		<p>Tucked away in the State of Play stream was the confirmation of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> Monthly Games line up for October 2025, with Sony bringing a fantastic horror game to the table for the spookiest month of the year. Have you seen Alan lately?</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus October 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>It’s quirky indie month on PS Plus and these games will be available from Tuesday, 7th October</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>Goat Simulator 3</strong> | PS4, PS5</li>
<li><strong>Cocoon&nbsp;</strong> | PS4, PS5</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> is a great headliner for this month’s PS Plus games. After a thirteen year wait, Remedy returned to the setting of one of their most beloved games, but took a distinctly more horror-tinged tone compared to the Xbox 360 original. Still, that totally worked for us. Nick gave it a glowing 10/10, and said:</p>

<p><em>“Just as it gives equal screen time to its two protagonists, Alan Wake 2 is a fine blend of equal parts narrative and survival horror. Both aspects are brought together in brilliant fashion to create a game that is going to mess with your head, scare the hell out of you and make you grin about it as you plunge forward once more, eager to see what’s next.”</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 Review –&nbsp;Worth the wait" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qi7NHf15a5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>How do you top that? Well, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cocoon">Cocoon</a> is a simply sublime little puzzle adventure with worlds nested in worlds. It’s “a beautiful experience that marries a gorgeous aesthetic with increasingly complex puzzles that really push you to experiment with the game’s mechanics,” Steve said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/13/cocoon-review/">our review</a>. “Whilst it isn’t a long or excessively challenging game, I would urge you to absorb yourselves in its dimension-hopping delights.”</p>

<p>And then you can go all the way into the left field for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/goat-simulator-3">Goat Simulator 3</a>, the latest entry in the meme-able game series. The game launched back in 2022, with Pilgor the goat going on many an adventure which, through DLC, has included some dimension hopping of its own.</p>
<h2>Can you still get the September 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 6th Ocober September to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viewfinder&nbsp;</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>

</ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/zero-upgrades-preview-za-um-crpg-disco-elysium/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zero-parades-preview-%E2%80%93-za-um-wants-you-to-%E2%80%9Cembrace-failure%E2%80%9D-in-its-new-crpg-at-the-end-of-history.1307751/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you had told me in 2020 that ZA/UM was making a new game called Zero Parades, I'd be excited and very interested to see what that new game was. At that point in time, we'd be a year from the studio's critically acclaimed debut hit, Disco Elysium. For all intents and purposes, it seemed like there was a new, groundbreaking studio on the scene, ready to push narrative storytelling in videogames and narrative games to the next level.</p>



<p>Today, I'm much less excited but in other ways even more interested than before. It's not the title of the game, of course, that has any weight on my expectations, but the myriad of new studios that have spawned in the last six years since Disco Elysium's release, and the dire allegations that have been flung between ZA/UM management and key creative leads behind Disco Elysium. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Zero Parades. Image credit: ZA/UM</figcaption></figure>



<p>It's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZEAs6M1wts">well documented</a> that key founding members of the art collective and cultural movement that grew into the game studio we know it as today are no longer there. None of the core writing team that worked on the 2019 release of Disco Elysium, some of whom created the initial tabletop role-playing game world of Elysium that would grow into the videogame, are still at ZA/UM, and their departures have not been clean.</p>



<p>This has made fans all too aware that Zero Parades is not a game made entirely by the people who brought them Disco Elysium, despite what the first teaser for Zero Parades (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz9apwrMKi8">back when we knew it as C4</a>) says off the top.</p>



<p>Of course, some of the team is still there, even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-standalone-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-and-quarter-of-staff-facing-redundancy-at-zaum">after the layoffs</a>, like Jim Ashilevi, a VO director and writer who has been with ZA/UM since its founding. I was invited, alongside other members of the press, to hear from Ashilevi and Jess Crawford, a producer at ZA/UM who joined the team in May 2022, to learn more about Zero Parades, what the game is about, and its main protagonist, Hershel Wilk. I even got to see some early-stage gameplay to better display the core pillars of Zero Parades, like a new game mechanic called Dramatic Encounters.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ZERO PARADES - Official Announcement Trailer (Gamescom 2025) #gamescom2025 #gaming #pcgaming" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D4JVY8rR-XQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>March 2025 was when we first learned about Zero Parades via its codename, C4. This past August, during Gamescom 2025, was when we got our first look at the trailer above and the Zero Parades name. A new game and IP not set in the same world as Disco Elysium, with new characters, but, as is very easy to spot, not exactly an entirely new look.</p>



<p>Obviously, it's not Aleksander Rostov behind the wheel of the game's art, but it's easy to spot Zero Parades as a game that has Disco Elysium DNA, at least at a glance. It becomes even easier to spot that genetic history when you look closer, particularly when viewing any snippets of gameplay and gameplay screenshots. And as previously mentioned, it shares plenty of Disco DNA thanks to the team members at ZA/UM who remain at the studio and previously worked on Disco Elysium.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Zero Parades. Image credit: ZA/UM</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-foundation-of-zero-parades">The foundation of Zero Parades</h2>



<p>Zero Parades is an espionage CRPG that's heavily inspired by classical espionage fiction, with Ashilevi pointing directly to novels like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley's People by John le Carré and Mick Herron's Slough House series, while the sci-fi side of the game comes from authors like Blade Runner writer Phillip K. Dick, The Dispossessed writer Ursula K. Leguin, and Stanisław Lem.</p>



<p>Beyond its literary influences, Ashilevi points to film influences that helped shape Zero Parades, namely Korean cinema, with Ashilevi specifically calling out Park Chan-wook and his films as a source of inspiration. It's all together an interesting mix, though interesting influences do not necessarily make for an interesting final product.</p>



<p>Moving on to the game's protagonist, rather than being a drunken detective trying to solve a mystery, Hershel Wilk is a secret agent working under one of the three global powers. She's a fatally flawed lead who, despite her issues, is described as "<em>brilliant, magnetic, and relentless.</em>" Crawford also calls her "<em>the anti-James Bond</em>," because Hershel Wilk is not a slick spy capable of charming or punching her way out of bad situations. </p>



<p>She doesn't have fancy gadgets and gizmos at her disposal, and being a spy can be much more mundane and manipulative than movies make it seem. She has to figure things out as she goes along while wrestling with pretending to be someone she's not, which ties in to one of Zero Parade's core themes of 'embracing failure.'</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, Hershel is a spy, though in the game's world her official title is 'Operant' and her codename is 'Cascade.' She works for Superbloc, a union of communist nations and one of the three global powers, under its espionage division called 'Opera,' hence the 'Operant' job title. The two other global powers are a group of techno-fascists and a shady international bank, with all three groups caught in a power struggle in the sovereign island city-state, Portofiro.</p>



<p>Though it remains a democratic nation separate from Superbloc and the other parties, Portofiro has felt their sting so often that the city's best days are behind it, and there's a dread hanging over the island of something terrible that hasn't happened yet, but everyone seems to feel coming. It's where, Ashilevi explains, the feeling that Portofiro is at "<em>the end of history</em>" comes from, which was a topical notion in the 1990s, around people feeling like all of history's biggest events had happened, and some imminent doom or event is incoming. </p>



<p>It all powers the setting that Hershel walks into when returning to Portofiro, who is also in the dark about what's coming next as much as everyone else on the island. Ashilevi even comments that Hershel doesn't know entirely why she's being sent to Portofiro in the first place.</p>



<figure><figcaption>An area in Portofiro called Bootleg Bazaar in Zero Parades. Image credit: ZA/UM</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-personal-struggle-at-the-core-of-the-political-mystery">The personal struggle at the core of the political mystery</h2>



<p>To be clear, she knows part of why she's being sent there. Five years before the events of Zero Parades kick off, Hershel and the team she assembled while stationed there got into a big mess that entirely blew their cover. In order to get out, Hershel betrayed her squad, leaving them behind to ensure her own safety. The Opera had her working as a desk agent for the next five years as a result of her failure, though now that something is heating up in Portofiro again, as the Operant most familiar with the island, she's being sent back.</p>



<p>Besides the top-level political struggle Hershel is being sent to try to deal with, her relationship with her old crew is where the personal struggle of the game's story comes in. Whatever this mission is going to entail, she won't be able to do it alone, and she'll need to recruit the help of her old crew. But how can she hope to get their help when the last time they saw each other, she betrayed them?</p>



<p>"<em>It's very much a story about failure and crippling regret</em>," Ashilevi said during the presentation, "<em>and what it's like to lose the very people that you cared about the most, and what it's like to carry the burden of basically being the person who f***** them over, and what does it mean to try and rebuild bridges that you can't really rebuild.</em>" </p>



<p>"<em>What do you do if you have to find a way back to those people, but you can't, there's literally no way. We've been deeply interested in what it does to the human psyche, how it leaves scars on someone's heart and soul, and what goes on inside the mind of a person who has been put in this impossible situation where, on the one hand, they have this enormous responsibility to be a small player in an immensely complicated and important power struggle at the highest political and economic level. But then also, how does that person simultaneously grapple with deep internal grief, and how does that manifest in her landscape and in her psyche.</em>"</p>



<blockquote>
<p>"<em>It's not only a game where you solve a complicated mystery that is external to you, it's also a game where you take a deeper dive into your own psyche.</em>" - Jim Ashilevi</p>
</blockquote>



<figure><figcaption>Zero Parades. Image credit: ZA/UM</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-skills-fits-dice-rolls-conditioning-and-dramatic-encounters">Skills, fits, dice rolls, Conditioning, and Dramatic Encounters</h2>



<p>One of the ways ZA/UM is trying to express all that in gameplay is through a mechanic called Conditioning, which is part of how the player will build their own version of Hershel throughout Zero Parades' story. Conditioning is about the 'thoughts' Hershel will gain, and how you, as the player, choose to condition Hershel to those thoughts. As you gain different 'thoughts' in the game, you can either reinforce them, giving you one set of modifiers, or punish them, giving you other modifiers. </p>



<p>But whether you choose to reinforce or punish a thought, you can still choose to act against your conditioning. A hypothetical Crawford discusses is: say Hershel has been conditioned not to smoke, for whatever reason. It's a reinforced thought that she won't ever take up smoking. But while at a party where she's trying to gain information, standing outside with the other smokers and partaking could lead to new information gained that would be missed by staying inside. Going outside and smoking, though, would negatively impact her and her modifiers, potentially impacting what could come after gaining the information.</p>



<p>"<em>That's the choice</em> <em>throughout gameplay, it's who you want to be, versus who you really are</em>," said Crawford.</p>



<p>You'll also map out your version of Hershel through her skills, including espionage skills like Coordination, Primal Reflex, Sensors, Shadowplay and Doppelgang. Her less espionage-focused skills include Poetics, Technoflex, Records, Grey Matter, Entanglement, Nerve, Cold Read, Statehood, Blueprints, and Personalism. </p>

			    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Just because you're skilled for a situation doesn't mean it'll always go your way, though, as another aspect of Zero Parades gameplay is Pressures and Exertion. These aspects are related more to Hershel's physical state as well as her mental state, charting things like her fatigue and anxiety. Successfully win a dice roll to perform something physically taxing, and Hershel will be more fatigued afterwards. Have a drink of coffee, and her fatigue will drop, but she'll grow more anxious. </p>



<p>Dramatic Encounters, which I mentioned at the top, tie into everything else already discussed, but are also ZA/UM's way of adding an element of action to the gameplay in what is otherwise a game where you do lots and lots of reading.</p>



<p>The presentation showed a clip of early gameplay footage (so early that there was a test dummy model in place of Hershel) in which the player must try to get across the market without being seen. You'll be stopped at inflection points, like needing to choose between three paths, and whatever happens based on your skills, modifiers, dice roll, and your choice, you'll need to adapt to it. You don't get to try again; you have to embrace the failure or success of whatever comes and keep moving forward.</p>



<p>Hershel's outfits also play a role in gameplay, as you'll be given access to different areas or dialogue options based on what you're wearing, though it's not necessarily something that you have to always follow. "<em>You can choose whether you want to make your life easier or look cool,</em>" Crawford said.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Zero Parades. Image credit: ZA/UM</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-start-of-a-new-za-um-chapter-at-the-end-of-history">The start of a new ZA/UM chapter at the end of history</h2>



<p>When the nearly 50-minute-long presentation concluded, and as I wrap up this preview, I feel, as I said at the start, more interested in Zero Parades than excited about it. Unable to be overly excited due to everything that's happened within and outside the studio in the past six years, and interested to see what the group of artists still there make as they try to come out the other side of it all.</p>



<p>As the first game from ZA/UM following the departure of the core creative team behind Disco Elysium, and a game that will likely be released while the issues between the members of that team and ZA/UM are still being worked out in the courts, Zero Parades is burdened by a pressure it doesn't need.</p>



<p>It seemingly has to prove to players that ZA/UM is more than just the original 2019 writing team of Robert Kurvitz, Helen Hindpere, Argo Tuulik, Martin Luiga, Olga Moskvina, Cash Decuir, and Märten Rattasepp. That the art collective at the core of the studio's founding is still in there, and that it hasn't been spoiled by business-only minded people in the way that some of those departed creatives have alleged.</p>



<p>Nothing I saw in the presentation looked bad. Based on what I saw, Zero Parades has a strong and rich foundation to tell a deep and engaging story. It could be one of the best narrative games to hit the industry since Disco Elysium. But previews can only reveal so much, and especially with narrative games like this, you can't get a sense of what the final product will be like without actually spending a good amount of time playing it.</p>



<p>I know game development is almost never a solo act, that there's practically no such thing as an auter in this industry because you can't do it alone. Every game comes together thanks to the work of an entire team of people, from writers to artists, animators, programmers and so on. </p>



<p>I know it's true that ZA/UM was always more than just those writers, but if Zero Parades fails to deliver in the way that Disco Elysium did, then the idea that the studio has lost its touch without them is the kind of convenient claim the internet will run with, and ZA/UM may never be able to shake that identity. At least what I got to see of the game and what I heard about it from Crawford and Ashilevi gave me the hope that ZA/UM can still be the groundbreaking studio we all saw in 2019.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel%E2%80%99s-wolverine-is-even-bloodier-than-we-expected-and-out-next-year.1307736/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wolverine is going to kill a lot of people. That was the main takeaway from the first gameplay trailer for the upcoming PS5 exclusive <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-wolverines-turn-for-a-big-budget-video-game-1847646598"><em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em>,</a> which was shown off during Wednesday’s State of Play. Who’s ready for some true, next-gen blood tech?</p> <p>Alongside its first big trailer, Insomniac Games confirmed that <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em> will be Sony’s big fall 2026 blockbuster. For anyone who worries Logan might be taking it easy in a more family-friendly superhero blockbuster, fear not: the <em>X-Men</em> icon appears to have no qualms about slitting throats and slashing vital arteries in his first solo video-game outing in years.</p> <p>Take a look for yourself:</p>  <p>Wolverine will be played by actor Liam McIntyre, who portrays a version of the comic book character trying to uncover his past. Apparently there are a bunch of weird cyborg enemies who don’t want that to happen. “He’ll leave an impression on his foes with fast, fluid, and rapid attacks and techniques that’ll dismember or break anyone who gets in his way,” writes Insomniac’s Aaron Jason Espinoza <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/marvels-wolverine-arrives-on-playstation-5-fall-2026/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>. “Wolverine might be distant, but he isn’t afraid to get up-close and personal when it counts.”</p>

 <p>This journey will take Logan around the world, from the Canadian wilderness to the neon-lit streets of Tokyo. Along the way he’ll come face to face with Omega Red, Mystique, and others, including one of the game’s enemy factions called the Reavers. Espinoza says the development team is looking to marry the violent gameplay with a nuanced story, and is also trying to break new ground with a game that’s “much darker and more brutal than you might expect from Insomniac.”</p> <p>That’s great news, even if some of the shots in the trailer gave me the familiar queasiness of a <em>Mortal Kombat</em> fatality. Can <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em> be more than&nbsp;<em>just</em> a hyper-violent showcase of next-gen cinematic storytelling? I hope so. Insomniac says fans can expect to see more of the game in the spring.</p>

Following the cinematic teaser for the game during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">PlayStation February State of Play</a>, this new trailer confirmed the release date is March 20, 2026. It also offered a first look at gameplay and how the protagonist of Arjun Devraj--voiced by Midnight Mass actor Rahul Kohli--can turn every death into a painful learning experience to help him grow stronger.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtCS5tuvCKs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XtCS5tuvCKs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Saros is a spiritual successor to Housemarque's previous game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/returnal-review-pc-update-live-die-repeat/1900-6417669/" data-ref-id="1900-6417669">Returnal</a>. Similar to that action-packed roguelite, Saros is set on the planet Carcosa, a world inhabited by all manner of creatures looking to stop Devraj's investigation. Caught in the shadow of a sinister eclipse, Devraj has to deal with nightmarish characters that want him dead. It looks like they'll succeed--and frequently--but death is not necessarily the end for Devraj.</p><p>The big difference between Saros and Returnal is that there will be permanent resources and progression to help players out should they die during a run. Housemarque says that you will be able to choose and permanently upgrade your loadout from an evolving set of weapons and suit upgrades to help you overcome deadly challenges on Carocosa.</p><p>Saros will be released on March 20, 2026 for PS5.</p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2025/09/24/marvels-wolverine-comes-out-swinging-in-gameplay-trailer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel%E2%80%99s-wolverine-comes-out-swinging-in-gameplay-trailer.1307691/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Today’s State of Play offered some fresh looks at a number of games, but one of the most exciting appearances was for Insomniac’s hotly antipated Wolverine game. The newly revealed trailer offers plenty of action to sink one’s claws into, and also hints heavily at some of the characters and locations that will play a central role.</p><p>The development studio that brought us the Marvel's Spider-Man games is clearly taking a very different direction with Wolverine as it relates to mature content. Specifically, Wolverine is, without a doubt, an M-rated title that includes some extreme levels of brutal violence. Logan is seen throughout the video using his claws to dismember, stab, and otherwise eviscerate his foes, and it’s clear that Insomniac has invested heavily in creating believable tech around the battles, including the lifelike appearance of blood.</p><p>Evidently, the mutant warrior will be taking on a globe-trotting adventure, as we see locations as far-flung as a Japanese cityscape, the wilds of Canada, and the mysterious land of Madripoor – a fictional mainstay of Wolverine adventures in the comic books. We also see several familiar faces show up, including the likes of Omega Red and Mystique.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>After revealing the trailer, Insomniac introduced us to the man who’ll be voicing Wolverine this time around. Liam McIntyre is set to bring Logan’s gruff but emotionally fraught persona to your gaming screen. McIntyre is best known for his work on the <em>Spartacus</em> TV series, but he also has video game experience, having played JD Fenix in Gears of War 4 and 5. He’s also done voice work in various animated properties.</p><p>Marvel’s Wolverine is still a good way off from its release on PlayStation 5 in the fall of 2026, roughly a year from now. However, Insomniac made a point to call out plans to share more about the game this spring. Until then, we’ll all have to be the best there is at what we do: waiting for more details.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the full trailer above, and a breakdown of what was shown in the "Behind the Claws" video below.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oBib2xkYfE4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oBib2xkYfE4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2025/09/24/marvels-wolverine-comes-out-swinging-in-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>In recent years, PlayStation has begun porting its precious exclusives to PC, and today, they revealed a peripheral that will theoretically enhance that experience: a pair of PlayStation-branded speakers. You can watch the Pulse Elevate speakers reveal trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lgn9VHKFDd0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lgn9VHKFDd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As the footage says, the speakers use Bluetooth, connecting to a PC or Mac using a USB-C dongle. They can also pair to a PlayStation Portal, presumably without a dongle, if you want to use them instead of the handheld's built-in speakers. The speakers are also able to make use of 3D audio if you're playing a PlayStation game that includes it as an optional feature. And like the DualSense, it also comes with a built-in mic with noise canceling, to allow you to voice chat while the game is playing.</p><p>It's a bit of an odd product, to be honest – it's unlikely that people with gaming-capable PCs don't have speakers already, and it's quite a purchase to bring with a handheld like the Portal. With the rising costs of gaming hardware, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/20/sony-is-raising-the-price-of-every-playstation-5-model-tomorrow-august-21">including PlayStation's increases from August</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/19/xbox-console-prices-will-increase-again-next-month">Xbox's increases announced just last week</a>, we're curious to see how much these speakers eventually retail for, though the price has yet to be revealed.</p><p>The speakers will hit shelves some time next year in black and white models.

During this campaign, you’ll fight a tank battle under the shadows of the Pyramids, take to the streets of Brooklyn for intense gunfights, perform a HALO jump into enemy territory, and more in this modern military thriller,” explains EA’s Roman Campos-Oriola, Creative Director for the singe player game.</p>

<p><strong>Cliff Lopez</strong>: Rejecting his parents’ wishes for him to go to med school, Lopez sought glory and adventure on the field of battle. Lopez wears his heart on his sleeve and as the squad’s&nbsp;<strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;is an essential member of the team.</p>

		<p>Surprising literally nobody, Flight Simulator 2024 has been announced for PlayStation 5, the latest Xbox exclusive to breach the previous platform divide. The game will arrive on PS5 on 8th December 2025, while PSVR 2 support is also in development for a later date.</p>
<p><iframe title="Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S5xeNotR5Hw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Flight Simulator 2024, launched for Xbox and PC at the end of last year, an overhauled successor to the 2020 Flight Simulator, building on the same rendering of the real world that you can fly around, but building in a career mode, more missions, from Search and Rescue to tourism, agricultural crop dusting, and plenty more.</p>
<p>It’s a great simulator, but I think I’m most intrigued to see how PSVR 2 support looks on console, as the game is pretty heavy to run.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Housemarque and Sony have released a chunky five minutes of gameplay for the upcoming looper shooter roguelike Saros – the sequel to Returnal. The team have confirmed that Saros is coming to PS5 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> on 20th March 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="State of Play | September 24, 2025 [English]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0QcEoGC51ZY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This latest tale takes players to the planet Carcosa, with an ominous eclipse and the end of the world sending Arjun Devraj (portrayed by Rahul Kohli) into a deadly time loop. He’s a Soltari Enforcer, looking for answers on a lost off-world colony which is repeatedly being destroyed by way and the death of the planet’s sun. He’s a bit chattier, it seems, as he has an AI companion, and hunt down Soltari datalog vaults to reveal more of the game’s story.</p>
<p>The gameplay structure will sound pretty familiar. It’s a roguelike third person shooter, very much in the vein of Returnal, with a permanent progression system wrapped around individual runs that reshape the world and give you new upgrade possibilities to find on the next attempt.</p>
<p>The action looks a bit faster than Returnal, though this may be my imagination, with more sprinting and dashing. Arjun comes with a Soltari Shield that can absorb and reflect projectives, using them to feel the Power Weapon, an Eclipse-driven weapon.</p>

<p>Second Chance is one of he permanent progression features, able to revive Arjun on his first death to immediately throw him back into the action of a particular run.</p>
<p>The video built up to the reveal of a big many-armed boss, with many more snippets of titanic gameplay to round things out.</p>
<p>Looking back on Returnal,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/"> our glowing 9/10 review</a> of the PS5 launch window game said, “It feels immensely satisfying to be sat here in 2021, eons after playing Super Stardust HD on PS3, and see just how far Housemarque has come. Offering a visual bullet hell spectacle, a showcase for the DualSense controller and a rewarding sci-fi narrative woven around the roguelike loop, we can say with unflinching confidence that Returnal is the PS5’s best game to date.”</p>

			<p>Housemarque kicked off <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-krafton-u-turn/">today's State of Play presentation</a> with our first look at gameplay for Saros, showcasing some of the new gameplay mechanics that the studio is implementing to build off what it did with Returnal, and landed the new trailer by revealing that Saros is coming to PS5 on March 20, 2026.</p>



<p>It was a very action-packed trailer that showed Housemarque isn't trying to fix what wasn't broken with Returnal's gameplay, and is adding new features to turn up the danger by giving players a shield they can use to break up some of the onslaught of colored shots coming their way, and fire back with more power.</p>



<p>You'll also get one extra chance per run, letting you revive yourself at least once instead of reviving, which is something you unlock deep into the game, like it was in Returnal. The trailer didn't get too deep into the modifiers and upgrades you can unlock, though, so it could be that we'll have more than one extra chance in a run, depending on what you unlock.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>For our first look at gameplay we wanted to show real and unedited action gameplay from Saros, and then layer by layer detail some of the new elements we have added on top of Returnal’s award winning third-person action. Our goal with these new elements has been to add more depth to our gameplay by adding a wider variety of tools</em>," wrote Gregory Louden, creative director at Housemarque, in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/saros-launches-march-20-on-ps5-first-look-at-gameplay-from-todays-state-of-play/">a PlayStation Blog post.</a> </p>



<p>"<em>Arjun’s Soltari advanced combat suit allows him to dash, melee, jump, and more. At the start of every run you will select your loadout from a mix of Soltari human weaponry and Carcosan alien weaponry. In this video, Arjun is using the Soltari Phosphorous Shotgun to defend himself and melt the hostile machines housed in the lost ancient city. As you can see from our extended gameplay, you can expect spectacular bullet patterns from enemies, and brutal weapons to use which fuel the sci-fi power fantasy.</em>"</p>



<p>Louden also briefly touched on the story in Saros and what Arjun is doing on the planet of Carcosa, though was careful not to reveal too much, of course. "<em>We also wanted to highlight how we are expanding our storytelling in Saros. Along with grounded voice-over, stunning cinematics, haunting audio logs, and conversations with our ensemble cast of NPCs, there are also Soltari Holograms detailing what happened on Carcosa as you explore. If you choose to collect them, they are vital to discover what happened on this hostile planet. There’s also more surreal and mysterious storytelling sequences, but we will share more with you about these moments ahead…</em>"</p>



<p>Saros will arrive on PS5 and PS5 Pro on March 20, 2026.</p>
