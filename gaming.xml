                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stellar-blade/" data-ref-id="5000-495029">Stellar Blade</a> launched last week for PC, and its first weekend saw the biggest spike in concurrent players--an early trend often seen with major releases. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-is-off-to-a-roaring-start-on-pc/1100-6532380/">After reaching a peak of 147,996 concurrent players</a> on Steam shortly after launch, that number surge to 192,078 concurrent players on the weekend. This doesn't include the players on the Epic Games Store, where Stellar Blade is also available for purchase.</p><p>As noted by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad, Stellar Blade is doing very well in China, thanks to the Chinese dub of the game and it being priced much cheaper there.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1934432993210237238" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Majority of PC sales from China thanks to Chinese dub (not on console) and regional pricing ($38 vs $60)</p>  — Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1934432993210237238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p><a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/news/news.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=275&amp;page=1&amp;code=news" rel="nofollow ">Shift Up also confirmed</a> that Stellar Blade has sold over 1 million units in just three days, and with PS5 sales combined, this brings the grand total of sales up to 3 million so far. The game has also been fine-tuned since launch, and it has received two major expansion packs as well.</p><p>The first one saw it cross over with what is arguably its biggest influence--Nier: Automata--to add new outfits and collectibles themed after the acclaimed game, and recently, it added new content inspired by Shift other game, Goddess of Victory: Nikke. This also included more unlockable outfits, new quests, and a brutal boss fight against Scarlet from the mobile game.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-sequel-seemingly-confirmed-by-developer-shift-up/1100-6531674/">A Stellar Blade sequel is already in development</a>, and Shift Up is aiming to have it out by 2027.</p>

                <p>Following the reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-4/">The Witcher 4</a> tech demo earlier this month, CD Projekt Red has shared why it has decided to focus on developing the game for consoles first, rather than for PC.</p><p>In case you missed it, the State of Unreal showcase offered us the first in-engine look at The Witcher 4 by highlighting the new, explorable region of Kovir, a brand-new look at the game's protagonist, Ciri, while also showing off the many features of Unreal Engine 5, which the game will utilize rather than the studio's proprietary engine.</p><p>It looked beautiful, but what's more impressive is the fact that the tech demo was captured entirely on the base PlayStation 5 at 60fps, with ray tracing.</p><p>Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OplYN2MMI4Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-cd-projekt-is-taking-a-console-first-development-approach-but-with-good-reason" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), CDPR’s VP of technology, Charles Tremblay, has explained that the studio is aiming for a "console-first" development with The Witcher 4 after learning from its mistakes with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OplYN2MMI4Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OplYN2MMI4Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"We always do PC and we push and then we try to scale down," Tremblay said. "But then we had so many problems in the past that we tried to say, 'This time around we really want to be more console-first development.'"</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077's launch in 2020 was a disaster, particularly for PlayStation and Xbox. While the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions did have their issues, it was the PS4 and Xbox One versions that suffered most. Performance was so bad on the last-gen consoles that, at one point, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-has-been-removed-from-playstation-store-refunds-will-be-issued/1100-6485659/" data-ref-id="1100-6485659">the game was taken down from the PS Store</a> altogether, and refunds were issued.</p><p>Almost five years and a bunch of updates later, Cyberpunk 2077 is now one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-rpgs/2900-5272/" data-ref-id="2900-5272">best RPGs</a> you can play right now, but CDPR has said it doesn't want to make the same mistakes again with The Witcher 4.</p><p>Jakub Knapik, VP and Global Art Director at CDPR, explained that by focusing on the game's development with consoles, it will make "scaling up" to PC easier, as opposed to scaling down for PlayStation and Xbox.</p><p>"We wanted to solve certain foundations," Knapik said. "It’s pretty logical when you think about it, because it’s easier to scale up than down. We knew that once we set up certain foundations both visually and technically, there’s room to scale up. Now, what that means is another question. We’re CDPR: We always like to push PCs to the limit. It’s just a creative process how to really use it."</p><p>However, Tremblay later admitted that releasing The Witcher 4 on Xbox Series S at 60fps "will definitely be extremely challenging" and that the studio is now actively trying to figure it out.</p><p>Despite the "console-first" approach, the VP of technology confirmed that PC players who invest in their hardware won't miss out.</p><p>"In the past, something that’s super important for the group is that if people pay good money for their hardware, then we want them to have what the game can provide for that, not like a simplified experience," he said.</p><p>"So this is something we will definitely explore. The company started as a PC company, and we’ll definitely want to have the best experience for the PC gamer for sure. But it’s too early to say what this will mean for The Witcher 4."</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't have a release date just yet, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/" data-ref-id="1100-6530369">not expected to launch until 2027</a> at the earliest. The studio is also actively working on multiple other projects, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">Witcher remake</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> direct for later this week.</p>
<p>It'll be taking place on <strong>Wednesday, 18th June at  6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm UK time</strong>. According to the official Nintendo App where it was announced, the Donkey Kong direct will last only 15 minutes.</p>
<p>We've seen little bits of Donkey Kong Bananza here and there over the past few months. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-getting-a-new-3d-donkey-kong-platformer">Back in April the game was officially revealed</a>, alongside some gameplay which shows everyone's favourite gorilla punching through the ground and barrelling through the open world.</p>

<p>He's got a new look too, with S<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto-explains-donkey-kongs-recent-makeover">higeru Miyamoto stating that when going back to the drawing board with Donkey Kong the team developers wanted something "more expressive"</a>. Fans eager for the game also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananzas-secret-in-game-language-has-already-been-decoded-months-before-launch">cracked the banana-centric language</a> seen in small clips of the game, way ahead of its release.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, but don't expect any other Nintendo games to show up as part of this direct. It's a pure Kong affair. All monkey, all monkey business. But if you're looking for more info on a brand-new game created for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>, it sounds like an event worth tuning in for.</p></div>

		<p>The next Nintendo Direct is set to take place this week, Nintendo has announced, with a presentation dedicated to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> scheduled for Wednesday 18th June at 2PM UK time.</p>
<p>“Tune in on Wednesday, June 18, for a livestreamed Donkey Kong Bananza Direct presentation,” the simple announcement reads in the Nintendo Today app. Adding the event to the in-app calendar also reveals that it will take place at 2PM.</p>


<p>And that’s the full extent of the announcement.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/donkey-kong-bananza-revealed-for-nintendo-switch-2-coming-in-july/">Announced back in April for the Switch 2 game and gameplay reveal</a>, Donkey Kong Banaza is the first fully 3D platformer in the DK series since the N64’s Donkey Kong 64, and so the gameplay is understandably rather different to Rare’s 90s classic.&nbsp;There’s a big emphasis on DK’s massively strong, letting him just smash through enemies, smash through walls, and even smash down into the ground…. then use chunks of the ground to smash more stuff around him!</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza Hands On –&nbsp;3D Platforming with a punch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LJIOuYCS414?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game at the Nintendo Switch 2 event in Paris a couple days later, find a game that’s as smash-happy as you would have expected. From my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-preview-a-3d-platformer-with-a-lot-of-punch/">Donkey Kong Bananza hands on preview</a>, I said, “If your kids are fans of Hulk smashing his way through earlier Avengers movies, then they’ll probably go bananas for Donkey Kong Bananza. As Nintendo and their partners explore platformers in all their forms, there’s some neat ideas built around the frenzy of punching and adding deformable world to the genre. I look forward to seeing how this can be explored in different ways, to hopefully avoid DK becoming a one punch ape.”</p>

<p>This will be the first big game for the Nintendo Switch 2 following the console’s release at the start of this month. The Switch 2’s debut came alongside a must-have game in the form of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a>, but the lineup has been rather thin outside of this. DK will lead the way for what will hopefully be a strong second half to the year, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-confirmed-for-october/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch-2-preview-worth-the-wait/">Metroid Prime 4</a> and more on the way.</p>

<p>This one launched on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2856370/Into_the_Emberlands/">Steam</a> earlier this year and, to put it simply, it looks <em>super</em> cute. Into the Emberlands will see you play as a Lightbearer tasked with reuniting the titular world after it became swamped in a malicious miasma. To do so, you'll have to journey out into the fog with your Ember Lantern, collecting resources and rehoming the adorable little Knacks (the species you'll see in the above trailer) you'll encounter along the way.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You only have a limited number of steps per day — room for a little more <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a>, anyone? — and the gameplay loop will restart if you run out, with your previous Lightbearer setting up camp to be found on a future run.</p>
<p>It's combat-free, all about helping others, and colourful enough that we can imagine it being an all-round wholesome experience — and we could all do with a little of that every now and then.</p>
<p>You'll find a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots below from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Into-The-Emberlands-2848916.html">eShop listing</a>:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/future-clair-obscur-expedition-33-updates-new-content<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sandfall Interactive, the studio behind the hugely successful turn-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, has confirmed it's actively considering "new content" for future updates, as well as various other improvements.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3lrpzry3pnk2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Bluesky, Sandfall says it's "currently exploring a wide range of future improvements" for&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>updates, including "accessibility features", "new content", and "all sorts of bits and bobs".</p>

<p>One of the major improvements Sandfall says it's thinking about involves expanding localization options for the game, allowing folks to play it in more languages. However, the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3lrpzry3ujs2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cautions</a> that it doesn't have "specific timelines or confirmed languages" yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-updates-new-content-lune.jpg?itok=8xZg97HD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-updates-new-content-lune.jpg?itok=Zd-eqjMq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>could be getting new content in future updates.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG that serves as the debut title from French studio Sandfall Interactive (and once you've played the game, you'll understand why its developer needed to be French).</p>

<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>takes place in a world ravaged by a monstrous figure known as the Paintress, who paints a new number each year. Everyone of that age dies at the conclusion of the year, so humanity sends out "expeditions" to try and defeat the Paintress before the next number is painted.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, the game appears to take several cues from classic turn-based RPGs in franchises like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>, although it has a much darker and more bleak tone than the latter.</p>

<p>It's also got a parry system, being a modern game, and so you'll have to factor in parrying or dodging enemies' attacks as well as strategizing during turn-based combat.</p>




<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has proven immensely popular. It <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">sold 500,000 copies</a> within just 24 hours, going on to reach <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">two million in under two weeks</a>. At last count, it had hit the satisfying total of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days" rel="nofollow">3.3 million sales in 33 days</a>.</p>

The company announced the upcoming Direct event through its Nintendo Today app <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1934596827900178721">and on X</a>, saying the livestream will feature 15 minutes of information about the Switch 2 game.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641537/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> was announced</a> on April 2nd and launches for the Switch 2 on July 17th.

Whilst <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-where-to-buy-in-stock">MTG: Final Fantasy</a> has finally dropped, there's still plenty of buying options for sealed product from big box retailers and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-cards-to-buy-tcgplayer-mayhem-sale">TCG Player</a>. I've also found some cracking bargains on <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRRkq?object_uuid=dd8f7c62-50dd-458a-9254-ce965ea069b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SSDs</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObbV2?object_uuid=dd8f7c62-50dd-458a-9254-ce965ea069b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">portable storage</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OO7y?object_uuid=dd8f7c62-50dd-458a-9254-ce965ea069b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DDR5 RAM</a>, games and more. Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Restock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Checking these prices against TCG Player secondary market values, a lot of these products aren't far off the mark. Make no mistake, they're still way off MSRP, but finding Pokémon products on shelves that haven't been marked up past the point of anyone caring is a positive. Still refusing to pay over MSRP for new sets? Well played, I'm proud of you. Here's some single card highlights for you to shuffle through instead. Spoiler, there's plenty of deals to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Singles Are On The Rise (Again)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to stick a pin on Destined Rivals single card values right now, and the dips in value seem to match the little bits of stock distributors release to stores. Looking at the tracking charts for each of these cards, we can see mostly plummets from day one, then either upticks or cards for sale that exceed the original value at launch. It's crazy, but we now know how low these cards can go. Sure there's always attempts at market manipulation, but I wouldn't buy any cards on the rise right now.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Journey Together Singles Are Settling In Value</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having keeping an eye on the market since launch, Journey Together singles are now more affordable than ever. Many of these cards have stabilized, with the main chase card - Lillie's Clefairy ex SIR, settling at around $150. If you were planning on getting into Journey Together at some point to collect the illustration rares and SIRs, now is a great time to jump in.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Epic Primastic Evolutions Cards That Aren't Umbreon</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's so many great cards in this set that aren't Umbreon ex SIR, all of which are a damn sight more affordable right now. Because I hate anything popular (Yes, I know I'm a massive fan of the most popular IP on earth), my two favorite cards are Dragapult ex SIR and Roaring Moon ex SIR. The former is now down to a respectable $125, with the latter holding it's value well since launch, floating towards the $200 mark. These prices and below are great deals for these cards, so don't miss out.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Discounted MTG: Aetherdrift Boxes </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering discounts at a big box store like Amazon? Surely not! Aetherdrift turned the MTG meta on its head introducing vehicles and other unique mechanics. This is a great time to jump into it and rip open some packs, it's deffinately one of the most "out there"  twists on the ever popular trading card game.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy MTG: Final Fantasy</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's finally here, Magic the Gathering: Final Fantasy is out in the wild. If you got a preorder for MSRP, well played, but many TCG and Final Fantasy fans missed out. Fear not, there's still some options on sealed products available right now, including options from the secondary market with TCG Player which is around the same or lower than the pricing of big box retailers right now.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Big Discounts On Crucial DDR5 and Storage</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crucial are one of the most dependable brands when it comes to M.2 and portable drives, and is a great option for those wanting the benefits of DDR5 RAM without flashy RGB and it's price tag. Here's some of the best deals in the Crucial price slashing marathon on Amazon right now. I currently use the X10 Pro 4TB for backing up files and folders on my PC and for watching videos on my projector, just a solid piece of kit.</p><p id="kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-ps5"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (PS5)">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (PS5)</h2></p><div catalogid="12468fbf-8990-4f79-9cda-997cbff2a2aa" id="223003"><div id="223003" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingdom Come Deliverance II drops you into the brutal heart of 15th century Bohemia, and right now the PS5 version is just $47.99, down from $69.99.

                <p>Since the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, many Nintendo fans have wondered when the first Nintendo Direct of the post-launch era would drop. Nintendo has decided not to monkey around for too long on the subject, as it has announced the next Direct will be this week--and it will be focused on Donkey Kong’s upcoming adventure Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p>The Donkey Kong Bananza Direct will air Wednesday, June 18 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET on the official Nintendo YouTube and Twitch channels. It will feature "roughly 15 minutes of information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game," according to the official announcement on the Nintendo Today app.</p>

		<p>Triumph and Paradox have revealed the next DLC for Age of Wonders 4. The fourth instalment in Expansion Pass 2, Archon Prophecy expansion is set to launch on 12th August for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Archon Prophecy Expansion Release Date Announcement | Age of Wonders 4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UtIcPa9D_8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Archon Prophecy will add a new culture, the Architects, allowing players to construct huge magical monuments within cities. There’s also new Forms, a new narrative path to follow, two new story realms, and more.</p>
<p>The Archon Prophecy expansion will arrive alongside a free update, dubbed the Griffon Update. This will have new features that include the Extra Faction data, the new Form trait Flaws, and&nbsp;Hero Class Updates.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown of Archon Prophecy from Triumph:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>New Culture: </b>Build your empire with the help of the <b><i>Architects</i></b> – construct vast, magical <b><i>monuments</i></b> within your cities and dedicate them to the affinity of your choice to empower your economy and unlock powerful bonuses. Shape your domain and carve your ideology into the world.</li>
<li><b>Two New Forms</b>:<span>&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><b>Elysian<i> </i></b>– ascended, heavenly beings that bring a touch of the divine to your realm.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Ancient </b>– withered and bent beings from the depths of history – and other, more sinister places.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>New Narrative Content: </b>Forge your destiny with <b><i>Prophecy Traits </i></b>— new society traits that help you shape your empire. Early in your journey a vision will appear, challenging you to define your ruler’s purpose and ambitions. How you interpret it is up to you, but fulfilling the Prophecy will unlock powerful rewards.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Two New Story Realms: <span>&nbsp;</span></b>
<ul>
<li><b>Rings of Emnora</b> – Enter the hidden realm of Emnora, stronghold of the Archons, in a search for aid in the eternal war against Urrath.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Cliffs of Sordünn</b> – Land on the Coast of Sordünn and explore an ancient land that fell into the endless horrors of the Umbral Abyss. Reclaim the realm from Urrath’s clutches and fulfill a Prophecy that will shape the war between light and darkness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Four New Tomes:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Tome of Virtue</b>: Empower your armies with unwavering righteousness and bolster their fighting strength until the bitter end.</li>
<li><b>Tome of Prophecies</b>: Weave fate into every moment with prophetic spells and omens that shape the battlefield.</li>
<li><b>Tome of the Revenant</b>: Channel the power of the dead, and take vengeance against the living.</li>
<li><b>Tome of the Archon</b>: Summon celestial allies and ascend your units to the ranks of Archons.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>New Hero Class: </b>Answer the call of the divine with the power of the <b><i>Battlesaint</i></b>. Whether guiding the faithful as a sacred support unit or standing firm as a martyr-like tank, the Battlesaint turns virtue into strength and sacrifice into victory.</li>
<li><b>And</b> <b>So Much More</b>, including seven new wildlife units roaming the wilds, two new mounts, five new music tracks from composer Michiel van den Bos, several map updates, new interface skin and many other smaller things!</li>
</ul>
<p>Age of Wonders 4 came out in May 2023 and, while we unfortunately weren’t able to review the game at that time, it had a broadly positive reception. It saw the series return to the fantasy setting of the earlier games, after the sci-fi divergence of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/05/age-of-wonders-planetfall-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Age of Wonders: Planetfall</a>, and brought some fun new ways to mix and match your wildly customisable empires and races.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/exoborne-is-a-tactical-open-world-extraction-shooter-in-development-at-sharkmob/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exoborne</a> has been one of those battle royales with a unique traversal hook that I’ve been curious about but never had the chance to go hands-on with until Summer Game Fest 2025’s Play Days. The concept of fighting off not just other players but the weather seemed like a concept that would keep fights feeling dynamic between sessions.</p>
<p>Sharkmob and Level Infinite let us jump into a quick three-player match after a brief bit of onboarding and watching a mission cutscene from one of their key NPC handlers. After that, we were permitted to look at and pick just one of the three Exo-rig’s they wanted to show off. My two teammates went with the more nimble Viper while I opted for the heavier Kodiak. Despite all of my ziplining around and attacking from above, I didn’t get to try out most of his kit and instead just stuck with sniping and machine-gunning as they were more than effective against the majority of AI grunts we encountered (there were other players in our match, but we extracted once we bumped into them without much of a drawn out firefight).</p>
<p>Exoborne's gunplay is fairly standard stuff, with various weapons having enough impact to feel like you're not just shooting Nerf pellets at the enemy troops while not having enough recoil to knock you out of your Exo-rig. With Exoborne being focused on being a faster-paced run-and-gun format, leaning into an arcade-style for gunplay lends itself to a more enjoyable experience over some of the more hardcore extraction shooters</p>
<p>In speaking with one of the developers from Sharkmob before my interview with Martin Holberg (co-founder at the studio and a narrative director on the game), it’s clear that they’ve done a large overhaul to the mechanics and progression for Exoborne throughout the various beta tests, from retaining your Exo-rig on death to supporting separate progression tracks to each rig. Extraction shooters are becoming a busier and busier market to compete with and it looks like Sharkmob is taking the closed beta feedback to heart in order to hit the ground running when Exoborne launches later this year.</p>

<p><strong>For gamers that might be seeing Exoborne for the first time, can you give us a quick rundown on what this project is?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. Exoborne is a tactical extraction shooter. You play as an Exowarrior in the United States that's being torn apart by these apocalyptic forces of nature, and that happens as you play the game.</p>
<p>During a session, you scavenge and fight to stay alive. It's an extraction shooter. You fight your way in, you try to achieve an objective, you fight your way out, and hopefully, you survive long enough to extract yourself and get out of the session. You can prolong that experience by doing certain activities in the session.</p>
<p>There is something called a rebirth trace timer that keeps track of you as you move around. Eventually, that timer is going to identify you on the map for all other players to see. That's your hint that you should have gotten out already, because now you're kind of marked. You can extend that timer so it takes longer before you get marked on the map,</p>
<p><strong>How does extraction work in your game?</strong></p>
<p>The only way to get out is through the extraction ships. There are a number of extraction points on the map, and not all of them are active at any given time. The weather can affect which ones are active, and there's also a random dynamic to it. The first thing you really want to do when you drop in is kind of look at which of these zones are active for extraction, and then you plan your activity.</p>
<p><strong>Ok. It's probably one dropship per extraction point, so if a player team goes there and they extract, there won't be another ship called in right away, right?</strong></p>
<p>No, you're calling in one ship at a time and then there's a cooldown on that extraction point. If you're another team, you would have to wait a while to call in the next one. But you could also kill the ones trying to extract and take their extraction, or you could just go up, shake their hand, and all of you can get on board. But that rarely happens.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have an emote system in there for that sort of thing?</strong></p>
<p>We're actually looking at that now. I know it's on the design team's table. I haven't gotten the latest update on that, so I'm going to leave that as a maybe.</p>
<p><strong>In the PR materials for Exoborne, we saw highway signs for Albany. Does this mean that the game will be set in the northeastern reaches of the US?</strong></p>
<p>The game takes place in a fictional place that we call Colton County. It's a place we made up just because we wanted to be able to create our own sandbox to play in, right? And we always imagined Colton County located somewhere in the southeastern USA. We're still keeping it a bit vague, but it's not an accurate portrayal of any specific location. But yeah, there are traffic signs to real locations.</p>
<p><strong>We got to see three of the different Exorigs that players will have access to. Roughly how many are you planning to have at launch for Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>At launch, there will be the three rigs you saw today, plus one we use for tutorial and onboarding. It's a much simpler thing. We just use it to teach you the basic power. The three you saw here are the three we're shipping with.</p>
<p><strong>And what sort of upgrades will players get as they dedicate time to each of the rigs?</strong></p>
<p>Each of these has some bespoke modules that are unique to each model. Then there are a number of shared modules that you can apply to every one of them. It can be different stuff, like, it can affect your movement speed, it can affect your grappling hook's speed. It can be lightning resistance or fire resistance, that type of stuff. You try to configure your exorig to fit your optimal playstyle or&nbsp;preference in combat.</p>
<p><strong>Are they more like static modifications, or will there be some that add in new abilities or change how an ability works?</strong></p>
<p>We have both direct abilities and stats that change based on the mods. You can call in an air strike, you can cloak, you can put down a cloak field, you can put down a minefield. There's a bunch of offensive capabilities and also some defensive capabilities. The other ones are more along what I mentioned previously, affecting your run speed or like grappler, cooldowns, and stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>What's the length of the grapple, roughly?</strong></p>
<p>That's a very good design question. I'm going to have to get back to you with an answer on that because I don't know it. It's also quite different depending on how you modify it, but we can get you an exact answer if you want to.</p>
<p><strong>I was experimenting right around the 15 to 20 m range when I got it to be really reliable.</strong></p>
<p>I would say it's around 20 m, but I can't give you an exact number.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Exoborne-1-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>How many different weapon types are available in Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>I will have to count them in my head because I don't know the exact number. We have sniper rifles,&nbsp;shotguns, assault rifles, submachine guns, pistols, light machine guns. I'm sure I forgot one or two, so I would say 6 or 7 different types, and then many variants of those. None of them is limited to a specific rig.</p>
<p><strong>How large are each of the maps?</strong></p>
<p>Maynard is the biggest one. I'm struggling to remember exactly the size of it, but Maynard is quite big. It's a very big open. You can use cars to drive across it. The other one, the mid-size one we call Agnesville, and that's an urban area, so it is smaller in terms of the size, but it has way more vertical space because you've got more rooftops, you've got indoors. It plays very differently.</p>
<p>The smaller one is essentially quite a large sinkhole that's about 1 kilometer big, and it's like a big hole where you need to go down and do certain things, so it's a very intense area.</p>
<p><strong>When you're moving into a much denser area, like you mentioned,&nbsp;that limits a lot of the mobility options there.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. The Exorigs are made for traversal. That's one of the key components. That works absolutely best when you're outside, when you can either move freely on the wind, grappling up on cliffs or on buildings. When you go inside, it becomes more of a traditional tactical shooter because now you're locked in a hallway or locked into a room. That changes pacing, the tactics you apply, and to a certain degree, it also changes what you can use your Exorig for. But we still have some fairly large indoors as well where you can use some of these things to your advantage, like grappling hooks to get up on catwalks.</p>
<p><strong>Are any of these levels modular, where you might see them play out a little bit differently, or is every map bespoke?</strong></p>
<p>The layout is the same, it's static, but the weather patterns are always different, so that's dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any building destruction in Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>We have destructible objects. The buildings themselves are not destructible, but many of the props and objects out in the world are. For example, fences and low walls and stuff like that can be either crushed if you run too fast with your Exorig. You can drive through them with cars, or you can shoot them or blow them up.</p>
<p><strong>We saw tornadoes. We did see firenados and others. Can players throw like a Molotov or an incendiary grenade and turn a tornado into a firenado?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. You can either use a Molotov to do that, or you can shoot an exploding barrel and cause a fire and the tornado becomes a firenado. You can do similar things with toxic substances. If you shoot a container with gas in it, then it carries the gas with it.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to have a weather forecast? It wouldn't have to be exact, just to get a rough idea of the conditions before starting a map.</strong></p>
<p>We've thought a lot about that. I know design has been struggling a bit with that. We want you to be able to have some degree of anticipation so you can load your equipment, because otherwise it doesn't really make sense, right? You want to prepare for a certain set of conditions. At the same time, we do want it to change on the map.&nbsp;I'm just going to have to say we're going to get back to you on that with more details.</p>
<p><strong>This isn't your first multiplayer title, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-qa-devs-talk-early-access-feedback-and-partnering-with-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt</a> being the previous one from Sharkmob. What sort of lessons did you learn about what players enjoy most about a multiplayer game?</strong></p>
<p>Many of the seniors at our studio had worked together before on other multiplayer games. Just like you said, Bloodhunt is the first one that Sharkmob did, but we have some experience prior to that as well. A lot of the learnings we took from Bloodhunt were related to how to operate and how to run a live game. Bloodhunt was free to play. It's very different. We are now making a premium game, so there are certain factors that are quite different, but there were a lot of good lessons in Blood hunt on everything from the vertical movement. It might have been a bit too hardcore in Bloodhunt, where it was quite easy to get away from a fight by jumping down a house or breaking a line of sight, meaning that you would often lose your prey and you wouldn't get to finish the fight.</p>
<p>In Exoborne, we've spaced out the verticality a bit more, so it's harder to quickly break those lines of sight. You're going to have to commit to the fight more than you did in that game. Besides gameplay stuff like that, there's also learnings around cheating, how to plan live content, and at the same time provide updates and bug fixes, and all of that stuff. It's way more complicated than you'd think initially to be able to both proactively produce content and, at the same time, maintain what's running live right in front of you. So a lot of good lessons on the simple practical stuff of running a game like that.</p>
<p><strong>What anti-cheat solution are you using?</strong></p>
<p>We've got to get back to you on that one. The only thing I can say is that we've invested a lot of thought and time into it, but we're also quite wary about releasing too many details about it for the obvious reasons of maybe not wanting to spill the beans on it.</p>
<p><strong>Is PC the only platform or just the primary platform for Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>It's more like the first platform for us. We will do PC and console, but we will do PC first and then consoles will follow.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Exoborne-2-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Battle Pass?</strong></p>
<p>There will be a Battle Pass, we can say that. The game is full of cosmetics, vanity, and customizing your character. Not just how it plays, but also how it looks is very important to us. That's another one of those things we kind of fell in love with Bloodhunt, where we had a lot of customization options. You will definitely be able to have a lot of diversity in how you set up a character.</p>
<p><strong>One thing that's unique about Exoborne is that, rather than picking upper and bottom layers, you're picking the entire outfit. Will players be able to have different colors for a given outfit?</strong></p>
<p>I don't think we have different colors on the outfits. We have different variants of the same. We have different uniform patterns, for example. It's the same basic uniform, but with different patterns. On the Exorigs, we have more color options.</p>
<p>Because you have the vanity on your outfit, which is like your clothing, and then you have your Exorig where you have another set of vanity on top of that, like the skin for the actual Exorig and you have Helmets, you have facewear, and then your facial customization.</p>
<p><strong>Will players be able to acquire the outfits in the game itself? Can they find a rare loot that might have an outfit?</strong></p>
<p>I am pretty sure we have a reward system that rewards vanity.</p>
<p><strong>Alright. Is there any sort of mastery system that incentivizes players to pick up one specific Exorig and specialize with it?</strong></p>
<p>There's a progression system tied to the Exorig, so it's going to take time to max it out. Ideally, I think you would probably want to be able to use all of them because there's a synergy between them, and you play in a team. So, if the entire team goes in with the same Exorig, that might not be optimal. Depending on who you play with, you might want to swap it out.</p>
<p><strong>Going into the mission, we saw a loadout or gear score. What risks are there for players if they die in the world? What will they lose?</strong></p>
<p>When you die, you lose everything except your Exorig, so you lose your guns and all. Well, you don't lose the vanity either, so the Exorig and the vanity are safe. You lose your weapon, you lose your mods, you lose your inventory, you lose your armor. That's what you lose when you die.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any insurance system at play here where players might insure their primary weapons, so if they die and lose everything, they might be able to retain them?</strong></p>
<p>We're running a lot of tests and each of these tests have generated feedback that we have taken and addressed in the game. For example, we did a progression overhaul, an inventory overhaul, we did a significant UX pass. The handler character that you probably saw when you played is Styx, who holds together much of the missions and we're constantly looking for that feedback.</p>
<p>When it comes to the insurance thing, it's one of those things where I'm saying currently we don't have it. If we think we need, it we might add it, but right now, it's not in the game. It's one of those things where some players love it, some players hate it because they want every match to be incredibly high stakes. But sometimes it helps draw in players that might be a little risk-averse to go out there with those higher ranked weapons rather than just keeping them in your stash for another day.</p>
<p>That is the big challenge, right? If you have a very powerful weapon, the risk is that you're too afraid to use it. I definitely get that desire, but there might be other ways to handle that and make sure you still feel like you can use your toy and not be afraid to lose it.</p>
<p><strong>How will players be able to communicate in the world of Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>We have the ping system. We also have VoIP for both team and proximity chat, so you can communicate with other teams if you want to when you're close to each other. Those are the main ways of doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Will players be able to link multiple squads together if they want to ally towards the end of the match?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, there is no system that allows that to happen mechanically, but there's nothing that stops you from doing it on a gentleman's agreement.</p>
<p><strong>When will players be able to get their hands on Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>We recently had that public test. We are preparing to do more tests, and a date will be released in the&nbsp;not-so-distant future, but we're not releasing that date yet.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts on collaborating with other brands or other games to create new content or cosmetics for Exoborne?</strong></p>
<p>I think we're always open to collaborations, and you can obviously do them in many different ways, right? We have a world that is very close to our own, so there are some brands that fit perfectly as a part of the universe, and those brand collaborations are very easy if they show up. Then there are collaborations which might be a bit more on the edge of, does that fit in our world? Then we'd have to take that discussion, but typically even in that case, you could have a temporary event where you do that kind of stuff. We're always hoping for collaborations. It's always fun.</p>
<p><strong>Exoborne is so much about the gunplay, but would you consider having melee weapons in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Each of the Exorigs today has a melee move, which you can use for different things. Personally, I mostly use it against NPCs. I'm not sure I would dare to go and try to get a player doing that as long as they have a gun, but I would absolutely say that I would not completely rule out melee weapons as a thing that could be added in the future. It's how we work: we watch how people play and what they enjoy to do, and then we try to create more of that content, but there will definitely be no melee weapons at launch. It's one attack per unit and that's it.</p>
<p><strong>Any other closing remarks you'd like to leave with our readers, Martin?</strong></p>
<p>Like I said, we already made major improvements to this game based on feedback from people like your readers. I would be very happy to keep seeing their feedback and just to have them comment on stuff, participate in our play tests, and let us know what works and what doesn't work. Often, what can be really helpful is why they think it doesn't work. It's one thing to say, oh, that thing is shit, but please elaborate and explain why you think it's shit or why you think it's awesome because that really helps us when we read the comments.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-direct-scheduled-for-this-week.1219368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-direct-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it will be airing a&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>-themed Direct presentation later this week, so we'll finally get to learn more about the iconic ape's upcoming platformer.</p>

<p>As revealed on the Nintendo Today news app, the&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>Direct airs on June 18th (that's this Wednesday at time of writing). It'll last around 15 minutes and will (quite obviously) focus entirely on&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, so put your&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>hopes away.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">back in April</a> as part of the Nintendo Switch 2's big reveal,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>will serve as DK's first 3D platformer in 26 years. Naturally, I'm not counting the newer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country&nbsp;</em>games; their models might be 3D, but they're 2D platformers at heart.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-announced-dk.jpg?itok=FoXmj90V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-announced-dk.jpg?itok=Rpz_cQ8B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Direct airs in two days, DK. I'd go find something else to do in the meantime.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will see you playing as the titular ape as he attempts to recover priceless golden banana-shaped jewels from the nefarious VoidCo, for if Donkey Kong is involved, then it must be the rescue of bananas that motivates him.</p>

<p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>will take the form of a 3D platformer with all the good stuff you've come to expect from the genre: collectibles, bad guys to fight, and, of course, plenty of chasms to jump across.</p>

<p>The game will also feature destructible environments, with initial trailers showing off the ability to smash up elements of the stage to get underground or to collect more stuff. That's the kind of thing the original Switch probably wouldn't have been able to handle.</p>

<p>You can remind yourself of how fun&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>looks (very, in case you need a refresher) by checking out the debut trailer from back in April below.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>Direct presentation airs on June 18th at 9am Eastern (that's 6am Pacific). The game itself launches <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2</a> on July 17th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-trailers-of-summer-of-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The summer is a great period for games, but also kinda weird when you think about it: it’s a few weeks where we’re all more excited about watching trailers for games, rather than playing them. It’s all for a good reason, of course – the multiple big presentations, once the framework that held up E3, showcase the most exciting new games in development and often reveal new projects for the very first time. They’re our first taste of what we’ll be playing tomorrow and beyond, and so naturally they garner a huge amount of interest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To see what’s really caught players’ attention, we’ve combed through every video posted to IGN over the last couple of weeks and picked out the 10 most-viewed trailers from the Summer of Gaming. There are some clear standouts, clocking up millions of views, as well as a mix of highly-anticipated returns and brand new surprises. You can see the biggest and best trailers below. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Resident Evil Requiem</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 2.1 million</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil 9</a> was the big hit of Summer of Gaming 2025. Resi fans have been waiting a long time for this one, with Requiem’s predecessor – Resident Evil Village – having been released back in 2021. And with Ethan Winters’ story now over, the perspective is switching to a new character. This first trailer provides a solid introduction to FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft, and we couldn’t be more excited because it appears she’ll be heading to a bombed-out Raccoon City. While much of the trailer is set in Ashcroft’s office, the final segment goes hard on the dark and gnarly survival horror tone established in Resident Evil 7 – making it clear that developer Capcom is looking to scare us all silly. We can’t wait.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Invincible VS</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 2.1 million</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Video’s animated version of Robert Kirkman’s Invincible comics has proven exceptionally popular, so naturally an Invincible video game has captured the imagination of many gamers this week. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs">Invincible VS</a> is a 3v3 tag fighting game that really does seem to capture the bone-crunching, bloody violence of the TV show – more than clear during the shot where Invincible causes Bulletproof’s head to detonate. While the promise of a city-destroying Invincible vs Omni-Man showdown is enough to sell us on the idea, seeing other characters turn up for the tag-style matches – including Atom Eve and Rex Plode – really has us eager to learn more.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Game of Thrones: War for Westeros</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 1.5 million</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">People may grumble about Game of Thrones’ final season to this day, but that doesn’t mean the fantasy series has lost any popularity. That’s proven by the massive number of views on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/game-of-thrones-war-for-westeros">War for Westeros</a> trailer, which acts as something of a “what if?” scenario. The cinematic trailer sees Jon Snow face off against the Night King in a one-on-one duel, a thrilling event that never happened in the HBO show. As the fight continues, we see other exciting but similarly non-canon moments play out, such as Daenerys and Drogon being shot out of the sky by a huge ballista, and Jaime Lannister fighting in what appears to be a four-way battle between his army, Stark bannermen, the Unsullied, and the White Walkers (the first hint of this being a real-time strategy rather than an action game). The big surprise, though, is seeing Jon killed and turned into a wight. As many in the trailer’s comments have said, this is the big finale season 8 could have been. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. ILL</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 1.3 million</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil understandably got the most love of any horror reveal this year, but we’re delighted to see the grotesque gameplay trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ill">ILL </a>also struck a chord. This terrifying, rusty-looking survival horror is full of some of the freakiest enemies we’ve seen recently, including multi-limbed monstrosities, bobble-headed babies, and zombies with a desperate need to see a dentist. All of them can be torn apart thanks to an "advanced dismemberment system". Despite all that grossness, ILL knows how to crack a good joke: over in the equally engaging <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ill-official-trailer-summer-game-fest-2025">SGF trailer</a>, the whole sequence ends with a zombie toddler being kicked in the face and punted into a pile of barrels. A little dark humour to brighten up your Summer of Gaming, there.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. The Expanse: Osiris Reborn</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 1.2 million</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">RPG experts Owlcat Games is back with a new project, set in the world of The Expanse. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-expanse-osiris-reborn">Osiris Reborn</a> is very different from Owlcat’s previous projects – where the studio usually develops isometric RPGs that take inspiration from both games like the original Baldur’s Gate and tabletop adventures, this new Expanse game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-from-the-developer-of-warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-looks-a-lot-like-a-new-mass-effect-and-yes-there-is-romance">looks a lot like a modern-day Mass Effect</a>. And considering how long it’s been since we had a good Mass Effect, it’s no wonder the internet has gone wild for this lengthy trailer, which combines exciting cinematics involving flying grenades and face crystals with a healthy gameplay montage demonstrating some good cover-shooting mechanics. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. 007 First Light</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 835,000</strong> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IO Interactive’s Bond game was announced years ago, but we finally got to see it in action as part of PlayStation’s State of Play stream. The coolest thing about this trailer is how it treats <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">First Light</a> as if it were a brand new 007 film, introducing us to the new cast playing the likes of M, Q, and – of course – James Bond. Our super spy hero is much younger and greener than we’re used to, but it’s clear that IOI knows everything that’s required for a hit Bond mission. There’s exotic locations, expensive watches, a vintage Aston Martin, and more high-stakes action than the entire Hitman trilogy combined. It seems like IOI really does have a license to thrill.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. ROG Xbox Ally X</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 822,000</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">New hardware is always going to draw significant interest, and so it's no surprise to see a handheld Xbox among the most-watched trailers. Of course, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/rog-xbox-ally">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> isn’t <em>quite </em>a true handheld Xbox – this portable PC is developed by Asus rather than Microsoft itself, and is an extension of its existing line of ROG Ally devices. However, it’s still the next step in Microsoft’s “This is an Xbox” project, which aims to allow you to play Xbox games anywhere from your console to your computer, TV, phone, and (presumably, one day) your fridge. And a powerful handheld PC that can directly interface with Xbox Game Pass and the Xbox cloud services is certainly nothing to be sniffed at. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Atomic Heart 2</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 796,000</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first trailers for the original Atomic Heart were big hits with the IGN audience, but a sequel was never a sure thing – reception of the first game was mixed, and it wasn’t quite the BioShock spiritual successor that the trailers suggested. Nevertheless, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/atomic-heart-2">Atomic Heart 2</a> seems to be doing it all over again. This time around things look significantly more expansive; there’s space stations, wall-running, hang-gliding, mechs, and more vehicles, plus what looks like a much more active world with a larger array of characters. It’s all rendered in Atomic Heart’s signature, retro-futuristic Sovietpunk art style, which really is unlike anything else out there. Well, apart from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-cube">The Cube</a>, a multiplayer game set in the Atomic Heart universe that was also announced at Summer Game Fest this year.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 720,000</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’d think that the only kart racing game anyone would care about in June 2025 would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World</a>, but the latest trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> has truly popped off. That may be down to Sonic going through what is undoubtedly his most significant popularity spike in many years (no doubt thanks to the movies), but it also helps that this new trailer shows off some exciting guest additions to the character roster: Hatsune Miku, Like a Dragon's Ichiban Kasuga, Persona 5's Joker, and Minecraft's Steve. There’s even Minecraft-themed courses, which hints to even larger ambitions when it comes to cross-dimensional races. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Chronicles: Medieval</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 708,000</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s very little gameplay in the trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/chronicles-medieval">Chronicles: Medieval</a>, but those brief few seconds reveal that we’ll be leading an entire army from horseback. That promises an epic scale, perhaps one similar to that explored by the Mount &amp; Blade series. The CGI cinematic proceeding that glimpse of gameplay showcases the life experiences of a medieval warrior, from simple village life, to forging weapons, to bracing against cavalry charges. If Chronicles: Medieval can capture all that, then all the excitement around this trailer will be well-rewarded. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Honourable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also a few other trailers that demand honourable mentions. Naturally, much-demanded sequels and remakes always do well in trailer showcases, and so it hasn’t been surprising to see both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-official-gameplay-trailer-state-of-play-2025">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/high-on-life-2-official-announcement-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">High on Life 2</a> clock up over half a million views each. It’s been far too long since we had a new MGS game, and while Delta isn’t a brand new entry, it is at least a shiny remake of arguably the best game in Kojima’s back catalogue. High on Life, meanwhile, was a breakout hit for Squanch Games back in 2022, and clearly people are excited about wielding even weirder weapons with faces in a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel has also had its fair share of success, but it wasn't ambitious PlayStation 4v4 tag team game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</a> that drew in the crowds. Instead it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/marvels-deadpool-vr-official-reveal-trailer-summer-game-fest-2025">Deadpool VR</a> and its kinetic, violent action. It really seems like an authentic Deadpool experience, from hacking a guy's head off with a katana and then bowling it at another enemy, to forcing someone’s face into a propeller. And because it’s VR, you know this is all player-controlled stuff rather than canned animations. We can’t wait to see the horrible possibilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But returning favourites are perhaps not as exciting as the truly new, and joining MGS, High on Life 2, and Deadpool in the “over half-a-million club” is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-official-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Blood of the Dawnwalker</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/clockwork-revolution-official-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Clockwork Revolution</a>. The former is a new RPG from former CD Projekt Red developers, and looks a little like a new take on The Witcher's recipe with bloodthirsty vampires. The latter, meanwhile, is from the RPG longbeards at InXile, and the five-minute-plus trailer dives deep into its steampunk world, roleplaying mechanics, and time-travel systems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN is, of course, not the only place people go to for trailers on the internet. We’ve also taken a look at the official YouTube channels for PlayStation and Xbox, and you’ll see similar stats there. 007 First Light was the big winner at PlayStation, with almost three million views, closely followed by Resident Evil Requiem. ILL and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/silent-hill-f-official-release-date-trailer-japanese-audio-state-of-play-2025">Silent Hill f</a> also pulled in over a million views each, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/gears-of-war-reloaded-official-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> – which marks the series’ arrival on a Sony console for the very first time – saw in excess of half a million views. As for Xbox, the brand new ROG Xbox Ally X handheld PC was the leader with over a million views, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/persona-4-revival-official-reveal-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Persona 4 Revival</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/super-meat-boy-3d-official-reveal-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Super Meat Boy 3D</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/beast-of-reincarnation-official-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Beast of Reincarnation</a> all clocked up hundreds of thousands of views.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what was your personal favourite trailer of the event?

<figure><a title="Bitsummit 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/034614476e800/bitsummit-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bitsummit</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has reconfirmed that it will be attending BitSummit 2025 to showcase select indie games on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This year's event, dubbed <strong>BitSummit the 13th: Summer of Yokai</strong>, will take place at the the Miyako Messe in Kyoto City from <strong>Friday, 19th July to Sunday, 21st July</strong>. Tickets are on sale now for Japanese attendees via the <a href="https://t.pia.jp/en/pia/event/event.do?eventCd=2511585">Ticket Pia website</a>, while international attendees can use a dedicated <a href="https://ticket.pia.jp/piasp/inbound/bitsummit25eng.jsp">English-language page</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo has stressed that it will not be showcasing any first-party games at the event, which is completely understandable given the nature of BitSummit. It's also confirmed that the Nintendo booth will be accessible via a lottery system, with the reservation page available at a later date.</p>
<p>Other confirmed publishers attending the event include PlayStation, PocketPair, Lost in Cult, Inti Creates, Spike Chunsoft, Devolver Digital, and more.</p>
<p>Nintendo will no doubt be seeking every available opportunity to advertise the Switch 2 now that it's out in the wild. Having launched earlier this month, it's gone on to become the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">fastest-selling console of all time in Japan</a>, and the fastest-selling Nintendo platform in both the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">US</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk-console-launch-of-all-time">UK</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-a-linear-game-that-wont-place-too-much-focus-on-difficulty/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-a-linear-game-that-won%E2%80%99t-place-too-much-focus-on-difficulty.1219299/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-a-linear-game-that-wont-place-too-much-focus-on-difficulty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The revival of Onimusha, CAPCOM's action series that hasn't seen a new entry in nearly twenty years, certainly surprised fans. During the latest Summer Game Fest 2025, where Onimusha: Way of the Sword was shown to the press (<a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-hands-off-sgf-2025-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ourselves included</a>), Italian website Multiplayer had the chance to speak to the developers and learn more details about the upcoming game, such as its linear level design.</p>
<p><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword will generally be structured around a series of sequential missions. There will be a series of levels and, as shown in the presentation, those individual levels will feature a relatively linear path with some secondary areas: once you reach the final boss, you defeat it and move on to the next mission. However, the content shown in the presentation was only representative of a small fraction of what is found in the Kiyomizu-dera level. Although the essence is linear, there is a lot of hidden content in each level.</em></p>
<p>One thing is for sure: CAPCOM did not choose to bring back the franchise as a reaction to games like Dark Souls. In fact, they said that the goal is not at all to create a particularly challenging game.</p>
<p><em>I can say without a doubt that we did not decide to bring Onimusha back to life because of the recent trend of particularly difficult video games. On the contrary, we want to ensure that as wide an audience as possible can immediately get into the game and enjoy it. The goal is not to create a difficult experience: we want to offer the right sense of satisfaction to both hardcore gamers and those who approach it from other perspectives, for example, to enjoy the story and setting.</em></p>
<p>It seems like Onimusha: Way of the Sword will focus more on the narrative than ever before, as the developers recognized it is a major way to open up the game to a broader audience.</p>
<p>So far, we only have a generic 2026 release window. However, with the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-onimusha-way-of-the-sword-playable-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be playable at Gamescom 2025, a launch in the first half of next year is not to be ruled out.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-pc-sales-apparently-topped-a-million-in-just-three-days.1219296/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-sales-1m-three-days<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PC sales of the hack-and-slash actioner&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>apparently reached a major milestone within just three days of the game's release, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per Korean news platform <a href="https://bbs.ruliweb.com/news/read/211821" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ruliweb</a>&nbsp;(via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-proves-theres-appetite-for-playstation-5-games-on-pc-as-it-blasts-past-one-million-sales-in-three-days" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>),&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>'s PC version, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-release-june-leak" rel="nofollow">released last week</a>, racked up a million sales for itself on PC alone within the first three days of its release on the platform.</p>

<p>According to Ruliweb, that brings the game's total sales up to over three million around the world. That's on both PlayStation 5 and PC, of course, and it also includes both digital and physical shipments. Still, that's not a bad figure at all, and it means&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has picked up an extra two million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">since June last year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-sales-report-boss.jpg?itok=uA66X8Or 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-sales-report-boss.jpg?itok=0eCGlPQk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Blade</em>'s PC port has done solid numbers, according to a new report.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, it's an action game developed by&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>studio Shift Up. Released last year, the game revolves around Eve, who must rid Earth of a hostile force known as the Naytiba.</p>

<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates, including the addition of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-new-game-plus-mode" rel="nofollow">New Game Plus mode</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow">crossover with&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow">Nier: Automata</a>&nbsp;</em>(one of the game's biggest inspirations), and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/festive-stellar-blade-update" rel="nofollow">lots of new outfits</a> for several of the game's characters as well.</p>

<p>Supposedly, the game did so well that Shift Up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-shift-up-ps5-pro-bonus" rel="nofollow">gifted all of its employees PS5 Pro consoles</a> as a Christmas bonus last year, and since&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>boasts PS5 Pro improvements (along with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">several other games</a>), I'm sure that came as a welcome surprise.</p>




<p>As for what's next for Shift Up, a <i>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</i>sequel has been confirmed to be in the works, although we don't know when it's due yet. Additionally, the studio is currently working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-developer-shift-up-new-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">new next-gen action-RPG</a>&nbsp;with an urban sci-fi theme.</p>

<p>For now, though, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3489700/Stellar_Blade/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/stellar-blade/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can read our very own Austin's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stellar-blade-review-mother-sphere-knows-best" rel="nofollow">review of the game here</a>.</p>

I have yet to play Oxygen Not Included, but Klei seldom miss - their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mark-of-the-ninja">Mark Of The Ninja</a> remains one of my favouritest ninja shankfests - and Away Team already seems very appealing for putting a deeply inhumane emphasis on traitorous physics. Here be trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>In offering a world in which "every tile is simulated", Away Team is both daring comparisons with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a> and building on the volatile foundations of Oxygen Not Included, which Nate (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oxygen-not-included-review">called</a> "a machine for procedurally generating engineering problems, and due to the huge number of physical properties interacting in the simulation, they will never be the same twice".</p>
<p>In Away Team, you are a solitary Oxygen Not Included colonist, aka Duplicant, who has mistakenly pushed a big red button and rocketed off to a strange new world. Equipped with a vacuum gun, you must explore the depths and craft your own abode from all the materials you find. You will need food and oxygen. Also, a working understanding of conductivity. And a very careful aim.</p>
<p>This is a realm in which every piece of matter is subject to the laws of thermodynamics. Liquids flow and evaporate. Fires spread, given access to flammable materials. I don't remember things being so... temperamental in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a> away missions, but I would have happily watched a million episodes of a show in which Captain Picard spends 29 minutes gingerly carving out acid vats, then says "oh shit" just before the credits roll.</p>
<p>Away Team has yet no release date, but it does have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2168390/Away_Team/">a Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
