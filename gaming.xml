<p>This includes the Super Mario Galaxy 'Good Night' track and Super Mario Galaxy 2 tracks 'Twins' and 'Special Someone'.</p>


<p>This follows an update to the app earlier this week, which added the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/princess_peach_showtime">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> album. Nintendo also added the Super Mario Galaxy 2 soundtrack to the service last month.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-just-made-it-easier-than-ever-to-stop-putting-up-with-microsoft.1314361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft, which remains <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a BDS priority target</a> after barring Israel from deploying <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/26/why-has-microsoft-cut-israel-off-from-some-of-its-services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some – but not all – of its products</a> in service of Palestinian mass surveillance, and which has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/microsoft-fires-four-workers-on-site-protests-over-companys-ties-israel-2025-08-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired and reported to police</a> multiple employees protesting its involvement in the genocide, stepped in it again today. If it feels like it’s only been a few months since the last time Xbox was at the vanguard of Microsoft’s ceaseless woes, that’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-game-pass-unsustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">because it has</a>. Mass layoffs and studio closures, turns out, did not sufficiently satiate Microsoft’s almighty Line – which remains buoyed, increasingly <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-bubble-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">precariously</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/29/vibe-working-microsoft-agent-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the AI bubble</a>. So now the company is trying a good old-fashioned price hike. Many Game Pass customers have had enough.</p><p>Today Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a series of confusing changes to Game Pass, principal among them a 50-percent price increase to Game Pass Ultimate that brings it up to $30 per month, or $360 per year. The company is trying to justify the bump with a plethora of new games, as well as a <em>Fortnite </em>Crew membership that includes battle pass access and V-Bucks. PC Game Pass, meanwhile, is also going up in price, from $12 to $16.50, but otherwise remaining the same.&nbsp;</p><p>But that’s not all! Other tiers are getting renamed: Game Pass Core is now Game Pass Essential, while Game Pass Standard is now Game Pass Premium – because surely no one will struggle to discern the difference between something that is essential (a colloquial synonym for best), premium (a colloquial synonym for best), and ultimate (a colloquial synonym for best). Essential and Premium are also adding new games, and while the latter will gain Xbox-published games within a year of release, only Ultimate includes day-one releases.</p><p>This announcement has gone over spectacularly, in the sense that a house fire could be described as such so long as you are not the one inside the house. Mat Piscatella, senior director at analytics firm Circana, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m25bghhcpc2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed out</a> that as of Q3 2025 a whopping 58 percent of those who’ve unsubscribed from Game Pass have cited budgetary concerns, and today so many leaped to cancel that they <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m25h7cyrah2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overloaded the website</a>. This is not surprising: Beyond simple sticker shock, more granular math doesn’t really work out in your favor unless you’re a power user.</p><p>"$30 is a redline," accessibility-focused creator and consultant Steve Saylor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stevesaylor.net/post/3m25bo6o3ac2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Bluesky</a>. "There was a time where you could play 2-3 games a year and Game Pass would pay for itself. Now it's 5 games priced at $70 a game."</p><p>"From a moral standpoint, you really oughta consider losing your Game Pass subscription due to the BDS boycott," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/funnywes.online/post/3m25hyiehls2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> voice actor Wes Wiggins. "[But even] not from a moral standpoint, what the fuck. ... That's one and a half <em>Silksongs </em>a month. That's three <em>Yakuza 0s</em> a month. That is, funnily enough, 360 dollars a year."</p><p>This is the <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second Game Pass price hike in just over a year</a>, a severe impediment to Microsoft’s strategy of turning everything – <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/this-is-an-xbox-microsoft-claims-over-an-image-of-a-car-that-will-soon-offer-cloud-game-streaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including cars</a>, for some reason – into an <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-marketing-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a>. After all, if you’re trying to expand your user base beyond the confines of a specific piece of hardware, you’d want to keep your primary offering well outside the ballpark price range of said hardware. In related news, tariffs recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced Microsoft</a> to raise the price of the Xbox Series X to $650 and the Xbox Series S to $400. Late last month, Microsoft <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/handheld-gaming-pcs/the-rog-xbox-ally-x-priced-at-usd1-000-and-available-to-pre-order-in-october-making-it-officially-the-most-expensive-xbox-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also announced</a> that the Xbox-branded versions of the ROG Ally handheld coming in at $600 or $1,000 depending on how many bells and whistles you want. In other words, an impulse buy – assuming the thing you’re impulsively purchasing is a Steam Deck.</p><p>There was no reason to put up with Microsoft’s endlessly enshittified operation months ago, when the company unceremoniously laid off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9,100</a> people, and there are even fewer now. Studios, <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-unions-microsoft-layoffs-mmo-elder-scrolls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hollowed out by layoffs</a>, are footing the bill for the gargantuan $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard purchase, and customers are paying for Game Pass’ lack of actual profitability (once you subtract Microsoft’s <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1941933309900013850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fake accounting math</a>). All of <em>that</em>, as well as productivity programs people depend on <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/29/vibe-working-microsoft-agent-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Word and Excel</a>, is then being <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alyssamerc.bsky.social/post/3m22wrg5wjs2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fed into</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the AI meat grinder</a>, ensuring that the worst is yet to come.&nbsp;</p><p>Today Israel <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/9/2/live-geta-thunberg-once-more-on-board-sumud-flotilla-sailing-for-gaza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intercepted a flotilla</a> meant to provide aid to starving Palestinians and arrested those involved. Fuck that and fuck anyone who supports it, especially materially.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Phil Spencer has been the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/31/phil-spencer-revealed-as-new-head-of-xbox?_gl=1*15tu7ax*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTg1ODYxMjY3LjE3NTkyODE1MzY.*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NTkyODE1MzYkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTkyODE1MzYkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>head of Xbox</u></a> (now officially the CEO of Microsoft Gaming) for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-has-now-been-head-of-xbox-for-10-years-we-look-back-at-his-first-decade"><u>over a decade</u></a> now. And up until very recently, I’d argue that under his watch, the brand really did put players first, even if Xbox has continued to lose market share to PlayStation. As a reminder: Phil immediately <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/13/microsoft-reveals-xbox-one-without-kinect"><u>unbundled</u></a> the Kinect from the Xbox One, removing the $100 albatross weighing the console down. His first big initiative as boss was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/15/e3-2015-xbox-one-backward-compatibility-update-enables-360-xbla?_gl=1*quxw10*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTg1ODYxMjY3LjE3NTkyODE1MzY.*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NTkyODE1MzYkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTkyODE1MzYkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>championing backwards compatibility</u></a>, which is inarguably a huge success. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-fps-boost-far-cry-4-watch-dogs-2-sniper-elite-4-ufc-4"><u>FPS Boost</u></a> on Xbox Series later made many of those old games run even better. He dragged Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/02/sonys-stubborn-stance-on-cross-play-is-embarrassing"><u>kicking and screaming</u></a> into normalizing cross-play. The Xbox One X <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/08/xbox-one-x-review"><u>one-upped the PS4 Pro</u></a> by offering true, native 4K. And Xbox gaming has undeniably become more inclusive in the Phil Spencer Era thanks to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-gaming-accessibility-advancements-controllers-ui"><u>Xbox Adaptive Controller</u></a> as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-accessibility-is-the-future-of-gaming"><u>laudable ASL features</u></a> in multiple first-party games. Finally, there’s Xbox Game Pass, whose mystery economics continue to make it controversial amongst both gamers and developers alike, but has nevertheless been a tremendous value for subscribers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until now, at least. On IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/xbox-unlocked">Unlocked podcast</a>, I (far too) often make reference to that Simpsons gif where Sideshow Bob keeps <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/the-simpsons-sideshow-bob-RSOUOj8H9A3Xq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>stepping on the rakes</u></a> he’s surrounded by. And the reason I do that is because Xbox always seems to find a way to ruin any momentum it builds up, typically through no fault of anyone but itself. Take the month of October, for instance. Microsoft is shipping not one or two but <em>three </em>really exciting new games in the next 30 days: the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-first-hands-on-impressions-its-faster-and-bloodier-than-ever"><u>very</u></a>-<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-the-final-preview"><u>awesome</u></a>-so-far Ninja Gaiden 4, which revives the beloved fast-action franchise after a dormant decade; Double Fine’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/double-fines-next-game-keeper-has-you-controlling-a-walking-lighthouse-driven-by-a-goofy-bird"><u>promising</u></a> Keeper, the studio’s next project after its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2021-winners-revealed"><u>Game Awards Game of the Year-nominated</u></a> Psychonauts 2; and ever-reliable Obsidian Entertainment’s RPG/shooter sequel The Outer Worlds 2, which we’ve loved every time we’ve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-the-first-preview-ign-first"><u>seen</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-first-hour-has-layers-and-layers-of-role-playing-opportunities"><u>played</u></a> it. That’s a potentially huge month for Xbox – particularly when so many Xbox fans remember how it wasn’t long ago when we’d be lucky to get three ultra-promising first-party releases in an entire <em>year</em>, let alone a single month.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All three will drop onto Xbox Game Pass on day one – but this is the part where Xbox starts stepping on all those rakes. Effective immediately, you’ll need to pay <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-rises-to-30-a-month-microsoft-adds-more-day-one-games-and-throws-in-fortnite-crew-and-ubisoft-classics-to-help-justify-the-cost?_gl=1*16yxkxu*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTYzNzk0MjM4My4xNzU5MzM0NzE3*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NTkzMzQ3MTYkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTkzMzQ3MTYkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>a whopping 50% more</u></a> for that privilege. Microsoft has raised Game Pass prices for the third year in a row, with the give-me-all-the-day-one-releases tier now setting players back $30 per month. Fourteen months ago, by the way, Game Pass Ultimate was $17. That’s how high and how fast the price has risen. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fourteen months ago, Game Pass Ultimate was $17. Now it's $30. That’s how high and how fast the price has risen.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In fairness to Microsoft, the company has added more to Ultimate: Ubisoft+ Classics, Fortnite Crew, and higher-resolution cloud gaming. It’s also worth mentioning that multiple likely Game of the Year candidates hit Game Pass Ultimate on day one this year: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight: Silksong, and Blue Prince. But we all know that the biggest appeal of Game Pass are those day-one benefits for Xbox-published games, and this price increase feels directly targeted at that. (For the record, PC Game Pass is going from $12 to $16.49 per month.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes immediately on the heels of the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-in-the-usagain"><u>jacking up Xbox console prices</u></a> for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raises-the-price-of-all-xbox-series-consoles-xbox-games-confirmed-to-hit-80-this-holiday"><u>second time</u></a> in the past four months, with the top-end Xbox Series X now carrying an eye-watering price tag of $800. But that $800 almost sounds like a damn bargain next to the much-hyped ROG Xbox Ally X handheld gaming PC, which weighs in at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-x-and-rog-xbox-ally-price-finally-revealed-microsoft-goes-for-1000-for-most-powerful-version-amid-tariff-uncertainty"><u>NINE-HUNDRED AND NINETY-NINE U.S. DOLLARS</u></a>. Sure, there’s a less powerful, more affordable version for $599, but nobody knows if that one’s worth a damn, because Microsoft has only ever let media and influencers get their hands on the more powerful Ally X. Hopefully it proves useful, as the Series S has for the non-hardcore gamer part of the market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heck, the only thing the Xbox folks haven’t raised prices on are first-party games. Oh, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-is-microsofts-first-confirmed-80-game"><u>they tried</u></a> with The Outer Worlds 2, to be clear – and they inevitably will next year when Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, Forza Horizon 6, etc. drop – but the Xbox community wasn’t having any of that, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers"><u>Microsoft relented</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I realize we live in crazy times, and that Sony and Nintendo are not exactly blameless here either after each of them raised prices on their own aging hardware in the past year (with Nintendo also aggressively raising software prices for the Switch 2 generation as well). Blame the Trump tariffs if you want to (heck, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-in-the-usagain"><u>Microsoft does</u></a>), but I’m sorry: at the end of the day, the buck stops with Microsoft. This is a company with a market cap of nearly $4 <em>trillion</em>, who has done layoff after layoff, after spending upwards of $80 billion on studio and publisher acquisitions. And it’s fair to wonder if those naysayers who question the sustainability of Game Pass and its business model are being proven right with this latest, deepest round of price hikes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We’ve reached a sad point where gaming is becoming less accessible to new players rather than more.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s worse is that, in the bigger picture, we’ve reached a sad point where gaming is becoming less accessible to new players rather than more. Historically, console prices go down and the size and quality of the game library goes up over the course of a generation, leading to more units sold and a healthier ecosystem for everyone inside it. And while again, the blame for the absence of that this generation does not rest squarely on Microsoft’s shoulders, the actions of Team Xbox are of a company that isn’t showing a lot of empathy towards its customers as the cost of groceries, gas, and other bare essentials keeps going up. Again, these larger economic issues aren’t Microsoft’s fault, and it has to contend with rising development costs too, but they are choosing profit over players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As such, while I recognize that this Xbox console generation isn’t over yet, it’s almost certainly going to be remembered first and foremost for Microsoft’s greed: two hardware price increases (and counting), three Xbox Game Pass price increases (and counting), one software price increase (so far), and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff"><u>tens of thousands of layoffs</u></a> as well as multiple studio closures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s kind of a monkey’s paw situation, really: all Xbox gamers have wanted since the start of the catastrophic Xbox One generation was a steady supply of great first-party games. Well, in 2025 we’re finally getting that – and as I’ve already mentioned, 2026 is shaping up to be a banger too – but it’s coming at the cost of, well…practically everything else. But it’s not our fault. Instead, Microsoft’s greed is to blame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

Drawing inspiration from the ARPG greats like Diablo, Path of Exile, and Grim Dawn while packaging everything in a highly replayable roguelike formula, Gell Clock provides a great middle ground for people who want to experience the power fantasy of an ARPG without having to grind for hundreds of hours every season. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/hell-clock/news/hell-clock-1-1-crafting-system-preview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Patch 1.1, the Clockmaker’s Tools,</u></a> is Hell Clock’s largest update yet.

Take a look at IGN's post on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hell-clock-update-11-detailed">Hell Clock 1.1 Update</a> for more information.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/01/img-2-beginners-guide-1759338858483.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Maxroll Hell Clock Beginner's Guide</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Maxroll’s comprehensive <a href="https://maxroll.gg/hell-clock/getting-started/hell-clock-beginners-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Hell Clock Beginner's Guide</u></a> gets into the details of Hell Clock's core systems and mechanics with links to more detailed guides where you can learn more. Start by exploring the campaign, progressing through each act, and challenging bosses. Next, learn more about the game's progression and metaprogression systems. These include Skills, Blessings, Gear, Passives, Relics, and Constellations, all of which combine to make a variety of builds. Then learn about what awaits you in the endgame with Abyss, Oblivion, and Ascension.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/01/img-3-getting-started-1759339001410.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Getting Started in Hell Clock</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After getting started with the Beginner's Guide, continue your journey with Maxroll’s new player resources. First up, the <a href="https://maxroll.gg/hell-clock/getting-started/hell-clock-campaign-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Campaign Guide</u></a> has information on all of the Survival Encounters and Bosses you find when progressing through Hell Clock's 3 Act story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Note:</strong> As part of the endgame,<span tabindex="-1" role="button">Tap to Reveal</span></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Skills</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Skills are the core of your build in Hell Clock. Some Skills, like Split Shot, are easy to spam and often act as your primary damage. Others, such as Spectral Knives, have a longer cooldown and often take a secondary role. As you progress through the Acts and defeat bosses, you can access new skills (via the Skill Book), but you must spend 100 Soul Stones to unlock them.

Blessing of Proficiency enhances your skills, Blessing of Foundation gives global character buffs, whereas Blessings of the Future and Legacy give you new Gear or Relics.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Gear</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You can find gear within your run or purchase it from the Blessed Corner.

            <p>
Am I good at chess? I'll take no for $1500, Alex. But do I love a funky twist on games that are older than time itself? You bet your bottom dollar I do! Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/below-the-crown">Below the Crown</a>, a chess video game that is also a roguelike, ,and is also a turn-based strategy game, and is also a dungeon crawler on top of that. It's a lot! It also works very well, and in a demo that just came out today (alongside an early access release date), there's a suggestion of something a touch more… unsettling… going on under the hood.
</p>
<p>
In Below the Crown, you are a wizard who is working to get The Emperor the gold he knows is down in the dungeon below his castle. This wizard version of you places a single king on a chess board in each run, with a selection of other, occasionally remixed versions of classic pieces at your disposal. You slowly add pieces to the board as you try to strategise your way towards taking down opposing kings, adding abilities to your various pieces as you go room by room. Sometimes you'll be offered the opportunity to buy certain useful cards too, like one that will freeze an enemy piece in place for five turns.
</p>
<p>
It's chess! And it's not chess. The important thing is that the essence of the age-old game is there, that feeling of thinking where you're going to place which piece where, albeit in a refreshingly different way. Though, it definitely is a game that is smarter than me, at least when it comes to chess, because I really would like to stress I'm pants at actual chess. Still fun though! And then there's the creepy bits.
</p>
<p>
In between rounds, you might get asked to do things like placing a marker on a graph that reads loneliness on the Y axis and anxiety on the X axis. Upon beating a run I was asked to rank my pieces based on how I felt about them, and was then questioned on my choices afterwards. Methinks there is a bit more than just retro, roguelike chess going on here, and I'm curious to find out more.
</p><p>
Which I'll be able to do soonish! As developer Misfits Attic (who also made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duskers">Duskers</a>) shared that Below the Crown will be launching into early access next month, November 10th. Better keep practicing at regular chess in the meantime so I don't totally suck at this twisted video game version of it.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/candy-crush-player-sues-over-alleged-%E2%80%98scam%E2%80%99-tournament.1314298/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Candy Crush Saga</em> player Ruben Valenzuela is suing King and Activision Blizzard over a $250,000 <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> tournament, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/926665368/Candy-Crush-player-sues-over-alleged-scam-tournament" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to court documents reviewed by Aftermath</a>. Valenzuela and his lawyers allege in a complaint filed last week in a Los Angeles court that King “tricked players” into believing they had better chances of winning than they actually did, leading to players spending much more time and money than they might otherwise.</p><p>Valenzuela wrote that King did not accurately supply players with information necessary to assess their chances—how many players advance through each stage (and obscuring the amount of players that did), rampant cheating, unfair advantages given to “super users,” and the ability for players to play offline and mask scores, which mucked up the tournament’s leaderboards. Valenzuela and his lawyers posit that the <em>Candy Crush</em> All Stars 2023 tournament is a way for King and Activision Blizzard to “entice users to spend money and to spend more of it.”</p><p>The <em>Candy Crush</em> All Stars tournament began in 2020 and has been held yearly since. A New Yorker named Jay Simunovich won in 2023, beating out “roughly 20 million people,” <a href="https://newsroom.activisionblizzard.com/p/victory-is-sweet-for-candy-crush" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to King</a>. Fifteen million people participated in 2025, where an Ohio man, Ben Chin, won the $500,000 prize. This year, in June, King awarded another $500,000 to a man named Tiago, from Portugal, after he beat out 15 million people. Players are pooled into groups and tasked with climbing to the top of their leaderboards by collecting All Star Candies, which are rewarded for completing levels. Players do this through a bunch of different rounds until the top 10 players reach the finals, which are held in person.</p><p>Valenzuela is one of those 20 million players who participated in 2023, according to the complaint. Lawyers wrote that the tournament “consumed” his life because the leaderboards gave him the impression he was in the lead.&nbsp;</p><p>“At every turn, he was given the impression that he was in the lead, and knew that if he stopped playing for even a few minutes, he would lose his place,” they wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>It went on for a month before Valenzuela was knocked out of the tournament and stopped playing. He spent “thousands of dollars” on the event, according to the complaint, buying in-game bonuses to help him accrue points.</p><p>His lawyers called the event a “scam.”&nbsp;</p><p>“And perhaps we could blame Ruben, and the millions of people like him who did the same, if the game had been fair,” they wrote. “We could say that adults should not allow themselves to be led astray by sleek corporate marketing and clever corporate machinations designed to draw players into a game where they need to spend their wages on color bombs and lollipop hammers. After all, if a corporation can convince people that they should exchange their money earned in the real world for intangible thingamajigs in the cyber world, then people have only themselves to blame.”</p><p>But lawyers said the tournament isn’t fair, largely due to how King allegedly obscures a person’s chances at winning. They said that the player numbers are obscured by King pulling people into small groups of just dozens of players, instead of thousands, which leads people to believe they’ve got to beat less people. They also alleged that <em>Candy Crush</em> All Stars was rife with cheaters who quickly scale the leaderboards knocking legitimate players out—the issue here, according to the complaint, is that it’s not disclosed to players. Similarly, lawyers said King doesn’t disclose the advantage some players who play a ton of <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> get; players who beat more than 14,000 <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> boards gain access to levels that have huge point multipliers. Lastly, lawyers blame the lack of disclosure of offline players, whose scores aren’t uploaded until a person goes online, making the leaderboard misleading. So, if a person accrued a million points while playing offline, it wouldn’t be listed on the leaderboard until the device was connected to the internet. A player with 999,999 points would think they’re in the lead.</p><p>The big problem with all this, according to the lawyers, is that players like Valenzuela made purchasing decisions based on the leaderboard positioning. A person in third place would potentially spend money on boosts to reach first place, but may not <em>actually</em> be in third place, say, if someone with a higher score was playing offline. That person will appear to suddenly surpass you when they do connect to the internet, and their score appears on the leaderboard.</p><p>The lawsuit cites <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> forum posts in which players rant about the tournament—offline players making it “impossible” to gauge positioning, about cheaters who had impossibly high scores just minutes after the event began, and lamenting the sheer amount of money they’d spent in an attempt to win big.&nbsp;</p><p>“The whole tournament is designed to mislead players into spending money for what was essentially a lottery,” one person wrote.</p><p>The&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush</em>&nbsp;All Stars tournament’s current <a href="https://candy-all-star-live--king-ccs-campaign-cms-prod.us-central1.hosted.app/en/pages/all_stars_terms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terms and conditions</a> do address some of these complaints. A section titled Unfair Play described a “zero-tolerance policy” for anything deemed unfair play, like using exploits or hacking, sharing an account, using bots, and playing on multiple devices simultaneously. King also addressed offline play, though not necessarily for players on the other end: King wrote that players using the game offline could see disruptions to their scores. “You agree that King is not liable for any data loss resulting from your offline play, and we will not restore any such data loss to your gameplay or King account,” it said.</p><p>In a section labeled Costs, King said participants don’t have to make purchases to play, but certainly can.</p><p>Indeed, elsewhere on the internet, players warned each other against getting too invested. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/candycrush/comments/1c3ymfd/comment/l27jpol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One person who claimed to reach the final knockout round</a> said they played for 24 hours straight to get that positioning. Another person chimed in: “I played from 8am to about 3am non stop and when I noticed the person in 2nd stopped playing I took a quick nap and rested my eyes up until I saw them started playing again so I continued around 6am until 7:30,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/candycrush/comments/12sev6e/comment/jh0uxh8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they wrote on Reddit</a>. “There were times when they took over first but I took it back and finally got a 40k lead on them.”&nbsp;</p><p>Some players wrote they’ve made it past several rounds <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/candycrush/comments/12rg8q5/comment/jguili4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without spending any money</a>, but others, like Valenzuela, said they’ve spent thousands for a chance at the grand prize.</p><p>Valenzuela and his lawyers are looking to find King in violation of the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and also alleged fraud and unjust enrichment. They’re looking for the lawsuit to be certified as a class action. Aftermath has reached out to Activision Blizzard and King for comment.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/candy-crush-saga-lawsuit-alleged-scam-tournament-king]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ananta">Ananta</a>, whether it ends up being a good game or not, is clearly a confident one. You have to be brave to so blatantly, we'll say, borrow from so many different games. Like many anime-esque games of its ilk, it will live and die by its characters (which, by the way, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/locking-characters-behind-gacha-would-have-clashed-with-anantas-intended-playstyle-and-high-degree-of-freedom-producer-explains/">you won't have to gacha roll for</a>), of which it seems to have in spades judging from that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ananta-looks-expensive-like-a-mix-of-gta-spider-man-and-yakuza-and-a-bit-overwhelming">first gameplay trailer</a>. These characters will all play differently too, and according to Ananta's producer Ash Qi, the dev team wants you to think of them like Avengers members. Comparing your new thing to an older, widely loved thing is always a safe move!
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/gta-and-spider-man-are-big-shoes-to-fill-but-ananta-producer-decides-to-raise-expectations-even-higher-with-marvel-avengers-comparisons-they-are-the-protagonists-of-their-own-stories/">GamesRadar</a>, Qi said he believes "many of the characters in the game could be protagonists in their own game." Qi went on to explain that they're "trying to create a big storyline that will evolve, giving the characters focus, which will add new characters and new cities to explore. Take Marvel as an example; there are many different heroes and champions in The Avengers. 
</p>
<p>
"However, characters like Captain America and Spider-Man have their own storylines, separate from the larger plot, and they are the protagonists of their own stories, each with their unique missions." Qi goes on to note that this approach, of trying to make each character stand out, is their attempt of keeping them in focus - not to mention a feature they're working on where several characters can all fight other enemies at once.
</p>
<p>
One point I do take slight umbrage with is that Qi also said the studio is trying to "achieve a design that feels unique compared to other RPG games." Sure, there might not be many RPG games like this one, but there are even just some animations that seem uncomfortably similar to other games.
</p>
<p>
I still have my reservations about Ananta, but I'm still curious to find out how it actually shapes up… whenever that is.

              <p>A TikTok content creator allegedly flew all the way from the United States to Edinburgh, Scotland to stand outside the offices of <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a> developers Rockstar North and yell at people entering and exiting the studio. According to the creator, he is “sick and tired” of waiting for a new trailer or information on any further delays.</p> <p>On September 30, <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/gta-6-devs-harassed-by-tiktoker/">as spotted by </a><em>TheGamer,</em> TikTok user Backonboulevard shared a video on the social media service that appeared to show him staking out the Rockstar North office in Scotland and then yelling at two different people that he seemingly assumed were developers working on<em> GTA 6</em> after spotting them entering and exiting the building. The video has over 140,000 views and is currently pinned on the TikTok user’s channel.</p>

 <p>In the first incident, a person can be seen walking toward the office when Backonboulevard yells at them: “When’s the delay? When’s the next trailer? I wanna know!” The person shrugs, starts walking away quickly, and replies, “I don’t know.”</p>

   <p>In another incident shown in the video, Backonboulevard seemingly follows a person after they have presumably left the office and shouts at them, asking: “When’s the delay happening? Is there another delay? What about the trailer? Another trailer? You can’t tell me? You can’t tell me? You can’t tell me nothing?” That person looks visibly scared and understandably nervous about a random dude aggressively confronting them in the dark, and quickly flees the scene as the TikTok creator follows before the video cuts.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted the TikTok user about the video and reached out to Rockstar Games.</p> <p>“I’m sick and tired of waiting for the answers,” explained Backonboulevard in the video. At another point, he showed the outside of Rockstar North’s offices to prove he was there. “Right now we are here, right here, live from Rockstar North. I told you guys I wasn’t playing around.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/GameRoll_/status/1973022044251152503">On Tuesday, the video was flagged by <em>GTA</em> content creator GameRoll on Twitter</a>. “If you’re waiting outside of somebody’s workplace to harass employees over a video game, give your head a wobble,” said GameRoll.</p> <p>While many in the comments below GameRoll’s post shared disbelief and anger over what Backonboulevard seemingly did, there are many, many comments below the original video on TikTok that take the creator’s side and blame Rockstar’s lack of information and new trailers for the harassment. And to be clear: That’s fucking stupid and you should never, ever, ever sit outside a video game studio and harass the people inside and demand answers from them. That will never work out, it might get you in trouble legally, and it’s just a dick move.</p> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is set to launch in May 2026 <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860">after being delayed earlier this year</a>. It will launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Don’t yell at the devs about it, okay?</p>

                <p dir="ltr">With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, Treyarch is going back-to-back with Black Ops releases. The new game brings a futuristic setting for multiplayer, the largest round-based Zombies map ever, and a new Resurgence map for Warzone called Haven's Hollow. GameSpot went hands-on with Black Ops 7 during Call of Duty: Next, and while the jump into the future does enough to distinguish the multiplayer from last year's offering, and the latest iteration of Zombies creates a new experience, Warzone's upcoming integration currently falls flat for Black Ops 7.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Futuristic and refined multiplayer</h2><p dir="ltr">I've always believed that Call of Duty was at its best with a rotating developer cycle. I liked flip-flopping between developers and the different series within Call of Duty. Going from Modern Warfare to Black Ops was refreshing because the different teams each introduced different styles, modes, and features to their takes on the game, lessening the yearly "CoD fatigue."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">So, with another Black Ops title coming so soon, my biggest concern was how Treyarch would make Black Ops 7 feel fresh enough. I didn't want another year that felt like more of the exact same, because we already lived through that with back-to-back Modern Warfare titles. Thankfully, I can happily report that Black Ops 7 does enough to remain an invigorating multiplayer experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking Black Ops out of the '90s of last year's entry and into the year 2035 does a lot to change how multiplayer feels. Treyarch leans into the tech of this future, providing more interesting scorestreaks such as the dog-like robot called the D.A.W.G. and the Rhino, which is a robotic take on Call of Duty's juggernaut enemy type from previous games.</p><p dir="ltr">Loadouts can also be equipped with other tech and gadgets from the future to further differentiate Black Ops 7 from its predecessor. There are field upgrades that let you launch drones, temporarily cloak yourself, and even place decoy holograms of your operator to trick your enemy. These aren't new mechanics in Call of Duty, but we haven't seen equipment like this since the days of the high-tech jetpack games, and they add immersion to Black Ops 7's futuristic warfare.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578517-b1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578517" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578517-b1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578517"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578517-b1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Treyarch also enhanced the omnimovement system introduced in Black Ops 6, making the movement faster, more fluid, and oftentimes flashier. The team removed the tactical sprint (you now need a specific perk to use it), increased the base movement speed, and added a wall jump. On paper, these changes to omnimovement seem minimal, but the adjustments do feel impactful. Wall jumps can be chained together, and these hops can be used to reach windows and other areas not previously accessible in boots-on-the-ground Call of Duty games.</p><p dir="ltr">During my hands-on time, I was able to perform a few fancy wall jumps where I could tap the wall, giving me extra height, and then spin around in the air to catch an opponent off guard. I could also toss a stun grenade into a window to daze a sniper, and then wall jump high enough to reach and eliminate them, which is a play the previous game's movement didn't allow for. I'm not super savvy with advanced movement, so there will be players who perform much more impressive plays, but it does give you more options on how you approach areas of the maps, as well as your gunfights. This also may or may not sound like a huge feature to some, but fundamentally impacting the moment-to-moment gameplay in this way can really freshen things up for Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">The maps I played were also large enough to give space for pulling off these over-the-top action moves. One complaint I ended up having in Black Ops 6 was that most of the maps were on the smaller side, with a focus on chaotic and in-your-face action, but the Black Ops 7 maps we played gave me much more room to breathe. These aren't huge designs, but they are all medium-sized Call of Duty maps.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce, and senior director of production Yale Miller, the developers explained how this year's maps were meant to feel more like classic maps inspired by Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">"The big things we talk about with map design are being fair and fun," Miller said. "It's also because this is a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2, so it's really leaning into those core beliefs on three-lane maps. Each lane needs a really clear purpose. If one side has a power position, there should probably also be a power position on the other side."</p><p dir="ltr">Forge was easily my favorite multiplayer map. We played Domination on Forge, which is set at a Guild research and development center. There are two large wings of the facility to fight indoors, and the B flag for Domination is located outside at the center hub of the map. Uniquely, the B flag is surrounded by sections of cover that continuously rotate around the point. This center hub provided a lot of interesting opportunities while fighting for B. Sometimes the rotating cover would move at just the right time to expose an enemy, while other times it would catch me off-guard and leave me vulnerable. There are also exterior building walls that curve around this center hub, giving plenty of opportunity for those flashy wall-jump plays.</p><p dir="ltr">Forge was also the map the developers said proved to be most challenging.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578518-b4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578518" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578518-b4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578518"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578518-b4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Not from a sheer design point, but just everything that went into it," Miller said. "There is rotating cover, and like, how is that going to work?"</p><p dir="ltr">The map is also complicated from a technical standpoint, he said.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's a lot of glass. Glass canopies and other stuff," Miller explained. "To make the map look right when light is coming through the glass, you need reflection and refraction, so it drops a little bit of shade."</p><p dir="ltr">Scronce and Miller also confirmed that last year's training grounds would return in Black Ops 7 to give you a safe place to practice the game's updated omnimovement. Black Ops 7's training takes place on Forge, and the map's design makes a great location to practice wall jumps and other moves, as this was the map that provided me the most real estate and opportunity for performing these actions.</p><p dir="ltr">There is also an intelligent movement setting in Black Ops 7 that helps you with the wall jump.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's listed as a wall jump assist in your movement settings," Scronce said. "Then, you can jump at the wall, and it will wall jump for you."</p><p dir="ltr">This, combined with the practice map, should help players like me improve their movement skills.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the standard Call of Duty weapons, perks, and attachments remain in Black Ops 7, so it was the map design, refined movement, and future tech that sold the multiplayer for me. I had a blast wall-jumping and launching drones into the air, and I look forward to trying out the rest of the map pool at launch.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The Wonder Vehicle changes the Zombies experience</h2><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 introduces Ashes of the Damned, the largest round-based Zombies map ever, but this time the design is more road-like than that of a standard map. It's inspired by Black Ops 2's Tranzit and features a figure-eight layout with separate chunks of map locations that are all connected by dangerous stretches of road. In Tranzit, you navigated the roads via a bus that would continuously loop around the map, but Ashes of the Damned puts you in the driver seat of Ol' Tessie, the map's new Wonder Vehicle. Tessie is an old junker of a truck that you gain access to at the start of your match, and you can drive and upgrade the vehicle on your journey.</p><p dir="ltr">Design director Kevin Drew and lead game designer Steve Bianchi explained that Ashes of the Damned was specifically designed around Tessie.</p><p dir="ltr">"We created it around the vehicle," Bianchi said. "The scale of the map matches having a vehicle as a core element to the map. It's the fifth member of your squad.</p><p dir="ltr">"The fog and the roads between are treacherous to travel, so we wanted those to be very streamlined but also really cool for the vehicle to travel," Bianchi continued.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1070775999" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

of zombies in my path. I didn't get to experience the full upgrades available, but I did get to the portion of the map where you can upgrade the vehicle to include a Pack-a-Punch machine. That's right: The truck becomes a moving Pack-a-Punch machine, and you can upgrade your weapons on the fly.</p><p dir="ltr">If you decide to take the roads on foot, you're met with a fast-moving enemy type called Ravengers. These creatures swarm you and make it difficult to proceed, so it's a lot safer to travel with Tessie. It also made for awkward and tense moments when our vehicle was destroyed while traversing these roads. Enemies and crashes can cause enough damage to disable the Wonder Vehicle, and while Treyarch told us there was a way to repair Tessie, we didn't figure that part out.</p><p dir="ltr">Like other Zombies maps, Ashes of the Damned features a main storyline quest, a unique Wonder Weapon, and plenty of mysteries to uncover. Features like Wall Buys, GobbleGums, and the iconic Mystery Box return. I also appreciate that Treyarch isn't drip-feeding the perks to us this year. Black Ops 6 started with a small selection, and each seasonal update expanded the list of perks. Black Ops 7 includes all the perks available in Black Ops 6 and introduces a new perk called Wisp Tea. I didn't get to try this perk out for myself, but it spawns a spectral orb-like protector to help you fight off zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to being the largest round-based map, Ashes of the Damned also includes the largest cast yet. The map features eight playable characters: the crew of four from Black Ops 6, as well as the iconic cast of Takeo, Dempsey, Nikolai, and Richtofen. You can mix and match any of these characters for up to four-player co-op. They all have unique voice lines, and Drew said some dialogue will depend on which characters are included in your party. Much of the character dialogue was blocked from our hands-on session, as Treyarch wanted to preserve the story elements for the full launch, but I am excited to see where Tessie and this new story will take me in Black Ops 7.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Warzone lacks meaningful changes</h2><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 will integrate with Warzone during Season 1. A date hasn't been confirmed for this first post-launch update, but the content will include map changes for Verdansk and a new Resurgence map called Haven's Hollow.</p><p dir="ltr">Due to the popularity of Verdansk, I'm not surprised the developer is bringing it back as Warzone's big map battle royale. However, I am surprised by how uninspiring the map's changes proved to be in our hands-on session.</p><p dir="ltr">The Season 1 update will add two POIs: Factory and Signal Station. Factory is a large factory-style building next to Superstore, and it's a very forgettable location. Signal Station is a little more interesting as it offers objectives you can complete in order to get rewarded with extra intel. Completing the objectives will upgrade your Tac Map to reveal enemy density for a portion of the map. The Tac Map will highlight quadrants in orange or red based on how populated those areas are. Intel is always handy, and maybe this will become a hot spot for players, but ultimately my time on this version of Verdansk played the same as any other match pre-integration.</p><p dir="ltr">The season's new map is a smaller one for Resurgence. Haven's Hollow is set in the same town as Black Ops 6's Zombies mode. Of course, this version of Liberty Falls is designed pre-outbreak, meaning there are no Zombies elements or destruction here; this is just a quaint West Virginia town. It does include the church, bowling alley, bank, and other major points of interest, but the playable area also extends beyond the areas within the Zombies maps.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578519-b2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578519" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578519-b2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578519"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4578519-b2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Haven's Hollow is a vibrant map, and it's filled with rich color not often seen in a Warzone map. I do appreciate the effort to make this map easy on the eyes, and I wish other maps had been this colorful, but unfortunately, it's not a memorable location to fight for a victory royale. Liberty Falls was the least interesting of all the Zombies maps, and when you take away the Zombies elements, it feels even truer for Warzone . A boring '90s version of West Virginia feels like another missed opportunity to do something futuristic and fitting of the Black Ops 7 theme. Of course, this was just my initial impression after a few matches on Haven's Hollow, so maybe this map will grow on me with time, but it lacks any initial wow factor.</p><p dir="ltr">It would've been nice to see a futuristic new map or an upgraded version of Verdansk with new lighting and robots to fit the Black Ops 7 theme. Warzone's yearly integration with a new title usually brings something new or fresh-feeling, but this is definitely the battle royale's most uninspiring yearly update yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch did announce the return of Black Ops 4's popular Blackout battle royale mode on the Avalon map. This new Blackout battle royale experience won't arrive until sometime in Spring 2026, and we didn't get to play or learn any details about the mode at Call of Duty: Next. While Warzone is leaving me disappointed and wanting a whole lot more, I am excited to see what the return of Blackout looks like in Black Ops 7. I just hate that we'll be waiting long after launch to play it.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Final thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr">Warzone really missed the mark with uninspired maps, and it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Fans like myself will likely need to wait until the springtime to get any major or impactful changes to battle royale, and that is a huge disappointment for the yearly integration. However, multiplayer and Zombies content make me excited for the full launch of Black Ops 7. Redefined omnimovement makes the game even more satisfying to play, and if the rest of the maps have the same quality as the ones I sampled at Call of Duty: Next, it can be another enjoyable and action-filled year for Black Ops.</p>

              <p>Peacemaker’s dance emote will return to <em>Fortnite</em> now that Epic Games is satisfied it had nothing to do with Nazi imagery. Following the reveal of the HBO show’s recent season 2 twist, the company implied it was concerned the dance moves<a href="https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-fortnite-nazi-emote-season-2-spoilers-2000629842"> intentionally recreated a swastika</a>. The emote will now return next week, with modified animations.</p> <p>“We’ve worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros. Games to confirm there were no creative intentions to connect the Peaceful Hips Emote and the current <em>Peacemaker</em> storyline,” the<em> Fortnite</em> account on X posted on Wednesday. “To avoid any confusion, we’re modifying the Emote choreography in next week’s update. If they prefer, players can return the Emote without using a ticket.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/ial5jDTIFI">https://t.co/ial5jDTIFI</a> <a href="https://t.co/CnsrL8QL7t">pic.twitter.com/CnsrL8QL7t</a></p> <p>— Leryensu (@iLegendTz) <a href="https://twitter.com/iLegendTz/status/1973484250289807592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><strong>Spoiler warning:</strong> we’re about to mention some major plot points from <em>Peacemaker</em> season 2.</p> <p>This whole thing started after the alternate universe that John Cena’s Chris Smith has been exploring this season was revealed to be one in which Hitler’s Germany won WWII and America is now run by Nazis. If you then went back and looked at the&nbsp; dance in the Peaceful Hips <em>Fortnite</em> emote, which is supposed to be the one Cena does in the season 2 intro, you can sort of see that maybe there’s a swastika in there somewhere if you overlay multiple freeze frames.</p> <p>Epic Games then pulled the emote and said it would investigate to see if this had been done by someone at Warner Bros. on purpose. It seems the company is now satisfied that it was just an unintended coincidence. But what fans really want to know is if the dance will actually sync up to the music this time the way it’s choreographed in the show. We’ll know when the emote returns during <em>Fortnite</em>‘s reset next week on October 9.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-announces-luna-another-cloud-based-streaming-ga-1845170977">Luna, Amazon’s video game cloud-streaming service</a>, is shifting gears. While the service will still feature AAA video games like <em>Fallout</em> and <em>Dead Island,</em> the retail giant has announced new plans to “reimagine” Luna as a way for families to play casual, easier-to-learn games using their phones. And the first one of these games Amazon revealed is a courtroom comedy game featuring an AI-powered Snoop Dogg as the judge. Hmm.</p> <p>Launched back in 2020, <a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-cloud-streaming-war-xbox-ps5-ps-portal-luna-1851704159">Amazon Luna followed in the footsteps of Google’s video game streaming service</a>, Stadia. But unlike Stadia, <a href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014">which died back in 2022</a>, Amazon has continued to support Luna, offering a subscription service with access to over 100 games as well as giving Prime members a small catalog of games to play for free. It’s never felt like Luna was a big hit, though, despite some publishers like Ubisoft and EA continuing to support it. Well, Amazon seems to have admitted it wasn’t working, because the company just revealed big plans to rebrand Luna as a more casual experience built around couch co-op and new, unique games.</p>

  <p>On October 1, <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/new-amazon-luna">Amazon announced that later this year, Luna will change.</a> While the service will still allow you to buy and play AAA games, Amazon is going to target, as explained in a press release about the pivot, “the <span>100s of millions of people who&nbsp;</span><span>want</span><span> to experience the magic of playing games on the big screen but feel left out” due to games being too complicated or consoles being too expensive. Amazon’s play is to turn Luna into a place where friends and family members can gather around the TV, pull out their phones, and play less complicated games together. If this sounds a lot like Jackbox, well, congratulations, you too can be an Amazon Gaming executive.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>The big centerpiece of this rebrand is Game Night, a new Amazon-developed hub within Luna that will offer a variety of Jackbox-like, family-friendly, casual games. Players just scan a QR code using their phone, and a few seconds later, they’re having a great time playing… a Snoop Dogg courtroom game powered by AI?</p>

 <p>Yeah, the big game revealed today is <span><i>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg,&nbsp;</i>which Amazon describes as an “</span><span>AI‑powered improv courtroom game where players invent outrageous characters, spin wild stories, and do whatever it takes to defend their testimonies before Judge Snoop Dogg.” Gather around, grandma, pull out your Cricket Wireless smartphone, and let’s yell at an AI-powered recreation of a famous rapper who has, <a href="https://www.snooppassport.xyz/">let’s say,</a> <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/snoop-dogg-criticizes-lgbtq-couple-disney-lightyear-1236353064/">made some</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/g-s1-43733/snoop-dogg-trump-perform-inauguration">bad choices in recent years</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>Will this big pivot work out? I have no idea. A lot of this pitch reminds me of the same stuff Google said about Stadia and what Intellivision promised about <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-new-gaming-console-thats-become-a-giant-car-crash-1847699027">the disaster that is the Amico console</a>. Maybe Amazon will find success where others haven’t? Maybe. I mean, it’s not like Luna’s setting the world on fire at the moment. We’ll find out when the big pivot happens later this year.</p>

                <p>Walton Goggins' character, The Ghoul, is one of the breakout creations from Prime Video's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-amazon-show-review-of-the-people-for-the-people/1900-6418209/" data-ref-id="1900-6418209">Fallout</a> TV series. Now, The Ghoul is coming to Fallout 76 later this year as part of the Burning Springs expansion. While Burning Springs won't officially launch until early December, a public test server for the expansion is going to be open on October 2.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bGPRrcnJ5Y" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9bGPRrcnJ5Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players won't be able to control The Ghoul, but they can find him in Burning Springs, Ohio, where he operates out of a bar called The Last Resort. His function in the expansion is to give the players bounty hunter assignments. The grunt hunts are the lower-tier bounties that can be used to gain experience and the occasional legendary item. Tougher targets can be purchased in exchanged for caps. The most difficult assignments are the head hunts, which are "open to anyone in earshot." Those are some of of the most difficult targets to handle, and players may need backup to bring them down.</p><p>Burning Springs is also introducing an important new character called the Rust King.

                <p>Microsoft announced some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">significant changes for Xbox Game Pass today</a>, headlined by a 50% price increase for Game Pass Ultimate, bringing it up to $30/month. But it may not be the last change for the service, according to at least one expert.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1973424993909211530" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad</a>, Microsoft is betting that its console players stay loyal to Game Pass even at the higher price while the company continues to release more and more games on rival platforms like PS5 and Switch 2, in addition to its ongoing efforts in the PC market. Ahmad also suggested Microsoft could look at an ad-based tier for Game Pass to help the subscription service remain sustainable.</p><p>"The primary concern for Xbox at this time is managing the transition from a closed-console-based ecosystem to an open multi-device ecosystem. Console sales have dropped considerably, PC Game Pass uptake has been slow, and cloud is still seen as an extension of existing play, rather than a primary entry point," he said.</p><p>"The bet that Microsoft is making here is that its existing console base remains loyal to Game Pass at higher prices (or current prices with Premium), while it looks to ramp up growth on PC, PS5 and Switch 2 via day one / late ports that are fully priced," Ahmad added.</p><h2><strong>A Game Pass ad tier?</strong></h2><p>Can Game Pass remain sustainable for Microsoft against this backdrop? That's the "big question," Ahmad said. The company may look to a variety of sources to help grow Game Pass in the future, including by introducing an ad-supported tier, Ahmad said.</p><p>"The big question going forward is if Game Pass can be a sustainable product off console and how best they can reach this audience. At the very least that's going to require a lower entry cost (Essential) and experimentation with cloud only, ad supported, or mobile-first offerings," he said.</p><p>It's expected that Game Pass will continue to evolve over time, but whether or not the things Ahmad said, like an ad tier, come to fruition remains to be seen. How an ad-based version of Game Pass could work is unknown. Back in 2012, Square Enix launched an ad-based streaming game service called Coreonline before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-kills-ad-supported-streaming-service/1100-6417195/" data-ref-id="1100-6417195">killing it off 15 months later due to a lack of uptake from players.</a></p><p>For now, Game Pass Ultimate is going up in price from $20 to $30 per month, while the Core and Standard tiers have been renamed Essential and Premium (with no price hikes). For the increased price, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-are-fortnite-crew-and-ubisoft-classics-the-new-game-pass-ultimate-perks/1100-6535143/" data-ref-id="1100-6535143">Ultimate subscribers are getting Fortnite Crew and Ubisoft+ Classics</a> added to their memberships, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/94-new-game-pass-games-released-today-heres-the-full-list/2900-7083/" data-ref-id="2900-7083">a lot more games.</a></p><p>The price increases for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass come just ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> in November.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-gets-ubisoft-classics-fortnite-crew-and-a-ridiculous-price-increase.1314226/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has announced a major shakeup of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>, bringing more games to players across its four versions, including the addition of Ubisoft+ to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, but with the top tier getting a staggering, frankly ridiculous 50% price increase because of this.</p>
<p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate has long been the go-to tier for Game Pass, giving access to a library of games, Day One access to a bunch of new releases (including all first party games), cloud game streaming, and online console multiplayer. Now, Microsoft is guaranteeing at least 75 day one games will be added each year, and the addition of Ubisoft+ Classic and Fortnite Crew.</p>



<p>The price of Game Pass Ultimate has crept up in the last few years, and has stood at $19.99 and £14.99 per month since last summer. Now, though, the price is going up by 50% to $29.99 and £22.99 per month.</p>
<p>That’s justified by the Fortnite Crew addition, which is valued at $12 a month as it gives you the Fortnite Battle Pass and 1000 V Bucks each month, and the Ubisoft+ Classics library, which is valued at $8 per month. It’s starting to sound a bit like cable TV or Sky Sports, where you pay through the nose for a huge package of channels, even if you only really want the one thing.</p>

<p>This now puts a massive premium on Game Pass Ultimate and, while there’s additions and more promises, it feels like Microsoft is readjusting the business model in a way to compensate for “lost” revenue from first party game sales. If you see no value from Fortnite Crew or Ubisoft+, then this is just a huge price increase.</p>
<p>The other way to get day one games, in a more limited fashion, is with PC Game Pass. This is only usable with Windows PC – and with the upcoming Ally X handheld – and is going up from $11.99 / £9.99 to $16.49 &nbsp;/ £13.49. The only change here is the addition of Ubisoft+, getting it for $4.50 / £3.50.</p>
<p>Game Pass Standard has now been rebranded as Game Pass Premium, thankfully holding onto the same $14.99 / £10.99 price point. This is actually just becoming a better deal, as while you don’t have day one games, you will get Xbox published games added within a year of launch, and there is now priority cloud gaming for the Game Pass Premium library and for select games that you own.</p>
<p>The runt of the litter remains Game Pass Essential, which replaced Xbox Live Gold a good while ago. Sticking with $9.99 / £6.99 per month (and I believe still with a 12 month purchase possible) this is required for online gaming, and includes a much smaller selection of games. That’s been doubled now, from 25+ to 50+ games, and you can now access cloud gaming.</p>
<p>All of this comes down to how you use Game Pass to consume games. Do you like the additions to Game Pass Ultimate, or would you be reconsidering your subscription at this price point?</p>

            <p>
There just doesn't seem to be a good time to release a game right now, does there? We all saw the way that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> scared away plenty of games, even games with completely different genres. And sometimes it's just a case of a particular month being stacked - just this month alone there's Ghost of Yotei, Battlefield 6, Pokemon Legends Z-A, Ninja Gaiden 4, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, Dispatch, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, the list truly goes on. So, I really can't blame developer Digital Sun, who've announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</a> has been delayed.
</p>
<p>
The developer shared word of said delay in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2350790/view/525355229451912554?l=english">Steam news post</a> earlier today, as the game was originally slated for release October 23rd, later this month. But, as they note, "the month has filled up with so many other great releases that we feel it has become too crowded for us. And as every wise shopkeeper knows, even the most precious gem can be overlooked in an overstuffed showcase." So now, you can expect the game to launch on November 19th, a little more than a month later.
</p>
<p>
As a little bonus to make up for the delay, Digital Sun will also be running some closed playtests to let you try the game out, in particular to get a feel for some of the changes made based on community feedback. More details on that are coming soon, apparently.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> 2 looks like it's picking up where the original game left things off, gameplay wise at least, having now been transported to the realm of 3D. Based on an interview between the devs and <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-preview-inteview-hades-inspired/">TheGamer</a> earlier this year, you can also expect it to fully lean into being a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>, which admittedly is a bit of an oversaturated genre right now. Fingers crossed the still fun concept of having to plunge into dungeons to stock your own shop is strong enough to find success this time around too!

<p><i>No Man’s Sky</i> continues to impress with its regular updates, and the most recent one was surely one of the most eventful. That’s because it allows players to build massive ships of their own design, with fully explorable interiors, resulting in some epic ships their creators are sharing across the internet.</p> <p>If you frequent <i>NMS</i> spaces online, you’ve likely seen some of these. But whether you’re a regular spacefarer or it’s been some time since you’ve taken a look at Hello Games’ vast and ever-improving galaxy, I invite you to have a gander at some of the most impressive ship builds out there.</p>

 <h2><span id="from-star-wars-to-the-matrix,-five-awesome-recreations-of-famous-ships"></span>From <i>Star Wars</i> to <i>The Matrix</i>, five awesome recreations of famous ships<span></span></h2> <p>Give folks the ability to make stuff in a video game and you’ll quickly see recreations of beloved people, places, or things from TV shows, film, and other games. In <i>No Man’s Sky</i>, that mostly means ships, and there are tons of excellent recreations of famous ships out there in the <i>NMS </i>galaxy. Here are five standouts.</p>

 <h3>John_Dog_’s Millennium Falcon from <i>Star Wars</i></h3>  <p>It was hard to not just fill this list up with <i>Star Wars</i> recreations. Though it required a bit of glitching to make happen, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nui1ju/i_know_theres_been_a_lot_of_these_but_i_had_to/">this Falcon</a> is one of the most accurate I’ve seen.</p>

 <hr> <h3>Own–Astronomer-1296’s Sea Duck from <i>Duck Tales</i></h3>  <p>Maybe this one technically belongs in the collection of sillier ships you’ll find below, but given how ships can now land on water, there’s a satisfying fusion of form and function in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nhh5qz/i_think_ive_peaked_the_sea_duck/">this <i>Duck Tales</i> recreation</a>.</p>

 <hr> <h3>Due_Willow_137’s Pyramid ship from <i>Destiny 2</i></h3>  <p>No, this is not a screenshot from <i>Destiny 2</i>, though it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nu8e1s/pyramid_vessel/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sure as hell looks like one</a>.</p> <hr> <h3>solidsharkey’s Eagle 5 from <i>Space Balls</i></h3>  <p>Having spent countless weeks traveling and living out of a van myself, I’ve often dreamed of having my own <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1ndkz7i/spaceballs_the_video_game/">Eagle 5</a> to just cruise space with.</p>

 <hr> <h3>AcoupleofIrishfolk’s Nebuchadnezzar from <i>The Matrix</i></h3>  <p>While the exterior design of this recreation of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n99tpb/the_nebuchadnezzar/">Morpheus’ ship from <i>The Matrix</i> looks sick</a>, it’s the faithfully recreated interior, complete with screens and cables running everywhere, that really sold this build for me.</p>

 <h2><span id="five-sick-original-ship-builds"></span>Five sick original ship builds<span></span></h2> <p>It’s wild how flexible <i>NMS</i>’ shipbuilding system is. I’ve particularly enjoyed seeing builds that deliver on aesthetics not normally found in Hello Games’ otherwise kinda cartoony presentation.</p> <h3>Barbed-Wire’s ‘Lived-in’ corvette</h3>  <p>Maybe I just have a thing for living out of vehicles? I’d call <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1njmnts/ive_finally_finished_my_livedin_corvette_build/">this place</a> home.</p> <hr> <h3>schmacobinc’s ‘Biblically Accurate’ corvette</h3>  <p>This one caught my eye immediately. And it’s a fantastic example of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1neq31b/a_biblically_accurate_corvette/">wacky and weird</a> shit you can kitbash together in <i>NMS</i>.</p> <hr> <h3>Leteramma’s ‘Trash Ship’</h3>  <p>There are plenty of OG ship creations that look fit for the cover of some space opera novel. And this “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nhny71/my_trash_ship/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Trash Ship</a>” looks like it has a story all to itself.</p>

 <hr> <h3>Beckhaver’s ‘Mini Salve Outrider with Trailer’</h3>  <p>I love the simplicity and originality of this two-part build. It uses some fancier build techniques to pull off, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nrylm6/voyagers_mini_salvage_outrider_with_trailer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">but it looks so worth it</a>.</p> <hr> <h3>Lopsided_Wealth_7968’s ‘Desert Hovercraft’</h3>  <p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nnvyub/desert_hovercraft/">sick-looking spacecraft with outdoor seating</a> for some scenic views?

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-jobs-ranking-best-ivalice-chronicles-2000630679</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-jobs-in-final-fantasy-tactics-ranked.1314214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is renowned</a> for its clever, quirky, and deeply customizable job system. It might be the best job system in any game ever. It’s certainly the best in Square Enix’s long-running RPG franchise (<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> fans can fight me in the Dorter Slums after work). But how do you decide which one to choose? Here’s my list of the best ones, based on a combination of their sheer power and how fun they are to play with.</p> <p>A word of warning: you won’t find jobs like Time Mage, Mimic, or Arithmetician in the ranking below. That’s because while each of those contains some of the most powerful abilities in the game, they are each highly situational and/or better when paired with other jobs as the primary one. So while you should make sure everyone learns some of the Time Mage’s skills, you should never be fielding one just for fun. And while Mimic and Arithmetician are responsible for some of the deadliest combos in the game, they also both come with huge drawbacks that ultimately disqualify them for our purposes here.</p>

 <p>The jobs below are the ones that will get you <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228">the most bang for your buck</a> and are the ones you’ll want to revert back to once your characters have mastered the rest of their skills.</p> <h2>10. Orator (Requires Mystic Lv.3)</h2> <p>Final Fantasy loves experimenting with offbeat character classes and in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> that’s the Mediator. This job talks and carries a gun. That’s it. While not the most powerful or effective, it’s pretty versatile and lots of fun. Intimidate lowers a unit’s Bravery and can turn them into a chicken. Mimic Darlavon can put even some bosses to sleep. All of these abilities cost zero MP and have no cast time. Also the hat rules.</p>

 <h2>9. Geomancer (Requires Monk Lv.4)</h2> <p>What if a knight also had magic? This is <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ version of the Blue Mage. Geomancers can carry swords and shields but also hit enemies from far away with environmental magic based on what type of terrain they’re standing on. Each attack comes with its own chance to proc a debuff like slow or petrify. The attacks don’t do much damage but they are free, happen immediately, and can chip away at foes while you’re closing the distance.</p>

 <h2>8. Dragoon (Requires Thief Lv.4)</h2> <p>Dragoons have the tankiest stat growth and also the coolest-looking armor. They can hit from two squares away with javelins, keeping them out of harm’s way for enemy melee counters. Plus they can ignore elevation when moving, and Jump allows them to hit faraway enemies for extra damage while staying out of danger for most of their turn. They aren’t very flashy or fun but they can take a beating and still dish it out, one-shotting pesky enemy mages from far away.</p>

 <h2>7. Black Mage (Requires Chemist Lv.2)</h2> <p>Black Mages have the highest base magic attack power in the game and make things, including on occasion their friends or even themselves, go boom. All you really need to know.</p> <h2>6. White Mage (Requires Chemist Lv.2)</h2> <p>This is the most versatile magic class because it can revive fallen party members and attack with Holy. Like its Black Mage counter-part, Flare, Holy also only targets one square, letting you nuke enemies without fear of friendly fire. In addition to full-heal revives with Arise, Reraise lets you revive allies ahead of time before sending them to draw enemy fire. The only downside is that all of this costs a boatload of MP.</p>

 <h2>5. Summoner (Requires Time Mage Lv.3)</h2> <p>Summoners have the most powerful attack spells in the game. Unlike Black Mages, their summons can’t hurt allies and also have wider areas of impact. Cyclops and Bahamut do incredible damage and their casting times in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster have all been buffed. Plus Lich is absolutely necessary for late-game boss fights where enemies have over 1,000 HP. That’s because it does damage on a percentage of total HP basis, letting it hit for 999 damage. Also Golem is a great support summon for soaking up Archer fire in-between turns.</p>

 <h2>4. Ninja (Requires Archer Lv.4, Thief Lv.5, Geomancer Lv.2)</h2> <p>Two words: Dual-Wield. The only thing cooler than one sword is two swords, and the Ninja job gives you that. Or two flails if you’re an RNG sicko. Ninjas have great movement and speed, and can be outfitted with enough evasion to make their squishy HP less susceptible to being quickly depleted. The throwing attack isn’t the best but it’s another decent ranged option for picking enemies off from afar.</p> <h2>3. Samurai (Requires Knight Lv.4, Monk Lv.5, Dragoon Lv.2)</h2> <p>Okay, maybe I lied. The only thing cooler than two swords is one big sword that you lift up over your head to cast magic with. The Samurai is another interesting riff of the “what if Knight but also Mage?” question. The Iaido abilities scale with magic attack and let you heal, buff, debuff, and damage a big area around your character without having to worry about friendly fire. It can be expensive early on when your swords randomly break in-between uses, but more tanky-ness than the Ninja and Geomancer also adds to the appeal. Some other people would put Ninja ahead of Samurai, and that’s because they get a perverse satisfaction out of constantly having to revive them.</p> <h2>2. Chemist (Unlocked from the start)</h2> <p>Unlocked right from the start, Chemists are the true workhorses of the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> combat economy. They’re far from flashy but they provide incredible value, instantly healing without needing to wait for spells to cast or hoping they have enough MP left in the tank. They also get guns and they automatically discover items hidden beneath them during battle sometimes. There is almost no battle in<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em> you can’t eventually win simply by throwing dozens and dozens of potions and phoenix downs at it. Plus they have lots of fun pouches.</p> <h2>1. Monk (Requires Knight Lv.3)</h2> <p>The Monk. Where do I begin? They don’t need weapons or hats so you don’t need to spend a ton of money on upkeep. They have the best physical attack growth in the game and the Martial Arts ability is by far the most useful. They have ranged options and can revive allies or get rid of status effects for free. Plus they are the only Job that can restore MP to multiple characters at once, keeping your big Mage guns fueled up. The only drawback is these abilities are severely hampered by differences in elevation so you have to play smart. But when all else fails, just punch everyone in the face really, really hard. Works every time.</p>

<p>This collection doesn't just include the Blue Blur, either — both his sidekick Tails and Shadow the Hedgehog will be featured on much of the apparel landing in-store and online later this month.</p>
<p>The complete range will include a pair of Sonic-inspired Puma Inhales, pairs of Tails and Shadow-designed Puma Inverses, and a range of apparel such as matching track jacket and track pants, a hoodie, shorts, a racer shirt, cap, and waist band.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lpzuqo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Plus, the collab doesn't end there — those racing around in CrossWorlds will be able to get in-game decals from Puma that you can use to customise your vehicles with.</p>
<p>Honestly? We kind of just want the little Tails and Shadow lace shrouds. They're pretty cute and we could make them work on <em>anything</em>.</p>

<p>Well, we'll have to wait and see how much the collection will cost. For now, you can admire the press shots above and let us know what you think of everything in the comments<em>.</em></p>

In particular, the rise of online communities and how they are the modern day gathering place, the role of avatars, and how our communication changes due to that. How this affects studios and real life will be explored, and overall is dedicated to giving shape and context to why online communities are so powerful and different than what we might think. It ends off on the author’s philosophy on the top community desire, which is to be seen, heard, and like they matter. Thus, this section will be the guidepost to driving strategy in a positive direction.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What is Community?">What is Community?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I first joined Habbo Hotel, an online social game (A.K.A. chat rooms with avatars), it was pandemonium. Massive amounts of spam in the shared spaces, rampant not-safe-for-work rooms, and more. In particular, I was part of someone’s America’s Next Top Model community, where players would line up to have their outfits judged based on the theme, and the winner would gain access to the exclusive "friend group" and back area. Losers were kicked out of the room. It was fun, but most of all, the friendships I gained there felt real, and one older girl took me under her wing to guard me from creepy guys. I’d eagerly wait for school to end so I could go back to be part of what felt like an exclusive group.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/what-happens-when-a-colossus-like-silksong-scuppers-your-launch-plans-" target="_self" data-discover="true">What happens when a colossus like Silksong scuppers your launch plans?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I wasn’t a part of the Habbo Hotel community because I signed up for an account. No—I became a part of the community when I actually started using the platform, talking to people, and actively participating in what it had to offer me.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the simplest terms: community is when a group of people have a shared sense of belonging that allows them to gather, engage, and connect with each other.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Community is more than just a group of people in a space. If it were simply that, anytime you opened the App Store on your iPhone, you’d be part of the "App Store community". There is a difference between being in the same space as someone and feeling like you matter and encouraged to reach out to people. You don’t even need a platform to have a community either! Obviously communities have long existed before Facebook was invented. They have evolved in terms of where people go to find community. As we dive into building up communities, we must keep in mind these questions:</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/xbox-explains-how-devs-can-make-the-most-of-streaming-showcase-spots" target="_self" data-discover="true">How developers can make the most of streaming showcases</a></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Who are the people we want participating in our space?&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Where is the space they are gathering in?</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What is the common language, slang, jargon, customs they will participate in?</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why are they there?

Community is what urges people into action. Community is what helps people grow, learn, and be exposed to a world outside of their own bubble. No matter where we are—online or offline—people crave a group of people like them. And the internet? It opens up a whole new level of exposure to people’s lives… and some new problems too. As community professionals we’re able to shape how these people connect and understand each other.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Communities are exactly the kind of thing developers are looking for in order to create better, more enjoyable game experiences. Metrics and data tracking will help quantify the most popular choices and issues in a game. A good community will work hand-in-hand with data to reveal even more: why something has occurred, the experiences and logic behind it, the emotions others may feel, and if this is something others would want.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/steam-defaults-to-language-specific-review-scores-to-provide-a-better-indication-of-user-sentiment-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Steam defaults to language-specific review scores to provide 'a better indication of user sentiment'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Communities don’t just make sense culturally, but design and business-wise too.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How Communities Form">How Communities Form</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bear with me as we dive into some solid sociology. How you tackle community management will start from the base assumptions you have of people and their interactions, and knowing your own base line will help you figure out what and why you decide to go a certain way, and if there is a different viewpoint that may help you gain perspective and understanding.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Culture and Community">Culture and Community</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Culture refers to the learned sets of meaning and behavior between members in a community. Interestingly, many people might not even be aware of their cultural nuances until they encounter a different one. Think of how a player might experience a cultural "shock" if they were to swap from playing multiplayer Stardew Valley to a competitive game of League of Legends. What is considered normal in one place might be entirely different in another.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unlike a rigid method of living, culture can be considered more like a template that shapes people’s behavior. Almost like how a game can have a joint set of emotes players can pick from to add and remove as they wish. New members are able to pick up and learn the template, add their own spin to it, and the template can evolve overtime. These templates aren’t often followed in their entirety, but they give many people a starting point to learn how to interact in ways that both enhance bonds and minimize misunderstandings. It’s powerful!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Religion, marriage, and even memes are a form of culture. Culture change often moves MUCH faster than laws can (e.g. internet culture has evolved at a much faster pace than any entertainment or media law can keep up with), but sometimes law can move or define the culture (for instance, the death penalty.) And the communities we create inevitably have their own type of subculture within the larger "culture" of the gaming community.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This act of actually influencing and shaping behavior is called socialization. This is a life-long, active process—it can change overtime, and takes time to form as we. Children in particular soak this up quickly, but also will try to negotiate and limit test to see where the boundaries are. With each "failure" they have (e.g. every time they get in trouble for acting a certain way), they learn what behaviors are okay. (You may find that adults in your community will limit test too. But they’re not children. They’re just annoying. Heh. I’m joking. Kinda.)&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’re able to shape not just communities, but literally the culture someone is in. I don’t say this to inflate us into some life changing entity, but we do have a large influence on how the spaces we work in progress and interact with each other. And the culture players are in is important, beyond just having someone to talk to! It also influences the kinds of people they’re exposed to, their resources, and even their attitudes and biases.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Rise of Online Communities">The Rise of Online Communities</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, fun fact, the internet is pretty popular nowadays. (This is the kind of groundbreaking insight you’re reading this book for, I know.) Especially when it comes to our games, whether AAA or indie, we rely on having a healthy community to give us feedback and sustain our studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are three main areas in which your community may form as it relates to games:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Social networks.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> While social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and other services are generally not necessarily conducive to back and forth conversation between players, there’s no denying it’s an important part of how gamers interact and find each other, so would feel wrong not to dive into the most culturally relevant platform. &nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Forums.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I include instant chat services like Discord in this. Reddit, Steam forums, or your own hosted forums on a website. While not as prolific as before, these are one of the places some of your most hardcore fans will be.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>In-Game.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> While this book will focus less on the actual in-game design of spaces (as those primarily lie with the game designer), the in-game community is inextricably linked to the community that gathers outside of it, so it’s important to take note of how they influence each other.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It doesn’t matter where you start out, so long as the players can find you. As your community gets bigger, it’s likely they will branch off and create communities not directly tied to you. This is good! It’s a sign of a successful game when you aren’t able to control every aspect of it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While we have fallen into a slight trap of the internet needing to be "entertaining" to be worthy—this is not the way we should be tackling it. As community builders, we can make the internet more than just entertainment. It is belonging, growth, and learning.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Third Spaces">Third Spaces</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I like to think of online communities working very similarly to real life cities or neighborhoods. A city is a conglomeration of people from all walks of life—different cultures, beliefs, socioeconomic backgrounds, and so on. Even in monocultural countries, there are still differences between people and their understandings of the world, plus tourists, in many cases. A well planned city has multiple places in which people can gather together—parks, libraries, public recreational areas, community centers, block parties, etc. There is lots of care and consideration for how people find each other in cities that aren’t necessarily profit driven. Online communities need that same amount of care and consideration—structuring and designing the space for it to survive in the long term, whether that’s for a business or not.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These places where people gather in cities can be described by a term coined by the sociologist Ray Oldenburg: "third spaces". These places refer to spots that someone goes to that are not their usual social environments of the home and the workplace. (And now with remote work, sometimes there isn’t even a "second" place.) Third places can be things like parks, a cafe you frequent, public libraries, gyms, bars, churches, community centers, a comic book store, etc. Oldenburg argues these third places are incredible important for society, engagement, and feeling like you truly belong in a place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And with the prevalence of the internet, many people are starting to find an almost "fourth" place there. Or perhaps, in some scenarios, the internet IS someone’s third places due to a lack of accessible real life third places (distance, a global pandemic, etc.)&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thinking about digital communication through the lens of the spaces we build is important because it encourages us to consider how that design and structure can shape relationships, rather than just using it to advertise products or exchange information. A community requires not only common goals or interests, but a sense of interactivity and understanding between each other.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we look at what a third space needs to be considered one, we can see that the internet actually can contain a lot of similar characteristics:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Neutral ground: There is no obligation to be in the space and you are free to leave and come back whenever you want.&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Leveler: Your socioeconomic status, unless in a game that has pay-to-win tendencies, is not apparent nor overly important.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conversation is main activity: Light-hearted and good-natured conversation is the main focus of the space, though not the only activity.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Accessibility &amp; accommodation: Must be accessible and provide for those the enter the space.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regulars: A number of regular people that visit the space that set the mood, tone, and characteristics. Often they help newcomers feel welcome.&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A low profile: Not pretentious, accepting of people that come to it no matter their background.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Playful mood: Being playful and good natured is common and highly valued.&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Home away from home: A feeling of belongingness and regeneration by spending time there.&nbsp;</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is, of course, assuming all goes well and no laws are being broken. But if we take these characteristics and apply them to game communities, we can see many of our characteristics or at least goals aligning.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A well functioning community relies on collective efficacy, which is a group’s ability to trust each other and work together. There are shared expectations on behalf of the common good of the space (e.g. not throwing trash into your neighbor’s lawn.)&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The cool thing here is you don’t need strong social connections for collective efficacy to occur. You don’t have to like every single one of the people in your city to be able to make something happen, just a mutual sense of understanding and trust. And having this makes living or interacting in space that much more pleasant.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A mutual sense of trust is maintained by:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A willingness to help others out.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking actions to gain understanding.</span></p></div></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So in our roles, we want to encourage and create this sense of mutual working trust not only between players, but between the developers and players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And to combat any naysayers about internet communities being inherently "bad" – what does that mean? Before you can assign a judgment like that, we need to be clear about what the role and function of an online community is supposed to be.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This isn’t to say online spaces can replace (or should replace) real life third spaces. However, they’re an almost inevitable part of life, especially as the years go on. We still need strong resources, third spaces, and offline interactions, but there’s no denying a huge chunk of time for younger folks (wow I feel old) has been replaced by time spent on social media, or in our case, in games.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because of this, we can’t just ignore online communities or treat them with blanket templates or rules. Community managers are the designers and maintainers. What are we doing then?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Avatars, Personas, Anonymity&nbsp;">Avatars, Personas, Anonymity&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A special part of online communities in particular is the persona people can create—whether in game or on social platforms. Whether it’s a highly curated version of themselves, a completely new version, or even an anonymous entity, there are endless options for people to be what they want to be.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As social media has become more prolific and being an influencer as a career choice becomes more interesting to folks, you may also see a rebound effect where folks begin to overshare. Daily vlogs, relatable content, personal life confessions, even babies can be dragged into it before they’ve even begun to understand what consent is if parents begin to do it. We’ve evolved past the time where it’s weird to be friends with internet strangers. Arguably, it’s even expected and professional in games.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even more than other industries, part of the fun of games is to adopt some sort of persona online. Game communities are great at being a leveler in that sense. Through avatars, profile pictures, and text chat, social identification is dependent on those chosen aspects rather than judging the actual face of the person behind it, or even the voice. (This is separate from badges or follower counts one may have, but at the onset, everyone starts from 0.) This isn’t to say that people don’t go by their real name or photos, but that a large part of gaming culture is the ability to embody the character or avatar you want to be. It’s common to refer to someone as only their online name—knowing them as an alias rather than their legal given name. To know their character more than they know your face. This creation of social identity—masking the background or visual cues (and sometimes things like accents) add to the interesting dynamic of social interactions in games, where the playing field seems "level" and it’s assumed at first glance, everyone is coming from a similar background and history as you.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While it’s great this happens, it also creates a higher chance of culture clash with the high levels of interactivity with low context.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Communication Changes">Communication Changes</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As communication channels evolve with the help of reaction GIFs, emotes, emojis, and memes, this creates further incentive for folks to chat with each other in a shared language. This is particularly helpful for people who may have struggled in real world communication.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, while removing face-to-face interactions means the nuances of expressions are gone (for better or for worse), it’s replaced by written nuances. Is typing in proper punctuation in a casual conversation seen as someone being tense or stoic? Is typing in all caps angry yelling or just fun excitement? What happens when voice chat is added to the mix, but again with no facial cues?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These changes in communication styles are things we need to constantly keep in mind as online communities develop and attempt to understand each other.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Studios and Communities">Studios and Communities</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I can rant and rave about how wonderful and culturally significant communities are, but at the same time, I know what you’re here for. Community management falls under a larger marketing umbrella, and especially with independent studios, you often have the role of handling numerous aspects of social, marketing, public relations, and even sales.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, while we will be tackling the values and ethics of communities, we can also acknowledge that while living in a capitalist society, there is a business value to maintaining communities too. While the two may seem to clash with each other, there are ways in which they find a happy medium that we must find. After all—we need to survive as community managers and studios too! We have games to make!&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For many, the actual business value of a community is hard to calculate. The value will be determined by the key players in your studio, here is a small example of what communities can do for a studio. (We will dive into actual tracking further on in the book, don’t worry!)</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Loyal fan bases for repeat customers</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Word of mouth marketing (the best!)</span></p></div></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Helping new players understand how to play a game/leading them</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lightening direct lift of onboarding and teaching</span></p></div></li><li></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In games, it’s wild to think we are willing to sit down for things like Nintendo Directs, E3 (RIP), and other similar showcases. While new game releases and updates are very cool, it all technically is just an advertisement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Movies do have something similar, where you watch trailers if you are early enough to a movie premiere. But the closest thing you get to people wanting to willingly watch ads at such a hyper focused scale is something like an Apple presentation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But this is why a community is so important. All these events have some sort of community surrounding them, willing to do something like watch 3 hours of advertisements but also willing to tell their friends about it. There is a level of identity and excitement. You can always copy the infrastructure of a community but you cannot copy the identity, relationships, and emotional depth of one. Your community is your own, and that’s what makes it valuable and so hard to cultivate. You can’t copy it!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Your community is willing to sit down and get excited with you. It’s an incredible power to be able to move people, particularly into action, which is why when we build and maintain our communities, we need to ensure we’re doing it right by them, the industry, and ourselves. This is where designing communities for kindness comes in.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Real Life Still Affects Life Online">Real Life Still Affects Life Online</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the things we need to acknowledge before we get into our own design of communities and kindness are the limitations we work in.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Communities are not a substitute for individual growth or real life interactions and everyday living. While online spaces can be many things—a reprieve, a place for growth and learning, a place of solace—it is not a replacement. It is an enhancement of one's own lived experiences and communities, expanding it and providing context that may have never come to be before. It can encourage actions and growth, but we are not beings that can detach our regular lives from our online spaces. The internet cannot completely rip away the importance of real life interactions and circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’d be wrong to talk about community building without considering—gasp—capitalism. The fact we work in spaces that need to profit does change our interactions with it. And there’s nothing wrong with acknowledging that—in fact, we HAVE to. We need to understand what the boundaries are if we are to ethically engage with our communities in a way that is beneficial to both the people and the studio.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance—class and income levels can drastically affect who spends time online. According to a study by the PEW Research Center in 2015, teens who are from more affluent households are more likely than those from lower-income households to say they hang out with friends in person outside of school. Lower-income teens are also less likely to play online games with in-person friends as opposed to their more affluent peers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, as we create communities online, we need to account for and consider situations in which we are inadvertently making biased assumptions in both structure and management of them. For instance, when we create communities, are we considering how some of the most vulnerable groups are being onboarded and welcomed into the space? For example, we can account for:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is not to say we need to give up entirely or even that it’s a huge undertaking to consider these things. Merely that as you continue reading this book, keep in mind what kind of biases you may hold about a player (e.g. "ugh why are they using such an old rig to play this game and complaining) and consider how we can approach situations with the nuance they often deserve.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How are Game Communities Different?">How are Game Communities Different?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game communities aren’t like other B2C communities. (Cue the "I’m not like other girls" joke here.) The audience will be influenced by a number of factors, including: studio culture/voice, game genre(s), game tone, and number of players. From this, you can judge where your primary community demographic will come from, and how you can design appropriately.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With games, we are closely tied to our players. This is also because games are such an intense bonding experience—you physically feel like you are in the game, taking on the character, experiencing the stories. So! The communities we create and what they bond over will be influenced by the structure and rules, but also the kinds of games the studio makes. They will attract certain kinds of people seeing a certain kind of experience. That being said, this doesn’t mean your horror shooter game cannot find a positive, warm audience. Merely that your structure may have to account for a different mindset going straight in.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Examples of the type of community ethos a certain game may attract:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mastery: Comprehensive knowledge or skill in a subject or accomplishment. Example games: Dwarf Fortress, Darkest Dungeon, Cuphead, Monster Hunter</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Competitiveness: Having a strong desire to be more successful than others. Example games: Rocket League, League of Legends, Fortnite</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kindness: friendliness, coziness, generosity, trust, or inclusion dynamics. Example games: A Short Hike, Tiny Glade, Animal Crossing, Slime Rancher</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, these are not exhaustive or exclusive. Communities can be and usually are a mixture of many people, personalities, and game genre interests. But by knowing what type of community ethos you’re aiming for, you can appropriately plan for things such as:</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What kind of community design you want/how you will promote it.">What kind of community design you want/how you will promote it.</h2><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Types of social platforms needed/their structure.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amount of moderation needed.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What sorts of risks come with each community.</span></p></div></li><li></li></ul></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Accessibility to Creators">Accessibility to Creators</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is a certain level of fanaticism games get, but also, a certain level of accessibility unlike other entertainment genres. When people get hyped over a movie, they can’t just join Christopher Nolan’s official Discord server to talk to the production team about Batman. They aren’t attending a game convention and hanging with the developers.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Self-Motivated Space Creation">Self-Motivated Space Creation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game communities are incredibly organic. Even more than other industries, it is natural to create a game community of some sort, even if it’s just with your friends to get a good raid in together or form a guild. It has inherently been built into gaming culture from the get-go. With this kind of space creation for each other, we are actually frontrunners in terms of what many other industries wished their consumers did. But with this, we also tend to fall into the trap of taking these places for granted and not trying to build on them and improve them.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conflict is Key">Conflict is Key</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conflict or friction tends to be part of the core experience of a game! How do we work with this? Usually people would avoid this, but in games, we WANT conflict sometimes. We encourage it! Me VS you! So we need to ensure we are keeping the spirit of the game, while also encourage sportsmanship among our players.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Comfortable Conversation Starters (And Sometimes, Passionate Ones)">Comfortable Conversation Starters (And Sometimes, Passionate Ones)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Playing games with others are especially helpful because they tend to bypass a certain awkwardness of real life conversations, and the struggle to find a common interest. After all, whether you’re new to games or not, the fact is you’re all playing and experiencing this one game. And better yet, things happen in games, and they’re often exciting, emotional, or surprising. This generates a huge opportunity for conversation starters and can even be great segues into deeper ones. Especially if you want to play with this person again, asking them or adding them as a friend online is entirely normal, and often done through a process that doesn’t feel as personal as, say, giving someone your Instagram account.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking these things into account, we’ll be structuring our community strategy to either encourage or manage expectations when it comes to these activities, and ultimately aim to use this to sustain the interest and longevity of our spaces.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="My Community Philosophy">My Community Philosophy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My main philosophy when it comes to dealing with anyone—players, coworkers, strangers—is that they want to feel seen, heard, and valued. I use these 3 points to always direct how I do community management and everything it touches, from social media strategy to writing a dev log.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As we dive specifically into game communities, here are some ideas to help drive your strategy in a positive direction:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Interactions matter.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> At some point, your community should not be built around your posts. It should be built in the replies—to you and to each other. Community is not a one way street.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Activity matters</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—in all ways. While a community that talks and engages with each other is important, do not forget that lurkers and those that more passively consume content are just as important to the community. Most people do not interact in a space—that’s normal. But while we do want to encourage activity, know that some silence is normal.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Louder does not equal right.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> While you may have more opinionated, angrier, or passionate members, remember their thoughts do not drive the direction of everything you do. They should certainly be taken into account, but part of your job is to figure out what is noise versus what is worth paying attention to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Small moments matter. Paying attention to the details of a relationship will do wonders. If your partner hints that they love flowers, occasionally surprising them with small flowers and remembering their favorite treat will do more for you than a single grand gesture on Valentine’s Day. (Okay this isn’t a dating advice book, so I could be wrong, but also… I’m not. Shush.) Pay attention to the hints your community drops for what they appreciate. What parts of the game do they gravitate towards? Do you remember a mod’s birthday? Do you take the time to check in on folks?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Be agile. Community moves just as fast as technology. New social platforms, new problems, new ways to connect. Ensure you’re keeping on top of the trends and don’t be resistant to change and experimentation.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A community needs kindness, resiliency, connection, and sustainability. We’ll dive more into this further on in the book, but these will ensure your community doesn’t just survive, but thrive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As you continue reading on in this book, I hope you keep that exact philosophy in mind for your own activities! After all, this book is NOT here to tell you exactly how you should structure or run your communities. To treat communities as a generality is a disservice to their complex nature. Instead, this book aims to provide you with resources, suggestions, and ways in which you can understand how to best work with your communities no matter what size it is.&nbsp;￼&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="References">References</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oldenburg, Ray. 1999.
