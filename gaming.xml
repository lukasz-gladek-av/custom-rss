After the world found out how much of a genocidal maniac his father Omni-Man (J.K. Simmons) is, the young superhero had to deal with civilians being afraid of him when he was trying to help, Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins) being wary of Invincible fighting for the Global Defense Agency (GDA), and his own self-doubt over whether he might one day become his father. After the first three episodes of <em>Invincible </em>season 3, it’s clear that those closest to the titular hero might need contingency plans in the event he goes rogue. And that includes the woman he loves.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-recommend-id="image://f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="145" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kotaku Spoiler Warning" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kotaku Spoiler Warning" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Graphic<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-recommend-id="image://f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="145" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kotaku Spoiler Warning" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The show has previously hinted at Mark’s struggles with doing what’s right without doing what’s lethal. Let’s not forget he ended season 2 in a more brutal way than his father ended Season 1, pummeling multidimensional terrorist Angstrom Levy (Sterling K. Brown) to his death because he threatened to hurt Mark’s family. He rationalizes the murder even while criticizing Cecil in the Season 3 premiere for allowing Darkwing (Lennie James) and D.A. Sinclair (Ezra Miller) to work for the GDA after killing people themselves, demonstrating the kind of moral double standard that could sprout into bloody vigilante justice.</p><p> Let’s also not forget that Levy showed us an alternate reality future in which Invincible teams up with his father to enslave Earth, a future that isn’t totally ruled out as one that may come to pass. Add in the fact his younger brother <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/invincible-season-3-jk-simmons-omni-man-oliver-1851756268&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/invincible-season-3-jk-simmons-omni-man-oliver-1851756268">Oliver channelled</a></span> his father’s genetic predisposition for duty-bound murder when he slaughtered the Mauler Twins in Season 3's third episode, and it’s no wonder Cecil implanted a device in Mark’s brain to subdue him at a moment’s notice and has an army of robots ready to take him down.</p><p>All that taken into consideration, Earth’s best chance at stopping an evil Invincible could be the overpowered Atom Eve, who Mark falls in love with in Season 3, and who also fights against him in his tyrannical alternate-reality future. Invincible may be able to destroy almost anything he comes in contact with, but Gillian Jacobs, who voices Atom Eve, says her character is more powerful than what we see in the show. </p><p>“My character and her powers are so immense that [<em>Invincible </em>series creator] Robert [Kirkman] says they struggle to find ways to not make her just instantly win,” Jacobs told <em>Kotaku</em>. “So, in one version of it, I think she could take down anyone, but they always come up with really interesting things that happen in fights so that can’t happen.”</p><figure id="" data-id="91be1c10e311e4ee2ef228ff7ac42ec0" data-recommend-id="image://91be1c10e311e4ee2ef228ff7ac42ec0" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1688" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Atom Eve flying away" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Atom Eve flying away" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Courtesy of Prime</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91be1c10e311e4ee2ef228ff7ac42ec0" data-recommend-id="image://91be1c10e311e4ee2ef228ff7ac42ec0" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1688" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Atom Eve flying away" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nerfing Atom Eve’s powers makes total sense. Eve can materialize anything she thinks of. She created a treehouse from thin air in minutes, rearranges someone’s body on a molecular level, and creates a force field against intergalactic weapons she’s never seen before. The writers do give her limitations for fixing large-scale calamities and healing people by restructuring their molecules, but those are built into the limits of her imagination. She couldn’t build structurally sound homes for the homeless because she didn’t have that architectural expertise in her mind, something she opted to rectify. If she’s willing to take college architecture courses to learn how to build, she could also go to medical school and become truly unstoppable, learning how to shut down someone’s vital organs or rearranging their brain chemistry to make them go insane. But perhaps, when it comes to reaching Mark, there’s a more straightforward approach.</p><p>“She might be able to just get [Invincible] through talking. Maybe she could destroy his mind from the inside,” Jacobs says.</p><p>That is a hell of a contingency plan for a superhero who, we’ve already seen, finds certain sonic frequencies nothing short of debilitating. As of now, she has nothing to worry about with Mark/Invincible other than scheduling dates and taking down bad guys together. But the time could come when she needs to be more than invincible. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It means that for now at least, GTA 6 is still on track for its previously announced release window and has not been delayed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN ahead of the release of its financial report, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that while "there's always a risk of slippage," the company "feel really good about it [fall 2025]."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, there's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Zelnick responded when IGN asked how confident he was that Rockstar will hit fall 2025 for GTA 6. "So we feel really good about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked for an update on how development on GTA 6 is going, Zelnick kept his cards close to his chest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, I think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally," he said. "We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organization is super excited."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The GTA 6 release date is one of the hottest topics in all of entertainment, with rival publishers waiting with bated breath for Rockstar to make its announcement. Earlier this week, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-boss-willing-to-move-battlefield-release-date-to-account-for-nuanced-year-relative-to-competition-cough-gta-6-cough">he was willing to delay the new Battlefield</a> out of the next fiscal year depending on the release timing of its competitors’ games, a thinly veiled nod to the behemoth that is GTA 6.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While its release window remains firm, GTA 6's much-wanted Trailer 2 has yet to materialize. We're now over a year since Trailer 1's release, a gap that has caused plenty of feverish fan speculation. While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, Zelnick's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking generally about Rockstar, Take-Two said Grand Theft Auto 5 has now sold-in an incredible 210 million units worldwide. GTA Online had a “strong” quarter, led by the Agents of Sabotage update. GTA+ memberships increased 10% year-over-year in the quarter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption 2, meanwhile, has sold-in more than 70 million copies. Take-Two noted it is currently seeing its highest level of concurrent players on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two has a busy 2025, with the just-released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> from Firaxis, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pga-tour-2k25">PGA Tour 2K25</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> in the summer, GTA 6 in the fall, and Gearbox’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> before year-end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are exceedingly optimistic about the commercial potential of our titles and believe that they will have a transformative effect on our business – and our industry – over the long term,” Take-Two said, before adding it remains “highly confident” it will achieve “sequential increases in, and record levels of, net bookings in fiscal 2026 and 2027.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> has now sold a staggering 210m copies, publisher Take-Two announced this evening in its latest financial results. 
</p>
<p>
The new total means Rockstar's wildly-successful game has shifted another 5m copies over the last three months of 2024, up until 31st December. 
</p>
<p>
There's a fresh lifetime total for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, also. It now stands at 70m copies sold, up three million units on last quarter - which would be jaw-droppingly impressive in comparison to pretty much any other game out there, other than GTA 5.
</p>
<p>
New content is still being pumped out for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>, such as December 2024's Agents of Sabotage update, and the multiplayer portion of Rockstar's aging game continues to be one of Take-Two's biggest earners. 
</p>
<p>
This year will see GTA 5 mark its 12th anniversary on sale (it originally launched in September 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360). Red Dead Redemption 2, meanwhile, will turn seven in October.
</p>
<p>
It's around then that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">Take-Two has said GTA 6 will finally arrive</a> - during its launch window which has now been re-confirmed for sometime this autumn. 
</p>
<p>
"There's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Take-Two boss <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">Strauss Zelnick told IGN</a> this evening, when asked about the likelihood of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> not making its current launch window. "We feel really good about it."
</p>
<p>
It's a busy year for Take-Two in general, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 on 11th February, Mafia: The Old Country in the summer, GTA 6 in autumn and Borderlands 4 before the year's end.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> has had a bit of a bumpy start on PC, but with a couple of emergency hot fixes now under its belt, developer Insomniac, alongside porting partner Nixxes, has released its first major patch - targeting reports of crashing, among other things.
</p>
<p>
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 made its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-recommended-specs-and-pc-features-detailed">long-awaited PC debut</a> last Thursday, but reports from frustrated players soon surfaced, highlighting significant crashing issues, bugs, and poor optimisation. It didn't take long for the game to amass a "mixed" rating on Steam as complaints continued piling in, and Insomniac <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-steam-hotfix-hopes-to-address-pc-ports-stability-woes">responded quickly with a series of hot fixes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, the studio has released its first full patch for Spider-Man 2, primarily targeting "several crash fixes based on feedback from [players] and our crash reporting system." There's more beyond that, however, with update v1.205.0.0 also implementing a backup system for autosaves, fixing a number of visual bugs related to DLSS Ray Reconstruction and raytracing, and addressing a range of UI related bugs.

<p>
Menu toggles have also been introduced for Film Style Animation and Comic SFX, and there are interface improvements intended to simplify starting New Game+. 
</p>
<p>
Insomniac acknowledges not all reported issues have been addressed in its first patch, but says it's "committed to improving your experience and [will] continue to work on regular updates with more bug fixes, improvements and performance optimisations."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell had good things to say about Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PlayStation 5, calling it "simple, familiar, and occasionally cluttered [but] still brilliant fun" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-review-1">his four star review</a>. Hopefully, Insomniac and Nixxes can resolve the PC version's current issues and give the game the port it deserves. For now, though, you'll find full patch notes below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Various crash fixes based on player feedback and data from our crash reporting system.</li>
<li>Improvements to crash reporting with screenshot support.</li>
<li>Film Style Animation and Comic SFX can now be toggled via Settings &gt; Game &gt; Camera.*</li>
<li>User interface improvements to simplify starting a New Game+</li>
<li>Implemented autosave backups. At key points in the story the game will create a backup of the autosave slot.</li>
<li>Added mouse scrolling to the manual load/save menu.</li>
<li>Various improvements and bug fixes to the user interface.</li>
<li>Reduced noise in character hair when using DLSS Ray Reconstruction.</li>
<li>Enemies webbed to surfaces no longer have a black background when using ray-traced shadows and ray-traced ambient occlusion.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug related to ray-traced reflections that could cause pixelation artefacts along water edges.</li>
<li>Settings for Subtitle Text Size, Closed Caption Text Size, Icon and Prompt Size and Audio Listening Mode are no longer synchronized between different devices.**</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*These options become available after obtaining the Across the Spider-Verse Suit. ** As a result of this change, these settings will be reset to their defaults after you install this update.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Looking to add a bunch of PC games to your Steam collection for cheap? Check out this month’s <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fplatinum-collection-build-your-own-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanaticals-new-platinum-collection-includes-the-gunk-afterimage-pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-and-more%2F1100-6529299%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Platinum Collection</a> at Fanatical. You’ll get to pick from a catalog of 21 games--and the more you buy, the cheaper they become. Best of all, every single game in the collection is offered as a Steam key, so you can easily add them to your library. As a bonus, you’ll also get a 5% off voucher for your next purchase. This edition of the Platinum bundle will be available until March 5.</p><p>Like other Build Your Own Bundle deals, the Platinum Collection offers multiple pricing tiers. Purchase <strong>three or more games to get each one for $3.33, five or more games for $3.00 each, and seven or more games for $2.86 each</strong>. In other words, you can pick up seven games for less than $21--and if you add all available games to your bundle, you'll pay just $60--making this an excellent time to pick up indie hits you may have missed over the past few years. </p><p>One of the highlights of this collection is The Gunk. Developed by the team responsible for the SteamWorld series, The Gunk is a 3D platformer that takes place on an overgrown jungle planet. You’ll be tasked with restoring nature as you eliminate the nasty gunk that’s slowly consuming the environment.</p><p>Other notable titles in the lineup include the 2D platformer Grapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines, the hilarious adventure game Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip, and the roguelike strategy game Tales &amp; Tactics. If you prefer metroidvanias, don’t miss out on Afterimage and Vernal Edge. The former looks stunning with its hand-drawn graphics, while the latter boasts fast-paced action with a deep combo and spell system. There's also the CRPG Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Enhanced Edition, which is similar to other sprawling, isometric RPGs like Baldur's Gate--but instead of using Dungeons &amp; Dragons as the baseline for its gameplay mechanics like Baldur's Gate does, it uses the Pathfinder 2E tabletop system instead.</p><p>Speaking of tabletop experiences adapted to video games, several digital board games are also on offer in the Platinum Collection, including hits like Root, Everdell, and Munchkin. Root is particularly notable, as its adorable characters are brought to life with a charming cartoon art style, and its many layers of complexity remain intact for this PC adaptation. </p><p>Check out all the games on offer in this month's Build Your Own Platinum Collection below, or head over to Fanatical to start customizing your bundle.

As of now, the second half of 2025 is a complete mystery as far as what else is coming out and when. Take-Two is one of those companies with a bunch of other games coming out this year. While <em>Civilization 7 </em>is out this month and <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> arrives sometime in the summer, <em>Borderlands 4</em> is also due out before the end of 2025. </p><p>It remains to be seen whether the popular loot shooter gets pushes out ahead of <em>GTA 6</em> or after, during the tail-end of the year. Whether <em>GTA 6</em> ultimately ends up getting delayed or not could end up being what decides that. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-says-nba-2k25-surpassed-player-spending-expectations/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Player spending in NBA 2K25 grew by a huge margin in the final months of 2025. So much so that it helped Take-Two Interactive meet their revenue forecast for the latest financial quarter.</p>



<p>According to Take-Two’s <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/quarterly-earnings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly earnings</a> for Q3 2025, the performance of NBA 2K25 “greatly surpassed” the company’s expectations. The report says that the “outstanding performance” of NBA 2K helped Take-Two reach the “guidance range,” or financial forecast, of the quarter. Essentially, Take-Two earned the amount of revenue from spending it predicted it would because of NBA 2K’s overperformance.</p>



<p>The statement reads that Recurrent Consumer Spending (RCS) in NBA 2K grew over 30 percent, attributed to “new features and innovation in our game modes.” In NBA 2K, this RCS metric includes virtual currency, in-game advertisements, and other in-game purchases. Overall, this helped Take-Two Interactive reach a 9% growth in RCS, despite only a 6% increase in mobile spending (below the company’s expectations), and a decline in GTA Online spending.</p>



<p>During this quarter, NBA 2K25 released a number of seasonal updates, including a patch in November that finally added Easy Anti-Cheat for PC users. Each seasonal update also came with a purchasable season pass for $10 or an upgraded “Hall of Fame” version of the pass for $20. Since release, NBA 2K25 has sold 7 million units.</p>



<p>While the overperformance of NBA 2K25 is certainly something Take-Two Interactive is happy about, it’s clear that the company is looking further down the line. In their earnings report they stated that 2025 could be the “strongest [year] ever” for the company. 2025 will see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-goes-gold-ahead-of-release/">the release of Civilization VII in just a few days</a>, followed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-mafia-the-old-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a> in summer, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fall-2025/">Grand Theft Auto 6 in the fall</a>, and Borderlands 4. The company is confident they will hit “record levels” of revenue in Fiscal Year 2026 and 2027.</p>

It lets you stream games from your PS5 over Wi-Fi. It's a solid choice for anyone who wants to play their PS5 games from other rooms in their home, or while someone else is using the TV, or even while away from home. The PS Portal can be used anywhere; you don't need to be on the same Wi-Fi network. If you have an internet connection, you can wake your PS5 from rest mode and stream your PlayStation games while traveling.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4440006-61twtfjqlol.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4440006" data-ratio="0.666796875" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4440006-61twtfjqlol.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4440006"></a><figcaption>PlayStation Portal</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4440006-61twtfjqlol.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A bunch more notable PS5 accessories that cost over $100 are also eligible for the deal, including the <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%2F%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fdualsense-edge-wireless-controller&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fps5-accessory-sale-how-to-save-20-on-playstation-portal-helldivers-2-dualsense-controller-and-more%2F1100-6529304%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DualSense Edge Controller</a></strong> (normally $200), the <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%2F%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fpulse-elite-wireless-headset-ps5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fps5-accessory-sale-how-to-save-20-on-playstation-portal-helldivers-2-dualsense-controller-and-more%2F1100-6529304%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pulse Elite Wireless Headset</a></strong> (normally $150), and <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fpulse-explore-wireless-earbuds-ps5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fps5-accessory-sale-how-to-save-20-on-playstation-portal-helldivers-2-dualsense-controller-and-more%2F1100-6529304%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pulse Explore Wireless Earbuds</a></strong> (normally $200).

But that time’s over. Rockstar announced that it would reveal the game’s first trailer on Tuesday, December 5th, 2023, at 6AM PT / 9AM ET. Unfortunately, an early leak prompted the company to release the trailer more than half a day earlier than planned, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">revealing <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will bring the series back to Vice City</a>, and it showed off a new protagonist, Lucia.</p><p>Though Rockstar Games has kept mum on what to expect from the next installment in the series, we do have a bit of an idea of what the game looks like thanks to a hacker leaking 90 videos’ worth of material. In 2022, Arion Kurtaj — a member of the Lapsus$ hacker ring — leaked the videos, and in 2023, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23842746/lapsus-member-uber-rockstar-games-hack">a London jury found him responsible for the act</a>.</p><p>There have also been unconfirmed reports of another, more recent <em>GTA VI</em> leak in the days before the trailer’s world premiere, showing off a bit of the game’s map <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-leaks-may-have-just-come-from-a-rockstar-employees-son">that allegedly came from a Rockstar employee’s kid</a>.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article"><div><p>GTA VI is still coming this fall.</p><div><blockquote><p>Looking ahead, this calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for Take-Two, as we plan to launch Sid Meier’s Civilization VII on February 11th, Mafia: The Old Country in the Summer, Grand Theft Auto VI in the Fall, and Borderlands 4.</p></blockquote></div><p>Take-Two also revealed that the over-a-decade-old <em>GTA V</em> has sold more than 210 million copies globally.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Mjc5MDg=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">Grand Theft Auto VI is launching in fall 2025</a></h2><div><p>In Take-Two’s <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/take-two-interactive-software-inc-reports-results-fourth-0">Q4 2024 earnings report</a>, the company stated when gamers can expect the next entry in the <em>GTA</em> series.

The trailer looks great, and good news: <em>Digital Foundry</em> is “inclined to believe” that the footage “is representative of the actual game,” <em>Digital Foundry’s</em> Richard Leadbetter writes in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-does-grand-theft-auto-6-deliver-the-generational-leap-we-were-hoping-for">a written analysis</a>.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>The GTA VI trailer is already breaking viewership records on YouTube.</p><p>Despite Rockstar <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23987993/gta-6-news-trailers-rockstar-games">releasing the <em>GTA VI</em> trailer early</a> following a leak, it still managed to rake in 72 million views and counting. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-has-smashed-through-60-million-youtube-views-in-12-hours/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a> points out this makes it the most-viewed non-music video on YouTube in the 24 hours following its release — a record <a href="https://gamerant.com/mrbeast-video-breaks-most-views-24-hours-record/">previously held by MrBeast</a>.</p><p>It’s also getting close to dethroning <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/24/entertainment/bts-youtube-record-dynamite-intl-scli/index.html">BTS’s “Dynamite” music video</a>, which currently holds the record for getting the most views on all of YouTube in 24 hours.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>GTA VI isn’t launching on PC.</p><p>Unfortunately, the absence of PC isn’t too surprising, given that the PC version of <em>GTA V</em> was released more than a year and a half after the game first came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pred-optic-texas-call-of-duty-league-retur/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On social media, the OpTic Gaming team revealed that Pred is making his way back into the OpTic Texas starting roster ahead of Major II of the CDL 2025 season. This news comes more than two months after Pred went on a hiatus from the team after struggling with a personal situation that was never clearly explained.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-return-of-the-pred">Return of the Pred</h2>



<p>Pred has returned to OpTic Texas, and Huke is now out in the open, with his future sitting in an unknown state.</p>



<p>Here’s what OpTic posted on socials to address that situation:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Thank you </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Huke" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Huke</a><span> for your dedication &amp; passion playing for OpTic.

We appreciate you always, best of luck.</span></p></article></div>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/huke-replacing-pred-in-optic-texas-starting-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Huke joined OpTic Texas</a> on December 11, joining the team and taking up a familiar mantle while Pred took a break from competing to deal with his mental health. He mentioned during a stream yesterday that his return wasn’t far off, and just one day later, he’s back on the team.</p>



<p>The return comes just as the Call of Duty League prepares to land in Texas for an OpTic-backed Major event.</p>



<p>Recently, OpTic Texas fell short at the Madrid Major, being kicked out of the elimination bracket by the Carolina Royal Ravens, who ultimately ended up going through to finish in fourth place.</p>



<p>The Major in Madrid was the first EU-based CDL tournament ever, and it was a boon for OverActive Media, the event’s host. The event saw 12,000 people attend – 80% of which came from <strong>outside </strong>Spain. The broadcast also picked up 250,000 peak viewers on platforms like YouTube.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see Pred back on OpTic Texas? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>
Take-Two recommitted to its release window as part of its <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4d81f3f6-cf24-44fa-892b-8ace44767349">Q3 FY 2025 earnings report</a>, writing, "This calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for [the company], as we plan to launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 on 11th February, Mafia: The Old Country in the summer, Grand Theft Auto 6 in the Fall, and Borderlands 4."

Take-Two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">announced an autumn 2025 release target</a> for GTA 6 last May, narrowing down what had previously only been a 2025 window at the time of the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">first trailer reveal</a>.

<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-may-slip-to-2026-as-development-has-reportedly-fallen-behind">report last March</a> suggested Rockstar had originally been targeting a "spring" 2025 release but that development had "fallen behind". An autumn launch was said to be more likely - just as 2K later announced - but it was claimed a 2026 release could happen as "fallback plan".
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-recommits-to-autumn-2025-launch-following-delay-rumour">later called the rumours unfounded</a>, and Take-Two has continued to stand by its autumn launch window, even if it still hasn't quite got as far as revealing the release date the entire games industry is waiting for.</p>
<p>
Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has acknowledged the mounting anticipation around GTA6 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">in an interview with IGN</a>. "I think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally," he said. "We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organisation is super excited."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rockstar Games has once again reconfirmed that Grand Theft Auto 6 will launch in 2025, despite the lack of a new trailer.</p>



<p>The announcement was made during <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take-Two Interactive’s quarterly earnings</a> for Q3 2025.</p>



<p>“Looking ahead, this calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for Take-Two, as we plan to launch…Grand Theft Auto VI in the Fall,” it read.</p>



<p>The news may come somewhat as a surprise to some readers, as online discourse for the past few months has led most to believe that the game will undoubtedly be delayed due to the lack of updates.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, GTA 6 has not received its second trailer, with the first being released in December 2023. From trailer one to trailer 2, it’s now the longest time between trailers seen for a Rockstar Games titles.</p>



<p>That being said, Rockstar Games and take-Two Interactive seemingly are in no rush as the games reveal trailer broke several YouTube records, including, Most Viewed Video Game Reveal on YouTube in 24 Hours,’ ‘Most Viewed YouTube Video in 24 Hours,’ and ‘Most Liked Video Game Trailer on YouTube in 24 Hours’.</p>



<p>In short, Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar Games are confidence that no matter when the next GTA 6 trailer releases, it’s going to do big numbers and with a staked lineup for Take-Two releases this year, they might be thinking that focusing the spotlight on other games for the time being makes the most sense.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to GTA 6? And do you think it will actually release in 2025? </p>

                <p>Rockstar's highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI remains on schedule to launch in Fall 2025, parent company Take-Two announced as part of its earnings briefing today. Some expected Rockstar to announce a delay given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">Rockstar's history of delaying its big games</a>, but it did not happen.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said there is "always a risk of slippage," but he feels "really good" about the game making it out on time in Fall 2025.</p><p>"Look, I think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally," he said. "We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organization is super excited."</p><p>Separately, Zelnick told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/gta-6-fall-2025-release-take-two-earnings-1236299292/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, "We've announced a pretty narrow window [for GTA 6]. So I think our view is that right now, that's fine. And then when it’s appropriate, of course, Rockstar is going to have more to say."</p><p>Take-Two's share price is surging following the announcement of earnings, growing by more than 7%. This may also be related to Take-Two beating earnings projections, suggesting positive financial health. </p><p>GTA VI has extremely big shoes to fill, as GTA V has now sold more than 210 million units, propelling the entire series to 440 million copies sold.
