            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-steam-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infold Games has announced that an <i>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</i>Steam release is on the way, so you're in luck if you've been wanting to add the cozy open-world adventure to your library on Valve's app.</p>

<p>In a press release, Infold confirms that the game, which has attracted more than 20 million downloads since launching in December, will support cross-progression, so you'll be able to pick up where you left off on Steam.</p>

<p>It does sound like that feature will require an Infold Games account, though, so if you were hoping to check out&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>on Steam without signing up to another third-party account, it looks like you'll be out of luck.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-balloons.jpg?itok=PHDGykfy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-balloons.jpg?itok=KjRwbbsJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is floating its way onto Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only will&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>be available on Steam, but it'll also boast "the full range of features unique to the platform", according to Infold Games. That means widespread controller support, Steam achievements, and "social integration".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1890262857750905235" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on X, Infold says that each <em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Steam wishlist milestone it reaches will result in more rewards for players. Getting 10,000 wishlists will grant players some "live wallpaper", while hitting 50,000 will reveal some new concept art.</p>

<p>At 100,000 wishlists, Infold will reveal "more surprises", while 200,000 wishlists will result in "the final surprise" being granted to players. That sounds pretty ominous, but given&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>'s cozy vibes and cutesy aesthetic, I'm sure it'll be something light-hearted.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-wishlists.jpg?itok=CNySqrzm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-wishlists.jpg?itok=AbpvQSXJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wishlisting&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>on Steam could lead to something good.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, it's an open-world adventure that emphasizes platforming, minigames, and general cozy vibes rather than action-packed setpieces or tense combat.</p>

<p>The game sees Nikki and her companion Momo exploring the world of Miraland, and while there is a story (and it's got some pretty high stakes at that), the focus here is much more on enjoying the game however you want to.</p>

<p>Since release,&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has proven pretty popular, attracting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-downloads-10m" rel="nofollow">over 10 million downloads in just a few days</a>. Two major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-1-1" rel="nofollow">updates</a> have been released for the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-12-release-date" rel="nofollow">so far</a>, bringing new outfits, story content, and more.</p>

<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is available now on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164330/Infinity_Nikki/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam right here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Sometimes it's nice when city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builders</a> look like stratospheric views of actual cities, and sometimes it's nicer when they look like a collection of animated postage stamps. Behold <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dawnfolk">Dawnfolk</a> - a pixelart fantasy town grower packed full of minigames that describes itself as "charmingly dark and minimalist", much like a potential hook-up on some highbrow dating service. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The premise is that you're running a tile-based kingdom lost to malevolent shadows. Fortunately, you've got a fireball friend called Lueur who can light up tiles for you, providing you keep it topped up by producing glowdust. Upon these liberated tiles you shall grow crops, breed animals and build things like taverns, temples and sawmills. It's all very trim and tidy, as I've just learned from the Steam demo - perhaps a bit too trim and tidy. Here's a trailer.

"Not everyone has time to invest hundreds of hours into learning how to play a grand strategy game," comments the Steam page. Oh my word! "You can dive right in and start building your settlement immediately, going from a handful of tents to a big city in less than an hour," it continues. Stop! Stop! My mouth can only produce so much drool!</p>
<p>The price of such convenience, naturally, is that this isn't massively elaborate by city-builder standards. It feels like more of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> puzzle boardgame, with adjacency bonuses shaping your choice of buildings in addition to the need for certain resources. 
</p>
<p>
Still, there's a pleasant liveliness to this murky world. Tiles burble with marketplace chatter, animal noises, and the like. There's also a military component, with Orc camps to flatten, and irregular battles with the aforesaid malevolent shadows. This takes the form of a minigame, nested within the tile at stake, where you angle a sword towards threats.
</p>
<p>
I can live without a lot of Dawnfolk's minigames. While the idea of a Warioware company town is fun, the ones I've sampled were rather perfunctory and unimaginative - sliding a bow and arrow around to shoot deer for a few seconds when harvesting meat, for example. Still, Dawnfolk has the makings of a sweet diversion between rounds of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/farthest-frontier">Farthest Frontier</a>. It's out now and the demo is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308630/Dawnfolk/">still live on Steam</a>.

The team behind the co-op game has now released a roadmap for upcoming fixes and new content drops, however, and says it has “no regrets” about soft-launching the game when it did. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196663" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="429" data-playlist="196663,196086,195189" data-current="196663"><div><p>The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22220.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> “There is no amount of time you can spend in isolation that will make the game great,” lead producer at Heart Machine, Michael Clark, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/despite-a-teamwide-oops-guess-we-made-it-too-hard-moment-hyper-light-breaker-has-no-regrets-about-its-mixed-response-early-access-launch-and-now-its-got-a-roadmap-so-everyone-can-git-gud/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/despite-a-teamwide-oops-guess-we-made-it-too-hard-moment-hyper-light-breaker-has-no-regrets-about-its-mixed-response-early-access-launch-and-now-its-got-a-roadmap-so-everyone-can-git-gud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> this week. “You get the best version of a game by maximizing the amount of feedback-and-iteration loops you can go through, and Early Access is the way to do that for a title like this.”</p><figure id="" data-id="c672bcbd2a80495d6a52d47fec2daea9" data-recommend-id="image://c672bcbd2a80495d6a52d47fec2daea9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Hyper Light Breaker's roadmap.

If Heart Machine does deliver on its latest promises, <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> could become the game fans of the studio were hoping to play in just a few months. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rockstar has yet to confirm a GTA 6 PC release date; however, Corsair’s CEO believes the game could arrive for the platform in early 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corsair’s CEO, Andy Paul, recently mentioned GTA 6’s PC release window during the company’s <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757670-corsair-gaming-inc-crsr-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2024 Q4 earnings call</a>. The developer first spoke about how enthusiasts are “lining up” to purchase components to support the newly released Blackwell 50 series GPUs. Their “gaming business has never looked so strong”, with GTA 6, “the most anticipated and hardware-demanding game”, on the horizon.</p>



<p>Paul then discussed GTA 6’s PC release window, stating that, according to his understanding, “it’s going to come out in the fall for console, and then early ’26 for PC.”&nbsp;The CEO mentioned this release window when asked if GTA 6 would be a game that could “spur purchases of either peripherals or components.”</p>



<p>Take-Two’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke about</a> GTA 6 not coming to PC, stating that it will first be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S and then branch out to other platforms. However, Zelnick added that he’s observed the PC platform become a “more and more important part of what used to be a console business.” He understands how big the market is, stating that PC versions of games can “result in up to 40% of a game’s total sales.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, GTA 6’s release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-release-may-not-be-the-end-for-gta-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may not be the end</a> of GTA online. Also, the publisher is ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-publisher-is-not-worried-about-the-game-influencing-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not worried</a>’ about the upcoming game influencing violence in the real world. Do you think Corsair’s CEO is right about GTA 6 arriving for PC in early 2026?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fantasy-life-i-release-date-confirmed-for-may-additional-platforms-revealed.1109583/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Level-5 has announced the&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>release date, with the long-awaited JRPG landing not only on Switch but also on other platforms in May.</p>

<p>That's right: after numerous delays,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>finally has a concrete release date, and it's May 21st. Not only that, but the game will be arriving across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox as well as Switch.</p>

<p><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>was first revealed during a February <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/february-2023-nintendo-direct-here-are-all-news-announcements" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Direct presentation</a>, at which point it was given a release window of 2023. That release window later proved to be overly optimistic, though, as in November of that year, Level-5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed the game to 2024</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-release-date-dragon-characters.jpg?itok=64Wg7ErB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-release-date-dragon-characters.jpg?itok=kKa7QJEQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually, a release date of October 10th was settled on for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, but it was then announced that the game wouldn't make that date either, with Level-5 delaying its "slow life" RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">indefinitely in August last year</a>.</p>

<p>Now, however, Level-5 has announced a release date for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, and it looks like the studio is serious about this one, although there's every chance it'll be delayed again before May 21st rolls around.</p>

<p>The release date was revealed as part of a brand new features trailer for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, showing off the things you can do in the game. If you're a fan of the original 3DS&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life</em>, then it's likely you'll find a lot to like here as well.</p>

<p>Not only can you adventure across a "vast open world" and choose which one of a variety of jobs you want to pursue, but you can also create and maintain your own island, delve into "endless dungeons", and even play the game in split-screen co-op.</p>




<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10013482/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/FANTASY-LIFE-i-The-Girl-Who-Steals-Time-2339978.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on May 21st (assuming it doesn't get delayed again). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-cost-cutting-q3</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-pledges-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-tough-third-quarter.1109580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-cost-cutting-q3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed that it plans to implement yet more cost-cutting measures into the next financial year in order to exceed its cost reduction targets "by a significant margin".</p>

<p>In its latest financial <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2GbdOQTUuRZV3mqGXgTfeK/520f2262c4f60b4bc13f0f3a59ec37e7/Ubisoft_FY25_Q3_PR_English_vFinal.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which covers the period between October and December 2024), Ubisoft reveals that its "net bookings" - essentially net sales sans fees and other cancellations - fell by 34.8% when compared to the same period last year.</p>

<p>The company points to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">cancellation of first-person shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>and the closure of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">three</a> Ubisoft locations as major cost reduction initiatives, and CEO Yves Guillemot says Ubisoft isn't done yet, although he doesn't clarify exactly what's coming next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-finances-cost-cutting-xdefiant.jpg?itok=6spiOGKj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-finances-cost-cutting-xdefiant.jpg?itok=bhcu7Nf7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft canned first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>in December.</figcaption></figure><p>Guillemot says that Ubisoft "plan[s] to pursue [its] efforts" with regards to cost-cutting measures into the 2025-26 financial year, "going beyond the initial target by a significant margin".</p>

<p>It's not entirely clear what he means by that, but given that previous cost-cutting measures have involved layoffs and studio closures, it's not unlikely that we'll see more of that kind of thing in the year to come.</p>

<p>He also says that the "formal review process of [Ubisoft's] strategic options" is ongoing, with a view to "unlock[ing] the best value from our assets for our stakeholders" and fostering the "best conditions to create great games in a fast-evolving market".</p>

<p>For context, a Ubisoft shareholder <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">called for "strategic and structural change"</a> at the company back in September, reportedly prompting Guillemot and major stakeholder Tencent to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">consider taking the company private</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-snow.jpg?itok=We_M_-tE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-snow.jpg?itok=y0jZGoJS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is probably banking on&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>to do well.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to Ubisoft's future, Guillemot says the company is "fully focused on the upcoming launch of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">on March 20th</a>", echoing the studio's comment when approached about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">rumors of Saudi-funded&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC</a>.</p>

<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-says-the-plan-is-to-focus-on-open-world-and-live-service-games-year-after-year/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, during a followup Q&amp;A session, Guillemot told investors that Ubisoft is committed to "open-world action adventure" games and "game as a service-native experiences" for the foreseeable future, so if you were hoping for a&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>sequel, you may well be disappointed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/612715/elden-ring-nightreign-game-director-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>My <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">first time playing <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, I was stressed the hell out. My team and I were in an underground dungeon, trying to make our way past traps and dangerous blind corners, all while knowing there was an invisible clock ominously ticking down above our heads. If we were still underground when it hit zero a deadly storm called Night’s Tide would close in, potentially trapping us. That kind of anxiety was exactly what <em>Elden Ring</em> combat designer and <em>Nightreign</em>’s game director Junya Ishizaki had in mind.</p><p>Speaking with Ishizaki after my time with the game, I was surprised to learn one of the main inspirations for <em>Nightreign</em> – a co-op focused PvE action game – was the board game <em>Pandemic</em>. Ishizaki said that one of the things he enjoyed about <em>Pandemic</em>, which he later incorporated into <em>Nightreign</em>, was the idea of playing under pressure. “When you come up against these seemingly insurmountable odds, it’s up to the player to choose how to use their time in order to overcome the seemingly impossible challenge,” he explained.</p><p>The tension between whether to continue through the dungeon as the HP-draining Night’s Tide storm slowly closed in, or to cut bait and run, was one of the most satisfying feelings I had during the hands-on. But I also felt another, far less pleasing type of tension – the one between me and my companions. I was scared I wouldn’t be able to hold my own against bosses or that a decision I made would turn out to be a waste of precious time. Since I play FromSoftware games as a strictly solo enterprise, that anxiety was new to me. But according to Ishizaki, that anxiety is also part of the plan.</p><p>He explained that the development team’s approach to <em>Nightreign</em> was a desire to incorporate elements learned from <em>Elden Ring</em> reconfigured into a new experience. Since FromSoftware is known for games with punishing combat, they focused their ideas on revamping the combat system including tweaking the number of combatants. “One of the ways we could make [combat] really exciting and interesting was having co-op be the main focus, and having players have to work together,” Ishizaki said. </p><p>This approach was interesting because one of the things many people enjoyed about <em>Elden Ring</em> was that it’s a very solitary and lonesome game. It’s also a difficult one. You are subject to violent death over and over and it’s powerfully satisfying when you’re able to take what you learned from those deaths to beat a tough encounter. But the goal of <em>Nightreign</em> isn’t to replicate the experience of <em>Elden Ring</em> with a multiplayer modifier: it’s to make something fundamentally new.</p><p>“We wanted to break from this feeling of loneliness and isolation and overcoming things on your own.” Ishizaki said. Since the team wanted to make <em>Nightreign</em> feel fresh and exciting that meant doing away with the creature comforts players expect from <em>Elden Ring</em>. </p><p>“Part of that means working together,” he said. So while my two favorite aspects of <em>Elden Ring</em> are totally absent in <em>Nightreign</em>, I don’t feel alienated by the game. The good internal tension I experience as a solo player is replaced by an external tension – learning to work together in a group – that I could learn to love once I get my hands on the full game.</p><p>But Ishizaki understands that there still might be other players who look at <em>Nightreign</em> and can’t get past the game’s frenetic multiplayer focus. “Existing fans may seem quite bewildered at first when it comes to <em>Nightreign</em>,” he said. “But we feel like once players get it in their hands and actually start playing, it’s actually not too big of a hurdle to overcome.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"Work is ongoing to restore server functionality. Further updates will be provided.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/14/is-this-seat-taken-preview-a-cosy-puzzler-that-plays-with-the-stress-of-human-interaction/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-this-seat-taken-preview-%E2%80%93-a-cosy-puzzler-that-plays-with-the-stress-of-human-interaction.1109538/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/14/is-this-seat-taken-preview-a-cosy-puzzler-that-plays-with-the-stress-of-human-interaction/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sometimes, a game can live rent-free in your head, despite never having played it. That’s been “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/is-this-seat-taken-is-a-polite-and-cosy-puzzler-where-you-have-to-consider-other-peoples-feelings/">Is This Seat Taken?</a>” for me. Announced just a couple short weeks ago, I’ve watched the trailer a bunch of times, forced other people to watch it a bunch of times, and even taken it upon myself to force my phone on acquaintances to watch it a bunch more. So, it might have caught my attention. Is This Seat Taken? is a puzzler built around the idea that people don’t like sitting next to most other people. You have to balance the needs of everyone, despite the fact that they smell, they’re messy, and hell, they might pull their phone out and make you watch random game trailers. The monsters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Is This Seat Taken? Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5Nw0qzomec?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Each level of Is This Seat Taken? presents you with a setting, and then a batch of people you need to place within it. The first level is a taxi, getting you used to dragging and dropping your little folks onto the available seats, while their desire card pops up at the bottom of the screen.</p>


<p>Things start out simple enough – Jordi wants a window seat, when there’s two available, and Aurora prefers to sit alone, so she can sit on the other end of the row. They’re both very reasonable about it too, and there’s no pushing or shoving which tells you this must be a fantasy world.</p>


<p>Then you find yourself dealing with a limousine. Suddenly, there’s five people to deal with, the seats all face different directions, and each person has two needs rather than one. After various roles in hospitality, I’m all about making customers happy, but I’m already sweating the details. Given that you’re essentially doing this for reviews or likes – a thumbs up shows you’ve picked a good seat – I’m now beginning to worry about being reviewed on SeatAdvisor. This isn’t supposed to be stressful is it?</p>
<p>Juggling the different needs of each person becomes increasingly tricky, and through the demo you find the numbers of people you’re dealing with steadily increase. A bus journey proves really interesting, with people getting on and off, and a bunch of new needs like wanting to sleep or – the horror – wanting to play loud music. I mean, there should be an option to forcibly eject those people at the bus stop, but anyway.</p>
<p>There’s little snippets of storyline woven into some of the scenes, with indie movie director Alexis helping their actor friend Nat to feel at ease, while we learn all about Hat Wars fandom, where the movies are great but the fans are awful. It seems as though Is This Seat Taken? has an awful lot to say about the world, despite being a game about little shape people being polite and sitting in the right seats. It’s a great combination.</p>

<p>Despite the complicated human interactions, Is this seat taken? is a joyful and upbeat game. The laidback tunes help to ease the trickier puzzle moments, and you’re helped along the way by the changing expressions of each sitter, telling you whether they’re content or not.</p>
<p>You can check out Is This Seat Taken for yourself right now, with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/">demo available to download on Steam</a>, ahead of its release on PC and mobile later this year.</p>

<p>After hearing Take-Two CEO’s recent comments on supporting “legacy titles”, GTA Online may have a chance at survival even after GTA 6 arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two’s CEO, was recently asked why players should keep investing in GTA Online in 2025 when an improved and enhanced version could arrive with GTA 6. Zelnick didn’t mention GTA Online or an online version of GTA 6 specifically; however, his answer provides some hope to the massive community.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Zelnick stated that his statements are theoretic, as he can’t mention a particular project (GTA 6 Online) “when an announcement hasn’t been made.” However, he added that Take-Two is known for its support properties if the community is still involved with the games.</p><p>&nbsp;As an example, he explained that 2K released NBA 2K Online in China in 2012, and soon after, a new version called NBA 2K Online 2 was released in China in 2017. However, even after the latest version arrived, the company didn’t sunset the first online game, and they are both still available in the market. The CEO concluded, stating, “We’ve shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>GTA Online is one of the most popular multiplayer games, bringing in over 150,000 players daily on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/271590/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam alone</a>. The online version of GTA 5 has been available for more than 10 years now, and players have gathered a considerable amount of wealth and assets in the game by investing a lot of time and sometimes a lot of real-world money. Take-Two and Rockstar have earned a lot through GTA Online, and with a community so big, there might be a chance that the game survives even after GTA 6 arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the GTA 6 publisher is ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-publisher-is-not-worried-about-the-game-influencing-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not worried</a>’ about the game influencing violence in the real world. Also, Take-Two’s CEO recently spoke about GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not coming to PC at launch</a>. Do you want GTA Online to survive even after GTA 6 releases?

    <p><span>Rescue lives, unveil the truth behind the catastrophe, and reignite hope with the Coreflame.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.1 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Light Slips the Gate, Shadow Greets the Throne,” will launch on February 26, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [185 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-944235"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this update, Trailblazers and their companions will forge ahead on the grand Flame-Chase Journey, venturing into uncharted territories and embracing a tapestry of thrilling events. Adding brilliance to the adventure are two new playable characters, Tribbie and Mydei, each weaving their unique threads into the ever-unfolding saga.</p><p>In the previous chapter, Nikador’s Coreflame was successfully reclaimed. Yet, the Flame-Chase Journey remains a race against time. With this pivotal milestone achieved, preparations for the next step are already underway. In Version 3.1, the Trailblazer will take on the role of a messenger, embarking alongside their companions to a brand-new map, “Grove of Epiphany,” where the journey continues with renewed purpose.</p><p>The Grove of Epiphany, a revered city-state honoring Cerces, the Reason Titan, stands as Amphoreus’ cradle of knowledge and maintains strong ties with Okhema. Known for its vital academic contributions to the Flame-Chase Journey, the Grove has long provided critical research on the black tide and Titans, serving as a beacon of enlightenment and progress. Cerces, like Kephale, harbors goodwill toward humanity and, with boundless generosity, transformed the Grove into a sanctuary for knowledge seekers, offering rest, study, and the wisdom of the world to mortals once shrouded in ignorance. However, this haven of learning has recently fallen to the black tide’s assault. Amidst the ensuing chaos, a shadowy foe has emerged, seeking to claim Cerces’ Coreflame for their own. In the Version 3.1 Trailblaze Mission, Trailblazers must rise to the challenge, rescuing survivors, uncovering truths about the catastrophe, and reclaiming Cerces’ Coreflame to restore hope to Okhema.</p><p>Moreover, in Version 3.1’s Main Story, Trailblazers will harness the power of Oronyx to awaken echoes of the past, leading them to a new map where the “Abyss of Fate,” once known as “Janusopolis,” stands in its Day State. Along the way, they will uncover long-buried secrets from the “Era Chrysea,” gradually unveiling the mysterious past of Tribbie, the latest 5-star playable character.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

As a 5-star Imaginary character following the Path of Destruction, in battle, Mydei fully utilizes his undying nature to fight the enemies. With a mass of Max HP, he can consume HP to charge, and then enter an enhanced form. When enhanced, Mydei automatically strikes enemies in his turn, dealing greater DMG and showcasing the might of the crown prince in Castrum Kremnos.Additionally, the limited 5-star characters Yunli and Huohuo will have their return in the first and second halves of the Version 3.1 warp event, respectively. Their formidable assistance makes them invaluable allies for your future journeys.In addition to new characters and storylines, Version 3.1 brings an array of exciting events. One highlight is the new season of Divergent Universe, which introduces a brand-new research topic centered on Amphoreus. This time, battles will feature the innovative "Day and Night System," where combat alternates between day and night. Each state provides unique boosts, while transitions between them trigger additional effects. Furthermore, the Day and Night System, along with its associated Blessings, is deeply connected to the Titans and the Chrysos Heirs, adding layers of strategy and lore to the experience. Additionally, Trailblazers will take part in The Awooo Firm event, where players step into the role of manager to assist the chimera squad in Okhema.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-31-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.1, with the latest update for the spacefaring turn-based gacha RPG set to land later this month.</p>

<p>Titled "Light Slips the Gate, Shadow Greets the Throne" in typical grandiose HoYoverse style, Version 3.1 will arrive on February 26th and will bring a brand new map to explore, plus two new 5-star characters to use and more.</p>

<p>First up, Version 3.1 will let you explore the Grove of Epiphany, a city-state under attack by a "shadowy foe" looking to claim its Titan's Coreflame for its own. The Trailblaze Mission for this update will see you investigating what's happening in the Grove and reclaiming the Coreflame.</p>

<p>The first is Tribbie, a transformed version of the demigod Tribbios. HoYoverse says she deliberately split herself into "thousands of Messengers" using the Century Gate, and now, she can join your party.</p>

<p>She can buff your team and debuff enemies to help your party deal more damage, so she's a valuable combatant to have if you need an extra edge in combat.</p>

<p>Your second new fighter in Version 3.1 is Mydei, a "warrior as valiant as a lion" who consumes HP to deal extra damage. Reruns for Yunli and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-five-star-character-huohuo" rel="nofollow">Huohuo</a> will also appear in the first and second halves of the Version 3.1 event cycle.</p>




<p>You can also look forward to a new season of Divergent Universe in which battles will be split between day and night, introducing unique effects for both times of day. That's alongside the usual gameplay fixes and miscellaneous quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 3.1 launches across all platforms on February 26th.</p>

            <p>Renowned actress Laura Bailey portrayed deuteragonist Abby Anderson in The Last of Us Part 2, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> almost didn't cast her because "she's in everything".</p>
<p>That's coming from The Last of Us creator and Naughty Dog exec Neil Druckmann himself. Druckmann was chatting with Santa Monica Studio's creative director Cory Barlog during a panel at DICE this week, where he said he was "sure it was going to be a different actor" when he was watching the auditions live (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/neil-druckmann-wasnt-going-to-cast-laura-bailey-in-the-last-of-us-part-2-because-shes-in-everything-but-changed-his-mind-after-studying-her-audition-frame-by-frame/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>Even the studio more generally thought Bailey wouldn't be right for the role as Abby, as she had already been in so many other games, including Naughty Dog's own Uncharted series.</p>

</figure>
<p>However, and as we all know, the team changed its mind. Druckmann said the tipping point came after studying the audition videos "frame-by-frame", and noticing a moment of "vulnerability" in Bailey's audition that others hadn't shown. Druckmann then showed this moment to the wider Naughty Dog team, convincing them that Bailey was the right choice for Abby.</p>
<p>Bailey went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2020-live-report">win the Best Performance accolade at the 2020 Game Awards for her portrayal of Abby</a>.</p>
<p>For her role, Bailey received inexcusable online abuse, which didn't just threaten her life, but that of her baby son's as well. During a behind-the-scenes documentary about the game last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-abby-actor-reveals-online-abuse-didnt-just-threaten-her-life-but-her-baby-son-too">Bailey confirmed that the "real hardcore death threats" were so concerning</a>, they were passed on to police.</p>
<p>Kaitlyn Dever, who is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-twos-abby-isnt-as-muscular-as-part-2s-because-it-doesnt-play-as-big-of-a-role-in-this-version">set to portray Abby in the second season of HBO's The Last of Us</a> adaptation, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/abby-actress-kaitlyn-dever-protected-by-extra-security-while-filming-the-last-of-us-season-two">required extra security during filming for her own protection</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Warhorse Studios has <a href="https://x.com/KingdomComeRPG/status/1889706030226956469/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> the imminent launch of official mod support for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. The developer also revealed that it will be implemented through Steamworks rather than other options like Mod.io. As such, you should be able to download mods directly through Steam Workshop.</p>
<p>This will, of course, be in addition to all the regular mods that have been released and will continue to be released via platforms like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods?BH=7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-mod-roundup-unlimited-saving-and-increased-convenience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> some of the convenience mods last week, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-4k-skins-mod-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4K skin mod</a>, but there's a lot more you can find there. There are 412 Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 mods on Nexus, 291 of which were released in the last seven days. With the official mod integration, the community will have even greater incentives to continue improving, tweaking, and enhancing the game. Presumably, official mod tools will be released, too, although that was not explicitly confirmed at this point.</p>
<p>Warhorse's Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was a resounding success on all accounts. Commercially, it has already recouped costs and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold over a million units</a>. Critically, it stands at 88 average score on Metacritic. This includes our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10/10 score from Chris Wray</a>:</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>
<p>The release of official mod support won't be the end of Warhorse's work for this game. The Czech studio has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> its 2025 roadmap, announcing a free update for Spring (bringing barber, horse racing, and Hardcore mode), the Brushes With Death DLC for Summer, the Legacy of the Forge DLC for Autumn, and the Mysteria Ecclesiae DLC for Winter.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-and-first-major-update-revealed.1109490/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-first-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Heart Machine and publisher Arc Games have revealed the first major Early Access roadmap for action-adventure roguelike&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, as well as what's coming as part of the game's first big update next week.</p>

<p>The game launched last month to mixed player reviews on Steam, with players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">criticizing performance and accessibility issues</a> as well as some of the game's design.</p>

<p>As you can probably guess, the first big update in February, which lands on the 18th, aims to address some of those problems, promising rebalancing for combat and gear as well as "performance updates" and bug fixes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-fight.jpg?itok=oiZfF5AO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-fight.jpg?itok=tESpoMn1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s first roadmap is aiming to address some of its most common sticking points.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as these fixes and rebalancing efforts, the February monthly update will also bring a new player character, new holobytes, and new enemies to fight, plus new affixes to experiment with.</p>

<p>Another monthly update will arrive in March, and it'll bring plenty of new stuff; new enemies and a new assassin are on the way, plus more performance updates and more rebalancing.</p>

<p>Following that, a significant new update is coming in April, and this one's big enough to get its own name. The Buried Below update continues the previous two updates' efforts with regards to rebalancing and bug fixing, but it also brings new areas, another new player character, and "improved onboarding".</p>

<p>There's plenty more coming before the game's 1.0 launch as well, although that launch still doesn't have a release date. You can see the full&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>Early Access roadmap right here.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castle-crashers">Castle Crashers</a>' has revealed more details of its first DLC for 13 years, and while we don't yet have a firm release date, we do have a window: summer (Q3) 2025.</p>
<p>Last summer - 12 years after it first arrived on Steam, and 16 years after it debuted on Xbox Live Arcade - Castle Crashers announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/castle-crashers-is-getting-new-dlc-16-years-after-it-first-released">getting new DLC on Steam</a> (and only Steam - sorry, Xbox players).</p>
<p>Premium DLC Painter Boss Paradise not only includes new player and weapon artwork for all official characters and new character Paint Junior, but it also adds Steam workshop functionality, so players can create and share their own skins "with the world".</p>

<p>"After 16 years, when it came time to give Castle Crashers some more love, I started by drawing brand new knights," explained Dan Paladin, co-founder and art director at The Behemoth.</p>
<p>"I was able to do this fairly quickly and thought, 'Why shouldn't everyone have the ability to do this?', so - BOOM - the Painter Boss gave us all a perfect opportunity to make a natural shift to creating. People have wanted new characters so often - this allows the whole community to finally share more than we could ever give them!"</p>
<p>Although Castle Crashers debuted on Xbox and is still available on Sony consoles and Nintendo Switch, the $4 DLC (regional pricing is still to be confirmed) is only coming to Steam. You can wishlist it now.</p>
<p>"Much like The Behemoth's last Live Arcade effort, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alien-hominid">Alien Hominid</a> HD, this is a resolutely old-fashioned side-scroller," Dan Whitehead wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/castle-crashers-review">Eurogamer's Castle Crashers review</a>, waaaaay back in 2008.</p>
<p>"Where it differs is in a much less brutal learning curve, a vastly increased amount of peripheral stuff to play with and a generally more rounded gaming experience."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 2.30pm UK:</strong> FromSoftware has apologised for the failure of the network test and is considering additional sessions.</p>

<p>As a result, it's "considering" holding an additional test. A similar post was shared on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> account.</p> <div>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 12.30pm UK:</strong> The first network test for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has suffered server issues and is unplayable.</p>
<p>The online co-op spin-off has a number of three hour long sessions over the course of the weekend, with the first meant to be from 11am - 2pm UK time today. However, server issues have meant players haven't been able to get past the initial menu.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1890375131463082321">FromSoftware Player Support</a> has shared a number of messages, noting the server is "congested" before it restarted the server to solve the issue.</p>

<p>It's unclear how long it will take for servers to be reset, or if the remaining sessions will also be affected. After all, this is a network test - and the servers have clearly been tested.</p>
<p>I've contacted Bandai Namco for further details.</p>
<p>Myself, Eurogamer's Ian Higton and IGN's Jesse Gomez were planning to stream the game but have cancelled due to the server issues.</p>
<p>Players have been sharing their experience on social media and calling for FromSoftware to extend the sessions.</p>
<p>This was my view for over an hour of trying:</p>

<p>The test will continue over the weekend for those who registered, we have all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-beta-test-dates-times-register">details of Nightreign session times</a>.</p>

<p>"As it stands, though, Nightreign provides a delectable hit of Elden Ring in a repeatable microcosm," I wrote. "It's got the difficulty, the levelling, the boss battles, and the sense of discovery, but all at high speed for a new type of challenge, while its grim enemy selection is like a best-of Souls mixtape I'm itching to replay."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
