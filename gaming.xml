              <p>A British trade union group is accusing Rockstar Games of union busting after it reportedly fired over 30 employees across offices in the UK and Canada. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-vi-new-trailer-destiny-renegades-clair-obscur-1851779967"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> maker</a> denies the charges, however, claiming the people were terminated for “gross misconduct.”</p> <p>“Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry,” Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) president Alex Marshall said in a statement, first reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTkzOTg3MSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyNTQ0NjcxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNTBISEpHUFFRNkMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.9NYooKXrBMU_quRYMOSw6uACDogcIuS-E27t4GD8f2g">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. “This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry.”</p>

 <p>But Rockstar parent company Take-Two claims that’s not the case. “We strive to make the world’s best entertainment properties by giving our best-in-class creative teams positive work environments and ongoing career opportunities,” a spokesperson for the company said in an email to&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “Our culture is focused on teamwork, excellence, and kindness. Rockstar Games terminated a small number of individuals for gross misconduct, and for no other reason. As always, we fully support Rockstar’s ambitions and approach.”</p>

 <p>According to Marshall, the only people fired from Rockstar were all members of a private trade union chat group on Discord who had either signed up for IWGB membership or were thinking of doing so. While the studio is made up of thousands of employees and headquartered in New York, the biggest office is Rockstar North located in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p> <p>Best known for the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> franchises, the studio is currently working to ship <em>GTA 6</em> after its 2025 launch was <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860">delayed earlier this year</a>. It’s now set to arrive in May 2026. While Rockstar Games had <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466">a notorious history of crunching during development</a>, the company has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/gta-6-release-date-rockstar-cleans-up-image-after-employee-backlash">reportedly made big strides</a> in recent years in improving its work culture. A controversial return-to-office policy, however, <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-rockstar-games-return-office-1851297508">showed there are still tensions</a> between developers and management at the studio.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/free-horror-games-halloween-bundle-cheap-discount-2000640518</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Humble Bundle deals can be hard to beat and the latest is no exception. The Indie Fears bundle features over a dozen games for less than $20, including some instant classics like last year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><em>Mouthwashing</em></a> and the more often <a href="https://x.com/PATALOON/status/1950454460225872347">overlooked <em>Threshold</em></a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/indie-fears-bundle?hmb_source=&amp;hmb_medium=product_tile&amp;hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_1_c_indiefearsbundle_bundle">Pay at least $13</a> (or more if you want to donate something extra to the Special Effect charity for helping gamers with disabilities) and you’ll unlock PC codes for 13 games. In addition to the sci-fi mystery about crewmates stranded in space and the atmospheric horror game about an attendant at a train station in the mountains, the bundle also gets you <em>Buckshot Roulette</em>, <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, <em>Who’s Lila?</em>, <em>Order 13</em>, <em>No-Skin</em>, <em>Kiosk</em>, <em>Adios</em>, <em>The Boba Teashop</em>, <em>Daemonologie</em>, <em>Massacre at the Mirage</em>, and <em>Terror at Oakheart</em>.</p>

 <p>All of these games are highly rated on Steam, but I can personally vouch for<em> Buckshot Roulette</em> and <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, a surreal physics sim about cooking food for your fellow dissidents at a mysterious military prison. In addition to being cheap, these indie games don’t require a hulked-out PC to play them. If you have a laptop that came out in the last decade, you can probably play them just fine.</p>

 <h2>Four free games to try this Halloween</h2> <p>Okay, if $1 a piece wasn’t cheap enough for you, there are also some free horror games out there just waiting to be claimed. <a href="https://kotaku.com/stasis-shows-how-spooky-a-point-and-click-adventure-can-1728333738">First up is <em>Stasis</em></a>, a 2015 point-and-click isometric adventure about emerging from a pod during a mysterious space voyage and figuring out what the hell is going on. &nbsp;“The game’s atmosphere is thick with tension, but it’s not trying to make you sweat the whole time, so the few moments it breaks things up and hits you with something shocking, it really works,” reads our <a href="https://kotaku.com/stasis-shows-how-spooky-a-point-and-click-adventure-can-1728333738">original review</a>. GOG is currently giving away the standard edition DRM-free for $0.00 <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stasis?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&amp;utm_campaign=cj&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=cj&amp;r=true">through November 2</a>.</p>

 <p>The Epic Games Store is also giving out <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games">some Halloween freebies</a>. There’s <em>Bendy and the Ink Machine</em>, the first-person horror puzzle game in the style of old-time cartoons. Put up with its sometimes monotonous point-and-click problem solving and you’ll be rewarded with some neat storytelling.&nbsp;<em>Five Nights At Freddy’s: Into the Pit</em> is also free to claim right now. It takes the usual formula and turns it into a 2D pixel art adventure. Is it the best <em>FNaF</em> game? No. But it’s the cheapest.</p> <p>Finally, We Create Stuff, the team behind the acclaimed 2021 psychological horror puzzle game<em> In Sound Mind</em>, recently released a free game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3593490/Days_Without_Incident/"><em>Days Without Incident</em></a><em>.</em> It’s free to download and play and it’s getting some decent early Steam reviews. “This game has the same feeling as something Markiplier would have played back in the 2010s,” wrote one player. “It just oozes with old that school indie charm without relying on jump scares and loud noises every couple feet. Its definitely worth an hour of your time.”</p> <p>Sounds like a great way to spend a night pigging out <a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-price-inflation-trump-tariff-snap-2000640156">on overpriced candy</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-2-patch-1-notes%E2%80%94new-story-adjustments-bug-fixes.1340746/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hades 2’s first major update, Patch 1, is now available on PC and Nintendo Switch 2. The patch notes bring some fixes for Boons and bugs, with the biggest addition being new story, <strong>expanding on the game’s True Ending</strong>.</p>



<p>Released in September, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a> goes bigger and bolder than its 2020 predecessor, with more areas, Gods, and a new protagonist in Melinoe. Fighting Chronos, the god of Time, the witch will battle again and again in order to stop him from destroying the world and rescue her family. The roguelike sequel had been in Early Access since 2024 but came out in full this year to huge praise. Now the highest-rated new game of 2025, Supergiant Games’ mythological epic is poised to be quite the contender for awards. </p>



<p>However, its True Ending was met with some disappointment. Fortunately, the team has revised it, as well as seen additions. During the patch’s preview earlier this month, it seems like the ending changes are a good thing for fans. Some have expressed delight in the somewhat controversial True Ending’s fixes on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1oetj2x/hades_2_ending_spoilers_i_was_wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media like Reddit</a>. Now, the additions and revisions are out for all for PC and Nintendo Switch 2. Along with the ending, fixes to the game’s many Boons and bosses, as well as plenty of bugs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There has been a Witcher-sized hole in my heart for several years now. Unfortunately, the return of <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth-henry-cavil-1851493745">Netflix’s live-action adaptation</a> is unlikely to help fill it. <em>The Witcher</em> season 4 is finally out and bingeable on the streaming service, and almost no one seems to be happy about it.</p> <p>Liam Hemsworth has debuted as the grizzled monster hunter Geralt of Rivia. Netflix even went ahead and retconned him into old scenes for the recap. Does the <em>Hunger Games</em> star earn his keep after all the <a href="https://kotaku.com/liam-hemsworth-witcher-henry-cavill-geralt-netflix-battlefield-6-2000633232">drama surrounding Henry Cavill’s seemingly tumultuous exit</a>? Doesn’t sound like it. One of the most glowing things early watchers have to say about Hemsworth is that, while he ain’t great, he’s at least not the worst thing about season 4.</p>

 <p>It’s everything else that’s apparently a weird mess. The new episodes, which started streaming on October 30, pick up with a recovering Geralt searching a war-torn countryside for surrogate daughter Ciri who is trying out life with a group of bandits while the mage Yennefer rallies others to her campaign to take down the rogue member of the member of the&nbsp;Brotherhood of Sorcerers named Vilgefortz.</p>

 <p>The show was trending in the wrong direction even during its bumpy season 3, which was awkwardly split in half, thus I’m not entirely surprised that season 4 is the Netflix adaptation’s most poorly reviewed yet. It’s currently sitting at a positive rating of just 58 percent <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_witcher/s04">on Rotten Tomatoes</a>. Fan sentiment is even worse, with a user rating in the teens. “The problem isn’t that the show has a new lead actor; it’s that it continues to be a bloated mess,” writes Andrew Webster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/810151/the-witcher-season-4-review-netflix-liam-hemsworth">at<em> The Verge</em></a>. “No amount of imaginative swordplay or inventive creature design can prevent the sense that The <em>Witcher</em> is now what all sword and sorcery epics fear becoming: pure bilge,” wrote Nick Hilton <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/the-witcher-season-4-netflix-liam-hemsworth-review-b2854691.html">at <em>The Independent</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The problems go beyond Hemsworth, though. “The tone remains wildly uneven, lurching as it does between steeple-fingered <em>Game of Thrones</em>-y glumness and those early-90s Saturday afternoon series in which an uncommunicative hunk wanders between small communities, rescuing imperiled innocents from baddies while learning about the true meaning of friendship,” wrote Sarah Dempster <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/oct/30/the-witcher-season-four-review-liam-hemsworth-replaces-henry-cavill-review">at <em>The Guardian</em></a>. Solving that contradiction was what<em> The Witcher 3</em> video game did so well, and what the show has failed at more and more with each successive season.</p>

 <p>Not everyone’s so down on <em>The Witcher</em>‘s return. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-the-witcher-season-4-review-liam-hemsworth"><em>IGN</em></a>‘s Matt Fowler called it “incomplete” but congratulated it on “more successes than missteps,” while <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/netflix/the-witcher-season-4-review"><em>Paste Magazine</em></a>‘s Lacy Baugher called it “wildly satisfying” as a spin-off about the tormented mage Yennefer, played by the excellent Anya Chalotra. But many fans aren’t having it. “Don’t mind Hemsworth as Geralt,” <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_witcher/s04/reviews?type=user">conceded</a> one Rotten Tomatoes user. “It’s tough being second and he’s notable different to Cavill. The real issue with season 4 is the direction. It’s corndog crap. Witches on brooms, swearing birds, priests that burn children being aided by the crew of the Black Pearl, it’s just nonsense.”</p>

 <p>Beyond these eight new episodes, a season 5 is still supposedly in the works. After that? It sounds like Netflix is ready to call it. “By the time we wrap Season 5 fully, it will have been nine years of my life,” showrunner Lauren Schmidt-Hissrich <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/the-witcher-could-netflix-show-survive-without-geralt-henry-cavill-exit-3277462/">told <em>Dexerto</em></a>. “I think there are so many more stories to be told in <em>The Witcher</em> universe, truly.  But I also think you have to step back and accept gracefully, what is the end of this story that we’ve been telling?”</p> <p>At least by then, CD Projekt Red’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-ciri-trailer-gameplay-ue5-tech-demo-1851783467"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a> will probably be out. It will similarly be moving from one lead to another, focusing on Ciri instead of Geralt. Hopefully, that transition goes much smoother.</p>

              <p>The end of October is here, which means the spooky decorations are about to make way for snow, presents, and mistletoe. But before we say goodbye to the jack-o-lanterns and trick-or-treating, we can still pay tribute to the spookiest, the scariest, the ghouliest(?) of Pokémon: the ghost types.</p> <p>Over the years, ghost Pokémon have exploded in number, starting from just <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gastly-anime-episode-ghost-of-maidens-peak-1850892373">the Gastly line</a>, which was their sole representative in the original games, to now dozens of critters haunting the Pokémon world. Ghost-type Pokémon Pokédex entries include some of the most <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-horror-trailer-creepy-2000619530">terrifying lore dumps</a> in this typically all-ages series, and that’s what makes them some of the most interesting. But while we’d love to give every ghost-type friend their due, today we’ve narrowed it down to the 10 creepiest, spookiest, and most memorable lines in the first nine generations of Pokémon. That was a tough challenge, because there are some pretty remarkable ghosts in these games. But before we get to the honorees, here are the honorable mentions:</p> <ul> <li>Aegislash</li> <li>Cursola</li> <li>Dragapult</li> <li>Drifblim</li> <li>Froslass</li> <li>Galarian Marowak</li> <li>Gholdengo</li> <li>Golurk</li> <li>Hisuian Typhlosion</li> <li>Houndstone</li> <li>Mismagius</li> <li>Polteageist</li> <li>Rotom</li> <li>Skeledirge</li> </ul> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div>

<p>Electronic Arts (EA) has removed a “controversial” Battlefield 6 skin from both the base Battlefield 6 multiplayer and REDSEC in response to backlash online: “Wicked Grin”</p>



<p>The Wicked Grin is black and blue skin with a sharp-toothed design on the mask.  It was announced as a new skin for players to unlock as part of Battlefield 6 Season 1, but immediately, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wicked-grin-skin-argument/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players took to platforms</a> like Reddit to voice their frustrations.</p>



<p>There were even players vowing not to revive anyone who was using the skin in-game. </p>



<p>Season 1 began on October 1, and within days, the skin was quietly removed as players continued to comment on the skin. There’s been absolutely no communication from EA on the decision.</p>



<p>In its place is a new “Standard Issue” military skin that you can see below, along with the Wicked Grin Skin.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA for comment on why the Wicked Grin skin was removed. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

Some cards were going up, some were going down, business as usual. Damn sneaker heads!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to today, after a seemingly massive print run, everything is crashing. Literally every card you can pick out of this set is seeing new lows. For me, this is a market correction after a year of inflated prices both on the sealed and single card markets for a variety of factors I've discussed before.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Mega Evolution: All Crashers And Zero Climbs</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst I don't think we're seeing the bubble burst on the market just yet, we're seeing a massive market correction that could see a decline in scalped product and more availability across the board. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you can't tell by now, I won't be including a "Climbers" section today, but I'll be diving into just how much values have crashed in the last three weeks and bag my readers a few bargains in the process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the top cards from Mega Evolution at a glance, and we're seeing between 8% and 33% drops in just three weeks.

It's a gorgeous card and has ridiculously expresive artwork. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't see this card loosing a lot more value, so i'd recommend picking this bad boy up before it shoots back up.</p></div><p id="mega-venusaur-ex-177132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132">Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229405"><div id="229405" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Venusaur is the best generation one starter and i'll live on that hill, because I can't die with Venusaur at my side. Correct opinions aside, this card is getting more and more affordable has time goes on, In just three weeks this card has dropped by over $30, or 20%, to $174.80. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally I think this card can settle to $150, but that's just a gut feeling. Considering how playable it is with the help of Meganium, this feels like a good price.</p></div><p id="mega-gardevoir-ex-178132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132">Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229403"><div id="229403" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is arguably the chase card of the set for those who don't like Gold Hyper Rares, just look at it. Not only is Gardevoir a fan favorite (Let's forget about that life-sized weeb plush), but its a work of art. This has crashed massively by over $80, to a much more respectable $234.99, and i'd put a solid bet on this card climbing right back up in no time. </p></div><p id="mega-lucario-ex-179132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Lucario ex - 179/132">Mega Lucario ex - 179/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229409"><div id="229409" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lucario ex - 179/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is my favorite card of the set, featuring an expresive sky-high battle over Luminoise City between Mega Lucario and Mega Venusaur. For me it's a continuation of the Charizard V Alt Art from the Sword and Shield era featuring Venusaur. Top tier artwork and two fan favorite Pokémon and it's 20% down on Oct. 10, it's a great time to buy this card.</p></div><p id="mega-gardevoir-ex-187132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Gardevoir ex - 187/132">Mega Gardevoir ex - 187/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229407"><div id="229407" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Gardevoir ex - 187/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This gold rare has had one of the biggest drops i've seen for a while. This was going for $600 on Oct. 10, and it's dropped by a massive 33% to $399, which I think is about the right value for it now. If history teaches us anything, Gold Rares go down not up. But the unique embossed patterns and rainbow holo effect Mega Evolution Gold Rares have seems to be turning more heads. Personally it's not for me, but it's a tied top chase card with Mega Lucario ex Gold Rare.</p></div><p id="mega-lucario-ex-188132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Lucario ex - 188/132">Mega Lucario ex - 188/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229402"><div id="229402" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lucario ex - 188/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you think $530 is eye-watering, this card was a massive $630 three weeks ago, so it's deffinately moving in the right direction. One thing i've noticed about Mega Evolution cards today, is that we're at the point where the cards have hit a new flooor. This will bring more buyers in, create more demand and we'll see a rise once again. So if you were after this card, now is likely the best time to get locked in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Every now and then, some suit at a publisher looks at a beloved series they own, realizes they could make it into a live service co-op game, and says, out loud, “I know this has never worked for anyone else, but it might work for <em>us</em>.” It never does, of course; it makes the original fanbase angry, and oftentimes the franchise is old enough that new players don’t even know what it is. The result is a game for no one, a whole lot of nothing driven by market forces and the deluded belief that somehow, some way, this time the idea is just <em>better</em> than all of the previous times it’s been tried. This time, they, chosen by God, will be immune from whatever effects have frustrated lesser mortals. The latest game in this doomed genre is Painkiller, a reboot of People Can Fly’s 2004 cult classic, and the result is the same as it ever was. It’s fitting that it takes place in Purgatory. When it is consigned to the graveyard of history, its headstone will read “Here lies Painkiller, neither good enough to get into heaven nor bad enough to be damned to the inferno. You’ll wish you’d just played the original and called it a day, or simply booted up the Judas Priest song instead.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new Painkiller is one of <em>those</em> co-op games. You know the ones; a brief tutorial frontloads the meager plot, shows you the ropes and unlocks your base of operations. Once established, you pick from one of four visually-distinct-but-aside-from-one-passive-ability-virtually-identical-characters, all of whom come with pre-packaged quips that mostly sound like they were written by Dollar Store Joss Whedon. After selecting your weapons and loadout, you choose one of several missions, where you go to a place and kill a lot of bad guys, then return to your base with the spoils, where you can upgrade your stuff, and do it all again. You have seen all of this before, and I’m already bored describing it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story here is basically nonexistent. You are one of four souls stuck in Purgatory – Ink, Void, Roch, and Sol – approached by the disembodied voice of the angel Metatron to stop the demon Azazel, another faceless voice, from Doing Something Bad. Go on mission, go home, spend spoils, repeat. To Painkiller's infinite credit, there is no paid currency or battle pass here, just a Season Pass with skins and the like, But the loop never varies – once you get New and Better Stuff, it's just time to go do whatever Metratron determines needs doing next. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That really doesn’t sound like Painkiller,” you might say if you played the original – and you, reader, you win the solid gold Kewpie doll, because it isn’t like Painkiller at all! If you squint, you can see the inspirations, though I use this term loosely. There are tarot cards, though you “win” a selection of them by spending gold in the Tarot Lottery because everything about video games is gambling now (even if you’re not spending real money), and equip them before missions for bonuses like +50 health and 30% more damage. Once the mission is over, your tarot cards are used up and you either have to spend more gold in the lottery or Ancient Souls, which you earn during missions, to restore one you’ve previously used. You can also use these currencies to buy and upgrade weapons, and you generally won’t have enough to do that and have tarot cards early on.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This isn't a Painkiller game; it's Warhammer 40k: Darktide wearing a Painkiller suit.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of, much of the original game’s iconic arsenal has been resurrected here like the Stakegun and Electrodriver, complete with their amusing alt fires. However, the titular Painkiller (which you always have) is now doing its best impression of Doom Eternal’s chainsaw, there to get you more ammo when your other guns run out. Sometimes, levels will lock you into a large, usually circular or rectangular space and make you kill a lot of enemies, though none of them are as visually striking or bats**t insane as the original rogues’ gallery. The similarities end there. This is not a Painkiller game; it is Warhammer 40,000: Darktide wearing a Painkiller skin suit, and hoping nobody cares enough to notice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Painkiller looks good, but its problems really come down to mission design. Environments feel samey even when they look different, and each of the three acts (which are three levels apiece) finds a single gameplay idea and never lets go of it. Your progress will be stopped by <em>something</em> and the only way through will be Doing That Act’s Mechanic: in the first, that means filling barrels with blood by killing enemies near them and then slotting those into the proper place; in the second, you’ll need to find and use soul containers to power things; in the third, you’ll have to stand on ritual markers to activate dreamcatchers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Occasionally, Painkiller will mix it up a bit – I actually liked the spots where my team had to use the soul containers to power a large cart we had to escort, but moments like that are rare. Mostly, you do the same things over and over again, moving through the environments, collecting gold, finding hidden chests, and picking up consumables –one plops down health; another plops down ammo; the third is a mostly useless decoy you will never pick up unless the other two are not available; and the fourth is an extra life; that’s it. You’re then locked into a combat arena until you either get enough blood canisters/soul containers/dreamcatchers to proceed or everything barring your path is dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the combat isn’t as satisfying as it should be. Most enemies are cohorts, harmless by themselves but potentially dangerous in large numbers (and they <em>always</em> come in large numbers) that die easily. There are also larger, more dangerous demons you can stagger by pouring on alt fires or kill outright, and the end of act Nephilim, who serve as bosses. None of these are all that engaging aside from the Nephilim, and while there are several different kinds of cohorts and a handful of demons, none of them have much of a unique visual identity. There are no Psychonuns or Hell Bikers or Evil Samurai or Freaks, nothing that made the original game’s wacky evil ensemble memorable. No, this is Purgatory by way of a heavy metal album cover if it were generated by AI. If you’re going to do Painkiller, it could at least <em>look like </em>Painkiller, you know?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's Purgatory by way of a heavy metal album cover if it were generated by AI.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most infuriatingly, Painkiller isn’t out and out <em>bad. </em>The movement is fast, precise, and a hell of a time – you can slide, dash, air dash, <em>dash</em> <em>through enemies,</em> bounce off walls for a double jump, and use the Painkiller to grapple to various anchor points (or enemies!). All six of the guns, whether it’s the Electrodriver, Rocket Launcher, Hand Cannon, Stakegun, Shotgun, or SMG, feel great, and I liked messing around with the various alt fires. A shotgun that freezes enemies so I can shatter them? Neat. A Stakegun that’s also a grenade launcher or can create a gravity well? Love it. Turning the Rocket Launcher into a minigun that shoots rockets that freeze? Sign me up. And getting a new upgrade on a weapon’s branching paths feels meaningful and changes how you play. Yeah, a lot of it is “we have Doom Eternal at home,” but if you’re going to steal, you might as well steal from the best.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I even came to enjoy the characters, particularly Sol, a haughty, eternally youthful priestess, and Void, a straight man with a self-described fishbowl for a head and no memory of his past. Even Ink’s sarcasm and self-loathing and Roch’s tragic backstory aren’t poorly written, really. (The bad stuff is reserved for in-combat dialogue.) The issue is you rarely get to hear them finish telling each other their stories because you’ll run into some enemies and the background heavy metal (which is good) will kick in, or another character will spout some inane combat dialogue and the story dialogue you were hearing will just stop dead and never resume. Yeah, you can read it in the codex at your home base, but it’s not voiced, and the voice cast does admirable work with what they have. Bummer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The boss fights against the Nephilim are pretty good, too. They’re not groundbreaking – you’ve seen a lot of these mechanics before – but they’re engaging to play and they look cool, whether it’s a massive blood rat, a big statue hiding a secret, or a literal dragon. These are the best parts of the roughly four or so hours it takes to play straight through Painkiller’s Raid (read: campaign) mode, and a nice change of pace from the “we’re not locked in here with you, you’re locked in here with <em>us</em>” standard encounters.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Co-op Shooters</h3><p>There are a lot of co-op shooters out there. Here are the best ones.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Painkiller is designed as a three-player co-op game, and that’s the best way to play it, but if you’re short on friends or nobody’s around online, the bots are pretty good and respond well to player commands. Ordering them to stand on a switch to open a secret area is less intuitive than one of your co-op partners seeing the switch and just doing it, but it works, and I didn’t mind playing with bots when no one else was on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Disappointment still manages to creep in, though. I figured Painkiller’s blink-and-you’ll-miss it plot was setting us up for a showdown with Azazel when we finished all nine levels, but nope. You just get access to his empty tomb where his voice offers you the chance to work for him. Your character naturally declines and he pivots to offering, and I kid you not, this is an actual line of dialogue, “a higher difficulty” and the opportunity for more violence and chaos. Sure, Azazel, why not? I’m already having <em>so</em> much fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also a roguelike mode to try out, and I enjoyed it because, unlike the Raid levels, there’s a lot more variety, and you can take your rewards back with you. You might navigate a platforming segment between fights that hurts you for as long as you’re in it or have to bring soul canisters up to the top of a ziggurat. Even the “we’re gonna lock you in a combat arena until either everything else is dead or all of you are” bits are more fun here just because you haven’t seen these environments before, and the randomized nature of your weapons, alt fires, and tarot cards feels more natural. It’s like this is what the Painkiller reboot was <em>supposed to be</em> before someone decided it should have a campaign, too. Unfortunately, during my first roguelike run, my game crashed. Talk about being damned.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Painkiller is a frustrating game. The designs for the Raid levels and enemies are largely disappointing, the story is nearly nonexistent and ends on a low note, and the Great Value Wheedonisms the characters deploy in combat often had my eyes nearly rolling out of their sockets. But I can’t dismiss it outright, either. The movement and weapons are a lot of fun, the bosses are memorable, I grew to like the characters, and the roguelike mode feels like what Painkiller wants to be. Like its characters, this is a game stuck in-between. Unworthy of heaven, but not bad enough for hell. I can’t imagine who this is for, because it’s not Painkiller fans, and even as a co-op game, it’s held back by obvious limitations. It’s a game about nothing for no one, a mediocre resurrection of a classic trying to put a new cover on an old book and hoping it still has some relevance 21 years later. Yeah. Purgatory sounds about right.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/painkiller-2025-review]]></content:encoded>

laptop. The 15.6-inch LCD screen has a 144Hz refresh rate and Nvidia's G-Sync adaptive frame rate tech. It has a full 100% standard RGB color gamut, which often isn't the case with gaming laptops in this price range. It offers 300 nits brightness and has an anti-glare coating.</p><p>The GeForce RTX 5050 GPU is an entry-level graphics card--at least when compared to the rest of Nvidia's 50 Series lineup. It offers nice improvements compared to the RTX 4050, but it's not quite as good as the RTX 4060. Don't expect to play the latest AAA games on high settings, but you can play many games in 1080p at 60fps thanks DLSS upscaling. If you want to connect your laptop to a monitor for 1440p or 4K gaming, you will need to look elsewhere; the 5050 is only suitable for 1080p.</p><p>The Intel Core i5-13450HX is an entry-level processor with 10 CPU cores and 16 threads. It has a base clock speed of 3.4GHz and can boost to 4.6GHz.</p><p>Like most gaming laptops that retail for around $1,000, the Lenovo LOQ comes with 16GB of DDR5 RAM. It has two memory slots and can be upgraded to 32GB (16GB in each slot).</p><p>When it comes to PC gaming, 512GB of storage space really isn't a lot these days, especially if you play a lot of AAA games and online multiplayer titles with frequent updates.

                <p>Embark Studios is clearly keen to keep building on the success of its latest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>. The extraction shooter, which just launched to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-has-already-broken-a-steam-concurrent-players-record-for-extraction-shooters/1100-6535848/" data-ref-id="1100-6535848">biggest player numbers</a> on Steam for the niche genre, is already growing and now there's a roadmap outlining its trajectory.</p><p>Arc Raiders' roadmap provides a glimpse at the months ahead for the fresh third-person shooter on the market. As is typically the case, the live-service game will be receiving frequent updates fine-tuning the experience, ironing out any kinks, and steadily rolling out new cosmetics, feats and trials, as well as map conditions that should liven the playing field.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4594476-arcraidersroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594476" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4594476-arcraidersroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594476"></a><figcaption>Arc Raiders roadmap for the next several months.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4594476-arcraidersroadmap.jpg"></figure><p>The most exciting news though has to do with two updates coming in November and December, respectively. The first is dubbed North Line, and it will feature an entirely new map called Stella Montis, bringing Arc Raiders' map count to five. North Line will also introduce a new community unlock event--these are typically goals and challenges for the entire game's community to work towards in order to unlock a reward--as well as equipment and quests. There will even be two new Arcs, the game's robotic enemies which tower over players, called the Matriarch and Shredder.</p><p>Just a month later in December, another update called Cold Snap will be dropping just in time for the brisk winter holidays. As the name suggests, a new arctic map condition will arrive in the game as well as a complementary event called Flickering Flames. I reckon players should start preparing to fight one another in order to stay warm come December.</p><p>Both updates will also let players rediscover "what was lost in expanded Quests," according to Embark's announcement post. Only the Cold Snap update in December will pack in a Raider Deck though, Arc Raiders' rendition of a battle pass.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="11c4c6604f2bf"><a title="Animal Crossing Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/11c4c6604f2bf/animal-crossing-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I <em>adore</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. I know, I know, such a hot take puts me in a niche of... about 98% of people that read this site, but what I mean to say is that when the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> and the 3.0 update were announced yesterday, I was about as excited as Blathers when you deliver him a fourth Fossil in one day. That's <em>very excited</em>.</p>
<p>I spent the evening grinning about the return of Sonny Resetti, the Mineru Villager (!!), all of the design potential that comes with the Hotel Resort, and bulk crafting! I was even pretty pleased with the Switch 2-specific features like Mouse Mode and GameChat, perhaps not quite as big as the additions that the 3.0 update will provide, but a nice little bonus for four quid.</p>
<p>But then, as I settled into bed after an evening of counting the days until 15th January (77 today, for those interested), I was met with a little pang of worry. "If the New Horizons Switch 2 Edition is arriving with this much pomp," I thought to myself, "it's going to be <em>years</em> until we get a new Animal Crossing!"</p>
<figure data-uuid="d7a897ef76bd6"><a title="Animal Crossing Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7a897ef76bd6/animal-crossing-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>If only we could fast forward to the next entry, eh? — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn't to say I'm particularly keen to move on from New Horizons — if those lockdown months taught me anything, it was that I could play this game forever (given the time) — but I realised that a lot of my Switch 2 excitement was built on seeing what comes next. I've already <em>played</em> New Horizons, and no amount of home storage expansion is going to feel as fresh as a new entry.</p>
<p>I'm starting to see the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions as a big ol' placeholder in Nintendo's release schedule. It's one of those 'we're not quite ready to show you what's next, so here's something familiar to keep you busy in the meantime' moments that we're becoming increasingly well acquainted with. Surely a brand new game would be a much better prospect for console sales?</p>
<p>It was a similar story on Switch. Rather than give us a new Mario Kart, we got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>; instead of a new 3D Mario, we got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a>. They're great games, no doubt, but they're also a telltale sign of 'you're years away from a new entry, mate'.</p>
<p>And I don't want that for Animal Crossing. New Horizons launched over five years ago *<em>gulp</em>*, and while that's hardly a <em>long</em> wait between series entries, the arrival of the Switch 2 Edition makes me think that Nintendo could easily make us wait another five.Throw in some unexpected content updates a few years down the line to sweeten the deal, à la MK8D's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mario_kart_8_deluxe_booster_course_pass">Booster Course Pass</a>, and we might end up waiting even longer, forever convinced that the 2020 game is delivering something new.</p>

<p>I have no idea where we go next after New Horizons, but I thought the same thing after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">New Leaf</a>, and look where that left us! All the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does is delay the next entry. I'll jump back into ACNH and have a wonderful time doing so, but it won't capture the magic of terraforming your island the first time, will it?</p>
<p>More pressingly, putting my industry cap on for a second, Animal Crossing is a system seller. Unless Nintendo has another global pandemic up its sleeve, I can't imagine that a new series entry would hit the 48 million sales that New Horizons mustered, but people would <em>flock</em> to it, all the same. In a launch year that's been criticised for its re-releases, wouldn't 'Animal Crossing: Newer Horizons' be the big push to go out and nab a Switch 2?</p>
<p>It all feels like many of the same concerns that I've had with the console in general these past few months. I think the year-one lineup is fantastic, but I'm fortunate because I <em>like</em> most of the games that are getting re-released. No amount of graphical upgrades or Mouse Mode inclusions can overshadow the fact that these are games that I, and many other people, have played before, some of them just a few years ago.</p>
<p>Of course, this is how console launches work these days, and compared to the Xbox Series or the PS5, the Switch 2 is already off to a flying start as far as its software is concerned.</p>
<p>I also need to remind myself that the past four months haven't been wall-to-wall NS2 Editions. In terms of exclusives, we've had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a> are right around the corner, then we've got new Switch 2 entries for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">Yoshi</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem</a> already lined up for 2026. You compare that to the PS5's exclusives list for its first couple of years, and it's a firm reminder that we're eating good!</p>
<figure data-uuid="6c3ca090d3df6"><a title="Animal Crossing Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6c3ca090d3df6/animal-crossing-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Think you could magic me up a new game, Lloid? — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But I think we're still missing the real big hitter. The Switch 2 Editions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">BOTW</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">TOTK</a> seemed like a fair stand-in for a new entry in that series (we have had two newbies in the past two years, to be fair), Donkey Kong Bananza feels like the obvious substitute for a 3D Mario, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Mario Wonder + Meetup in Bellabel Park</a> will have us covered on the 2D front soon enough, too.</p>
<p>I was hoping that Animal Crossing would be the biggie to make everyone go, "Yes, now I <em>need</em> a Switch 2", but I fear that January's re-release is a sign that we still have a long wait ahead of us before we can see what Newer Horizons will look like.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Embark Studios just released its second major title, ARC Raiders, which launched yesterday and made quite the splash, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/">achieving over 250K concurrent players on Steam</a>, making it the biggest launch for an extraction shooter on the platform, and it also surpassed Embark's other major title, The Finals, for its concurrent launch numbers on Steam.</p>



<p>Keeping up with the pace of modern-day live service games, Embark Studios has no intention of slowing down and followed up yesterday's stellar launch with the reveal of the game's roadmap for the remainder of 2025.</p>



<p>There are no specific release dates around when the next set of major updates are coming, but it does tell us that we can expect two major updates for the rest of the year, one in November and one in December. Both include new quests and community events, though only the November update includes a new map and new ARC machines for players to combat.</p>



<p>The December update adds Snowfall as a new map condition to fit the holiday mood, a new expedition, and a new raider deck. </p>



<figure><figcaption><em>ARC Raiders 2025 roadmap. Image credit: Embark Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>We are so thankful to have you on this journey with us,</em>" Embark Studio <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/">writes on its website in its roadmap blog post</a>, "<em>and we will continue to refine and grow the game with your feedback in mind. Keep your eyes on the horizon. This is only the beginning of what is in store for ARC Raiders</em>."</p>



<p>Besides the roadmap shown off today, Embark Studios has also already put out the first hotfix for the game, which was intended to fix some server issues and animation issues. Though overall, yesterday (and so far today), has gone on without major reports about the servers being broken or players waiting in long queues. For an indie team making online multiplayer games, that's an impressive feat on its own.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fortnite-sidekicks-cute-pets-follow-around-can-only-be-customized-once/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-sidekicks-are-cute-pets-that-follow-you-around-but-can-only-be-customized-once-unless-you-buy-them-again.1340638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games has introduced a new category of cosmetics called Fortnite Sidekicks. They're essentially pets that follow the player around in various modes, including Battle Royale, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-fortnite-gets-launch-of-new-game-and-major-content-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Fortnite</a>, Save the World, Fortnite Festival (though they'll remain backstage), and even user-made experiences (though only if the creator has enabled them).</p>



<p>They won't provide any gameplay advantages, so their only real perk is looking cute. They do, however, react to the surrounding world, and players can interact with them through special Sidekick Emotes. The first one to be introduced to the game is Peels, a 'banana dog', which will be available to be unlocked via the Battle Pass starting tomorrow. Bonesy (which will be granted to owners of the Bonesy Back Bling), Spike, and Lil’ Raptor will go live next Friday, and Epic also teased that there will soon be something for the many cat lovers out there.</p>



<p>It sounds like yet another idea that will earn Epic a lot of money, especially because they are locking repeated customization beyond multiple purchases of the same pet. That's right: you may only customize the physical traits of Fortnite Sidekicks once. If you purchase it multiple times, you can give it separate Appearances, which must be unique (duplicate Appearances are not allowed). </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fortnite Sidekicks | Tutorial Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1N0m9H13pGM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Needless to say, some Fortnite players have already criticized this choice as a blatant way to extract more money from the user base. It is especially lamentable, since younger players may well be among the most interested in this kind of cosmetic customization. That said, Epic does allow you to change the Sidekick's name and accessories at any time, and you can also earn hats and hoodies by hanging out with your pet and using your Sidekick Points.</p>



<p>The current Fortnite season, Shock 'N Awesome, will end tomorrow at 8:30 AM Pacific Time/11:30 AM Eastern Time/4:30 PM Central European Time. The downtime is expected to last around two to three hours, after which Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 5, which is known to be themed around The Simpsons, will go live.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The viral horror sensation Poppy Playtime is back with Chapter 5 and, in honor of Halloween, a new teaser is out. Furthermore, we now know some more on what to expect from the next chapter in the series.</p>



<p>Mascot Horror has been at the forefront of the indie scene for quite some time. Starting with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-megan-fox-matpat-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Five Nights at Freddy’s</a>, the genre has developed into an almost foolproof shot to success. Games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-shown-at-summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Choo-Choo Charlie</a>, Indigo Park, and Garten of BanBan have rose in popularity from following FNAF’s footsteps. One such series, Mob Entertainment’s Poppy Playtime, has been one of the bigger successes. With recognizable characters like Huggy Wuggy, Doey, and CatNap, fans worldwide have been anticipating the next chapter of the franchise. Fortunately, just in time for Halloween, we got a new teaser and some plot to go with it.</p>



<h2 id="h-meet-the-puppetmaster-in-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-s-newest-trailer">Meet the Puppetmaster in Poppy Playtime: Chapter 5’s Newest Trailer</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 - Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGSn5cY0o3k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Mob Entertainment has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGSn5cY0o3k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released a new trailer</a> for <strong>Poppy Playtime: Chapter 5</strong>. While the video isn’t long, lasting less than a minute, it’s certain to make fans go nuts with theories and the like. There’s a lot to go off of, too, as specific locations like a science lab are shown along with mysterious goop and a burning Poppy billboard. Unfortunately, <strong>no pricing or release date was announced</strong>, though the game is <strong>now available for wishlisting</strong> on <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWlYYXJZYlJyb0NpWEF3X1dGUG5IeHRKckJqZ3xBQ3Jtc0tsTDBLdTh3TVpvdEJ3X20xRE1QWGdiVU9sR2hlQW5jS2dic29pNTNXdDhLNmtIaFRzSHVvMGMxSFRweFNDOU5NNF9Nd1hDYlhocjlVT3RMTTJzeDBXN3FPckRYcTEyeEZ3QnpMa2dlUGZFRWJ4YWdwcw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggywug.co%2F4oK8fPx&amp;v=NGSn5cY0o3k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> </strong>and the <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbUQ4eWZjbUNuWFVjbUxDY1o0b0pCeENRU3BuQXxBQ3Jtc0tsNkxVNzdqa1pFbllxV3ByR1hKZmFvVVdKSWFkSjl5RXF1NjUzd1JFZGtnLWhMMUV4UlhCaEZ4QjJIZ3YwaUtUenR4bFhiOGlhcWNQX2pxQXRkMEdBdGFDWXdyNGd5ZEN4Y3JjTEgwWGNrWl9WMHhVMA&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggywug.co%2F4qswKSW&amp;v=NGSn5cY0o3k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a></strong>.</p>



<p>However, we do know some information regarding the game’s plot. The game takes place after the events of Chapter 4. Mob Entertainment states on the official Steam page,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In Poppy Playtime: Chapter 5, players must prepare to face off against the deadly puppetmaster behind the horrifying events of Playtime Co. Solve devious puzzles and overcome dangerous obstacles as the true rotten heart at the center of Playtime Co. draws nearer. Traverse this new realm of shadows in a fight for survival (and the truth) with Playtime’s security system Huggy Wuggy in hot pursuit and separated from your only allies. Will you finally end this nightmare, or fall victim to the puppet master’s twisted madness?”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If Chapter 5 is as big as previous entries, we may see Poppy Playtime get back into the spotlight once again. Even if you haven’t played any games in the series, it’s sure to deliver some scares galore. Given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnitemares-2025-features-largest-ever-collabs-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite added Poppy Playtime</a> to its Fortnitemares this year, it’s a pretty good time to get into the series and an even better time to be a fan.</p>

                <p>Platinum Games' Bayonetta made her North American debut in 2010 and she quickly became a fan-favorite character. And what's not to love? She's a shapeshifting witch who's very good at gunplay. And she almost never appears without her glasses, as insisted upon by her creator, Hideki Kamiya.</p><p>Earlier this week, a fan on <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1983682508341571921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1983682508341571921%7Ctwgr%5E3034485e9a8241d0ba688a86118f8d542597acdd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fautomaton-media.com%2Fen%2Fnews%2Fthe-glasses-stay-on-bayonettas-most-iconic-design-feature-was-in-danger-of-being-removed-by-publishers-but-hideki-kamiya-refused-to-compromise%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> asked Kamiya about a meme-worthy quote he was alleged to have said: "Bayonetta’s glasses are just like her underwear." Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-glasses-stay-on-bayonettas-most-iconic-design-feature-was-in-danger-of-being-removed-by-publishers-but-hideki-kamiya-refused-to-compromise/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Kamiya attributed the quote to animation director Yuji Shimomura, who handled the game's cinematics. Kamiya also indicated that he agreed with Shimomura that Bayonetta should never be without her glasses.</p><p>"When we were designing Bayonetta, our clients requested us to take off her glasses, and it's true that I kept rejecting their proposals," recalled Kamiya. "But it's also true that, on a separate occasion, Mr. Shimomura, who produced the cinematics, said 'Bayonetta's glasses are just like her underwear--do not take them off at any cost.'"</p><p>Mari Shimazaki--the character designer of Bayonetta--posted <a href="https://twitter.com/MariShimazaki/status/1984088379362054294?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1984088379362054294%7Ctwgr%5E3034485e9a8241d0ba688a86118f8d542597acdd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fautomaton-media.com%2Fen%2Fnews%2Fthe-glasses-stay-on-bayonettas-most-iconic-design-feature-was-in-danger-of-being-removed-by-publishers-but-hideki-kamiya-refused-to-compromise%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a response of her own</a> on X, and noted that Kamiya came up with Bayonetta's glasses at the earliest stages of her creation.</p><p>"During the development of Bayonetta 1, when I was drawing up rough sketches of the character design, Kamiya appeared behind me out of nowhere and whispered: 'Give her glasses.' That's how everything started. Later, whenever I was sketching rough designs for Bayonetta, he'd always come up to me saying, 'Why don’t you give her glasses?' So it became a habit for me to always have a glasses layer ready in my designs. While the process of finalizing designs was sometimes a bumpy ride, I always had the glasses layer on standby."</p><p>Thus far in the games, Bayonetta has only allowed a single person to see her without her glasses. She even wears them during the 2023 prequel game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bayonetta-origins-cereza-and-the-lost-demon-malice-in-wonderland/1900-6418045/" data-ref-id="1900-6418045">Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon</a>.</p><p>Bayonetta 3 came out in 2022, and Kamiya subsequently hinted at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bayonetta-4-is-already-in-the-works-kamiya-announces/1100-6509360/" data-ref-id="1100-6509360">Bayonetta 4</a>. However, Kamiya left Platinum Games in 2023, and subsequently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bayonetta-creator-hideki-kamiya-says-his-next-game-will-be-one-only-he-can-make/1100-6519976/" data-ref-id="1100-6519976">expressed his desire to make his own games</a>. The status of Bayonetta 4 is currently unknown, with Kamiya busy on Okami 2.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">After 82 straight days of near-constant play, one Fortnite player has done something no one else has claimed before, as far as they know: reaching level 7,000 without cheating. The player, known as Terns on X and Canada in-game, documented the climb throughout the season, posting the milestone on social media this week.</p><p dir="ltr">The achievement, however, doesn’t mean much tangible at all. Fortnite caps meaningful rewards around level 200, and higher levels don’t grant extra items, bonuses, or skill advantages. The main payoff is appearing on a <a href="https://fortnite.gg/stats" rel="nofollow ">leaderboard</a> and having something to brag about--though even that isn’t respectable. Terns also admitted that most of their progress came from playing against bots rather than real players.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TernsCheese/status/1983319212446888292" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">22+ hours a day<br>82 days<br>7,000 levels<br>After a LOT of grinding, I've finally reached my goal and if I'm correct, the only grinder to ever reach level 7,000 legitimately without glitches or account sharing.

"I used 'bot lobbies,' which are an Epic-supported thing, where every enemy in your game is an AI player and it is easier to kill."</p><p dir="ltr">Terns’ post was met with ridicule across social media, with many users questioning how anyone could dedicate that much time to anything, let alone a single season of Fortnite.</p><p dir="ltr">"That’s honestly pathetic," one commenter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteBattleRoyale/comments/1oiujbr/comment/nlye4ib/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">wrote</a>. "Playing nearly three months with no sleep just to say no one has played as much Fortnite as you ... this is just grinding the same thing for weeks making your brain go numb so a bunch of 12-year-olds can go 'woah.'"</p><p dir="ltr">According to Terns, the upper ranks of Fortnite’s leveling leaderboards are often dominated by players who use exploits to boost their stats.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4594461-screenshot2025-10-31095044.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594461" data-ratio="0.4568661971831" data-width="1136" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4594461-screenshot2025-10-31095044.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594461"></a><figcaption>These levels will reset at the end of the season.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4594461-screenshot2025-10-31095044.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Others are cheating to grind, and it’s mostly the same few people every time," they said. "There are teams and clans of glitchers who cheat and try to ruin leaderboards and the integrity of grinding every season."</p><p dir="ltr">Epic Games occasionally patches these exploits, but Terns says cheaters quickly adapt. Their drive came from a small Discord community of like-minded players who talk about leveling up for hours on end.</p><p dir="ltr">"I’m mainly motivated by talking to other grinders in my own Discord server," they said. "We often sit in voice chats together, laughing and discussing XP all day."</p><p dir="ltr">We're fastly approaching the 10-year anniversary of the launch of Fortnite battle royale and Epic's creation is still gripping players like Terns. It helps that the gaming supergiant continues to update the game with content like a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time-rewards-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6535750/" data-ref-id="1100-6535750">Simpsons-themed</a> season.</p><p dir="ltr">Terns has been playing Fortnite since Chapter 1 Season 9 and has spent years grinding for levels. After hundreds of hours and nearly sleepless nights, they've reached a level that few players--or anyone else--should pursue again.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Halo: Campaign Evolved vs Halo Combat Evolved Side by Side Graphics Comparison</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Halo Leaks didn't have more details about the remakes to offer, but stated Halo Studios would be saving the return of the franchise's iconic multiplayer for Halo 7.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo: Campaign Evolved.when it launches in 2026, will be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696">Halo franchise's first time on PlayStation</a>, where it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-games-will-be-on-playstation-going-forward-says-microsoft/1100-6535712/" data-ref-id="1100-6535712">continue to be released going forward</a>. If the goal of Microsoft and Halo Studios is to introduce a whole new audience and generation to Halo, starting with Combat Evolved and going through the entire original trilogy does make sense. Xbox social marketing manager Josh Stein said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-on-ps5-is-a-win-for-the-future-of-halo-dev-says/1100-6535726/" data-ref-id="1100-6535726">Halo arriving on PS5</a> "is a win for the future of Halo and those that love it, new and old."</p><p dir="ltr">Remasters aren't exactly new for the Halo franchise. Halo: Combat Evolved received its first visual remaster in 2011, and Halo 2 was remastered in 2014 as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-283982">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>. Halo 3 has never been remastered or remade, making it a prime candidate for receiving a remake similar to Campaign Evolved.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that Halo: Campaign Evolved isn't out until sometime next year, it will likely still be a while before Halo Studios makes any official announcements about a Halo 2 or Halo 3 remake. In the meantime, some of the developers on the original Halo have shared their own opinions on Campaign Evolved. Master Chief creator Marcus Lehto said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">Halo remake "warms my heart,"</a> while another former <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">Halo dev slammed some of the remake's changes</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Europa Universalis V starts as it means to go on, dropping you into its recreation of the late Middle Ages just as England and France embark on their Hundred Years’ War and then as the Black Death washes through Europe. To that backdrop, whatever nation you choose to play as is going to have a pretty rough time of it early on, but that just breeds opportunity through the 500 years of human history this ambitious game looks to portray.</p>
<p><iframe title="Here's Everything You Need To Know Before You Unpause Europa Universalis V" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iA0cMW6QjDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But who do you choose to play as? If you’re coming from EU4, chances are you’ve already got a good idea, but for new players (or for the terminally indecisive) Paradox has a few handy suggestions, leaning into particular playstyles, such as the initially more expansionist tone of Hungary, the political focus of Norway, or the burgeoning trading nation of Holland. Unless you click it away, you’ll find yourself in a tailored opening experience with guiding tutorials through some of the key pillars and concepts within the game, and building certain mission paths.</p>


<p>There’s no getting away from just how dense Europa Universalis V remains, and it doesn’t help that some of the suggestions in the tutorial and the rigidity of the subsequent missions feel like they’re actively hindering your potential. That’s especially true of goals that target improvements, such as adding four buildings to your capital or increasing Control through a region –&nbsp;if you’ve already pushed those metrics quite high, it makes that mission tree more arduous than it should be. You can’t do multiple mission trees at once, and you lose progress if you switch to another.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the foundational work that Paradox has put in with the nested tooltips, the in-game search, and encyclopaedia all go a long way to helping pick up the slack… mostly. There’s still plenty of times where it won’t be quite clear why you can’t build that particular building just yet, or there’s a new term that your Renaissance Googling won’t quite dredge up, or maybe you’ve just found a search bar in the wrong section… But you’re in this for the long haul, and like a spotty 16-year old who’s been hurriedly handed a crown and told to go make an heir, you’ll figure it out – OK, that’s a bit more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/31/crusader-kings-iii-review/">Crusader Kings</a> than Europa Universalis, but you know what I mean.</p>


<p>Even as a series veteran, there’s plenty of new, returning, and modified concepts to get to grips with. Trade, for example, now hinges on a system of established markets to funnel all of a region’s imports, exports, resources, and production through – this isn’t based on nations, but literally the proximity and influence of the markets themselves. You can happily use the established flow of trade through the world to flog your wares and feed your economy, but there’s also benefits to being in control, and so you can make the investment to found a market of your own to try and grow your stature.</p>
<p>All of that trade is, of course, built off the backs of your people, your “pops”, and the provinces they inhabit. This is the real lifeblood of your nation, with each province (and there’s so many more vs. EU4) having a key resource assigned that can be gathered, mined, hunted, and farmed through an RGO (the very technically correct Resource Gathering Operation), alongside whatever buildings you’re able to construct for your town, city, or countryside. Pops are your units, each with their key culture, religion, and social position, needs, and preferences. Peasants are at the bottom rung, below Labourers, the increasingly wealthy Burghers, then the Nobility and the Aristocracy, with religious leaders having their own special place alongside, each represented by an Estate in your government. You need people of the right class to work the specific jobs, and so there’s some social mobility here even early on, but as you progress through the ages, that grows and shifts.</p>

<p>You are, in some ways, as much at the whims of the pops, as they are to your desires to reshape your nation along twelve Societal Values scales. You might want to build up the cities with tons of growing industries and technological advances, but people really don’t like change, whether that’s the nobility wanting to maintain all their power and serfs, or country folk not wanting everything to be so centralised around stinky towns. There’s a constant push and pull to societal change, as you need to appease each Estate by giving them privileges to give nuggets of power and influence in exchange for enabling your Reforms. On a smaller scale, individual pops can be dissatisfied, and you need to maintain stability, using this as a currency to enact change. Some of that can come from buildings, but there’s also tasking your Cabinet with tipping the balance in a particular category, making choices at key junctures, and enacting laws as their concepts become available. It’s always handy to have a fair amount of Crown Power to push this through.</p>
<p>Another key metric is Control, an indication of how “close” your provinces are to your centre of power –&nbsp;a bit like those mud farmers in Monty Python not knowing who their king is. It’s vital for you to be able to dredge up taxes and manpower for your military, as lower control drops your reach in a province. It’s simple, and it’s clear, and the two simplest ways to improve it are to build roads and use your Cabinet to increase control in a region, but there’s other ways to boost it as well.</p>

<p>Given the 500 year span of the campaign, there’s an awful lot of development of cultures, ideas and technology, and this is broken down into six distinct ages. Each of these has three core concepts that need to reach your borders, slowly spreading across the world from their point of origin, and then needing you to invest in that category before you can start to research – this costs more, the lower nascent awareness your pops have. The tech trees are big and broad, branching out from an initial innovation to a bunch of Advances, and the UI for this is a massively zoomed out sideways scrolling mess, but it’s conceptually a good way to gate and reveal each age’s advances. The sticking plaster is that there’s also a list of available Advances, that you can search for a particular thing you need and queue up the whole chain, and just offload to an AI manager.</p>
<p>And you can do that a lot in this game. AI has been laced into so many aspects of Europa Universalis V that you can almost put the game in autopilot to run itself but, really, I appreciate that this is present, it feels like it does a competent job, and I can always dive in and tinker as well. It allows trading to be massively granular, making deals with two decimal points for market needs while I just pop in to maybe set out some bigger ones. It’s a great tool both for beginners and for removing some of the busywork, and it can be applied as specifically or as broadly as you like.</p>
<p>With such an early start date to EU5, this really pushes the colonialist expansion side of a campaign much further. Depending on the nation that you choose to play as – I went with Holland for an economic play mainly – this can be your opportunity to really spread your wings when you’ve got major powers like France and England greedily gobbling up territory and vassals right next to you. The thing it, this is now tens of hours into the game, and if you’re a bit pigeonholed that can lead to long stretches of waiting.</p>

<p>So what to do but to lash out with some good old fashioned wars? I like the way that wars and combat are balanced in EU5. The tangle of alliances and defensive pacts can keep a lot of excessive aggression in check, and when fighting does break out, the AI is fairly smart in how it attacks you and uses multiple armies –&nbsp;though you can still outwit them if they get hung up on long sieges. Armies are arranged into three channels –&nbsp;a centre and two flanks –&nbsp;and you can toy with this a little to gain an advantage before combat begins.</p>
<p>All of this review, and I’ve barely scratched the surface of many of EU5’s depths and breadths. There’s an impressive amount in this game – the number of nations, cultural tweaks and world events are huge – and the core workings are very capable to encapsulating so much of this. I’ve no doubt that there’s balancing and tweaking that will occur once the game is in the hands of the masses, and the more overpowered and underpowered nations and playstyles will be brought into line.</p>
<p>But a final, special note for the presentation of this game. Visually, this is a nice evolution of Paradox’s Clausewitz Engine: there’s the pleasing way that towns and cities sprawl, how the overlay flattens the map and recedes, and the UI is pleasingly textured and thematic… but it’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLdEOqfEouw">Håkan Glänte’s soundtrack</a> that will burrow its way into your mind. It certainly leans toward the breadth of later classical music eras, but folds earlier instrumentation and styles into the mix, and recalls motifs from previous games as well. Overture II: The Odyssey swells with optimism, Pain Is Salvation boasts rich and dramatic choral work, and Battle of Lützen is a suitably epic accompaniment to wartime, and on and on. For music that will join you for tens and hundreds of hours, I’m definitely not sick of it yet.</p>

			<p>It's Halloween at the time of this writing, which means it's the perfect day to turn off the lights and play a horror game, whether that's something new like Cronos: The New Dawn and Silent Hill f, or a classic like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Dead Space, and Alien: Isolation. Developer Broken Mirror Games and publisher Skybound Games' upcoming isometric 80s-themed horror adventure was unfortunately never going to be an option this Halloween, <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-hate-this-place-release-date-ps5-xbox-nintendo-pc/">as it was due to come out on November 7, 2025</a>, but now it won't even be coming out this year.</p>



<p>A new story trailer released today shows off more of the game's spooky vibes, which is more than fitting for this time of year, but it ends with the revelation that the game will no longer make its November 7, 2025 date. Instead, it'll now release on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch on January 29, 2026.</p>

<p>"<em>As for the date change, we decided that we need a little more time to better incorporate some changes and features gathered from community feedback</em>,<em>" </em>Broken Mirror Games wrote <a href="https://x.com/BMGhorrors/status/1984260318382658038">in a post on its official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>. "<em>We feel the game deserves to make a good first impression so we rethought things and set the new release window to January 2026. Thanks for your patience and understanding.</em>"</p>



<p>Broken Mirror Games' debut title is based on the comic book by writer Kyle Starks and artist Artyom Topilin, with players facing supernatural entities in this 80s-themed world. It was first showcased in <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/open-world-survival-horror-game-i-hate-this-place-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-and-pc">March 2025</a>, and prior to this delay, was expected to arrive sometime before the end of the year.</p>



<p>At least with its current release date, by the time we get to October 31, 2026, you'll probably be able to grab I Hate This Place as part of a spooky sale if you hadn't already picked it up.
