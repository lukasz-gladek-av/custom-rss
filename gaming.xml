<figure><a title="Mario Kart World / Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f2019168b5632/mario-kart-world-mario-kart-8-deluxe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK Charts are in and, as expected, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has retained its lofty spot at number 1 following the Switch 2's incredibly successful launch. But what ho, what luck, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is also in the top ten at number 6! Nintendo must be proper chuffed at that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, other Switch 2 games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> have all slipped down every so slightly, though hardly cause for alarm. Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</a>, however, has tumbled all the way down to number 21. Perhaps this is the backlash to Game-Key Cards actually coming into effect.</p>
<p>A couple of <strong>Resident Evil</strong> games have also snuck their way back into the top 40, but no, it's sadly not because Switch 2 versions have suddenly become available. We suspect it's a result of the recent announcement of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. That said, we wouldn't say no to Switch 2 versions, eh Capcom. Eh? Eh? Go on.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/mindseye">MindsEye</a> made it to number 4?! People, people, people...</p>
<p>Here's a look at the full top 40 for this week, with platform breakdowns for all of the titles available on other consoles as well as the Switch and Switch 2:</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shogun-total-war">Shogun: Total War</a> is 25 years old this year, and Creative Assembly are holding <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war/blogs/73">a multi-month long celebration</a> kicking off in August with livestreams, interviews, sales, and multiplayer tournaments, all culminating with a showcase in early December. This will be the first showcase of its type they've done, and it's billed to feature announcements for "new games" in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> series. That's more than one, as the discerning pluralisation understanders among you have no doubt sagely clocked.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Whether you’re a fantasy or history fan, there will be plenty to enjoy," writes CA's Roger Collum. "Warhammer 40K and Medieval 3!" The crowds bay in frothing anticipation. "Star Wars and World War 1!", we scream like shrill goats perched on single planks of driftwood floating upon stone-gray oceans, kept from madness only by the knowledge that we can adequately explain what a hammer and anvil maneuver is, in lieu of having formed any meaningful human relationships in a decade.</p>
<p>"Lord Of The Rings and Empire 2!", reads the scrawled note sellotaped to the goat-rescuing submariner's periscope lens, resulting in the tragic water deaths of both the goat and then the entire crew somehow. This madness has gone too far. Please, control yourselves.</p>
<p>For what it's worth: yes, I think at least one of these games is going to be Warhammer 40,000. On to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/future-creative-assembly-games-may-require-blood-thematically-which-sure-sounds-like-a-total-war-warhammer-40000-teaser">hefty pile of circumstantial evidence</a>, you can add the seeming absence of Warhammer 3 game director Rich Aldridge from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-fans-reckon-theyve-already-guessed-which-faction-is-coming-next-in-tides-of-torment">latest Tides Of Torment showcase</a>. This said, it's also equally possible Aldridge is hard at work on the massive End Times expansion I'm sure is coming to Twarhammer sooner rather than later. "Tides of Torment DLC will reveal its final playable faction in July," writes Collum, "and some long-awaited content will be unveiled at the anniversary showcase". As long as I get Thanquol before the trilogy wraps up, I'm a happy little ratman. Well, Thanquol <a href="https://youtu.be/iUwsmt4DlUM">and Toddy</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Such has been the onslaught of livestreams, showcases, reveals, re-reveals, trailers and assorted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pondering-geoffs-orbs">Keighleybollocks</a> this month that we skipped the new game round-up last week. The Maw, thankfully, was too stuffed with Capcom previews to express much discontent, but it could have been disastrous. The last time we forgot to lay out a Monday feeding schedule, the creature ate a bunch of double-A publishers. What, you didn't seriously think THQ went under due to "strong headwinds", did you? But enough lamentation - there are new PC games to discuss.</p>
<h2>Monday 16th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Are you old enough to remember GEX? My sympathies. There's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gex-trilogy">GEX trilogy</a> remaster out today. If you are not old enough to remember GEX, perhaps you will be more enraptured by cute co-op climbing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>. I also have my eye on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310950/Nightmare_Frontier/">Nightmare Frontier</a>, a sort of weird western XCOM, with the caveat that AI generation tools were used to created some of its menu assets and translate the script.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 17th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's time to date everything in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/">Date Everything!</a> and take back Control of the office in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC Firebreak</a>. There's also post-apocalyptic colony builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/after-inc-revival">After Inc: Revival</a>, elven real-time tactics game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wartorn">Wartorn</a>, and shonen mech RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525510/NITRO_GEN_OMEGA/">Nitro Gen Omega</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 18th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>In first-person actioner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blessed-burden">Blessed Burden</a> you are the last surviving priest journeying deep into the bowels of hell, or thereabouts. In deckbuilder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2447980/Crown_Gambit/">Crown Gambit</a> you are a team of paladins trying to save a city from political turmoil, and "unearthly beasts".</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 19th June</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604270/Broken_Arrow/">Broken Arrow</a> is not a 90s airplane movie but a real-time strategy game set in the Baltic states with over 300 units. Pretty much the polar opposite of pixelart escapade <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1425180/Vessels_of_Decay/">Vessels Of Decay</a>, in which you navigate a post-apocalyptic Scandinavia full of folkoric monsters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 20th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>I can think of no better way to spend Friday than by tending <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mushroom-musume">an eerie mushroom princess</a>. Unless it be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2986450/Metro_Gravity/">sabotaging gravity as a witch</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the treehouse up to this week? Brendan and Jeremy are deep in the desert, Nic is roving an open world with a block of tofu, James appears moderately excited about a TV of some kind, Mark is reopening the gates of Oblivion, Graham is sitting on a large throne made of bones, and Ollie continues to reign over the night. How about you?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the latest Xbox announcements and rumors, fans have been worried that Microsoft's next-generation console might be a PC-like device that may not even run prior console games properly. This fear stemmed mainly from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation </a>of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 and the subsequent <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-made-xbox-handheld-reportedly-dead-oem-might-make-next-gen-xbox-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumor</a> from The Verge's Tom Warren that Microsoft might be allowing third-party OEMs like ASUS to create their own version of the next-generation console.</p>
<p>However, Windows Central's Jez Corden has taken it upon himself to reassure gamers that backward compatibility will be retained at a hardware level without even needing emulation. Corden said as much during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x6c-7VRVxw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of the Xbox Two Podcast</a>. Here's the relevant quote:</p>
<p><em>I can pretty much confirm - I'm like maybe two or three sources off writing a report on this, but the next Xbox is like 100% or 99.999% recurring running your console games, because I've seen that fear out there a lot at the moment, where it's like, oh my god, the next Xbox won't run console games. It's only going to be a PC. It's going to be like the ROG Ally. It's going to be made by ASUS, because Tom put in his article something like, "I believe Microsoft will still make their own hardware." I mean, they've said they will. The thing is, Xbox has said a lot of things in the past. When Tom says, "I believe they're going to make it," that exposes an issue with Microsoft's messaging. People don't really trust what they say anymore because they've gone back on their word so many times.</em></p>
<p><em>But, you know, which is again why I've been told by a bunch of people the next Xbox has the silicon for running Xbox One and Series X and 360 games natively. At least what's in the backwards compatibility program. And then everything you own on XB1 and Series X and S, those will all be playable on the next Microsoft Xbox. But I would not be surprised if there is an Asus ROG gaming all-in-one that also is just a PC, like Tom said. And to be fair, Tom was one of the first people, I think, who officially reported on the idea of third-party Xbox hardware. I didn't believe it at the time, but the more I looked into it, I was like, "Oh [ __ ] yeah, he's right." So, shout out to Tom for that.</em></p>
<p>To be fair, there were never any major worries that Microsoft would abandon its Xbox backward compatibility focus. It has been one of the few initiatives that has earned it widespread acclaim throughout the industry and among gamers.</p>
<p>Currently, the next-generation Xbox is expected to be launched in a couple of years. Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> fans the 'largest technological leap' between generations yet, a lofty claim to be sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mindseye-review-mideye<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At this point, <em>MindsEye </em>has had one of the most bizarre tales in the industry. Originally announced in 2022 as part of "<em>Everywhere</em>", a make-your-own game-style tool like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dreams-review" rel="nofollow">Dreams</a> </em>or <em>Roblox</em>. It was then reannounced in 2023 as a standalone episodic game where each episode would take place in a different time period and link together to an overarching story. Then, IO Interactive picked it up, and it was reannounced again in 2024, this time as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v" rel="nofollow"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a> styled open world game. That's what it finally launched as. Did all these reworks amount to anything, or is this <em>MindsEye </em>rather mid?</p>



<h2>The Worst First Day Known To Man</h2>

<p>You play as Jacob Diaz, a soldier who has gone through a mysterious traumatic event and is left with an implant that he doesn't know anything about, and most of his memories are missing. He arrives in the city of Redrock and crashes on the couch of his best friend Seb. At the same time, he also gets a security job working for Silva Corp, a company that I'd joke is "Evil Tesla," but Tesla is already Evil Tesla, so I guess it's just... normal Tesla.</p>

<p>During Jacob's first shift, he puts down a robot rebellion, stalks an employee, discovers his implant was made by Silva Corp, and then guns down a bunch of highly trained mercenaries. This starts a rolling mystery where Jacob tries to find out more about his implant, while also getting tangled up in each of these groups.</p>

<p>This may sound interesting, but the sheer amount of plot strings involved in this game means some are going to be left behind. What I didn't expect is that nearly every single one of these threads got abandoned. A former member of Jacob's military unit blackmailing him to commit crimes? Forgotten. The mayor's reelection campaign is based on taking control away from Silva Corp? Who cares. The celebrity who may be manipulating the owner of Silva Corp to steal robots? The owner's personal assistant working for a mysterious person who wants Jacob dead? Literally anything involving Seb after the first couple of missions? All of them were forgotten shortly after they started. It's like playing the first quest in a chain of side quests and then never bothering to revisit them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to take a moment to note that the game has characters that are all clear parodies of Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, and Donald Trump. However, it has nothing to say about any of these people. They're just here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only plot line given any substantial time of day is the robot rebellion one, but there's nothing about it that was really that intriguing. If you've seen any sci-fi game, movie, or book in the last 20 years, then you likely know all of the twists in advance. All <em>MindsEye </em>really has to offer is a chain of cliches, none of which are done well enough to really stand out.</p>



<p><em>MindsEye </em>is also full of bizarre line reads. None of the actors are bad, but there are several times when the tone of the read doesn't fit the situation at all. Its clear lines were edited into the wrong place, or the actors weren't given the right context for the scenes. While chasing a car in a sandstorm, Jacob is told to bring in a hacker alive, and he responds with a "copy that" that sounds like he's in tears that doesn't fit the tone of the dialogue before or after at all. At other times, lines felt chopped up, like at one point when a character responds with "that's [...] news," but if it was good or bad news is unsure because the word in the middle was clearly and poorly cut from the line.</p>

<h2>Never Before Have We Been Asked "What If a Company Was Evil?"</h2>

<p>So if the plot is generic and forgettable, the gameplay shouldn't be, right? Well, bad news there too. <em>MindsEye </em>is one of the most basic third-person shooters I've ever played, and channels all the memories of a generic mid-2000s cover shooter. Not like the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/uncharted-lost-legacy-review-chloe-and-nadines-excellent-adventure" rel="nofollow">Uncharteds</a> </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gears-5-review-let-past-die-kill-it-if-you-have-to" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears of Wars</em></a>, which felt good and provided memorable and unique moments. This is closer to something like <em>Damnation</em>, <em>Quantum Theory</em>, or <em>Inversion</em>: forgettable games that brought nothing special to the table, swinging at the king and missing.</p>

<p>The only real attempt to switch up the shooter gameplay comes in the form of your drone. You get it about a quarter of the way into the game, and can either command it to perform actions, or take direct control of it and do these yourself. At first, all you can do is use it as a taser to stun humans and shut off robots. Later, you also gain the ability to hack robots to turn them friendly, and shoot grenades.</p>

<p>The grenade stands out because it's just so much better than anything else you can do that I don't know why you'd use the others once you have it. However, even with all that, none of this makes the drone anything other than a small list of abilities that don't do anything you haven't seen before.</p>

<p>While the majority of gameplay is shooting, you are sometimes pulled away for something else. There are quite a few scenes of watching people slowly walk around and talk through cameras, which isn't much fun. Sometimes you do quick time events to perform CPR or dig a hole. There's a single stealth segment that's so easy there isn't really anything to think about.</p>



<p>Not like you'll be doing much playing. Before and after every gameplay segment you'll often be placed in 10+ minutes of cutscenes. It doesn't help that a lot of these times the gameplay segments are "walk/drive from point A to B." This makes <em>MindsEye</em>'s pace sluggish, with the game really drawing out how long it can take.</p>

<p>Take "Meeting Marco Silva", the game's ninth story mission, for example. First, you take a five-minute drive from a hotel to Silva's company. Then you get a lengthy cutscene where Jacob is interrogated by his boss before she's called and told he needs to go to Silva's house. Another five-minute drive there. Another lengthy cutscene where you meet Silva company owner, Marco Silva. Then another five-minute drive to a party, followed by another lengthy cutscene to meet two more characters. Only after that do you finally get into gameplay.</p>

<p>This can work, lord knows <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-wild-wild-west-part-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></a> have similar formats, but it works because the writing and acting in those games are top-notch. <em>MindsEye </em>barely has half the budget or talent, and it shows. The characters are not as well acted or interesting, and having extended cutscenes or driving segments with them is far more painful and boring.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I noticed at one point that any time a vehicle's driver dies, the car will explode no matter what. This can be really hilarious if all it's doing is sitting still or slowly rolling forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn't help that the driving segments usually end their conversations before you get wherever you're going and promptly become filled with generic and repetitive "go faster" and "why aren't we there yet?" barks.</p>

<p>But at least there's the open world, right? if you get bored of those cutscenes and conversations, you can go wander off and do side quests or other activities? Well, there's <em>MindsEye</em>'s secret. Despite looking like an open-world game, and featuring the entirety of the fictional Redrock City, this isn't an open-world game at all. You just move from story mission to story mission, having to drive through the city without interacting with it in any way.</p>

<p>Want to explore? Once you deviate too far from the path to the next mission you get a game over. Don't like your car? Too bad, you can't steal or take any. The game has assigned you a specific vehicle for this mission and that is the vehicle you get. Think you can get assigned a new vehicle? Blowing up your vehicle is almost always a game over, even if you're not near it or don't need it for the mission anymore. You will look at <em>MindsEye</em>'s world, go "shame I can't be there", and then play the game the way it demands you play it.</p>



<p>In total fairness, there is actually a free roam mode that you unlock once you beat the game. When I loaded into it I was assigned the character model of an old man wearing a gas mask, a bra, gym shorts, and with the words "Can't drink dust" painted on his stomach. I could not figure out how to change this character model. I was also assigned a car, much like the campaign, and I could not change it. There's no map, so who knows what's out there in the city. I found a single-checkpoint race, but that was it.</p>

<p>I also had a pre-made house that I could "interact" with stuff in, but that meant playing a canned animation while nothing happened, like a <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>roleplaying experience but without the other players to actually roleplay with.</p>

<p>It's a real shame because I actually would like to look around Redrock City. In one of the few positives I have to say about the game, Redrock itself is quite pretty and well-made. Sure, it's just Las Vegas, but it really nails that entertainment city vibe, with holograms, drone shows, a big sphere, tons of hotels, and more. I want to explore this city, just the game will not let me nor does it have interest in it.</p>

<h2>Nothing, Nowhere, At No Time</h2>

<p>In what feels like a leftover from when <em>MindsEye </em>was part of <em>Everywhere</em>, there is also a system that lets you build out missions and share them with people. In-game this means you sometimes see a portal and, when you go through it, you are automatically loaded into one of the 25 side missions the developer made at launch. Don't want to wait for the portal? Then you can pause the game, hit a button that says "play", and hop into a mission of your choice at any time.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first side mission I got loaded into was set in the past during Jacob's army days. It opened with him giving a monologue declaring that covert ops has changed, before declaring that covert ops never changes. Then it plays sad country music while you shoot people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The end result, however, is a bunch of generic side missions that often have nothing to actually do with the plot of the game and usually can't be more complicated than a checkpoint race or rolling firefight.</p>

<p>It's all the disadvantages of user-made content, such as canned animations, soundtracks that don't fit, and having to stick to some very specific archetypes, without the endless amount of content that actually makes these missions worth it. It's wild that each one is marked with "made by Build a Rocket Boy" like this is a crowning achievement.</p>

<p>This is also assuming the game works. I played <em>MindsEye </em>on a PlayStation 5, and it was constantly struggling to keep up with the game. It seemed like every time a quest took me into the city, the game's framerate would chug. MindsEye also crashed several times during my playthrough, sometimes during cutscenes, sometimes during firefights, and sometimes when I had the game paused while I took notes for this review.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That isn't even getting into some of the weirder glitches I saw. At one point, I had to chase a car, but the car hit a curb and flipped over. It then just sat there for a minute, me hanging around confused, before it just teleported to where I needed to chase it, causing me to fail the mission because I was too far behind. At another point, two cars pulled up full of soldiers that I think were supposed to get out and shoot me. The doors opened, and all eight soldiers dropped dead on the spot, me not having interacted with them in any way.</p>



<p>Over the course of the game, I saw other strange things like random limbs ragdolling on living enemies, my drone not listening to my commands, random vehicles exploding for no reason, and more.</p>

<p>However, I really don't want people to think there's some hidden gem buried under <em>MindsEye </em>that some patches can help unearth. <em>MindsEye </em>is, simply, fundamentally, a poorly designed, boring game. You can't patch it better without at least a year+ of reworks. Everything is fundamentally busted from the ground up, glitches or no.</p>

<h2><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>MindsEye </em>is so monumentally bad that I have a lot of questions about&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">what happens from here</a>. I can't imagine Build a Rocket Boy continues to exist. It certainly feels like IO Interactive is going to step away from publishing. This is probably the end of <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> producer/designer Leslie Benzies' career. I don't see <em>Everywhere </em>coming out after this mess. If nothing else, <em>MindsEye </em>will at least serve for some fantastic behind the scenes stories down the line.</p>

		<p>SNK has announced that first character from Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves first season pass, Andy Bogard, will be available from June 24th. To mark the announcement of Andy Bogard’s release date, a brand new trailer has been released showing him action. He will be available to play as in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves Episodes of South Town mode with his own story, along with being available in arcade mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="FATAL FURY: CotW ｜ANDY BOGARD" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ja2ku_BwwU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Andy Bogard is the first character as part of the season pass, with four more characters to come later on. Those characters are Street Fighter’s Ken and Chun Li plus returning Fatal Fury characters Mr Big and Joe Higashi. Now to get these characters, you will have to buy the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves Special Edition because the season pass is not available to buy standalone.</p>

<p>In our Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves review, Miguel said, <em>“Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves struggles not only to understand what it wants to be, but which audience it wants to be for. While the game can be a sweat-inducing treat at its highest level of play, casual gamers might not get a lot out of it and the bevy of distracting guest characters and stage song composers in the game make it hard to see the title for its own merits.”</em></p>

            <p>Both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> have set new concurrent user records on Steam over the weekend.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening, which released 10th June for all, and Stellar Blade, which had its long-anticipated PC debut on 11th, both launched with comparatively few problems, and their success has been underlined by the number of players getting stuck in over the weekend. At the time of writing, Dune: Awakening has secured an all-time concurrent peak of 175.5K players, and Stellar Blade 192K.</p>

<p>That puts both games in the top ten of most-played games of the weekend, with just <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, and Apex Legends attracting more players.</p>
<p>The PlayStation-published Stellar Blade made its way onto PC earlier this week and within hours of release, it was already the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-debut-welcomes-record-numbers-for-a-playstation-published-single-player-release">most successful PlayStation-published single-player game on the platform by concurrent count</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>In comparison, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered has a peak player count of 66,436, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Complete Edition has a peak of 56,557, The Last of Us Part 1 has a peak of 36,496 and its sequel - The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered - has a peak of 30,690. Only Helldivers 2 has attracted more players at once, but that's, of course, a multiplayer title.</p>
<p>Dune Awakening soared past 142,000 concurrent players on Steam following its full public release, quickly surpassing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-nears-100k-concurrent-players-day-one">peak established during the five-day head start</a> for those who bought the Deluxe or Ultimate edition. Within hours of the full launch, it blew past 113,000 players and currently has a concurrent record of 175K.</p>
<p>Not sure if either game is for you? In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Eurogamer's original Stellar Blade review</a>, we noted it "has a fair bit of weirdness", but " its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced". Meanwhile, Connor's having a great time with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-now-playing">Dune: Awakening thus far, writing in our review-in-progress</a>: "It's too early for a full review, but as of right now, I see little reason not to recommend giving Dune Awakening's unique offering a chance."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There hasn’t been a truly new entry in the series since 2014's <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, so being stoked to dive into this exciting adventure is perfectly reasonable. Equally reasonable, especially given the game’s controversial price tag, is to wonder how long it’ll take to beat and what type of replayability it offers. Let’s talk about it. - Billy Givens </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-how-long-to-beat-open-world-campaign-1851784366?_gl=1*10o91ha*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk4NDQwMzkkbzY0MCRnMSR0MTc0OTg0NzgyMCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-how-long-to-beat-open-world-campaign-1851784366?_gl=1*10o91ha*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk4NDQwMzkkbzY0MCRnMSR0MTc0OTg0NzgyMCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6ae9cde5a08a8feed1ab8856ad8b24fa" data-recommend-id="image://6ae9cde5a08a8feed1ab8856ad8b24fa" data-format="gif" data-width="1032" data-height="569" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A racer drives behind a car throwing coins.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xboxs-next-generation-of-rpgs-unlock-the-absurd-character-choices-of-our-dreams<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Once BioShock Infinite’s protagonist Booker DeWitt arrives in the floating city of Columbia, the local police set about getting a description of the False Prophet they’ve anticipated for so long. Only trouble is, they’ve spent years whipping the populace into a frenzy of xenophobic fear. And when they speak to eyewitnesses, bigoted terror is all they’re getting back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We hear on the radio that Booker is either a mixed-race dwarf, or a French man with a missing left eye - no more than four foot and nine inches. And when DeWitt stumbles across a sketch artist putting together a facial composite, the overheard conversation is farcical.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He was taller than that… slimmer. His eyes were further apart. Bigger than that. Squinty. His hair was… hmm, red and curly? He looked Irish to me. Yes, like that. Oh, he was certainly an anarchist. You can spot them anywhere, you know.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s silly, but it’s one of BioShock Infinite’s subtlest touches - a way for developer Irrational Games to demonstrate how a backward society is undone by its own narrow belief system. And it sprung to mind during this summer’s Xbox Showcase, where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clockwork-revolution">Clockwork Revolution</a> finally got an extensive reveal.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/13/clockwork-revolution-1749831208949.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Clockwork Revolution's steampunk world is rife with absurd role-playing opportunity. | Image credit: InXile</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">BioShock Infinite was the immediate and obvious reference point for a first-person action game dealing in turn-of-the-century Victoriana and time-twisting mechanics. While we’ll be “playing in the mud”, not up in the skies, InXile’s new game depicts a society where power imbalance has led to a powder keg atmosphere. Here, shootouts are fought with old-timey rifles and temporal magic on factory floors. With a flick of your wrist, you can turn a pile of rubble back into a wall, then take cover behind it. It’s all very consistent with our memories of Irrational’s swansong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s even an early scene in which an aristocrat, fizzing with outrage in the lobby of a police station, offers an eyewitness description of a burglary suspect. “Tall… built rather slim,” the lord mutters to a mechanical constable. “Well, muscular. Was very quick, agile. With a moustache. No, larger!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This time, though, the takeaway is very different. It’s not bigotry that InXile is highlighting, but the flexibility of its character creation tools. Because at its core, Clockwork Revolution isn’t a first-person shooter, but a western RPG in the tradition of Wasteland, The Bard’s Tale and Planescape: Torment - all the games the studio has delivered successors to in the past. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the outset of a campaign, you can define your background as a Gearsmith who scavenged their way through life, or a Bookwarden who was saved from the orphanage by a wealthy sociologist. You’ll pick from traits with names like Street Stalker and Steam Whisperer, and distribute attribute points to determine your resistance to chemicals or flair for conversation. Your journeys back to the past will send ripples into the future, changing the nature of the city around you - a tantalising prospect for fans of RPG reactivity.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The over-the-top tone actually helps support the RPG systems. It creates room for character decisions that don’t just conform to the greatest hits of the genre.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, despite initial appearances, Clockwork Revolution has less in common with Ken Levine’s opus than it does with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>. Obsidian’s upcoming sequel, also featured in this year’s Xbox Games Showcase, is similarly focused on reactive worldbuilding and the many little custom quirks that make up a truly unique player character. As game director Brandon Adler explained during The Outer Worlds 2’s Direct, you’re cast in the role of an Earth Directorate agent - basically a sky marshal. But the game doesn’t lock down your character’s background or personality. You might have joined the Directorate to escape outstanding warrants for crimes you’ve committed. Or you may be a fraud, coasting on a deadly reputation you earned through an accidental killing. You can’t be a Gearsmith, but you can be a Roustabout who fails upwards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both games also share a Wizard-of-Oz quality to their art direction, with slightly garish palettes and over-ornate armour designs that look as if they could have been picked out by Jon M. Chu. They don’t scream to be taken terribly seriously - particularly not when, in Clockwork Revolution, a mechanical doll is screaming to “keep your filthy pickers off me”. In each case, that over-the-top tone actually helps support the granular RPG systems. It creates room for character decisions that don’t just conform to the greatest hits of the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a tangible example of that last point, take a look at Flaws in The Outer Worlds 2. If you take Bad Knees, you’ll move faster throughout the game - but your joints will pop every time you stand up from a crouch, signalling your position to nearby enemies. And if you’re a Kleptomaniac, your character will sometimes nab an item you’re looking at in a shop without warning - leaving you with the task of explaining yourself to the guards. Is that tradeoff worth the better prices you’ll get when selling loot? Only you can decide.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/13/the-outer-worlds-2-1749831262661.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Far from a grounded RPG party, The Outer Worlds 2's rag-tag crew will permit all sorts of oddball approaches. | Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an unconventional power fantasy, you can choose to be Dumb in Obsidian’s RPG - allowing you not only to embarrass yourself in conversation, but to fix a computer by shoving a tin of hot dogs into the fuse box. This scope for wilfully idiotic decision-making is definitely reflected in Clockwork Revolution, too - as when, in the trailer, the protagonist repeatedly ignores an intimidating shopkeep named Uncle Alfie to talk to his underling Errol instead. A couple of unwise dialogue choices later, poor Errol is splattered across the floor, his head bashed in with a candlestick by his agitated employer. “Brains,” chuckles Alfie. “If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t have believed it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scenarios like these are laugh-out-loud surprising - rare in an RPG genre where character and conversation choices are often overfamiliar. More to the point, they simply wouldn’t belong in the more serious universes of Obsidian’s Avowed, or InXile’s Torment: Tides of Numenera. In other words, the absurdity of these settings is helping to keep the genre varied and fresh - and can perhaps even push it forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, zaniness is an acquired taste, and there’s a chance these games may overstep into tonal territory that becomes grating rather than gratifying. But the nature of choice-driven RPGs is that their most extreme aspects are optional. Nobody’s forcing you to wield the Spectrum Dance sabre, a musical sword in The Outer Worlds 2 that rewards you with damage bonuses if you can strike enemies on the beat. It’s your choice, and the tone of your experience can be tuned to your tastes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, I’m looking forward to building up a composite of my very own cockney criminal in Clockwork Revolution - with the help of a robot constable who gets suspicious as I pump points into Social skills. “Why do you think they’re so charismatic?” he asks, warily. “Are you sure this wasn’t a jilted lover?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jeremy Peel is a freelance journalist and friend to anyone who will look at photos of his dogs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-vibrant-visuals-update-finally-has-a-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Minecraft's Vibrant Visuals update finally has a release date: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPWdMDZWM4Y">17th June</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-because-it-simply-wasnt-built-that-way">We've known for some time</a> that Mojang was planning on a visual overhaul for Minecraft, and yesterday (14th June), the studio released a new video not only reminding us just what Vibrant Visuals brings to the game, improving "visual elements such as directional lighting, volumetric fog, and more", but also how the team achieved it.</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="MINECRAFT’S VISUAL REFRESH!" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTOLOErWN4w?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<figcaption>MINECRAFT’S VISUAL REFRESH!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTOLOErWN4w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>And the new feature really does elevate the world of Minecraft. As the developer explains, "every biome has their own atmosphere", so warmer biomes will look more orange and yellowish, while cooler ones will take on a crisper blue appearance.</p>
<p>"This is a visual enhancement - there are no changes to Minecraft's gameplay," Mojang said. "For example, visual shadows will not impact light levels in a game-mechanics sense, or affect where hostile mobs spawn. Vibrant Visuals will be easy to access and approachable for many more Minecraft players, as it will be available on many platforms as a simple menu toggle."</p>
<p>"This is a start on this journey of modernising the look and feel of Minecraft," explained Vibrant Visuals Lead, Dejan Dimic. "So we look forward to hearing more feedback from the players."</p>
<p>Vibrant Visuals is coming to supported devices for those running Minecraft Bedrock Edition, and if your device can run it, you can expect the new feature to be on by default once it updates. It still isn't yet available for Java, but Mojang insists it's "actively working" on it.</p>

            <p>Another day, another Red Dead rumour, but this one comes from John Marston himself - or, at least, the actor who brings him to life, Rob Wiethoff.</p>
<p>In his latest Red Dead Redemption livestream, as spotted by F4D3broboi on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lbextu/i_wonder_what_this_could_mean/">Reddit</a>, Wiethoff was very excited indeed about an upcoming announcement. And while he was coy about the details, he did stress that he was particularly excited playing "<em>this</em> game" - the original Red Dead Redemption - and even suggested we'll know by this time next week.</p>

<p>"I've got such exciting news," he teased. "I can't share it with you right now, and it's absolutely <em>killing</em> me. By the end of this week, hopefully sooner, you're going to - not this week, I guess; probably not as soon as tomorrow, but definitely before Friday… Oh my goodness, the news that I have to share, and I won't be the only one sharing it.</p>
<p>"I cannot wait for you to know what's going on," he added. "And that's all I can say. And I'm not trying to be… I'm just telling, that's the only thing I can think about right now. And you will know soon enough. I can't wait for you to know, I am <em>so</em> excited, but I truly cannot think about anything else, especially playing <em>this</em> game, I can't think of anything else. Oh, then what I want to tell you <em>so</em> bad."</p>

<p>This latest tease comes just days after we heard another rumour that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-next-gen-update-switch-2-port-reports-suggest">Red Dead Redemption 2 may be getting a next-gen update alongside a Nintendo Switch 2 port</a>. YouTuber Nate the Hate stated the cowboy classic will receive the update and a port to Nintendo's latest console release later this year.</p>
<p>The original Red Dead Redemption released way back in May 2010. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-review?page=3">We awarded it 8/10</a>, calling it "an exceptional Rockstar game, one that successfully re-clothes the Grand Theft Auto framework in an exciting, distinct and expertly realised scenario".

These days, making sweeping declarations about something’s quality can feel like a daunting task, as the internet has lost any ability to put opinions into context. If I say something is bad, that must be me making a declarative statement that readers are required by law to agree with. Thus, we get the typical internet defensiveness that follows, and the most annoying person you know starts to nitpick everything you say as being too definitive and not acknowledging that plenty of other people might feel differently.  - Kenneth Shepard </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crimson-desert-preview-summer-game-fest-sgf-action-rpg-1851784440?_gl=1*1swiv1l*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk4NDQwMzkkbzY0MCRnMSR0MTc0OTg0NTcxMCRqNTQkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crimson-desert-preview-summer-game-fest-sgf-action-rpg-1851784440?_gl=1*1swiv1l*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk4NDQwMzkkbzY0MCRnMSR0MTc0OTg0NTcxMCRqNTQkbDAkaDA.">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c0712c5bb4535653fe1b0654235ea0ef" data-recommend-id="image://c0712c5bb4535653fe1b0654235ea0ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen with Varric behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen with Varric behind him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0712c5bb4535653fe1b0654235ea0ef" data-recommend-id="image://c0712c5bb4535653fe1b0654235ea0ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen with Varric behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>With every new report about <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s troubled development, it feels like a miracle that the game came out at all.

We’re five years removed from its original announcement, and Capcom is no stranger to quietly hiding a game away and never releasing it (remember <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-caves-deep-down-capcom-1851364378&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-caves-deep-down-capcom-1851364378"><em>Deep Down</em></a></span>?). So, I let the game disappear from my memory until its name showed up in my inbox. Perhaps it’s fitting then that <em>Pragmata </em>feels a bit like a game out of time, as its gruff old man protagonist, slow-moving enemies, and brutalist sci-fi aesthetic are all evocative of the over-the-shoulder shooters from the PS360 era. Given those seemingly bygone qualities, it’d be easy for <em>Pragmata </em>to feel rote and dated, but what I played was just inventive enough to feel novel.
