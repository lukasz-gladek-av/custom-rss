			<p>Metro Awakening VR was showcased during Sony's State of Play on September 24. It is a highly anticipated VR game set within the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sold-10-million-units-in-5-years-next-mainline-installment-coming-in-202x/">Metro universe</a>. During the trailer, fans got a closer look at what to expect from the gameplay and storyline in Metro Awakening, where players explore the story of one of Metro's most pivotal characters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metro Awakening | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-y4s1AwVBco?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Much like the other games in the franchise, this title is also penned by Dmitry Glukhovsky, and this game serves as a standalone prequel to Metro 2033, where the game follows the story of Serdar, a doctor who is exploring the harrowing tunnels in search of his missing wife. On his journey, his sanity is pushed to breaking point, and he often finds himself seeing and hearing things that aren't there before awakening as Khan, a legendary mystic figure. Khan's wisdom and understanding of the tunnels' supernatural forces will then continue to echo throughout the years, with Khan becoming a spiritual guide and shaping the fate of those who explore the Metro tunnels.</p>
<p>Metro Awakening is currently <a href="https://metroawakening.com/ag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for pre-order</a>, with the game being compatible on the PS VR2, Meta Quest and Steam VR. There are two versions that players can pre-order: The Standard Edition, which includes some Field Medic cosmetics and a 10% discount for the Deluxe Edition.</p>
<p>The Deluxe Edition gives those who purchase it a 48-hour Early Access to the full game, with the Early Access period being available only on the PS VR2 and Steam VR. The Deluxe Edition equally includes the Field Medic pack, as well as the Memories of Polyanka pack, which comes with Nosalis cosmetics. Finally, it will also include a digital VR Concept Art Gallery.</p>
<p>If you want to pre-order Metro Awakening, the Standard Edition will cost $39.99, and the Deluxe Edition will cost $44.99.</p>
<p>"The Metro franchise isn't just about survival; it's also about the powerful stories that emerge from its world. By collaborating with Dmitry, we've created something truly special—a deeply personal narrative that will resonate with both longtime fans and newcomers," says Martin de Ronde, Game and Creative Director at Vertigo Games.</p>
<p>This title is being developed and published by Vertigo Games in collaboration with Deep Silver. Vertigo Games is a VR-specific studio known for making games such as Arizona Sunshine and After the Fall. Deep Silver is, of course, known for Metro but has also created iconic franchises such as Dead Island and Saints Row titles.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/six-days-in-fallujah-command-and-control-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/six-days-in-fallujah%E2%80%99s-shocking-new-update-adds-single-player-missions.991635/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/six-days-in-fallujah-command-and-control-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Six Days in Fallujah is a storied game with a lengthy history. It was created hand-in-hand with the guidance of US Marines who were on the ground in Iraq in 2004, and it’s easily considered one of the most intense first-person shooters ever developed.</p>



<p>Recently, the ‘Command and Control’ update was unveiled by Victura, the game’s developer. This gargantuan update introduces shocking content that makes the game ‘the world’s first documentary videogame’. It also brings to the table the title’s first single-player missions, an AI fireteam, and more than 300 improvements.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-snap-back-to-reality">Snap Back to Reality</h2>



<p>Six Days in Fallujah isn’t a run-of-the-mill arcade shooter. It’s a gritty and harrowing FPS that plants you in the centre of procedurally-generated environments in which every angle and frame presents an imminent danger. It has received global praise because of its reluctance to sugarcoat what was a brutal and historic battle.</p>



<p>Command and Control, the next major update for Six Days in Fallujah, introduces an AI fireteam that can be controlled with the press of a button. It’ll allow users to navigate Six Days single-handedly, backed up by a genuinely intelligent AI squad that can provide cover fire, manoeuvre through obstacles, clear buildings, and watch crosses.</p>



<p>I saw the AI fireteam in action at Gamescom when I sat down with Victura and I was blown away by how intuitive it was.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>This supersized update also introduces the first single-player campaign missions, which are based directly on events that happened during the battle in Fallujah in 2004. The gameplay has been fused with intense and somewhat shocking documentary scenes that show true-to-life violence and snippets of war, making players aware that what they’re experiencing was, at one point, <strong>not </strong>a game. </p>



<p>It has been little more than a year since Six Days in Fallujah was released on PC, and the Command and Control update is preparing to take things to the next level. It has had a graphical overhaul and the team has applied ‘more than 300 technical enhancements’ across the board.</p>



<p>Presently, the game is only available on PC, but there are expectations for a full release on consoles in 2025.</p>

We’re so proud of the engineers who worked long hours and overcame many obstacles to bring <em>Backyard Baseball ’97</em> back to the gaming community.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its Steam page:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Play Like It’s 1997</strong></p><p>Relive the game that started it all! The original Backyard Baseball ’97, now enhanced to run on Steam. Whether you’re picking your dream team, hitting home runs, or just here for the witty banter, step back into the backyard and experience the game that made baseball fun for everyone!</p><!-- AD: content -->

Backyard Baseball ‘97 features all of the realism and statistics of adult baseball games but with simple, intuitive controls that anyone can master.</p><p><strong>Batter Up, Playground Style</strong></p><p>The rules for Backyard Baseball are a hybrid of Major and Little League rules:</p><ul><li>No leading off</li><li>No Injuries</li><li>Bunting is allowed</li><li>Tagging up is allowed</li><li>You can also practice batting</li></ul><p>To get into the swing of things, choose a batter and face Mr. Clanky for some batting practice. This is where you’ll learn just when to click to make your chosen batter hit that ball!</p><p><strong>One Nation Under Pablo</strong></p><p>For many fans, this is the game that debuted one of the most iconic video game characters of the 90s or any era—the legend himself, Pablo Sanchez. Build a roster from a cast of 30 hilarious child athletes who made Backyard Baseball a cult classic.</p><p><strong>Game Modes</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Random Pick-Up</strong> – A quick way to jump right in! The computer chooses a random team for you and itself, and the game starts immediately.</li><li><strong>Single Game</strong> – You take turns with the computer, choosing players from a random pool of characters.</li><li><strong>Season</strong> – You create a team and manage the team through a 14 game series. The opposing teams are computer generated. At the end of the season the best two teams advance to the BBL playoffs (best of three).

Steam’s Leaderboard system lets you compete with friends and players around the world. Track your home runs, strike-outs, grand slams, season wins and more in real-time. See how you stack up and strive to reach the top!</p><p>At our core, we are fans first–not just of video games but of the Backyard Sports franchise. Fans have asked for accessible and legal ways to play their original Backyard titles for years, and we are excited to deliver.</p><p>Without having access to the source code, there are hard limitations on the experience we can create. As an example, we can’t support gamepads, nor the Steam deck, in these original titles. We can’t use the original 32bit code to support modern macOS, as even with an incredibly clever wrapper, macOS can’t execute the binaries.</p><p>We can make the game run buttery smooth, stack it with Steam achievements to test your mettle and give you a chance to batter up to compete in the Steam Global Leaderboards for Home Runs. Baseball 1997 runs well, looks better than ever, and creates a new installation for digital preservation within the Backyard Sports catalog that allows the next generation of fans to fall in love with the title that started it all.</p><p><strong>Development</strong></p><p>With the original source code lost in the years since the 1997 release, Playground Productions has teamed up with Mega Cat Studios to remaster the original titles and bring them to modern devices. Forming a team of avid gamers and <em>Backyard Sports</em> enthusiasts, Mega Cat accomplished a near-impossible feat by hacking the original CD-ROM and developing new game builds to be compatible with current generation PCs. It was a meticulous process that took a considerable amount of time and effort to revitalize the game. Given the intricacies involved in this remaster, <em>Backyard Baseball ’97</em> is only compatible with PC devices at this time, but both Mega Cat and Playground Productions are working diligently to ensure <em>Backyard Sports</em> becomes available on multiple platforms moving forward.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Steam Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Backyard Baseball '97 Trailer - Coming Soon to Steam!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UBCSPbOQGpQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has surprise-launched&nbsp;creature-collecting survival game&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>on PS5, although if you're in Japan, then you're sadly out of luck on that front, possibly due to what's happening with regards to Nintendo.</p>
<p><em>Palworld</em>'s PS5 launch was announced during yesterday's PlayStation State of Play show, where we also got reveals like the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>release date</a> and the existence of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025">followup to&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>, among other things.</p>
<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-sony-deal">teamed up with Sony</a> to expand the game beyond the world of video games back in July,&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s PS5 release probably shouldn't come as too much of a shock, but it's a pleasant surprise for PS5 players nonetheless.</p>

According to the official Japanese&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/Palworld_JP/status/1838716479136763971" rel="noopener" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, the game's Japanese PS5 release date hasn't been decided yet.</p>
<p>Of course, Pocketpair doesn't specifically name the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">patent infringement lawsuit</a> it was recently served by Nintendo, but it's not hard to read between the lines and guess that's the reason for the game's no-show in Japan on PS5.</p>
<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s release on PS5 coincides with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4700159105815693532" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an update released for the game today</a>, and while it's not a major update, it does fix a few bugs, including one in which Pals would get stuck in your base and one that would send you underground when starting a game.</p>

<p>If you're not across&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, it's a creature-collecting survival sim akin to something like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved&nbsp;</em>(whatever the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-palworld-trailers-unleash-more-unspeakable-quasi-pokemon-brutality-and-cuddles">"<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>with guns" descriptors</a> might have you believe).</p>
<p>The game sees you teaming up with creatures called Pals in order to do battle with other Pals, build a base, and generally eke out a life for yourself. It's in Early Access right now, but future updates will include new Pals, new dungeons, and "more pronounced and enjoyable" survival elements.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6360-PPSA23126_00-0112788005082769" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. Even if the Switch could run the game, I'm guessing a Switch version probably isn't going to happen anytime soon. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>An entire campaign walkthrough of a Call of Duty: Ghosts Alpha, codenamed Phantom, has leaked online. </p>



<p>The complete walkthrough comes from YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@alpha-archive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alpha Archive</a>, who uploaded over three hours of the footage to their YouTube channel. You can watch the full campaign walkthrough below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned in the video description, the following footage comes from a build of the game that was released on May 8, 2023. This means that the footage originates from a build that was only six months away from release, showcasing the amount of work that Call of Duty developers need to do in such a short space of time. </p>



<p>Two weeks after this apparent build, Infinity Ward <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxnx3W-HA18&amp;ab_channel=CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed Call of Duty Ghosts</a> to the public.</p>



<p>The game was a massive success for Call of Duty despite the series moving away from the ‘Black Ops’ and ‘Modern Warfare’ brands (although it did sell less than Black Ops 2). Within 24 hours of release, it generated over $1 billion in sales, and as of February 2024, it had sold 19 million units. </p>



<p>Call of Duty Ghosts released on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii U, and PC on November 5, 2013. </p>



<p>What do you think of the stage of the Ghosts campaign six months from release?&nbsp;Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/381/">official Insider Gaming Forums.</a></p>

<p>Pocket Pair <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-launches-for-ps5-consoles-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadow dropped</a> Palworld for PS5 consoles yesterday in 68 countries and regions worldwide, but Japan wasn’t included in the list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the latest post by the Japanese Pocket Pair account on <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_JP/status/1838716479136763971" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, the developers have yet to decide on a release date for Palworld’s PS5 version in Japan. They have apologised to the Japanese community and promised that their staff is doing their best to deliver this version as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players speculate that Palworld’s PS5 version has been delayed in Japan due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-suing-palworld-developer-pocketpair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo and the Pokémon Company’s lawsuit against the developers</a>. Nintendo has alleged that the game “infringes multiple patent rights”. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-lawsuit-reponse-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket Pair has already responded</a>, stating they are “unaware” of the specific patents they have been accused of infringing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palworld, dubbed “Pokémon with Guns,” was released at the beginning of 2024. The game quickly rose to fame, becoming the second-most played game on Steam at the time and attracting over 25 million players.</p>



<p>Palworld is an open-world, multiplayer, survival-crafting game where you use creatures called Pals to do your bidding. Players can use these Pals to fight or work at farms or factories. Players also have the option to sell the Pals or eat them.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Sony's State of Play broadcast on September 24 included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5793/" data-ref-id="2900-5793">a bunch of big news</a>, but perhaps the most significant announcement came at the end when Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima sequel was revealed. The sequel is not Ghost of Tsushima 2, or Ghost of Twoshima, as some envisioned. Instead, Sucker Punch is making a sequel in the form of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-a-ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-announced-at-state-of-play/1100-6526653/" data-ref-id="1100-6526653">Ghost of Yotei</a>, which features a new hero and a different time period.</p><p>In this post, we're rounding up everything we know about Ghost of Yotei, including its release window, story, characters, and setting.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When will Ghost of Yotei be released?</h2><p>Ghost of Yotei is in the works for PlayStation 5 and is set for release at some point in 2025. A specific release date has not been announced, however. The first game, Ghost of Tsushima, was released in July 2020.</p><h2>Preorder Ghost of Yotei sequel</h2><p>Ghost of Yotei was only just announced on September 24 and is not yet available to preorder.</p><h2>Ghost of Yotei trailer</h2><p>The first trailer for Ghost of Yotei was released during the September PlayStation State of Play briefing. The impressive three-minute trailer began with an ominous-sounding voiceover setting things up. "We are beyond the edge of Japan. People come north to disappear," a character says, before the trailer shows Mount Yotei and reveals a year in time--1603. "But you, you are hunting, and now, every ronin here is after you." The trailer then introduces Ghost of Yotei's main character, Atsu, before diving into a montage of sorts showing all manner of environments, people, and places players will journey throughout the game, along with some of the weapons like swords and rifles from Feudal Japan.</p><p>"Our trailer offers a glimpse into this world, but there's so much more to show, and we'll have much more to share in the months ahead, including details about Atsu's journey and the people (and animals) she'll meet along the way," the developer said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1563944156" data-promo-id="0"

It is Sucker Punch's first game "built from the ground up" for the PS5. "We're excited to build on the visual foundation we established in Ghost of Tsushima by making the world feel even more real," the developer said.</p><p>Players can expect "massive sightlines," new skies featuring auroras and twinkling stars, and "more believable movement" from how the wind hits grass and vegetations. The developer said the new setting also provides the team an opportunity to utilize "new mechanics, gameplay improvements, and even new weapons."</p><p>Sucker Punch did not mention how Ghost of Yotei might take advantage of the increased power of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">PS5 Pro</a>, or if the game could ever release on PC.</p><h2>Ghost of Yotei story, setting, and characters</h2><p>Ghost of Yotei is set in 1603, which is more than 300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima. That means the first game's hero, Jin, is not featured in this game. Sucker Punch said it wanted to make something "fresh but familiar," and this meant looking beyond Jin and the island of Tsushima.</p><p>"At Sucker Punch we love origin stories, and we wanted to explore what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask, and uncovering a new legend. This led us to Ghost of Yotei: a new protagonist, a new story to unfold, and a new region of Japan to explore," the studio said.</p><p>Sucker Punch went on to say it is holding back specifics on the story for the time being. But what it can say is that the game takes place in the lands surrounding Mount Yotei, a massive mountain in Ezo, which today is known as Hokkaido.</p><p>"In 1603, this area was outside the rule of Japan, and filled with sprawling grasslands, snowy tundras, and unexpected dangers. It's a far cry from the organized samurai clans who lived in Tsushima, and it's the setting for an original story we can't wait to tell," Sucker Punch said.</p><p>Sucker Punch's Nate Fox told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sequel-playstation.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a> that, upon visiting Shiretoko National Park, where he recorded nature sounds for the game, he witnessed the beauty and danger therein.</p><p>"Inside the park, you have to watch a video telling you about the dangers of bears," Fox said. "Being in this incredibly beautiful park with jagged cliffs and water, yet all the time being aware there were dangerous bears, was electrifying. We strive to bring that into the video game--that feeling of danger."</p><p>Atsu is portrayed by Erika Ishii (Apex Legends, Mortal Kombat 1) in Ghost of Yotei.</p><h2><strong>Is Ghost of Yotei open-world?</strong></h2><p>Ghost of Yotei is an open-world game, and that came with its own set of unique challenges. Jason Connell, the co-creative director, told The New York Times, "One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again."</p><p>Players will have access to a variety of weaponry, including melee weapons like a katana as well as firearms. "We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences," Connell said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373076-746adce92f7340db6569595774003b98026934c4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4373076" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373076-746adce92f7340db6569595774003b98026934c4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4373076"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei is coming to PS5 in 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373076-746adce92f7340db6569595774003b98026934c4.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373077-1a51feadac24df93d5067c20c6815cb5eb3b7846.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373078-1bfb5b0efbe05409fd2d5ab0054a34799700695d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373079-1cc02bccfaea1392d820dc02fcaaedd73bf598f8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373080-2e47be0ef25d627e82605a9b0cc5cd4567494c75.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373081-3a0e4445c27987450bb2193573f6deefbea0752d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373082-7cb6e884f7fb4368e4b9e9b4fc92873d8b8bd777.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373083-18bcb3eae57654c7b3a259528bf3c4ffcb65ee6a.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373084-31c065baafbcb3016390c887fb544229554867e0.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373085-68f8b931e13f633d99838a33d3ea46cf51a6b082.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373086-387b852c584baf8cff17a93f323e413ed052cd9a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4373077,1300-4373078,1300-4373079,1300-4373080,1300-4373081,1300-4373082,1300-4373083,1300-4373084,1300-4373085,1300-4373086" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373077-1a51feadac24df93d5067c20c6815cb5eb3b7846.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373078-1bfb5b0efbe05409fd2d5ab0054a34799700695d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373079-1cc02bccfaea1392d820dc02fcaaedd73bf598f8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373080-2e47be0ef25d627e82605a9b0cc5cd4567494c75.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373081-3a0e4445c27987450bb2193573f6deefbea0752d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373082-7cb6e884f7fb4368e4b9e9b4fc92873d8b8bd777.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373083-18bcb3eae57654c7b3a259528bf3c4ffcb65ee6a.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373084-31c065baafbcb3016390c887fb544229554867e0.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373085-68f8b931e13f633d99838a33d3ea46cf51a6b082.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4373086-387b852c584baf8cff17a93f323e413ed052cd9a.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373077-1a51feadac24df93d5067c20c6815cb5eb3b7846.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373078-1bfb5b0efbe05409fd2d5ab0054a34799700695d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373079-1cc02bccfaea1392d820dc02fcaaedd73bf598f8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373080-2e47be0ef25d627e82605a9b0cc5cd4567494c75.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373081-3a0e4445c27987450bb2193573f6deefbea0752d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373082-7cb6e884f7fb4368e4b9e9b4fc92873d8b8bd777.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373083-18bcb3eae57654c7b3a259528bf3c4ffcb65ee6a.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373084-31c065baafbcb3016390c887fb544229554867e0.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373085-68f8b931e13f633d99838a33d3ea46cf51a6b082.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373086-387b852c584baf8cff17a93f323e413ed052cd9a.jpg"></figure><h2>Who's developing Ghost of Yotei?</h2><p>Sucker Punch, the team that made Ghost of Tsushima, is returning to develop Ghost of Yotei.</p><h2>Ghost of Yotei development news</h2><p>Sucker Punch said when it was considering a sequel to Ghost of Tsushima, the team wanted to "maintain the core pillars" from the first game. That meant taking on the role of a warrior in Feudal Japan, giving players the opportunity to explore the world at their own pace and experience the world's beauty.</p><p>Fox told The New York Times, "When we started working on a sequel, the first question we asked ourselves is, 'What is the DNA of a Ghost game?.'" "It is about transporting the player to the romance and beauty of feudal Japan."</p><p>Ghost of Tsushima was a huge hit for PlayStation, selling 13 million copies, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sequel-playstation.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, so it was likely only a matter of time before a sequel was confirmed. The paper also reported that "other spinoffs" are in the works.</p><h2><strong>Ghost of Tsushima movie</strong></h2><p>In addition to Ghost of Yotei, Sony is making a Ghost of Tsushima movie via its PlayStation Productions division. PlayStation boss Hermen Hulst told The New York Times that these kind of transmedia efforts are just good business when done right.</p><p>"From a business perspective it makes a lot of sense," he said. "When a television series or movie comes out, people are inspired to play again or make friends to play."</p><p>John Wick director Chad Stahelski is attached to direct the Ghost of Tsushima movie, though there haven't been any significant updates on the film in some time. In November 2023, Stahelski said making a movie is "always tricky," but that, at the time, the team was "very close to getting our sh** together..."</p><p>Stahelski is attached to a number of upcoming projects, including the Ghosts of Tsushima movie, a Highlander film, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/michael-b-jordan-to-star-in-rainbow-six-movie-from-john-wick-director-report/1100-6510630/" data-ref-id="1100-6510630">Rainbow Six film</a>. He said the two that are the "closest" and that he's most interested in right now are the Highlander and Ghost of Tsushima projects.</p><p>"Both amazing, amazing properties, the story of Ghost is, also, one of my favorite properties of all time," he said. Whether or not Stahelski makes Highlander or Ghosts of Tsushima first remains to be seen.</p><p>Among other things, Stahelski is working on how they can "push the color palette" on the Ghost of Tsushima movie. "How can you bring that world to life in a very realistic and grounded way?" he said.</p><p>Before this, Stahelski said the success of HBO's The Last of Us TV series demonstrates that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-director-says-tlou-show-proves-video-game-adaptations-can-be-good/1100-6512452/" data-ref-id="1100-6512452">a good video game adaptation "can be done."</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-generated-image-of-nintendos-mario-are-being-expunged-from-the-internet-by-ai<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>An AI powered copyright tool is being used to remove AI generated images of Nintendo characters such as Mario from the internet.</p>
<p>That's according to a report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24252410/nintendo-dmca-notices-mario-fan-art-ai-image-detection">The Verge</a>, whose own reporter Tom Warren received a takedown notice for his AI generated artwork, which showed Mario sitting on a beach with a cigarette in one hand and a steaming (not sure why) pint of beer in the other.</p>
<p>The publication said a company called Tracer has been filing these takedown notices against AI images featuring Nintendo's moustachioed plumber and his pals, including ones made with xAI's <a href="https://x.ai/blog/grok-2">Grok AI tool</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.tracer.ai/">Tracer's website</a>, the company uses "human-in-the-Loop AI and machine learning to dramatically shorten the time from detection to enforcement by intelligently automating the review process and automatically offering an enforcement recommendation".</p>
<p>While The Verge's own Nintendo-related artwork has been removed, a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a>-inspired image depicting Xbox's Master Chief playing a PlayStation 5 remains (see post below). Meanwhile, another <a href="https://x.com/TheMidwestFella/status/1837027062323786069">affected account</a> which generated an image of Luigi as an IDF soldier with the Grok AI tool also said its content has been removed from the internet.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I have also come across a clearly AI-generated image of Mario in possession of drugs still on X, so not all images have been removed by the AI tool.</p>

<p>It is currently unclear whether Tracer is acting on instructions from Nintendo, although the Mario maker is notoriously protective of its property. Most recently, it announced it is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Palworld developer Pocketpair for patent infringement</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps an unexpected side effect of this AI purge by an AI tool, however, is that fanart has also reportedly been removed from social media accounts. "Apparently drawing Nintendo characters [is] copyright infringement," shared one <a href="https://x.com/OtakuRockU_/status/1838289702052405522/photo/1">X user</a>, with an image of their own takedown notice.</p>
<p>Neither Nintendo or Tracer have commented on these takedown notices yet, although Eurogamer has reached out for more.</p>

<p>AI remains a hot topic within the video game industry, with many concerned about its impact on the sector. Earlier this year, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> admitted it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">"dabbled" with AI technology for Foamstars</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-sparks-debate-by-unveiling-ai-tool-to-aid-scriptwriting">Ubisoft unveiled an AI scriptwriting aid in 2023</a>. More recently, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">report by Unity</a> claimed 62 percent of studios use AI at some point during game development, with animation as the top use case.</p>
<p>For more, our Ed spoke with AI expert Dr. Tommy Thompson all about the technology, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">how it is changing video game development forever</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, a followup to 2020's&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>that takes place more than 300 years after the original game. It's due to arrive for PS5 in 2025.</p>
<p>Revealed during yesterday's PlayStation Showcase,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>tells the story of Atsu, a warrior who must contend with the "sprawling grasslands, snowy tundras, and unexpected dangers" of 1600s Hokkaido, which was then known as Ezo.</p>
<p>In the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, we learn that Atsu is hunting someone in the Ezo region, and in the environs of Mount Yōtei specifically. However, an unsavory figure then tells an offscreen Atsu that she's also being hunted by "every ronin" in the region, at which point Atsu kills him. Only fair, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-atsu-forest.jpg?itok=m0Lvu-vl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-atsu-forest.jpg?itok=LWefafvX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>is the followup to 2020's&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We then get to see a montage of shots and scenes from the game, all of which look exactly as breathtakingly impressive as you'd expect from the folks who brought you&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Sony explains that it wanted to look "beyond Jin Sakai's story" in order to explore "what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask", with the aim being to "create something fresh but familiar".</p>
<p>Protagonist Atsu will be voiced by none other than&nbsp;<em>Dimension 20</em>'s Erika Ishii. You can take a look at <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-chat-dimension-20-burrows-end-generational-trauma-and-environmental">our interview with her (as well as Siobhan Thompson) right here</a> if you want to do a little homework before&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>'s release.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, which is more of an atmospheric mood-setter than an explanatory piece, right here.</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>is set hundreds of years after the original, Sucker Punch says it'll have the chance to introduce "new mechanics, gameplay improvements, and even new weapons" to the game.</p>
<p>The studio is keeping the story pretty closely under wraps right now, but it's safe to assume you'll be exploring gorgeous locales in pursuit of whatever Atsu's goal happens to be. We'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>
<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for PS5 next year. At the moment, there's no word of a simultaneous PC version, but since&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-announced-for-pc-with-nvidia-dlss-3-amd-fsr-3-unlocked-frame-rate-and">came to PC eventually</a>, we can likely expect this one to do the same at some point. Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>This year Nintendo finally gave its iconic princesses the royal treatment, putting both <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-showtime-review">Peach</a> and Zelda center stage in their own games. But with all due respect to the monarch of the Mushroom Kingdom, the head of Hyrule’s adventure isn’t just another second-tier spinoff. Trust me when I say that in every way that matters, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom <em>is</em> the next mainline Zelda game (the 2D line, at least). It takes all of the linear dungeon crawling and key item-style progression I’ve missed from the older games in this series and perfectly combines them with the ridiculously clever, freeform problem solving that made <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">Tears of the Kingdom</a> so captivating. It doesn’t always take this exciting step forward with unflappable royal grace, but it’s still easily become one of my favorite Zelda games – with or without a green tunic on my back. </p><p>While there are plenty of substantial mechanical changes to the way Echoes of Wisdom plays as compared to its predecessors, the practical differences of its main character switcheroo are actually pretty negligible – there were even a couple of times during my roughly 23-hour playthrough where I briefly got confused by a conversation because I legitimately forgot I wasn’t Link. Perhaps the most surprising difference to me, however, was how it makes the story that much more engaging. Rather than being yet another remix of a destined, mute swordsman’s journey to save the day, Zelda is <em>the</em> central character of the plot. As a result, I felt much more important and involved as I explored Hyrule to seal the mysterious purple rifts that were forming across my kingdom.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Of course, the most consistent reminder that you aren’t Link is the more indirect way Zelda actually interacts with that world and fights the wide variety of enemies within it. Thanks to a little floating friend named Tri who accompanies you, you have the power to create echoes of any enemy you defeat and an array of specific objects you come across. That means defeating a Moblin once will let you summon it to automatically fight for you in the future, and you’ll frequently create beds, boxes, and even trampolines to clear gaps or climb ledges as you explore. The menu you use to swap between your collection of summonable creatures and items does quickly balloon into an annoying-to-navigate pile, but it’s so cool that the number of echoes you can actually have out at the same time is only capped by an upgradable point system – starting at three and going up from there – and that always feels fun to plan around rather than than overly limiting. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It encourages the same "break the game” creativity as Tears.</p></div><p>Echoes encourages the same “go ahead and break our game” creativity that Nintendo embraced with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">Breath of the Wild</a> and doubled down on with Tears of the Kingdom, but this time in a 2D Zelda game that borrows the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/19/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review">Link’s Awakening</a> remake’s delightfully toy-like art style and occasional side-scrolling segments (as well as a bit of its inconsistent framerate, which isn’t wildly distracting but does also feel sort of inexcusable at this point. Where’s that Switch 2, Nintendo?). </p><p>I get that the echo system may sound far too quirky to be considered anything but an experimental spinoff of the traditional sword and shield combat we’ve seen in pretty much every 2D Zelda since the original in 1986, but the reason it’s able to stay so distinctly Zelda is because many of these echoes essentially act as classic key items. You may not have a hookshot, but that floating floor tile you’ll only find in a certain cave can suddenly let you clear large pits in a similar way; there’s no shovel this time, but a little mole friend will happily dig up secrets for you; and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-review">Skyward Sword</a>’s Gust Bellows isn’t back, but holding a Wind Cannon above your head will clear away piles of sand just as well.</p><p>The fact that so many of the most useful echoes are either tucked away in optional caves or found in dungeons (alongside some important central abilities, like Tri’s power to lift and move any object, Ultra Hand-style) gives Echoes of Wisdom a sense of progression that I must admit I missed while playing Breath of the Wild and its sequel. You still have immense freedom to explore where you want and solve problems in unexpected ways, but I love that you also have that classic Zelda feeling of leaving most dungeons with something new in your pocket. Sure, sometimes you’ll just get another middling summonable monster you’ll probably never use – but other times you’ll casually be handed something like the Water Block, a Minecraft-like cube which fundamentally changed how I moved around the map by letting me swim up or along walls with ease. </p><p>The exceptional puzzle rooms in Echoes of Wisdom also make great use of the absurd range of options you are given. Seeing a chest just out of reach would get my mind racing right away as I thought back through the exhaustive list of stuff I could summon that might help me out. That could be as simple as creating a monster to hit a switch for me, or as weird as stacking multiple things in just the right way to let me grab an object with Tri and then lift it past a series of obstacles and onto a button from afar. There is rarely one right answer, and the “a-ha!” moments are plentiful. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Exceptional puzzles make great use of your absurd range of options.</p></div><p>That said, the one place Echoes of Wisdom doesn’t really benefit from being built entirely around summons is combat. While puzzles really are more of the focus this time around, there’s essentially just as much combat as ever as well, and summoning a few echoes only to watch them slowly attack your target isn’t exactly thrilling stuff. This is coming from someone who typically <em>loves</em> playing as summoning classes in games like Diablo or Frosthaven, but in those instances you usually aren’t just spawning in a few dudes and then sitting on your hands until they finish the job. You do get some faster or harder-hitting options (the wide-spinning Peahat was an early favorite of mine) as you go, and fights are by no means unpleasant or anything like that, but swinging a sword as Link is still just fundamentally more fun. </p><p>Thankfully, Zelda isn’t a helpless damsel who relies entirely on others to fight for her: she literally has Link’s sword and can swap to “Swordfighter Mode” to attack directly at pretty much any time. However, your energy bar drains quickly while in that form, and that resource is limited enough that you can’t rely on it too heavily. The bar can be upgraded, but running out in the middle of a harder fight or a boss can be a real hassle if you don’t have any energy recovery items on hand, so I was always a little cautious about when I chose to pull out my blade. That means your combat options are essentially letting someone else handle fights or taking matters into your own hands with the pressure of a ticking clock, both of which <em>are </em>entertaining, but not to the same buttery smooth degree that echoes improve exploration and puzzle solving. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Combat does at least get a little more interesting later on thanks to the completely optional (and surprisingly easy-to-miss) automaton system. This small selection of buildable robots don’t cost any points to pull out of your pocket, but you can only use one at a time, they need to then be wound up manually before they start doing their job, and you’ll have to pay to repair them if they take too much damage. The payoff can be worth it though, with options like a Deku Baba that can eat enemies whole and a sword-wielding Moblin with a slow but massive area-of-effect slice. That makes them a pretty neat high risk/high reward option, and gives you a little more to do after summoning echoes in combat without having to spend any energy.</p><p>Another way automaton power is balanced is that you have to assist one character in constructing by completing a series of side quests – and Echoes of Wisdom has a <em>lot</em> of side quests. While it took me roughly 23 hours to roll credits, you could certainly make it there much faster if you are mainlining the story. My playthrough was fairly comprehensive, completing every quest I could find and hunting down collectibles, but I also wasn’t shooting for 100% completion. Going out of my way always felt worth it, be that because of the tangible rewards I would get, the useful new echoes I might find, the charming characters and stories I would encounter (a village of adorable Deku Scrubs obsessed with sweets is a real highlight to look out for), or the multiple entirely optional mini-dungeons I could complete, each of which has its own unique boss fight. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Tom's Top 10 Zelda Games</h3><p>Here is my personal top 10 Zelda games in order.</p></div><p>Exploring Hyrule in search of these extras is one of the clearest places that Echoes of Wisdom feels like a Zelda chimera – an explicit hybrid of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/01/23/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past-vc-review">A Link to the Past</a> and Tears of the Kingdom. Longtime fans will notice that parts of the map are nearly exact replicas of the SNES terrain, down to the little elevated platform just south of Hyrule Castle that Link’s house was on (though it’s absent here). Meanwhile, other areas have defining features of the Breath of the Wild map where you would expect them, from the Gerudo village in the southwest to an electricity-filled jungle in the southeast. The Zora are even split into two rival tribes: one with the fishtail heads of their modern design and the other with the finned-faces of the ones that would pop out of the water to attack you more than 30 years ago. In that way, Echoes of Wisdom feels like Nintendo fully embracing both the past and the present of Zelda, mixing what this series used to be and what Breath of the Wild so abruptly pivoted toward into a single game that honors and makes the best of both halves. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is far greater than a gimmicky spinoff led by Zelda instead of Link. Its echo summoning is a clever concept used to combine the expertly crafted dungeons, puzzle rooms, and item progression you’d expect from a classic-style 2D Zelda with the borderline unhinged freedom provided by Tears of the Kingdom. This experiment doesn’t produce an entirely perfect result, with a little bit of clunky menu management and combat that simply isn’t quite as compelling, but it’s an impressively successful one all the same. Echoes of Wisdom is also a glowing proof of concept for how a modern 3D Zelda could recapture some of what fans like me miss about the series before Breath of the Wild without sacrificing the intoxicating creativity it introduced. Creating echoes aside, if this is the future of Zelda, I can’t wait to see more.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A release date was not announced. <span id="more-917322"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Zanrai Interactive:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>VISEGUNNE</em> is a non-bullet-hell shoot ’em up where explosive action unfolds around you: cities are leveled, space colonies collapse, and orbital structures crumble catastrophically. Between missions, interact with your squad to uncover secrets about a post-apocalyptic Earth, visit shops to upgrade your arsenal, or customize your machine’s look in the garage. Each mission offers intuitive controls and scalable difficulty settings, welcoming both newcomers and seasoned veterans alike. Set in an era where the human soul is harnessed as a power source, join the DIVINITY SPACE DEFENSE CORPORATION’s elite mercenaries to confront pro-Earth terrorists threatening the fragile peace of space. With a charismatic cast of characters, a killer soundtrack, and screen-melting effects, <em>VISEGUNNE</em> is a thrilling modern homage to retro <a title="Genres > Action [2,184 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a>.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>When scientists discover evidence of the human soul, long dormant divides among the nations of Earth erupt into global war. Colonists residing off-world avoid the bloodshed, but live in fear that the planet’s conflicts might soon spill into space. With no formal military of their own, each colony resorts to employing mercenaries and privateers for their protection. The most influential of these firms is the DIVINITY SPACE DEFENSE CORPORATION, utilizing top-secret war machines capable of harnessing a user’s spirit as an endless source of energy. These SOUL-CAPABLE combat vehicles are unmatched in battle and after a century of this order, DIVINITY has grown to dominate colonial affairs, effectively quarantining Earth’s wars and its toxic politics to the planet’s surface. Earth sympathizers are routinely hunted down.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>But now, a new wave of pro-Earth fanatics threaten the peace of space, demanding an end to DIVINITY’s policy of segregation. Spurred on by the illegal broadcasts of an enigmatic android holy-man known as Kourosh, these dissidents have seized control of a colony and are demanding an end to DIVINITY’s blockade of the planet. As SOUL-CAPABLE pilot End Visegunne, your squad’s mission is to eliminate these terrorists, dismantle their network of co-conspirators, and return peace to the colonies.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_917319"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Traditional Non-Bullet-Hell Action</strong> – Gameplay inspired by classic horizontal shoot ’em ups.</li><li><strong>Gorgeous Retro Visual Style</strong> – Lovingly crafted pixel art and massive set-piece explosions, with a visual style influenced by late ’80s giant robot anime.</li><li><strong>Narrative-Driven <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,772 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a></strong> – A unique cast of characters and story-oriented mission design tell a tale about war, power, and disinformation.</li><li><strong>Diverse Arsenal</strong> – Over 20 different weapons to discover and upgrade, each offering game-changing strategies and attack styles.

                <p>Unless you had a CRT TV or a Sinden light gun, Time Crisis has been largely out of reach for most fans of the arcade shoot-'em-up classic. That's all set to change, as Dashine Electronics has announced GAIME, a new device that comes with an "AI-powered" light gun that the company claims can work on modern-day LCD TVs and comes preloaded with Time Crisis.</p><p>Pricing starts at $90 for the base unit and $120 for a deluxe version that adds in a pedal controller, but there is no release date yet for the launch of the GAIME. Dashine Electronics plans to showcase it at the Tokyo Game Show this week, and on its <a href="https://www.tasseidenki.co.jp/gaime" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official website</a>, the company says that the GAIME uses "state-of-the-art" AI technology to create a seamless plug-and-play experience.</p><p>"The AI Gun is engineered to self-calibrate by intelligently detecting your screen, offering unparalleled accuracy and ease of use. It works from various angles and distances, supports all kinds of common screen sizes, [and] can be tilted to shoot--it is designed with the casual gamer in mind."</p><p>For rail-shooter fans, this could be an affordable way to play Time Crisis or any other games if they're ported to the GAIME. There are other solutions--like <a href="https://arcade1up.com/products/time-crisis-deluxe" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcade 1Up's Time Crisis cabinet</a> if you can spare $750--or the <a href="https://sindenlightgun.com/" rel="nofollow ">Sinden light gun</a>, from which the Time Crisis cabinet gets its technology.</p><p>This is sold at a similar price to the GAIME and works primarily for PC, while PS1 and PS2 consoles are supported via a physical mod.</p>

		<p>Sony has confirmed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games coming along in October 2024, with three titles that all subscribers will get a hold of from next week that include remade horror, psychological anime and some oiled up wrestling.</p>
<p>Let’s see what they are!</p>


<h2>What are the PS Plus October 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which happens to be 1st October.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dead Space</strong></li>
<li><strong>Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!</strong></li>
<li><strong>WWE 2K24</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The headline act here really is Dead Space, the 2023 remake of the PS3 and 360 horror classic. “EA Motive have done incredible work with the Dead Space remake to bring a horror classic up to date,” Nick wrote in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/26/dead-space-remake-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc/">Dead Space review</a>, “injecting true horror back into the genre alongside considered changes and expansions to the original story. It’s hands down one of the best remakes ever made, and it’s like playing Dead Space for the first time all over again. Welcome back, Isaac.”</p>


<p>Then there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/12/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-side-stories-pc-switch-xbox-ps4-ps5/">the expanded psychological horror of Doki Doki Literature Club</a>. What initially seems to be a romancing visual novel ends up unfolding into something very, very different. Can you crack the code and reach the perfect ending?</p>
<p>And finally, we have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/22/wwe-2k24-launches-march-8th-classic-match-types-confirmed/">WWE 2K24</a>, which looks to celebrate 40 years of WrestleMania with a cast of superstars from across the decades, including&nbsp;“Stone Cold” Steve Austin, Undertaker and Andre the Giant, alongside more contemporary stars “The American Nightmare” Cody Rhodes, John Cena, Rhea Ripley and Roman Reigns.</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the September 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab September’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 1st October, so make sure to grab them while you can! They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quidditch Champions</strong></li>
<li><strong>MLB The Show 24</strong></li>
<li><strong>Little Nightmares II</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/september-2024-ps-plus-monthly-games-confirmed-quidditch-champions-more/">Head here for more details.</a></p>

<p>During yesterday's PlayStation State of Play presentation, Capcom revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>release date is February 28th. Don't worry, though; it's also coming to other platforms on that date, not just PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>The event also brought a reveal for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' flagship monster, which is a new winged creature known as Arkveld. Capcom says it "hails from a long-extinct species with an ecology shrouded in mystery".</p>

<p>We also got to see new monsters like the Leviathan-type Uth Duna and the Brute Wyvern Quematrice, which inhabits the Windward Plains. Of course, the game will include far more monsters than just these three, but these are some of the new creatures you'll be battling.</p>
<p>You can check out the new promotional trailer for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>right here. It gives a good idea of what you can expect from the finished game in terms of aesthetics and style, and there's a splash of gameplay in there too.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it's the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-teases-monster-hunter-wilds-at-game-awards-2023">latest game</a> in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-series-sales-100-million-anniversary">hugely successful titles</a> like&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World</em>.</p>
<p>The first&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game to be made with current-gen consoles specifically in mind, <i>Wilds&nbsp;</i>sees you journeying into the Forbidden Lands in order to investigate tales of a "mysterious monster" that attacked a village.</p>

		<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures, the blocky retelling of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, is launching on 14th November, Sony has announced. The quirky reimagining is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, PC and Nintendo Switch… but obviously not Xbox.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Horizon Adventures - Pre-Order Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fNAdje1kPxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Developed in partnership between Guerrilla and Studio Gobo, it’s one of the first times I can think of a big budget game being given the Lego treatment, similar to TT Games’ enduring film adaptations.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is a cute and quirky take on the thoroughly serious sci fi adventure that Aloy went on in 2017. An ancient evil is still seeking to destroy the world, and you’ll have to journey through the lush meadows, forests, and over the mountains of Earth to save it from a man named Helis and the evil that they follow.</p>
<p>Lego Horizon Adventures will be playable with both couch co-op and in online play.</p>

<p>The team has done a fantastic job of realising the whole world out of Lego-style bricks and pieces, when many games would have combined more traditional 3D game geometry with isolated block sections and structures.</p>
<p>There’s also plenty of space for some extra shenanigans, and the pre-order trailer showed how the game is being sprinkled with PlayStation easter eggs and in jokes. You’ll be able to customise your characters as well as your home, as well.</p>
<p>This will make the game and universe much more suitable for younger players, but just in case you’re feeling it’s a little bit immature, Lego Horizon Adventures is coming out just a couple weeks after<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launches-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/"> Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>. This remaster looks to bring the original game up to the standards of Horizon Forbidden West, making use of the PS5 and PS5 Pro to push a bunch of new graphical effects. There’s also around 10 hours of freshly captured conversation mocap, to try and bring more life to the dialogue in the game – one of my biggest criticisms from its original launch.</p>

			<p>There’s plenty of tropes that have persisted through the 35-year history of The Legend of Zelda, the developers over the decades painting with the same motifs of Triforces, a battle through the ages with Ganon and Ganondorf, and a young boy in a green tunic for the hero. It’s a testament to the series creators that they’ve still been able to tell such compelling tales while using the same brush and colour palette. But it’s also time for a change. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> it’s time for Zelda to be the hero of her own story.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom — Overview Trailer — Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/01onjjAUnOQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now it’s time for Zelda to save the land of Hyrule from a great peril, as it’s Link and not Zelda that’s sucked into mysterious purple rifts that are spreading across the land. And that simple-sounding change of protagonist brings with it massive changes for how this game actually works. Nintendo and developer Grezzo could have simply given Zelda a sword and shield and sent her out in a green dress, but instead they’ve cooked up wholly new and refreshing gameplay ideas for her to journey with.</p>


<p>Presented with a Triwand by the helpful rift-healing sprite Tri, Zelda becomes more of a trickster wizard than a frontline brawler. The Triwand enables her to copy all manner of objects through that she find through the world and then summon them as ‘echoes’ to help her get around. Want to get up onto a ledge? Well, laying small tables, crates and beds can create an impromptu staircase to hop up. Need something to throw at the traditional Zelda game enemies? Summon a rock, pick it up and toss it at them! You’re limited only by the amount of energy pips that Tri has, and the temporary cost that each echo has.</p>


<p>There’s other abilities lent to Zelda by Tri more directly, namely being able to Bind to objects and move them around with Zelda, no matter how big they are, or to have Zelda lock to and move with them, such as with a moving platform. You can switch back and forth while linked, which brings huge possibilities together for the environmental puzzling. Attach to a wall-climbing spider, and you’ll get up and over that wall, no problem!</p>
<p>Once enemies are defeated for the first time, their form can also be absorbed into the Triwand and summoned forth at will, letting you bring forth echoes to fight for and defend you. It creates these quirky little battles where you either try to spam creatures at enemies, or actually apply a little bit of puzzle logic to the situation before you. Octorocks are pretty effective on water, as they sink and hop up to shoot at a target, but if it’s a flying enemy, maybe a steadily respawning swarm of Keese would do the trick instead? Thick grass? It’s time to set everything on fire with a Zol. Or you’d better set a Darknut against shrieking zombies, as they struggle to do any damage to its armour.</p>

<p>It’s often a bit messy, especially when there’s multiple enemy types, or battles are drawn out if you head to a more difficult spot early in the game, and Zelda’s mainly got to run away, avoid focus and the put her most powerful ability to use at exactly the right time: the Swordfighter form.</p>
<p>This effectively turns her into a blue spectral Link, sword in hand, able to wail upon enemies and deal a lot of more focused damage in short order. However, this drains the energy meter, which limits the amount of time this is available for. Inevitably, you save it for more special occasions, such as the damage phase of a boss battle after you’ve knocked it out through evasion and echo damage – handily these also tend to see a sprinkling of energy appear to top Zelda’s energy up.</p>
<p>Of course, maybe this is all just my playstyle, because it feels like there’s so much creativity and more options available to you, and you can express yourself a little more than you might initially expect. In combat, you can spam those echoes, or you could summon one and then Bind to hold it in front of you, perhaps. My go-to for bridging gaps and getting higher was simply to layer bed upon bed in gravity-defying fashion. Maybe you’d rather use a trampoline on occasion, or attach to a bird and let them take you places. Bed stairs are pretty handy though, because you can have a nap and regain health…</p>

<p>The main problem with this summoning system is that the way you access all the echoes you collect is with a single line horizontal list. You can filter it to be of the most recent summons, most used, most recently caught, and by category, but it’s always just a single endless list that you’re picking from, and that’s inherently unwieldy once you’ve got more than ten. You can access a grid-based inventory view in your notebook, but it’s still not a perfect system. It’s very easy to get stuck in a rut of just constantly reusing the same echoes because of this – see my go-to stairs of beds.</p>
<p>It’s also pretty easy to be all fingers and thumbs when trying to do this in the heat of the moment. The echo selector does pause time – you should use the left bumper instead of the D-pad, always – but then targeting an echo under pressure is a bit tricky, and that’s before trying to use Tri’s ability to grab things. Some of the chaotic feel of combat simply comes from you not being directly involved, with only limited ability to direct echoes and them being slow to wind up their attacks, and the controls fundamentally being different to a traditional Zelda game.</p>

<p>There’s also a good few side-scrolling sections and light puzzle platforming, most commonly within the rifts and the Still World. Side-scrolling puts a different spin on how you use your abilities and echoes, a little sprinkling of something a bit different alongside the top-down adventure. There’s also other more incidental ideas, with costumes, smoothie blending, weapon upgrading, and charms to wear.</p>
<p>On the whole, it’s quite a light-feeling adventure, and a big part of that is thanks to the art style. Grezzo has continued on from their work on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-switch-review-the-legend-of-zelda-remake/">Link’s Awakening remake</a>, and it absolutely works for this game as well, the chunky character designs and world, the tilt shift-ish effect, and more generally the tone of the story that’s being told – some of the main quest stories feel particularly child friendly.</p>

<p>As gorgeous as this art style is, Echoes of Wisdom also has echoes of one of the nagging problems of the last time it was used. The Link’s Awakening remake had frame rate stutters aplenty, and that hasn’t been dispelled for this new game. It doesn’t really get in the way of the gameplay, given the general tone and pacing of this adventure, but it’s a shame to feel the frame rate juddering so often.</p>

					<p>“Why are the games called ‘The Legend of Zelda’ when you always play as Link?” is an inescapable question asked by pretty much everybody who encounters Nintendo’s beloved series, and yet, the company has never really provided a satisfactory answer beyond, “Uh, just because.” Well, this four-decade-long confusing state of affairs is being resolved (for now) as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> finally gives the Princess herself a starring role. This also marks the first original 2D Zelda title since 2013’s A Link Between Worlds, so a lot of longstanding fan requests are being satisfied at once here.</p>
<p>Is The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom another properly-epic entry in the franchise? Or does the game take some unwise steps? Time to shine the spotlight on Zelda’s big debut…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom begins on a familiar note, as Link, controlled by the player for a few brief minutes, battles Ganon in order to save Princess Zelda. Ah, but upon taking down the big pig, a mysterious rift opens open, drawing Link in. Just before our green-clad hero disappears into the depths, he manages to free Zelda from her crystalline prison with a well-placed arrow and she escapes with an ever-growing rift on her heels. From this point on, the player takes on the role of Zelda, and it becomes clear this version of Hyrule isn’t in great shape. The land is beset by numerous rifts, which have a habit of sucking in innocent citizens and producing evil copies in their place. This happens to Zelda’s dad the King, whose doppelganger promptly sends her to the dungeon.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Thankfully, Zelda’s adventure doesn’t end there, as she soon meets Tri, a little energy sprite eager to help with her quest, and gets her hands on the Tri Rod, a powerful wand that allows her to create “echoes” of various objects and enemies. It seems Tri’s spherical friends have long been tasked containing Hyrule’s rifts, which connect to a dark alternate dimension known as the Still World, but somebody or something has been trapping them, allowing the rifts to spread unchecked. Armed with the Tri Rod and Tri’s ability to enter the Still World at key locations, it’s up to Zelda to clean up the rifts, find Link and the King, and figure out what’s behind all this turmoil.</p>
<p>It’s certainly great to see Zelda step out of her usual supporting role in Echoes of Wisdom, but if you’re expecting a plot that feels markedly different from what this series has served up in the past, you may be disappointed. The game doesn’t really do much with Zelda as a character, nor does it do a lot to develop her relationship with Link. While Nintendo does throw out a bit of a mid-game twist, the overall plot is short of big shocks or emotional stakes and its big finale feels like a minor letdown from a storytelling standpoint. Of course, most Zelda stories are relatively simple, but the best ones still manage to deliver occasional affecting, memorable moments. Echoes of Wisdom’s story, by comparison, just kind of washes over you, leaving little behind.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>All that said, while Echoes of Wisdom’s story doesn’t quite captivate, it’s version of Hyrule does. 2D Zelda worlds have often felt a bit lonely, but Echoes of Wisdom brings a Breath-of-the-Wild-like vibrancy to its Hyrule. This take on Hyrule includes around half a dozen towns, each bustling with unique and charming NPCs worth getting to know. The quirky side of Zelda is on full display here, as you can indulge in pastimes like dressing up like a cat to talk to Hyrule’s feline population, finding stamps for a distinctly Tingle-like collector, and more. This is all brought to life via the same charming toy-like presentation as the 2019 Link’s Awakening remake, albeit with a new level of detail and variety. Thankfully, while you’ll still encounter some stutters and stumbles, Echoes of Wisdom also runs better than the Link’s Awakening remake. So, even if EoW’s story didn’t always grab me, I was eager to get back to the game’s Hyrule and its many colorful residents even after rolling credits.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Echoes of Wisdom’s Hyrule is larger and more open than past 2D entries in the series (it’s at least twice as large as A Link to the Past’s map), but make no mistake, those looking for a bit more structure after back-to-back “open-air” Zeldas will be pleased. While there are certain points in Echoes of Wisdom where you can choose the order in which you tackle a handful of regions and their dungeons, the rifts covering Hyrule allow the game’s developers to lock off parts of the map and lead you through a fairly specific campaign. While I don’t deny that clever fans may eventually discover something, I don’t think there’s a way to jump directly to the end of the game or skip any key steps along the way. That may irk some, but, personally, I’ve increasingly begun to feel the “finish the game whenever you want” gimmick of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tears of the Kingdom</a> hurt those games’ campaigns more than it helped.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Most of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom’s campaign follows a set formula – venture to a new region, meet the people that live there, then complete two or three smaller tasks in order to access the entry spot to that region’s large rift, which contains its dungeon. The most common of the lesser tasks you have to complete is clearing out small rifts, which almost feel like platformer stages (EoW gives you a full-on jump button). These small rifts task players with navigating floating debris in order to free several of Tri’s friends (usually four of five bunches of them) which does bring to mind the “collect X number of things” approach of BotW and TotK’s dungeons in a way that may illicit groans from a segment of the Zelda fanbase. That said, small rifts are generally brief (most don’t take more than 20 minutes) and don’t wear on you.</p>
<p>In addition to the small rifts, other challenges are mixed in – stealth sections, puzzle-filled caves, ect. Once you’ve completed your three-or-so lesser objectives, it’s time to enter the large rift, all of which contain a dungeon. And yes, for those concerned, these are real, full-on dungeons with small keys, a boss key, map, and the whole deal. In fact, these dungeons feel notably old-school, like a modernization of the labyrinths you may have once tromped through in A Link to the Past or Link’s Awakening. Needless to say, the “Bring back real dungeons!” lobby should be pleased by what Echoes of Wisdom serves up (a hearty seven full dungeons and some other dungeon-like experiences beyond that).</p>

<p>Zelda may be new to this adventuring thing, but she has no shortage of tools for exploring Hyrule, the Still World, and its dangerous dungeons. Of course, Echoes of Wisdom’s spotlight tool is the Tri Rod, which allows Zelda to summon echoes of mundane objects tables and beds, more fantastical things like floating cubes of water and flying floor tiles, and basically ever non-boss enemy you encounter in the game. Your summoned monsters can be siced on other baddies or, in some cases, used for other purposes (you can glide while clutching a Keese and spiders create climbable threads, for example). Tri can also “bind” to things you create, and a few other objects, allowing you to move them around at a distance much like Ultrahand Grab function from TotK, adding another layer to EoW’s puzzle-solving toolbox.</p>
<p>While I haven’t carefully counted them all, I’ve probably collected nearly 100 echoes, and while it’s cool to have so many options at your disposal, sifting through them all can be a minor annoyance. The game does give you limited options for sorting your echoes — by last one used, most used, the last acquired, and so on — but there are going to be times where you're stuck just scrolling through your increasingly-long list for the thing you need. That said, the game does pause when you're navigating your list and in most areas and dungeons you can get by with a half-dozen-or-so key echoes of your choice.</p>

<p>Nintendo has heavily hyped the freedom the echo system give players, but in my experience, Echoes of Wisdom’s puzzles are a bit less open-ended than something like Tears of the Kingdom. Typically, there is a set solution to a puzzle — move a rock that’s behind a gate onto a switch, for instance — with the player having some freedom about what<em> specific</em> combination of objects and enemies they want to use to proceed. It’s rare that you’re able to fully short-circuit or skip a puzzle as you can in BotW or TotK, or at least I wasn’t able to. Again, I don’t discount that particularly clever fans will figure out things I didn’t, but generally speaking, EOW feels like it provides a healthy measure of freedom within the confines of a more traditional Zelda structure, which actually felt like a nice balance to me. I realize some may miss the giddy “do whatever, all the time” ethos of the open-air Zeldas, but the series’ classic approach to puzzle and world design is something many fans, myself included, find satisfying in its own right. There’s room for both approaches here in 2024.</p>

<p>While I enjoyed The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom’s approach to puzzle and dungeon design, I wasn’t always captivated by its combat. As mentioned, players can summon any number of different monsters and direct them to attack other enemies using a basic targeting system. This works, but only <em>just</em>, as your AI allies are pretty stupid, attacking slowly and often getting stuck on or behind objects. They'll eventually get the job done, and you can pitch in by tossing rocks and other objects at baddies, but the process feels too drawn out, particularly early on when you only have low-level monsters at your command.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom12.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>But Echoes of Wisdom doesn’t force you to rely entirely on monster echoes to do your fighting. Relatively early on, you'll gain the ability to transform into Swordfighter Form, which allows you to tackle enemies head-on with a sword, and later, a bow and bombs. Unfortunately, you can only get to wield a sword for a fairly limited time, with an energy bar quickly dwindling while you’re in the form. Limiting the use of Swordfighter Form is a somewhat questionable decision to begin with, but it can be downright frustrating at times given the limited amount of energy the game gives you. Floating bits of energy are found in the Still World and are dropped by some enemies, but it’s surprisingly hard to come by, even at times when a lot of energy is required like during boss battles.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> keep your energy bar topped up by consuming various “smoothies,” which you can create via a simple crafting system. This is a cute idea, but you can’t mix up a smoothie just anywhere, as they’re only produced by a handful of vendors scattered around Hyrule. This resulted in me frequently having to back out of dungeons just before the final boss so I could go back to a town and craft additional smoothies for the energy I’d need. A fairly generous checkpoint system makes this not <em>too </em>much of a trial, but this whole system feels like it could have been smoothed out a bit.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom13.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Now, before you get too worried, I’m not saying combat in Echoes of Wisdom is bad. You will likely get the hang of it eventually, Swordfighter Form can be leveled up to give you a longer energy bar and stronger weapons, and you can even find gear that makes energy easier to come by. By the end of the game, I was quite comfortable with combat, but I can't help but feel like the developers overthought things slightly. Simply giving Zelda the ability to use traditional weapons <em>and</em> summon echoes all the time might have been better. As is, Echoes of Wisdom is a 2D Zelda, which have typically thrived on their simplicity and playability, that can feel a bit fussy at times.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom14.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ultimately though, any fussiness doesn’t obscure what Echoes of Wisdom is at its core -- a really good, modern take on the traditional Zelda format, with excellent old-school dungeons and an enticing world. And really, it’s some of the game’s less-flashy new features I enjoyed the most. The more responsive-feeling controls and platforming, the addition of a wide array of engaging sidequests, the ability to ride a dang horse in a 2D Zelda! This is the old-school Zelda you love, polished up to meet modern expectations.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdoms brings a lot of different things to the table, and in large quantities. The game is easily the franchise’s biggest 2D entry to date, offering up a story that took me 25 hours to complete and enough side content to keep you playing a dozen or more hours beyond that. Zelda’s first adventure as a headliner is no mere morsel, it’s royal banquette that ought to leave most fans feeling satisfied for some time.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom brings some new ideas to the table, but in the end, the game is more about modernizing the classic 2D Zelda experience. The attention-grabbing echo copying mechanic has its pros and cons, but where Echoes of Wisdom consistently hits is in the tried-and-true design of its world and dungeons, which are as good as any the franchise has delivered in the past. This may be Zelda's first starring adventure, but past Legends still echo strongly here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, launching September 26th, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct">is Princess Zelda’s first standalone adventure</a>. Her debut solo outing does an excellent job of establishing Zelda as a protagonist that’s unique and separate from that green guy. But the game’s sparse environments, formulaic dungeons, and simplistic platforming and puzzles ultimately swallow her up, making Zelda feel underutilized, even in her own game.</p><p>In <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, giant rifts have opened up all over Hyrule, trapping everything and everyone in a void of stillness while spitting out evil versions of the people the rifts have consumed. With the help of an adorable creature named Tri, Zelda must use the copying power of the Tri Rod to rescue her allies, defeat the evil clones, and stop the rifts from swallowing Hyrule whole.</p><div><figcaption><em>Zelda uses her Tri Rod to summon copies of objects called “echoes.”</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>Before <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, every opportunity we’ve had to play as Zelda has been in spinoffs, with gameplay designed to fit whatever alternate universe she’s in rather than her own personality. She’s a typical sword and board protagonist in her two Philips CD-i games. She busts out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/17/6251849/hyrule-warriors">elegant fencing in <em>Hyrule Warriors</em></a> and uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572264/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review-nintendo-switch-zelda-botw-prequel">the myriad powers of the Sheikah Slate to fight in <em>Age of Calamity</em></a>. And of course, she’s got a pair of lethal hands rated E for Everyone in<em> Super Smash Bros</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>But what makes the most sense for Zelda, in her original context as the Princess of Hyrule, when Link’s not around and there are dungeons to delve into and monsters to defeat?</p><p>Using her wits.</p><p>In <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, Zelda must figure out how to use echoes, or copies, of objects from throughout Hyrule to save the day. If there’s a wide gap to cross, Zelda can use the Tri Rod to build a bridge out of beds. When a pig-like Moblin is in her way, she can summon a bigger, meaner Moblin echo to fight it. <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is smart in that it allows Zelda to establish her own identity as a hero that feels authentic to her as a character. She doesn’t need brute force and utility belts worth of specialized tools, just her brain and fire zol or two. She’s distinct from Link but is as formidable a force as he is — scarier even. After all, who should Ganon worry about more? The guy who can kill him with a sword or the girl who can kill him with literally <em>anything</em>?</p><p>In the game’s first handful of hours, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24232567/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-hands-on">using echoes to solve puzzles and fight monsters was seriously fun</a>, reminding me of the first hours of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> or <em>Tears of the Kingdom.</em> The vastness of Hyrule lay sprawled out before me filled with things to discover, and it was up to me to figure out how. Puzzles and platforming sequences have multiple solutions and routes depending on which echoes you’ve learned. Instead of stacking beds to cross a gap, I can use a flying tile. Or I could use Tri’s “reverse bind” ability to tether Zelda’s movement to another moving object.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>The breadth of Hyrule is vast but feels very empty.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>But neither the possibilities nor the world were as vast as I initially thought. After a while, I realized there wasn’t much to do outside of the main quest. There were smaller rifts to clean up, which were minor dungeons all with the same objective: find three to five of Tri’s friends hidden behind monsters or complete simple platforming puzzles. Or there were a handful of side quests to complete, which were usually one-and-done objectives that involved either finding a thing or killing a thing. So many parts of Hyrule were just empty, populated only by the occasional monster or treasure chest. Eventually, I didn’t bother trying to explore anymore, choosing instead to fast-travel from place to place.</p><div><p>In Echoes of Wisdom there are basically only two kinds of challenges: something’s too high or something’s too far</p></div><p>Though <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> isn’t as large or as long as <em>Breath of the Wild </em>or T<em>ears of the Kingdom</em>, all three games operate on the basic premise of, “Here’s an open world and a bunch of abilities, figure it out.” What made <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and T<em>ears of the Kingdom </em>so fun was that both games presented so many different kinds of puzzle and platforming challenges that required out-of-the-box thinking to solve. Whereas in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> there are basically only two kinds of challenges: something’s too high or something’s too far. And in nearly every instance, those challenges can be solved with the same handful of echoes. I had so many of them, like a gnarly rolling log of spikes, that I never got the chance to use. The game never gave me a reason to.</p><p><small>You solve 90 percent of the game’s platforming challenges with beds and trampolines.</small></p><p>Combat was far better at incentivizing creativity than platforming. Each enemy has different movement and attack patterns, requiring the careful selection of the right monster or item to counter it. The snake-like rope monsters are fast, low to the ground, and hard to see when camouflaged in their grassy habitat, making them impossible to hit with melee attacking monsters. After I wasted too much time hoping my bird echo would pluck it off the ground, I discovered a much simpler solution: light everything on fire with a torch. And when I couldn’t find the right monster for the job, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24231404/echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-sword">Zelda can use Link’s sword, arrows, or bombs for a limited amount of time</a>.</p><p>I think that the singular ability to use Link’s sword gets at the heart of what’s ultimately disappointing about<em> Echoes of Wisdom</em>: all of Zelda’s wits don’t really amount to much. Sure I had dozens of echoes at my disposal, but halfway through the game, they only got in my way as I scrolled past them to get to the same five echoes I knew would get the job done. Combat was better, but whenever I wanted, I could thwart a difficult foe by simply stabbing it to death. That’s not to say <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> wasn’t fun. I wouldn’t have taken the time to clear every optional dungeon or most of the side quests if I hadn’t been enjoying myself.</p><p>But after 35 years of lending her name to the iconic franchise, I wanted Zelda’s first game to be a little bit more worthy of her intelligence and strength.</p><p><small><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> launches on Nintendo Switch on September 26th.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
