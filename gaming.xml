			<p>Ahead of Anno 117: Pax Romana releasing on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming November 13, 2025, Ubisoft has released a new gameplay deep dive trailer, going over what the game's campaign will focus on, and what's coming in the game's Year 1 Content Pass.</p>



<p>In Anno 117: Pax Romana's campaign, players will step into the role of Marcus or Marcia, and after being appointed a Roman governor, you'll try to shape the Celtic region you are charged with leading, and decide whether to enforce Roman traditions, or find ways to blend Roman and Celtic culture. Your campaign will also be slightly changed depending on who you choose to play as. Choosing Marcus will set one specific path in motion, and choosing Marcia, another.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>After release, the Year 1 content pass for Pax Romana will include three DLC releases. Provinces of Ash, the first DLC release, will introduce Latium, a large island with new cultural encounters, and a towering volcano that could prove to be a problem. The second DLC release is The Hippodrome, which adds a large stadium arena for players to construct and hold chariot races and big entertaining events for citizens.</p>



<p>The third is called Dawn of the Delta, which adds a new river-based province and a new culture as you expand to the Egyptian frontier.</p>



<p>Ubisoft did not yet say as to what the pace of these DLC releases will be, but since they're supposed to last for the first year of Pax Romana, it's probably a safe bet that they'll be fairly spaced out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/crimson-desert-golden-star-boss-battle-banner-1760099376651.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Bosses are woven into the fabric of Crimson Desert’s world. Judging by the many, many different ones we’ve now seen across multiple hands-on demos and videos, it appears that they’re frequently a showstopping spectacle that puts all of your abilities to the test. One such headline attraction is Golden Star, a monstrous mechanical dragon that we fought at the Seoul offices of developer Pearl Abyss in preparation for this month’s IGN First. If you watched our last gameplay video, you’ll have already seen this mighty boss in action, but here we’re going to take you behind the scenes to show you how it was designed, all the way from the sound of its beating wings to the method of its downfall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s safe to say that Crimson Desert’s continent of Pywel offers classic fantasy with a twist, often blending unexpected elements into the mix, including (but not limited to) rideable dinosaurs and supercharged mechs. The Golden Star, with its combination of classic fantasy beast and sci-fi metallic sheen, is this philosophy personified. Members of the Pearl Abyss design team explained that they’d put a lot of focus into trying to blend the organic and the mechanical together, but as part of that, perhaps surprisingly, they also wanted there to be a level of believability. The art team noted that, even though Golden Star looks like a sci-fi dragon, a lot of the materials used in its character model were inspired by everyday materials that could be found not just in modern times, but even back in the more fantasy-adjacent Middle Ages. It’s an approach Pearl Abyss applied not only to the Golden Star, but also to all the robots, industrial buildings, and steam trains that you can find in the game. While these elements lean closer towards science fiction, the design team was insistent on maintaining a sense of believability. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this helps us buy into the idea that this is a beast that could have genuinely been constructed by Marni, the inventor who sends you out on a quest to battle Golden Star. Exploring Marni’s office in the run-up to this encounter further educates us on the dragon’s origin, as the room is littered with paperwork concerning its construction, as well as industrial machinery that foreshadows the beast’s mechanical nature. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you finally meet Golden Star, whose claws crumble age-old masonry with ease, you can clearly see how the machine mimics the organic. The Crimson Desert design team made sure that the gears and chains beneath its armoured shell “realistically” operate in unison. Together, these components take the shape of something you’ve never quite seen before, but simultaneously it also feels familiar — the beast’s swooping golden wings and earth-shaking roar can’t help but conjure up memories of Bioshock Infinite’s Songbird, an equally impressive mechanical invention that’s also a man-made creation engineered from a fantasy framework. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sounds generated by Golden Star presented the team with a very specific challenge: having to combine the organic motions of a winged beast with the mechanical clanks and whirrs of something man-made in nature. On our visit to Pearl Abyss’ South Korean headquarters, we were shown around its purpose-built Foley recording studio and given a walkthrough of all of these different elements, and an insight into the enjoyably explorative process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">First on the agenda was the flapping of its wings, which also became the basis for all other dragons in the game. While Golden Star is mechanical, you’ll notice that its wings are giant sheets of fabric, and so their sound is also created by moving fabric: the waving of a leather jacket. The weathered rustling of the material evokes the sound of a wing’s membrane cutting through the air and provided a solid starting point for how to add aural layers to this creature, with the ultimate goal of creating something previously unheard. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pearl Abyss wanted to make you feel overwhelmed by the overall size and force of Golden Star.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up was to give it metallic heft, hence the closing of a creaky, clanking cabinet door being introduced to the mix. It’s followed by a ribbed, plastic hose — the kind you’d normally expect to see at the end of a vacuum cleaner — being pulled along the corner of that cabinet to further add texture to the dragon’s many moving parts. A smaller plastic pipe is then pulled and pushed like an accordion, as this friction,  surprisingly, adds an almost cyber-like tone to the beast. It’s this experimentation and commitment to using everyday objects in unexpected ways that make this process look very fun. On top of that, a large fork was dragged along a metal chain while the fingers of an armoured gauntlet were fiddled with at the joints to punctuate the sound of the wings' smooth motion, providing the effect with a mechanical edge. It all blends into a symphony of noises that creates a soundscape as engineered as the in-game dragon itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Foley studio is just one impressive aspect of the cutting-edge facilities found at Pearl Abyss' mammoth office building, which also houses a full 3D scanning centre and a performance capture space where many of the game’s cutscenes and combat animations were recorded. I found particular enjoyment in watching my colleague, Matt Purslow, experience the latter for himself, as he stepped into a mocap suit and swung a foam sword around, which was then mirrored in real-time on a neighbouring screen. It’s all very impressive tech, even if Matt could admittedly do with a little weapons training to fully take advantage of it. The pen is mightier than the sword and all that, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This tech fuels Pearl Abyss’ creative ambitions, with each boss fight in Crimson Desert not only posing a challenge to the player, but also pushing the limits of the studio’s creativity. The design team wanted to “find out their boundaries and limitations,” and Golden Star presented a particular conundrum due to its sheer bulkiness and ability to fly around at speed. That was very much a problem for a ground-bound, human-sized player to take down. This David vs Goliath effect was desired by the developers, though, who explained that they “wanted to make you feel overwhelmed by the overall size and force of the Golden Star”. To take it down, you’ll need to find its weakness.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/golden-star-arrow-1760102138540.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As with many of the bosses in Crimson Desert, there is a method to defeat this beast proficiently designed into the encounter, although it’s not the only way to achieve victory, as to incubate that feeling of being able to approach this world’s combat in any way you want to. You can brute force your way through this fight, reading its attack patterns and dealing damage to its gleaming head whenever it rears it. But Golden Star’s true Achilles heel is the power of an EMP blast. Though not strictly a puzzle boss, there are some elements of that style in this fight, such as luring the dragon into breathing fire onto pillars dotted around the arena, which heat up and, in turn, power machines that generate EMP bullets for your arm cannon. Fire enough of these into its body, and the Golden Star will be stunned, allowing you to wail on its collapsed skeleton. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Crimson Desert combat team revealed that they didn't want to make the boss into too much of a puzzle. While there are certain conditions that you need to fulfill in order to get the EMP to work, there are definitely other ways to defeat it. The team specified that you can damage the dragon using a bow and arrow, or your combat skills. They hope that players will work out interesting strategies and eventually share them with others when Crimson Desert is finally available next March. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The EMP method is certainly an effective one, and something the team made sure was seeded on the path up to the fight. Earlier skirmishes in this quest were designed to show off the capabilities of an EMP, as you take on an army of robotic fiends. The idea, the team explained, was to ensure that the mechanic was a consistent theme in the run-up to the Golden Star battle, and so that when you reached the boss itself, using the EMP would be second nature. You’d understand that Golden Star was a robotic enemy affected by your EMP devices and instinctively know what to do. This approach required focus on the placement of mechanics and gimmicks, ensuring the creation of a natural learning curve up to the boss fight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Variety is very much the name of the game in Crimson Desert, as our story that took <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-combat-explained">a deep dive into combat</a> explained, and that variety permeates through everything, especially boss design. Nowhere else, outside of a pilotable battle robot, have we seen EMPs utilised in this adventure in our several hours of hands-on with it. It's a further example of how each mission, each moment spent in this world, is aiming to be different from the last.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While mechanical variety is clearly important, the team also noted that variety was inspired by the bosses being considered as characters within the world. The team explained that they tried to put themselves into the shoes of each boss and really consider what their motives would be. That inspired their moves and overall design, and helped generate diversity among the dozens of bosses present in the game. It’s a philosophy that is certainly on full display when you place all of the bosses we’ve seen so far in Crimson Desert alongside each other. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-has-brought-absolute-cinema-back-to-multiplayer.1326928/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capturing the point is the backbone of many multiplayer games, and it’s often the most exciting moment of a match. It’s when Zarya drops a Graviton Surge that glues the entire enemy team together, ready to be obliterated by D.Va’s Self-Destruct. Or when your Super gauge finally fills and you’re able to unleash your Guardian’s point-clearing powers. Or when you unlock the perfect Killstreak that rains down a warehouse-worth of munitions, obliterating the opposition seconds before they can capture the zone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But no one does capture points like Battlefield. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I recently played a Conquest match of Battlefield 6 that saw a point on Operation Firestorm gradually attacked and seized over a couple of minutes. At first it was just on-foot soldiers, charging in and popping smoke to conceal their assault. Then the tanks turned up. Cannons roared, chunks of masonry scattered. Sparks fizzed as engineers patched up armour. And then, like some kind of finale fireworks, a jet screamed overhead, its deployed payload securing the objective from the final enemies who were holding out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As this was happening, the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/absolute-cinema" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet’s favourite Scorsese meme</a> came to mind. “Absolute Cinema.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield’s large-scale, combined arms, destructive multiplayer is unlike anything else. “Cinematic” is a quality that typically feels antithetical to multiplayer shooters, which are generally required to be more clean and precise. Clear sightlines. Hard counters. Precision-engineered, three-lane maps. Intense competition. There’s no room for spectacle, which is reserved for single-player campaigns. Not in Battlefield, though. To play Battlefield 6 is to be an actor in a war movie. And what a feeling that is, especially after years of sweaty battle royales and esport tactical shooters ruling the charts while prior, lesser accomplished Battlefield games languished on the sidelines. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/battlefield-6-jeep-chase-1760623275852.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6's vehicles are a vital part of creating its war movie-like feel. | Image credit: EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle royale has reigned supreme for almost a decade now, and it’s not difficult to see why the fight-to-the-last-player format has endured. Sure, the never-ending churn of brand crossovers that feeds Fortnite and Warzone plays more than a small part in keeping the masses entertained, but it’s undeniable that every match has the potential to tell a story of nail-biting survival. The one-life-only, you-versus-everyone nature of battle royale makes it an inherently tense experience, a trait the genre shares with the extraction shooter’s breakout successes – the pressure that builds across a match of Hunt: Showdown or Escape from Tarkov is unrivaled. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That kind of stressful, hyper-competitive design is also the fundamental fuel of Counter-Strike, the most-played game on Steam, and Valorant, Riot’s incredibly popular tactical shooter. Their tightly designed maps, painstakingly calibrated balance, and high-stakes, single-life matches are the ingredients for exhilarating digital sport. And while sport can indeed tell stories – the epic highs and lows of high school football, to reference <a href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/337640108/epic-highs-and-lows-of-high-school-football" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another meme</a> – there’s a significant difference between those stories of clutch victories and “cinema”.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Battlefield’s design allows emergent stories to happen in every match, and every time it feels like a scene from Black Hawk Down. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is the complete opposite of games like Valorant and Fortnite. While it certainly has rules and parameters, Battlefield is equally dedicated to immersion. Where Counter-Strike’s maps are clearly artificial constructs designed to promote the most competitive play, Battlefield aims to ship you off to war… or, more accurately, a war movie set. Each map’s pathways may have been laid out by a level designer with multiplayer engagements in mind, but they feel like slices of crumbling conflict zones rather than sport arenas.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those maps, and the objectives within them, create moments of big, loud, messy drama. Yes, that drama may often be rooted in clutch victories similar to what we see in the big esports games, but they’re made from the components of explosive action movies rather than streamer skirmishes. Battlefield’s dramatic because a tank is unloading shells into the building you’re trying to hold, and the walls are creaking and the whole thing is about to collapse, but your squad’s medic has finally arrived to resuscitate a nearby engineer, who’s able to fire off their RPG just in time to destroy that tank and save us all. That kind of combination just doesn’t exist in Counter-Strike or even Fortnite, despite the latter’s attempt to throw everything in existence onto its deadly island.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/battlefield-6-drag-revive-1760623339106.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The new drag-and-revive mechanic creates heroic moments. | Image credit: EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield’s design allows emergent stories like these to happen in every match, and every time it feels like a scene from Black Hawk Down. The squad and class systems only reinforce that. You’re all characters in a war movie, each doing their part. Laying down covering fire. Repairing a tank you’re huddled behind. Scoring a headshot on the sniper that’s got your group pinned down. The new drag-and-revive mechanic is perhaps the best example of this. Having my broken body pulled to safety, bullets striking the ground around my legs and explosions ringing in my ears, is one of the most heroic, brothers-in-arms things I’ve ever experienced in a game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the competitive-focused shooters that dominate the charts are seemingly governed by “the meta” – viral builds and strategies that threaten to make every match feel the same. It’s a phenomenon that really cements them as online video games rather than, say, counter-terrorism simulators or superhero showdowns, and in turn further divorces them from Battlefield’s sense of messy spectacle. And while we all know that the meta will eventually infest Battlefield 6 in one way or another, it can never truly control Battlefield, because its greatest strength is those emergent, cinematic moments, not its weapon stats or KDA ratios. No wonder “only-in-Battlefield” moments have been a core part of the series’ marketing for many years now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in the summer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-preview">I wondered if Battlefield 6 was playing it too safe</a>. As fun as its preview demonstration was, I had concerns that EA wasn’t pushing the series in any interesting new directions. And while it’s true that the final product is the very definition of classic Battlefield, and often feels like a game I’ve played for hundreds of hours before, I’m enjoying it more than I have any other PvP multiplayer game in years. In many respects, that’s simply because, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer">our glowing multiplayer review</a> explains, Battlefield 6 is fantastically layered and smartly designed. But more than that, it’s those emergent stories. Those player-created, war movie-like sequences that simply don’t happen in any other game. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/battlefield-6-beach-landing-1760623407330.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The campaign attempts to recreate the intensity of Saving Private Ryan's D-Day landings, but fails to make it as exciting as a multiplayer scramble. | Image credit: EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a shame none of that can be found in the single-player. Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-review">campaign review</a> quite rightly criticised it for not just being incredibly dull, but also for making next to no use of Battlefield’s iconic components. There’s no interesting squad dynamics, limited use of vehicles, and its destruction is all too frequently scripted rather than improvised. It doesn’t feel anything like Battlefield. Rather, its linear mission design makes it all too clear that it’s using Call of Duty as a blueprint. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why Call of Duty? Put the multiplayer suites of these series’ side-by-side and it’s clear they have almost nothing in common beyond their military theming. While there’s long been a rivalry between the two franchises, it's because they’re both fighting for different visions of the post-Medal of Honor FPS, rather than scrapping over the same idea. And so you’d think the same would apply to the campaign, that Battlefield’s single-player would be a distinctly different beast to Call of Duty. But they’re not. They’re the same tightly-controlled, linear shooters. Well, almost the same. Call of Duty is, more often than not, pretty good at this kind of thing. Battlefield… less so. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an alternate timeline, things may have been different. Back in 2022, EA established Ridgeline Games to develop Battlefield 6’s campaign. The studio was led by Marcus Lehto, one of the co-creators of Halo. With that history, you can see how Battlefield would have benefitted from his guidance. Halo’s campaigns are, afterall, built on a bedrock of wide open levels that allow smart use of infantry and vehicles – some of Battlefield’s vital building blocks. But the studio was struck by industry restructuring woes and shuttered in 2024, leaving Criterion Games and Ripple Effect Studios seemingly scrambling to piece something together in time for Battlefield 6’s 2025 release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hollow results left me wondering how Battlefield could have captured the cinema of its multiplayer without resorting to copying Infinity Ward’s homework. Considering its trademark  components, Battlefield seems like an ideal place to recapture the ideas of EA’s own, long-abandoned Mercenaries. With their sandbox open worlds, vehicles, artillery, and completely destructible buildings, Mercenaries seems an ideal template for what a modern Battlefield campaign could look like. But I’d take anything that actually reflects the series’ long-established identity. We can only hope that the development pipeline for Battlefield 7 is less troubled and more ambitious.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for now, we have Battlefield 6 and its joyously destructive, noisy multiplayer. The game where every objective is the stage for a war movie, packed with explosions, smoke, sparks, and the rattle of a dozen rifles. Where jeeps screech around the corner carrying much-needed reinforcements, and jets scramble to drop tide-turning payloads. Battlefield is most definitely back, and it’s absolute cinema.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-brought-absolute-cinema-back-to-multiplayer]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's time for me to return.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends: Z-A is out now. We're enjoying it considerably so far, and it's got its own interesting story of a group of young adults learning to love and protect their city and all the people and Pokémon in it. But there's one moment in Z-A that's got us thinking about another story entirely, one contained in Pokémon Legends: Arceus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, there's a museum in Lumiose City that you can visit in Z-A that includes an exhibit on the land of Hisui, which is where Arceus takes place. While most of the exhibit is made up of fun easter eggs for Arceus, there's at least one exhibit that resolves a dangling plot thread left over at the end of Arceus. It's a big one, too, as it gives one character's tragic story a happy ending at last.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I won't say more without warning you of spoilers. We won't include any spoilers for Z-A here, but we will spoil what the museum exhibit is, as well as the entire story of one of Arceus' supporting characters. Read onward at your own risk:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm talking about the story of the character Ingo. Let me catch you up, first. Ingo actually appears in Black and White, where he's a boss in the Battle Subway along with his twin brother, Emmet. Ingo isn't a particularly critical character in these games, but his importance grows significantly when he shows up in Arceus. You see, Arceus takes place in the distant past, but the Ingo we meet there is definitely the same guy, as he talks about having fuzzy memories of a brother and the time period he came from. But Ingo also doesn't know how he got to Hisui, or how to get back home to his brother and the Pokémon partners he left behind. As best as we can infer, the god of the Pokemon world, Arceus, likely transported Ingo back in time the same way it transported the main character back in time at the start of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Frankly, this sucks! Ingo clearly misses his brother and partners, but doesn't understand how this happened to him or why. He's super depressed the whole game. And this just...never gets resolved. At the end of Arceus, Ingo is still stuck in ancient Hisui, with no way home. But fortunately, Z-A appears to finally give Ingo a happy ending via the museum.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, there's a diagram in the museum of the Training Grounds, which is where Ingo hangs out in Arceus. The diagram has the following caption: "There are records of a man named Ingo providing guidance in the ways of Pokémon battle, but it is said that he simply vanished one day after stating, 'It's time for me to return.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's not definitive, this seems to imply that at some point after the events of Arceus, Ingo was spirited back home in explicably, finally getting to reunite with his brother and Pokémon. We'll never know for sure, but the museum exhibit clearly wants to prompt the player to imagine he was finally freed from Arceus' time traveling torment. I'm personally thrilled by this, as the god Pokémon Arceus' kidnapping spree was one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-arceus-tragic-story">most baffling bits of that game's plot for me</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/20251016100740-01k7h8mj1y8vvn1n25jvfw1dr5-1760627388298.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/20251016100743-01k7h8mwqjrz9qyzth7q4evtyq-1760627388299.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">My <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">review-in-progress of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is now live, if you want to check out my impressions of the first 24 hours, with a full review coming next week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Keep Black Friday in mind for some great board game deals.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re someone who loves board games, any and all board game sales are an excellent time to pick up some that you've had on your radar. If you happen to miss out on the seasonal savings this year, though, have no fear. There are a couple of different times throughout the year where you can find good savings on some of the very <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Below, we’ve broken down some of the best times to buy board games during the year. Alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a>, you can also find killer deals during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-2024">Amazon Prime Day</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/prime-big-deal-days">October Prime Day</a>. Most retailers also frequently have board games on sale throughout the year, and we’ll point you towards some of the best ones to check out.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">For the Best Time to Buy Board Games, Keep in Mind…</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="#blackfriday" data-cy="styled-link"><strong>Black Friday and Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="#prime" data-cy="styled-link"><strong>Amazon Prime Day</strong></a><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="#octoberprime" data-cy="styled-link">October Prime Day</a></li></ul></li><li><strong></strong><a href="#retailers" data-cy="styled-link"><strong>Retailer Sales</strong></a></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2" id="blackfriday">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/11/26/bfnewgloomhaven-1637938137595.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best times to pick up discounted board games is during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a>, which occur at the end of November. It’s not just on the day that sales will pop up, either. You’ll usually find sales at a variety of different retailers during the entire week of Black Friday and the following week after Cyber Monday. Some retailers even start up their sales as early as the first week in November like what is happening with .</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Major retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Target are all great places to look for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals">board game deals</a> and will often offer up 2 for 1 deals that make it worth buying multiple games. It’s also worth keeping GameStop on your radar during this time as they’re likely to have plenty of discounts on board games, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For these sale event, it’s also a good idea to plan ahead for what you want. Board games, in particular, can sell out during this period of time, so make a list of the ones you want before diving into the discounts. It’s also worth keeping multiple tabs open to compare prices at various retailers. Sometimes, you’ll find a 30% discount at one spot and 40% off at another, so you want to make sure you get the best deal possible before hitting that 'Buy' button.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon Prime Day</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/07/06/boardgames-br-1657138523925.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Black Friday, Amazon Prime Day is another sales event that’s worth keeping in mind for board game deals. This usually occurs earlier on in the year, around the end of June or start of July, so if you missed a board game deal during one sale you can plot to pick it up at the next. However, unlike Black Friday, Prime Day only occurs at Amazon and is only for Prime members. The only time you'll see competing deals is if another retailer, like Best Buy, counters the sale day with their own selections. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seeing as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-vs-black-friday-deals">Prime Day is similar to Black Friday</a>, you’ll want to make a list of which board games you want to buy for your collection. This will help you figure out what to look for but also helps with setting a budget. Another helpful planning tool is using a website like <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>camelcamelcamel</u></a>, which shows the price history on a product that’s listed on Amazon so you can see how often it goes on sale and at what price. This can help you figure out if it’s a better buy during Prime Day or if you should wait until Black Friday rolls around again to pick it up.</p><h3 data-cy="title3" id="octoberprime">October Prime Day</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon also has a second Prime Day in the year – called Prime Big Deal Days or Prime Day 2, for short – that occurs in October. During this 48-hour sale event, they give a little preview of what’s to come during Black Friday, making it another good time to check out board game deals and see if something you missed in the first Prime Day popped up again here. It’s also just a good time to scope out the Black Friday deals and see what’s in store for you then. This year, Prime Big Deals Day took place on October 7 and 8, with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/board-game-deals-october-prime-day-2025">particularly awesome spread of board game deals</a> we hope return for Black Friday. </p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="retailers">Retailer Sales</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/13/amazon-2-blogroll-logos-1699901424350.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The nice thing about board games is that you can find deals on them fairly frequently at a variety of stores all throughout the year. Amazon, in particular, has random deals on them often. And, as mentioned previously, it’s worth using a tool like <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>camelcamelcamel</u></a> so you can see when the best time is to pick up a board game you want there. Their helpful price history chart can show you what times of year their prices drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other retailers, like Target, will usually match Amazon’s board game deals throughout the year as well. Alongside those two spots, it’s worth keeping an eye on stores like GameStop, Walmart, and even Barnes and Noble to find board game deals. We’ll always keep you updated on the latest board game deals as well, whether that’s during big sale events like Black Friday or on a regular basis in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals"><u>best board game deals</u></a> roundup. If you follow <a href="https://twitter.com/IGNDeals" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IGN Deals</u></a> on Twitter, we’ll keep you updated there as well on the best board game deals as we come across them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelance writer who works with the Guides and Commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-time-to-buy-board-games]]></content:encoded>

He also stated that the quality of most Call of Duty releases since he left has fallen.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/interview-glen-schofields-plan-to-save-the-games-industry/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Schofield said of Microsoft's ownership of Call of Duty, "I worry about it immensely, I really do. Because what's happening here is a war."</p><p>"Unfortunately, once you're assimilated by one of these companies, I think you take on some of their traits," he added.</p><p>Schofield also said he imagines that Activision has eliminated the bonus program paid to Call of Duty developers based on the success of a game, and that might negatively impact the company's ability to attract and retain top talent.</p><p>Also in the interview, Schofield said that the Call of Duty series has sunk below its previous highs, creatively at least, since he left in February 2018 after Call of Duty: WWII. "I hate doing this, but since I left Sledgehammer, none of the games have been very good. I mean, the last one [Sledgehammer's Modern Warfare 3 in 2023] was a 50. They still sell well," he said.</p><p>"They just aren't as good. They aren't the same. Treyarch's still really good but you know … I got lucky," he added.</p><p>Finally, Schofield said he has a theory as to why the Call of Duty series has remained an annual franchise, and it's all about money. "First of all if they go to not every year, they lose a billion dollars every year, so that's why Call of Duty never did that," he said.</p><p>It was recently reported that Activision <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-lost-300-million-in-sales-due-to-game-pass-report/1100-6535256/" data-ref-id="1100-6535256">missed out on $300 million in revenue from putting Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Xbox Game Pass</a>.

<figure data-uuid="3b4f84884ee95"><a title="THE OPEN WORLD" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b4f84884ee95/the-open-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We may only be a few months into a shiny, new <strong>Mario Kart</strong> game with lush open worlds and challenges aplenty, but as I scrap it out in yet another Knockout Tour or pootle about for P Switches and Peach Coins, I can’t help but yearn for something a little more familiar.</p>
<p>It’s a sentiment shared by many, if social media is to be believed. Why not take a break to go back to a Mario Kart game where every course is a set track? A Mario Kart game I know and love? The most recent home console Mario Kart before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> rode into town? No, not that one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_live_home_circuit">Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit</a> turns five today and is technically Nintendo’s most recent home iteration of its behemoth franchise prior to World. I have many fond memories of this curious mixed reality experience. I’ve spent hours careening around my house through Mario’s eyes, zipping through makeshift tunnels under the sofa, dodging my children’s feet as they give chase, giggling with my wife whenever one of them would pick up Mario and plant a kiss on his nose - all blown up on the television in real time.</p>
<p>But as I fire it up again, I’m struck by an option presented to me on the home screen, an option I haven’t experienced in nearly half a decade of ownership of this game. Multiplayer. This seems mad to me. Mario Kart is, after all, the quintessential couch co-op experience. How could I have overlooked this entry in the series?</p>
<p>Quite easily, as it happens. Home Circuit is in last place when it comes to sales for the series, managing less than 2 million worldwide. And come to think of it, I’m not sure I <em>actually know</em> anybody else who owns it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="d7e18daf8c77f"><a title="TWO KARTS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7e18daf8c77f/two-karts.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Can we make this mixed reality dream a mixed reality reality? — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I need to fix this. I need to organise an all-tracks, all-in Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit Grand Prix.</p>
<h2><strong>The starting line</strong></h2>
<p>The game supports up to four players, so four players is what we’ll shoot for. My first thought is to sound out the folks who were mad enough to play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/death-by-a-thousand-karts-can-we-race-all-96-mario-kart-8-deluxe-tracks-in-a-single-session">every single Mario Kart 8 track in one evening</a> with me last year.</p>
<p>There are a few 'No's: Matt is otherwise engaged, Alfie now lives on the south coast, and Tom lives in Australia - clearly, Tom found the experience the most harrowing. <strong>Jonny</strong> and <strong>Mitchell</strong>, however, are stupid enough to agree.</p>
<p>They’ll need karts. A quick eBay reveals that the physical toys needed to play the game are very reasonably priced these days. I get a Luigi in box for £50 and a Mario &amp; Luigi together (albeit with no box, chargers or gates) for £45! You only need one set of gates, so this is an absolute steal - and a great Christmas present if you’ve got a Mario Kart enthusiast who’s never tried it.</p>
<p>They turn up at my door a couple of days before the event, and in the interim, I get a few more ‘Yes’s - including a face that may be familiar to long-time Nintendo Life readers. But more on that later.</p>

<figure data-uuid="6e1b78f637295"><a title="Mario &amp; Luigi Mario Kart live" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6e1b78f637295/mario-and-luigi-mario-kart-live.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I ask everyone to download the free game software so we’ll be ready to go on the day. We have the karts, we have the players, we have the game; now we need the venue. My last Mario Kart was a standard living room affair, but an event like this demands something a little more <em>theatrical.</em></p>
<p>Those who know me know that I have a background in the performing arts, and I’m still in touch with some of the lovely folks at the Watford Palace Theatre. As it happens, they have just opened up some new spaces nearby and are happy to accommodate our strange request in their Workshop Studio. It’s a big space with a wooden floor and nothing in the way - a proper blank canvas. It’s perfect.</p>
<p>Until I realise it’s a blank canvas. We need tracks. There are 10 Grand Prix to play through, each consisting of three races, which means I need to design 30 tracks. In two days. And I have <em>nothing.</em></p>
<p>A wave of panic hits. I bust out the squared paper and begin drawing huge pixel images - a mushroom, a flower, a star. It’s taking hours, and I’m not sure it’ll work. My wife finds me hunched over the sketch pad - gnawing at the pencil in my hands.</p>
<p><em>“Why don’t you just use tracks from the games?” She asks.<br>
“Because they’re massive - I don’t know how I’d even do that.”<br>
“What, even those old ones?”</em></p>
<p>I pause. Stinging sensation of calling something from my childhood ‘old’ aside, she’s made a great point. The SNES tracks are pretty pint-sized creations, but packed with tight corners, narrow passages, shortcuts. There are some pretty iconic ones, too! Even showing up in World here and there. It’s a great idea!</p>

<p><em>“Thanks, love! Speaking of, do you want to play it for a bit now?”<br>
“I think you should probably get your plan ready.”<br>
“Fine.”</em></p>
<p>Spoilsport. Completely correct spoilsport.</p>
<p>I pull top-down images of all the tracks from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a> and place them under a pixel grid. It’ll work well in regard to planning it out, but how am I going to size it? What am I going to use to create it? I think of genuine go-karting and the big rubber tyres that line the tracks. Big, cylindrical objects with a bit of give. And it hits me. Toilet paper. No, I was not on the toilet at the time.</p>
<p>Looking at my little Mario (again, not on the toilet, not a euphemism), I see he’s about two toilet rolls wide - that’s what I’m going to make my track out of. Perfectly placed pixel toilet rolls. I’ll make the tracks all four rolls wide to accommodate two racers going neck and neck and we can widen and squeeze where necessary to facilitate some overtaking and hot pursuit.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8f2bec1cf5ec4"><a title="TRACK PLANNING" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8f2bec1cf5ec4/track-planning.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yes, each of those dots is a toilet roll — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are 20 Super Mario Kart tracks in all. I couple this with the pixel images I’ve already created (a giant recreation of each of the cup names) and we have our 30. Everything is in place for the big race.</p>
<h2><strong>Shopping karts</strong></h2>
<p>I set off for the venue with four little cars in the boot of my car. I call up Jonny on the way.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Hello, have you got much toilet paper?”<strong><br>
Jonny:</strong> “I have <em>some</em> toilet paper? Why?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “I’m going to pick some up to make the tracks with, I don’t suppose you have one of those big boxes of 48?”<strong><br>
Jonny:</strong> “I’m sorry, did you say 48? I don’t think you fathom how much toilet paper that is.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “We get 48 at home. It’s not that much. It’s fine - we can grab some when I pick you up.”</p>
<figure data-uuid="32a42377e292c"><a title="JON AND KART" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/32a42377e292c/jon-and-kart.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Just when you thought you'd seen the last of him, it's Jon Kart-wright! — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not long after this call, I pick up our first volunteer for this herculean event, it’s none other than former Nintendo Lifer, current <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-CrwNynzNnOz4F9nVfxvkw">Good Vibes Gamer</a> <strong>Jon Cartwright</strong>! And he’s packing a spare Mario Kart, too. What a gent.</p>
<p>As Jon climbs into the car, he spots a bag of zip ties in the back seat.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “It’s normal - don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>Fully accepting of this, Jon (henceforth <strong>JC</strong>) climbs in and a short while later we pick up Jonny (<strong>JB</strong>) before heading to a big old supermarket. Checking my pixel creations, I know the larger tracks need over 150 rolls to complete them, so we pick up 8 bags of 24 rolls.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever had a big shopping trolley stuffed to the absolute brim with literally nothing but toilet roll, but I don’t mind telling you that it gets some odd looks.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> “You just got the best side eye from that man.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Do you think it would be weird to tell him that we don’t have diarrhoea?”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “That will make it look and sound even more like you do.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “I didn’t fathom how much toilet roll this would be.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “You did not.”</p>
<p>Hauling the toilet paper back to the car and stuffing ourselves in alongside it, I start to break down the day.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “I figure each race will only be a couple of minutes. If we can build quickly and allocate 20 mins to each Grand Prix, that’s three and a bit hours. We’ve got the room for four hours - so that gives us a bit of leeway.”</p>
<p>I acknowledge the plan is ambitious, but I think it’s achievable. We arrive at the Palace and the construction begins.</p>
<h2><strong>Game Building Garage</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="a83658163f182"><a title="THE PLAYERS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a83658163f182/the-players.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>From left to right, Alex, Mitchell, Janek, Artie, Ossie, JC, JB, and George crouching at the front for some reason — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Joining JB, JC, Mitchell, and myself this time are <strong>Alex</strong>, <strong>Janek</strong>, <strong>Artie</strong>, and <strong>Ossie</strong>. This gives us four teams of two and we pair up respectively, but not before setting to work to bring our first course, <strong>Mario Circuit 1</strong>, to life.</p>
<p>I’ve had the idea to tether some of the toilet rolls together to make runs of three, four, and five to speed up the building. While the rest of the team makes this work, I get the karts online. Well, I try.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> “No! A tutorial! I need to do a tutorial for these switches.”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “I’m on it.”</p>
<p>Jon grabs a switch and we rattle through the intricacies of ‘pressing A to go’ and ‘pressing X to honk’, amongst others.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Why can you not skip this?!”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “It’s agony.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Oh my god, they want us to make a track now? I just want to play!”</p>
<p>By the time we have set up the karts, we are already 25 minutes behind. But <strong>Mario Circuit 1</strong> is laid out in front of us. Look at it. It’s glorious. Bring on the mushroom cup, it’s time to race!</p>
<figure data-uuid="f309c59a3b0c2"><a title="MARIO CIRCUIT 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f309c59a3b0c2/mario-circuit-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>MARIO CIRCUIT 1! — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Mushroom cup: On your marks, get set, faff!</strong></h2>
<p>Except it isn’t. At the start of each track you’ve designed, player one has got to drive through gates one to four in order to establish the actual track for everyone else. No big deal. The track is done, to the starting grid, everyone! Let’s-a-</p>
<p><strong>Jon:</strong> “I can’t start?”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “Yeah, me neither.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> "You just press ‘X’ when you’re facing the gate.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “No, it won’t let me.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “You need to be looking at the gate.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “I am - look!”</p>
<p>Mitchell’s Mario is indeed staring down Gate One. What’s going on? What we hadn’t bargained on is the game having a very specific idea about where it wants each player to start, with little floating discs their kart should be on. The trouble is, on our tight little course, this is basically <em>on top</em> of other racers.</p>
<p>Some of us manage to hit 'X', but if we then accidentally tap 'A' or get nudged as someone else is trying to get started, it undoes our ready state. It is absolutely ridiculous. A <em>full three minutes later,</em> we are finally ready to start track one. And it’s worth it.</p>
<p>It’s madness. Delightful madness. Heads are bowed, watching our screens as the toilet paper hurtles by, our teammates cheering us on at the sidelines. Yells of glee and anguish go up as items connect and the track gets absolutely wrecked. I had hoped a nice fringe benefit of tethering the toilet rolls would be that they would stay quite firmly in place if bumped into, and this worked, but I did not foresee quite how easily the single toilet rolls would be smacked around with the slightest of impacts. By lap five, it felt like we were just driving through a jungle. Look at the state of it!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e3aeebc9e0a06"><a title="MARIO CIRCUIT 1 AFTER" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e3aeebc9e0a06/mario-circuit-1-after.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Wrecked. And we didn't even use any items on it — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mario Circuit gives way to <strong>Donut Plains</strong> and the teammates swap over.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Okay everyone, I’m going to set out the route. Just watch where my kart goes so you can stay on track and everything should stay intact.”</p>
<p>My words are unheeded. Another course absolutely decimated. Around lap three I notice that a Luigi is just floating around outside the track.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Hang on, is that our Luigi?”<strong><br>
Ossie:</strong> “Yeah, I didn’t really know where I was going.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “But I showed you!”<strong><br>
Janek:</strong> “The tracks are so narrow, it’s hard to know where you’re meant to be going.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Not if everyone sticks to the track! I planned them, they’re all wide enough for two karts. I promise. Right, I’m Lakitu-ing this.”</p>
<p>I scoop up Luigi and set him back on track, hastily rearranging the track rolls as I do.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “I think this is what we need to do going forward - teammates can be Lakitu and we need to sort of fix as we go along.”<strong><br>
Alex:</strong> “Yeah, sounds good.”<strong><br>
Artie:</strong> “Has anyone seen Ludwig? I think he’s miles ahead of all of us.”<strong><br>
Janek:</strong> “There’s a computer? I don’t think I’ve even seen him.”<strong><br>
Artie:</strong> “I think he’s been in first the entire time.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “Damn it, Ludwig.”</p>
<figure data-uuid="060ec4d371443"><a title="Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit 5-Year Anniversary Blowout" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/060ec4d371443/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-5-year-anniversary-blowout.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The computer may be dominating, but things start to get back on track with the final race of the Grand Prix - <strong>the big ol’ mushroom track</strong>. Though there’s still plenty of faff actually getting the race started, the space afforded with this one actually makes for a better experience and a proper hush descends as we compete for the podium. It doesn’t last, though, because as I whip round a corner with rolls streaking by, I can’t help but laugh when I pick my eyes up from the screen and spot my Luigi.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Oh my God! They look so slow in real life!”</p>
<p>I’m not sure I can summon the words to adequately describe the whiplash of speeding through a mountain of bog roll on a screen, to setting eyes upon the reality of a miniature toy jaunting along the floor covering <em>a minuscule amount of floor space</em>, but sure enough the focus we had mustered comes undone as everyone giggles at the lack of intensity the real karts are displaying. Those tight precision corners and bumper-to-bumper collisions look hilarious when you realise they’re just dinky plastic toys. 100cc suddenly feels like 10cc.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9c0562e6913f3"><a title="Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit 5-Year Anniversary Blowout" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9c0562e6913f3/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-5-year-anniversary-blowout.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>We swear it feels faster than this — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The race finishes and the horror of having a CPU take the grand prize with nearly double the points of second place is not lost on us. Time is also slipping away - it’s already been nearly an hour and a half and we’ve only managed one Grand Prix! No time to debrief, we need to get moving.</p>
<h2><strong>The Flower Cup. The definitely-a-Flower Cup.</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="78673c4acf853"><a title="MUSHROOM CUP STANDINGS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/78673c4acf853/mushroom-cup-standings.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>This one hurt — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Ghost Valley 1</strong> takes shape with its infamous jump shortcut in place. I had considered building a ramp, but any thought of this is pushed aside as time ticks away. I do, however, plop a toilet roll in the middle of the narrow stretch.</p>
<p><strong>JB:</strong> “What’s that?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “It’s for the shortcut. It’s to add a bit of jeopardy, otherwise everyone will just use it as it’s quicker. It’s risk and reward now.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “No, it isn’t, we’re just going to plough through it.”<strong><br>
Janek:</strong> “Could the tracks be wider?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “This one is quite wide, once we get round that first corner, it’ll be good. Ghost Valley is a classic. Trust me.”</p>
<figure data-uuid="317396109beec"><a title="GHOST VALLEY START" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/317396109beec/ghost-valley-start.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Just get past that first corner... — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Chaos. Everybody wipes out on the first corner except one sneaky Mario that flies through. As predicted, the shortcut also gets massacred. It’s a good race, though - I beautifully cut Luigi on the inside into first but slip down the rankings when I get nudged off course by that damn shortcut roll I had insisted upon on the last lap.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “LAKITU!! HELP!”</p>
<p>Mitchell pips it. That one stung. Ghost Valley 1 is my favourite. Onto <strong>Bowser’s Castle 1</strong>. I’d like to say cool heads prevailed as the pressure to create tracks quickly is sinking in, but -</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “I wish we could build two tracks at a time to speed things up.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “We can do that, can’t we? We’ve got the floor space?”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “And another set of gates?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “We don’t have enough toilet roll to build two at the same time.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “I don’t think lack of toilet roll is your problem here.”<strong><br>
Janek:</strong> “I think the tracks need to be wider.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “The tracks are wide enough!”</p>
<figure data-uuid="acfc7d139e459"><a title="Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit 5-Year Anniversary Blowout" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/acfc7d139e459/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-5-year-anniversary-blowout.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>They really aren’t. I’m slowly coming to the realisation that the tracks I’ve based these recreations on are, by and large, wide enough for 4-6 racers to sit side by side in-game. These are wide enough for two. Sometimes. Nevertheless, after the customary gate faff, Bowser’s Castle begins. And it’s around lap four that things unravel again.</p>
<p><strong>Artie:</strong> “Oh, I’ve got a Bullet Bill!”</p>
<p>Cue complete track destruction. The Bullet Bill positively smashes the kart through the toilet roll and decimates any semblance of a track. We struggle to get through the last lap as Roy romps into first.</p>
<p><strong>JB:</strong> “No! This is bull! I’ve been first the <em>entire time.</em> I’ve been robbed.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “Damn it, Roy.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Of course! The toilet roll doesn’t affect him. He’s just sauntering through a normal track.”<strong><br>
Everyone:</strong> “Ohhhhhh.”</p>
<p>We probably should’ve realised this sooner. Mitchell is doing well this Grand Prix, though, and not shy mentioning it.</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> “Smashed that. I could take this.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Nonsense.”</p>
<p>We construct the final track of the GP, and perhaps I should’ve foreseen things getting a bit bawdy.</p>

<p><strong>JB:</strong> “Err…what are you making?”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “Yeah, this looks pretty dodgy, George.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “It’s obviously a fire flower you savages. I’m going to set the gates up.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Are you going to block off parts of it?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “No! We want different paths and shortcuts and stuff. Mario Kart is all about options.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “I thought it was all about rage? Blind rage.”</p>
<p>I proceed to drive Mario through the gates.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Oh no. This isn’t going to help my case.”</p>
<p>Everybody loses it and I cannot repeat <em>anything</em> that was said as the karts shot up and down the track. The fact that it’s a nice, big track (stop it) again makes the race really enjoyable. Thankfully, Jon volunteers to demonstrate the actual scope of it:</p>
<figure data-uuid="14949fed2dea0"><a title="JON FLOWER" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14949fed2dea0/jon-flower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>I fear any caption being taken out of context here — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The looping nature of the track makes for some great bumps and item hits, with howls going up all round the room.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3756b171012dd"><a title="CROSSOVER HIT" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3756b171012dd/crossover-hit.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>The crime as it happened — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “I really like it when there’s a crossover - it’s great to dodge past people when you’re going round.”</p>
<p>Jonny promptly smashes into the side of my kart as I say this, catching my front wheels and dragging me round with him.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “No! I was in first!”</p>
<p>The CPU has once again taken the grand prize, but Mitchell was close. We have an hour and a bit left at this point and I concede defeat on any notion of completing every Grand Prix.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> “Yeah, I think that would take about nine hours at this point.”</p>
<h2><strong>A star-studded finish?</strong></h2>

<p><strong>George:</strong> “Okay, let’s do one more Grand Prix. We’ll make it a Star Cup as the track I had planned for the Shell Cup is ridiculously narrow. Like, one car wide.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Let’s not do that.”<strong><br>
Ossie:</strong> “What track are we building?”<strong><br>
Alex:</strong> “I think it’s better when the tracks are straighter.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Agreed. No wibbly wobbly tracks. There is one I wanted to try, though.”</p>
<p>Some toilet rolls later.</p>
<p><strong>JB:</strong> “What am I looking at here?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “It’s <strong>Koopa Troopa Beach</strong>! It’s quite open, so I’m hoping it’ll give a bit more space.”</p>
<figure data-uuid="e2a8203837dd7"><a title="KOOPA TROOPA BEACH" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e2a8203837dd7/koopa-troopa-beach.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>We could use a holiday — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It does, as it happens. The drive through is pretty good, we’re all happily battling it out, when Alex quietly bends down and casually scoops up his kart.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Are you finished already?”<strong><br>
Alex:</strong> “Yep.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “The utter disrespect. I love it.”</p>
<p>My plan to finish with Rainbow Road before wrapping up on the giant pixel star is scuppered when I hit ‘Next Race’ instead of course creation as KT Beach concludes.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Noooooo! Why is that the first option?”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “It’s very weird.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “It’s like they don’t want you to change tracks each time!”</p>
<p>I think about this for a second.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Oh my god. We aren’t <em>meant</em> to change the tracks each time. It’s meant to be the <em>environment</em> that makes each track different. Then there isn’t so much faff setting up the gates and running through them each time. You can just set off and have a different feeling course.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “So what you’re saying is, we’ve wasted hours building tracks at your hands as the malevolent dictator of track design.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “No! No, it’s still been fun. Just would’ve been much quicker."<strong><br>
Ossie:</strong> “Can’t we just move the gates?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Yes! Let’s do that! Just stick the gates anywhere in the room. See, I’m not a dictator.”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “So is this open-world? Are we Mario Kart Worlding it?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “We are Mario Kart Worlding it.”</p>
<figure data-uuid="13d8092c4c473"><a title="Mario &amp; Luigi Mario Kart live" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/13d8092c4c473/mario-and-luigi-mario-kart-live.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Who needs Mario Kart World?!... — <em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We spread the gates out across the massive room and proceed to race. It’s mad and brilliant. Watching our karts bomb it across huge straights. Mitchell’s Luigi is storming out front with mine in hot pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “I swear Luigi is faster.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> Of course, he’s the superior brother.”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “Oh no! I’ve got a Bullet Bill but he doesn’t know where the track is!”</p>
<p>Jon’s shuddering kart is a sight to behold as Mitchell and I duke it out for the customary second place behind the CPU.</p>
<p><strong>JB:</strong> “Where’s the computer?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “He finished ages ago. He doesn’t care about trivial things like where the gates or toilet rolls actually are.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “Damn it, Bowser Jr.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Evil.”</p>
<p>I’ve managed to climb my way to first (second) place, swooping tightly round Gate Four, keeping my eyes off the screen and on the IRL kart. I just pinch it through Gate One and fist pumps are shot into the air.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Yes! That was a great one.”</p>
<p>But when I look at my screen, something is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Hey? It says I’m still racing.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “Yeah, I just came second.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “What? Oh no - I don’t think it registered a gate!”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Sure, sure.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “No, really! I went through them all! You saw, Mitch?”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “I didn’t see anything, mate.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> "I can’t believe this!”</p>
<p>I storm back round the track and, indeed, Gate Four did not register. I feel hollow.</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> “That’s Mario Kart, baby.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Don’t even.”</p>
<p>Other plans have meant we are down to just JB, JC, Mitch, and myself now, and we enjoy our chunky Star Cup finale - even if the CPU takes the podium again. Though we agree the fact that none of us have <em>actually</em> taken first leaves us all a little bit unfulfilled…</p>

<h2><strong>Mario’s Migraine</strong></h2>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Okay, how about one final race, no CPU, winner takes all?”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “Okay - but what’s the track?”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Yeah, we don’t want any of that tight cornering nonsense.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “I was going to save the best for last - a giant recreation of pixel Mario’s head.”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “We’re going to drive through Mario’s skull? Okay, let’s do it.”</p>

<p>Look at the beauty of that track. I could weep. Now let's tear holes in it and set the gates.</p>
<p>Removing the CPU element and introducing genuine stakes has the effect I had hoped for all along. A proper, focused hush falls on us as the countdown begins. Then, almost immediately:</p>
<p><strong>Everyone:</strong> “Oh!”</p>
<p>There’s a sandstorm on the track and somehow you can <em>feel</em> its impact on the karts? A delightful reminder that Nintendo really can conjure up magic in any experience they put their minds to at this late stage in the day. We zip round the wonderfully spacious track and Mitchell takes first.</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> “I told you - Luigi is inherently faster.”</p>

<p>Seeing that lean, green machine sitting pretty awakens the green-eyed monster in me. But I play it cool.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “That was a great one, though! One more time, just for fun? I think we can squeeze it in. No weather effect this time and we don’t need to reset the gates.”<strong><br>
Everyone:</strong> “Sure!”</p>
<p>We replace a few stray rolls and line up again. I’m making steady progress and toward the end of lap four I’ve got a pretty commanding lead. I pull the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “I mean, obviously this is the real final race, right? Winner takes all!”<strong><br>
Everyone:</strong> “What?! No!”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “You’re ridiculous.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Ridiculously good!”</p>
<p>I storm through the final gate. Except I don’t. Because <em>once again,</em> I have failed to register a gate somewhere on my last lap.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “What? No! No - NOT AGAIN!”</p>
<p>I’m rattled as I bounce from gate to gate trying to find the offender - it’s Gate Three! And fittingly, it drops me to third. I backtrack sheepishly on my previous gloating.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Maybe we will count the last one as the real final race.”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “Is that because you came second in that one?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Shh.”</p>
<h2><strong>The podium</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="caa78bff1149a"><a title="THE PODIUM" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/caa78bff1149a/the-podium.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>The winner takes it all — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So there you have it - our final ranked positions on what was essentially a very elaborate, one-race winner-takes-all experience. We decide to take a podium picture holding our gates.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Come on, everyone, grab your rank. Jonny, you came fourth.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “I don’t accept that.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “That’s Mario Kart, baby.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “How did you all find it?”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “Life-changing.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> Decent.”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “Incredible response.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Nah - I’m only joking. It was lots of fun.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “A surprisingly civilised Saturday.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Would you do it again?”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Yeah, I would. Make better tracks, though.”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “I think it needs more danger. Get a dog in.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “Yeah, get a dog and I’m there.”</p>
<p>A dog it is.</p>
<p>And what about me? Would I do it again? Yes, absolutely, and you should too if you can - but a few words of advice.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2d6dc367d704c"><a title="Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit 5-Year Anniversary Blowout" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2d6dc367d704c/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-5-year-anniversary-blowout.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Don’t make a new track for every race! Setting it up is an absolute time sink and the tightness of the game tracks translates <em>horribly</em> into a real-life arena.</p>
<p>Make sure everyone has completed the arduous tutorial <em>before</em> you get there, and for goodness' sake, give everyone space to start at Gate One. I cannot overstate how much time we lost just <em>trying to start a race.</em></p>
<p>It’s so, so close to being a gem of a game - it’s just bogged down with a little too much faff and not enough getting going. Classic Nintendo. Turn off the CPU, too. You’re never going to beat a ghost that can drive through walls - keep the stakes between the real-life folks.</p>
<p>I would recommend the huge pixel recreations and letting the in-game effects shape the race. The pile-ups, seeing the hilarious juxtaposition between the thrill of the screen and the meandering of the real karts, the classic Mario Kart gameplay - it’s all here and really worth experiencing in four-player with the right people.</p>
<p>We may have failed on our quest to complete all GPs, but we had a blast trying. And hey, no matter what the outcome, at least we’ll have toilet roll on hand for <em>months.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto" data-qa="message_content" role="presentation"> <p>Former EA developer and <em>Dead Space</em> creator Glen Schofield really wants to make a new game in the sci-fi horror series, and is apparently already calling Electronic Arts <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">following the news that Saudi Arabia</a>, with some help from private equity firms, is planning to buy up the <em>Battlefield</em> and <em>Madden</em> publisher.</p> <p>Schofield’s last big game was 2022’s <em>Dead Space</em>-like <a href="https://kotaku.com/callisto-protocol-review-dead-space-pc-ps5-goty-1849848054"><em>The Callisto Protocol</em>.</a> It wasn’t a smash hit, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-leaves-the-callisto-protocols-striking-distance-studios">he left the studio he helped found</a> to build the game less than a year after shipping it<em>.</em> But he’s not done making games. He’s currently the director at Pinstripe Games, a studio that hasn’t announced what it’s working on, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners">and he also told<em> IGN</em></a> in a recent interview that he’s got “quite a few” ideas for more games, including<em> Dead Space 4</em>. But the last time Schofield went to the publisher to talk <em>Dead Space</em>, it wasn’t interested.</p> <p>“I went to [EA] recently and they’re like no, we’re not interested anymore,” Schofield told <em>IGN</em>. “I said, ‘I can get back the leadership team.’ I need the models from [<em>Dead Space</em> remake developer] EA Motive, and I can save you 30 to 40 million dollars on the idea that I have. And, they’re like, ‘no.'”</p> <p>But now that EA is set to be bought up by Saudi Arabia, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-deal-senate-union-banking-interest-rates-2000636023">assuming the United States government doesn’t get involved and block the deal</a>, Schofield thinks there’s a chance for <em>Dead Space 4</em> to happen, or at least for the franchise to be sold off and expanded into new media.</p> </div><p>“The fact that EA just got bought, I think there’s an opportunity. I’m already making calls. I don’t know where EA’s head is right now. I don’t think they made money on [the remake]. <em>Dead Space</em> needs to be adapted to different mediums — movies, TV series, it would be great. But I am more optimistic [since the sale of EA], because somebody new could buy [IP].”</p></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dead-space-creator-sees-chance-make-dead-space-4-ea-saudi-deal-2000636125]]></content:encoded>

<p>During the latest The Crew Showcase, it was announced that The Crew 2 has received a new update today, October 16, introducing a Hybrid Mode (offline mode).</p>



<p>The Crew 2’s offline mode was announced back in September 2024, and earlier this year, Ubisoft Ivory Tower <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-will-begin-testing-the-crew-2-offline-mode-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that testing for it would begin on April 30. Within just a few months, the new Hybrid Mode will be delivered and was shadow-dropped in an update today. </p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 11 is poised to bring huge changes to Blizzard's ARPG, and will overhaul item progression, see the return of leaderboards, rework the Renown system, and even dramatically change how the game's potions work. And that's not even everything.</p><p dir="ltr">While noticeable changes to the core of Diablo 4 come alongside nearly every season, most notably with Season 4's Loot Reborn, Season 11 still stands out. None of these changes were detailed in the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">2025 content roadmap</a>, and Blizzard has teased for months that many of players' biggest gripes with the game would be addressed in a coming update. Now we finally know what Blizzard has been cooking.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586075-diablo4masterworkingchanges.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586075" data-ratio="0.56267217630854" data-width="1452" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586075-diablo4masterworkingchanges.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586075"></a><figcaption>Masterworking and Tempering are becoming less random in Season 11.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586075-diablo4masterworkingchanges.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Tempering And Masterworking Overhaul</h2><p dir="ltr">Perhaps the biggest complaint players have had since Season 4 regards the act of Tempering and Masterworking items. In the current live version of Diablo 4, Tempering allows players to add affixes to items but with a catch.</p><p dir="ltr">The act of Tempering has an element of randomness, as each Tempering recipe usually contains up to three possible affixes. Which affix gets applied is random, and players often end up "bricking" an item by being unable to get their desired affix. Masterworking, too, has an element of luck, with bonus affix upgrades every few levels applied at random. Players trying to optimize their gear to the fullest often have to reset the item when the bonus affix upgrade doesn't land on a desired roll and start the entire Masterworking process over again from scratch.</p><p dir="ltr">That's all changing with Season 11. As detailed in a new blog outlined what all is coming to Diablo 4's public test realm, Tempering will finally no longer be random, with players able to apply the affix of their choice to gear. That affix can also be changed as many times as a player likes (as long as they have the necessary resources). The catch is that gear can now only have one Tempered affix. To compensate, non-Unique items are having their base number of affixes raised from three to four.</p><p dir="ltr">Going hand-in-hand with the Tempering changes is an update to Masterworking. Instead of improving the value of affixes, Masterworking instead improves an item's overall quality, up to a quality level of 20. Higher-quality items have increased base damage, armor, or resistances, and Masterworking an item has a chance to increase its quality by two to five levels.</p><p dir="ltr">Once an item hits Masterwork level 20, players can roll for a Capstone bonus, which upgrades a random non-greater affix on the item and turns it into a greater one. These Capstone bonuses can be re-rolled an unlimited amount of times without resetting an item's quality, allowing players to hone in on specific affixes necessary for their build (though it will cost some upgrade currencies).</p><p dir="ltr">More than just changing how Tempering and Masterworking works, Blizzard has additionally added a final step for an item's upgrade journey--Sanctification. This new system lets players use a fraction of Heaven's power to sanctify an item. Sanctifying an item has a random chance to apply one of the following benefits:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Bonus Legendary power</li><li dir="ltr">Turn an affix into a Greater Affix</li><li dir="ltr">Add a bonus Sanctification Affix</li><li dir="ltr">Replace an existing affix with a Sanctification Affix</li><li dir="ltr">Make an item indestructible</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Sanctifying an item makes the item unmodifiable. Blizzard warns that Sanctification should always be the very last upgrade made to an item.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586084-diablo4season11sanctification.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586084" data-ratio="0.56215083798883" data-width="1432" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586084-diablo4season11sanctification.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586084"></a><figcaption>Diablo 4 Season 11 is introducing a final step in an item's upgrade path called Sanctification.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586084-diablo4season11sanctification.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Healing And Defense Changes</h2><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 11's major rework for item progression isn't the only big change. It's also completely changing how defenses work, and scrapping the game's entire existing potion system in the process. Armor and Resistances are becoming a rating system, and one with diminishing returns at higher levels. Armor will reduce all damage taken, rather than just physical, and the armor and resistance penalties associated with each Torment difficulty will be removed. A new character-stat page that aggregates all of a character's defensive stats into one number, Toughness, will help give players a better idea of how durable they overall are.</p><p dir="ltr">As for healing, Blizzard is ripping out the existing potion system. Instead of needing to upgrade potions every few levels, potions in Diablo 4 Season 11 will instead always immediately heal 35% of a player's total health. Base potion capacity is being reduced to four as a result, but potions will recharge over 30 seconds. To aid with healing, values for all life-gaining affixes like life on kill, life on hit, and life regeneration have all had their values increased.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortify, a unique Diablo 4 mechanic that grants additional defenses when overhealing, is being changed into what is essentially an extra life bar that's slowly drained to heal over time. When Fortified, players will heal a percentage of their max life every second, draining the Fortified health pool.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Renown Reborn</h2><p dir="ltr">Potions aren't the only idea from the launch version of Diablo 4 that is being scrapped. Renown, a zone-specific reputation system that has various rewards like additional potion slots, skill points, and gold tied to it, is going away, at least for the game's Seasonal realm. It will still exist permanently in the Eternal realm, effectively making for noticeably different versions of Diablo 4 to choose from.</p><p dir="ltr">On the game's seasonal server, Renown is being replaced and combined with the game's current Season Journey system to form a new system called Season Rank. Players will earn rewards like additional skill and paragon points, Smoldering Ashes, and cosmetics by completing various objectives and advancing their Season Rank. Altars of Lilith will grant experience and minor rewards, but will no longer grant permanent stats as they have since the game launched.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586086-diablo4season11leaderboards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586086" data-ratio="0.56215083798883" data-width="1432" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586086-diablo4season11leaderboards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586086"></a><figcaption>Leaderboards are finally returning in Diablo 4 Season 11.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586086-diablo4season11leaderboards.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">The Tower</h2><p dir="ltr">Leaderboards are returning to Diablo 4 after having previously been deactivated alongside the game's Vessel of Hatred expansion. This time, however, they are taking a new form--The Tower. A new multi-floor dungeon, The Tower works similarly to The Pit, where players will need to battle through monsters and fill a meter within a 10-minute time limit.</p><p dir="ltr">Once enough monsters (or progress orbs that drop from them) have been slain, a random Tower boss will spawn. Defeating them concludes the dungeon and stops the timer, registering the run on the new leaderboard. There will be solo leaderboards for each class, as well as leaderboards for parties of two, three, and four. There will additionally be separate leaderboards for Hardcore characters. Blizzard said the version of The Tower and leaderboard appearing in Season 11 will be considered a beta, and that it hopes to update The Tower in future seasons.</p><p dir="ltr">There's more too, with Season 11 set to add a new world boss for the first time since launch, make enemy monsters tougher, and introduce a whole new set of seasonal powers and mechanics. Testing for Diablo 4 Season 11 will begin on the game's PTR October 21, with the season proper set to debut on December 9. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">Diablo 4's second expansion</a> is slated to arrive sometime next year.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> may be far more challenging come Season 11, with a slew of updates set to address monster behavior and difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed by Blizzard, the goal is to have monsters starting with Season 11 more regularly test players' defenses and force players to interact with them in new ways. Enemy monsters will see changes to make their behavior less predictable, while at the same time making it so each type of monster will have their own clear role and identity in combat. Monsters packs will also group up less, making it more difficult for players to wipe out large groups of multiple packs in a single go.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586093-diablo4season11azmodanworldboss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586093" data-ratio="0.56215083798883" data-width="1432" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586093-diablo4season11azmodanworldboss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586093"></a><figcaption>Azmodan will be a new world boss coming in Diablo 4 Season 11.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586093-diablo4season11azmodanworldboss.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A big part of the update to monsters will be new affixes, with more than 20 additional affixes for players to deal with. Elites will spawn minions that inherit some of their affixes, and affixes will in general be more powerful, requiring players to deal with them before taking out less-dangerous foes. Blizzard said that overall, monster affixes should overlap less in their design, be more visually clear, and be more engaging.</p><p dir="ltr">Those changes, in conjunction with other Season 11 updates like fewer potion charges and item progression changes, should make Diablo 4 overall more challenging than before. But deadlier monsters aren't the only thing players have to be afraid of. Season 11 is also adding a new world boss, as well as ways to encounter endgame Lesser Evil bosses like Duriel, Andariel, and Belial while doing endgame activities like Helltide, The Pit, and Kurast Undercity. The new world boss, the first added since Diablo 4's launch over two years ago, will be a familiar face to Diablo 3 players. Azmodan, the Lord of Sin, has a chance to appear as a world boss in the game's open world but can also be summoned at will using a special altar south of Zarbinzet.</p><p dir="ltr">It's currently unclear if the ability to summon the Lesser Evils is an evergreen mechanic or strictly seasonal one, but defeating bosses in this way will reward Divine Favor, used to level up a seasonal Divine Gifts mechanic and increase players' Season Rank (a new system for the game's seasonal server that combines the game's current Renown and Season Journey systems).</p><p dir="ltr">More powerful monsters and the inclusion of Azmodan aren't the only big changes coming next season, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-11-might-be-its-biggest-rework-yet/1100-6535476/" data-ref-id="1100-6535476">Diablo 4 Season 11 poised to be the game's biggest rework yet</a>. Season 11 will additionally overhaul item progression with sweeping changes to Masterworking and Tempering, reintroduce leaderboards, and more. Diablo 4 Season 11 is slated to begin on December 9, with PTR testing for the season beginning October 21. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">Diablo 4's second expansion</a> is expected to release in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Techland has outlined its eleven-week roadmap of updates coming to Dying Light: The Beast. The game launched a month ago and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-sells-over-1-million-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was immediately successful among fans</a>; now, the developers are ready to make it even better in the coming three months.</p>



<p>Confirmed additions include the New Game+ mode, Legend Levels, Nightmare Difficulty, new weapon executions, and Ray Tracing support on PC, which was suddenly removed just ahead of the launch, much to the detriment of the game's visual quality. There's also going to be a collaboration with PUBG Mobile.</p>



<p>Moreover, Techland announced a global community initiative titled Call of the Beast. The event started today and runs until January 7, 2026. New challenges and exclusive rewards will be introduced every week on Thursday.</p>



<p>Throughout this campaign, players worldwide will work together to achieve weekly goals that celebrate teamwork, persistence, and the strength of the Dying Light: The Beast community. Each challenge offers exclusive rewards that appear in participants’ in-game stash once the objectives are met. Every week, from new weapons to unique car skins, brings fresh surprises and reasons to celebrate the collective success. Players must contribute to that week's goal to receive the weekly rewards.</p>



<p>Sticking together with the community to complete at least 17 of the 22 goals will unlock a secret Legendary Reward, which players will receive at the end of the event. Additionally, if the community completes 20 goals, everyone who participated in at least one challenge will receive all the rewards, regardless of when they started playing Call of the Beast.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The first community challenge is called Season to Dismember and asks players to cut off 30 million limbs for a Lumberjack Car Skin and 60 million limbs for a Woodchopper Axe. This challenge will last until Thursday, October 23 at 4 PM CEST.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-expansion-cheap-sale-bundle-star-wars-2000636124</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/get-every-destiny-2-expansion-including-the-new-star-wars-one-for-just-35-right-now.1326835/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The<em> Destiny 2</em> 2025 Charity Bundle is almost too good to pass up. I say almost because the actual state of the sci-fi MMO right now is so rough that this might be the <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-free-final-shape-edge-fate-expansion-ps5-1851785927">worst time to hop into Bungie’s loot shooter in years</a>. At the same time, the bundle includes every paid piece of content for the game, including the upcoming <em>Star Wars Renegades</em> expansion, for half the price of a new game.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.greenmangamingbundles.com/bundles/destiny-2-expansion-bundle-2025/">charity bundle</a> is being sold in partnership with Green Man Gaming and is only for the PC version of the game, but the majority of the $35 price tag all goes to the Bungie Foundation which uses gaming to help children in need. Here’s everything included in the bundle:</p>

 <ul> <li><em>Destiny 2 </em>base game</li> <li><em>Forsaken Pack</em></li> <li><em>Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack</em></li> <li><em>Beyond Light</em></li> <li><em>Shadowkeep</em></li> <li><em>Witch Queen</em></li> <li><em>Lightfall</em></li> <li><em>The Final Shape</em></li> <li><em>The Edge of Fate</em></li> <li><em>Renegades</em></li> </ul> <p>That’s everything there is to play currently (the original story campaign and other content were sunset years ago). It’s a great deal, and the only thing stopping me from recommending it to everyone I know is that <em>Destiny 2</em> tends to live and die by the most recent expansion, and 2025’s <em>The Edge of Fate</em> is one of its worst. That’s infected the rest of the loot shooter with changes to the grind, gear, and progression that make the entire game <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-renegades-star-wars-power-reset-2000632488">a drag right now</a>. Bungie responded with a series of fixes, including promises to roll back some of the most controversial changes, but that requires placing a bet on <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s future rather than investing in its present.</p> <p>The addition of <em>Renegades</em> is the one big silver lining for this bundle. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-renegades-trailer-release-date-1851779376"><em>Star Wars</em>-themed expansion</a> is teasing some interesting ideas and new modes. At the very least, there will be a lightsaber sword everyone can obtain and mess around with. And if <em>Renegades</em> doesn’t help right the ship, well, I’m not sure anything will. So if nothing else, consider the charity bundle a super-cheap ticket to witness the rebirth of <em>Destiny 2</em>. Or, if things don’t turn around, its eventual end.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Owlcat Games announced that its next cRPG, Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, will launch in Open Alpha on PC in Q4 2025. Thus, aspiring Inquisitors will soon be able to command a diverse warband, shaping the fate of the Imperium one decision at a time.</p>



<p>In Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, a narrative-driven tactical RPG set in the grimdark universe created by Games Workshop, players lead a warband of diverse companions in a desperate battle against heresy and corruption against the backdrop of Noctis Aeterna and the mystery of the Tyrant Star. These companions range from loyal Imperial subjects, such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catachan, to nefarious xenos, including a bird-like Kroot mercenary.</p>



<p>Featuring intricate investigations, a turn-based combat system, and choices with grave consequences, Dark Heresy promises to greatly expand on the ideas previously seen in Rogue Trader. Unlike that game, it will also feature fully voiced dialogue. You can find <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-gamescom-preview-inquisitors-are-always-right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our Gamescom 2025 preview here</a>.</p>



<p>Speaking about Rogue Trader, Owlcat also announced that the cRPG will soon be released for the Nintendo Switch 2. It will be the first game made by the developer to launch on the new platform. Previously, Owlcat had released a cloud-only version of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous for the first Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Rogue Trader earned an 8 out of 10 score on Wccftech from Francesco De Meo:</p>



<p><em>With the great amount of love for the setting that was poured into the game evident from every line of dialogue and every little detail, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is one of the best games based on the universe created by Games Workshop, and a solid tactical turn-based role-playing game that can provide hundreds of hours of fun.</em></p>



<p>The game has also been greatly refined over the past two years and has received two DLCs: <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-void-shadows-q-launch-had-way-too-many-bugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Void Shadows</a> and Lex Imperialis. Two more upcoming expansions have been announced. In the third expansion, players will enter a Necron vault curated by the iconic Trazyn the Infinite. There, they will challenge ancient guardians and uncover relics tied to the Von Valancius legacy. In the fourth DLC, players will explore the Processional of the Damned, a surreal graveyard of voidships where they will descend into madness and mystery.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-competitive-multiplayer-game-spellcasters-chronicles/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spellcasters-chronicles-is-quantic-dream%E2%80%99s-new-f2p-3v3-competitive-multiplayer-game.1326817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Shortly after Quantic Dream <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-announces-multiplayer-game-star-wars-eclipse-work-continues/">announced that it would be making a competitive multiplayer game</a>, the studio went ahead and revealed the game to be <a href="https://www.spellcasterschronicles.com/en-US">Spellcasters Chronicles</a>, a free-to-play, 3v3 action-strategy game with third-person combat, where players clash in "<em>vertical arenas</em>."</p>



<p>You play as a 'Spellcaster,' and face off against other players in squads of three, in 25-minute battles where players have to capture altars, gain territory, and destroy the opposing squad's 'Lifestones' to achieve victory.</p>



<p>Spellcasters have their own spells they cast, though the more significant element of their gameplay seems to be summoning creatures to fight for you in these battles. Each Spellcaster has its own archetype though, so players can jump between them to find ones that suit their playstyle. Beyond those archetypes, you'll also be deck-building by selecting various spells and creatures to summon as part of our character's loadout.</p>



<p>Quantic Dream debuted a gameplay trailer for Spellcasters Chronicles, which you can check out below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SPELLCASTERS CHRONICLES | REVEAL TEASER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sEXC2rMYWTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We are honoured and excited to introduce Spellcasters Chronicles to players today, developed in our Paris and Montreal studios</em>," Quantic Dream co-founder and president David Cage says in a press release. "<em>Stepping into a new genre with a fresh artistic approach has been both a challenge and a source of growth, allowing us to evolve as a team. We now look forward to shaping the game further with players' feedback and to perfecting this journey together. This project reflects the creative spirit and technical ambitions guiding Quantic Dream for nearly three decades. With Spellcasters Chronicles, we sought to bring a new form of gaming experience blending action and strategy to life, while exploring community-driven narrative.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It has been an exploration of bold ideas, a chance to expand into social and multiplayer experiences, and an adventure shared by a new talented team of experts within our studios in Paris and Montreal who brought this original universe to life and are continuing to develop new experiences including Star Wars: Eclipse</em>."</p>



<p>Quantic Dream will host a closed beta for the game at the end of 2025, which you can currently sign up for if you're keen to try Spellcasters Chronicles yourself. The closed beta is invite-only, so signing up doesn't ensure you a spot; it just puts you in the running for one.</p>



<p>While the gameplay trailer does its job of making the matches look interesting, even potentially exciting, how the game plays will be what decides its fate. It'll be interesting to see how players react when they get their hands on the game for the first time, which is happening much sooner than the closed beta.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, on October 17, at TwitchCon in San Diego, on the LAN stage, people will get to play Spellcasters Chronicles for the first time. We'll also get a gameplay deep dive of the game, and there will be a community Q&amp;A session for curious players to learn more about Spellcasters Chronicles.</p>



<p>Hopefully, for Quantic Dream's sake, it goes well. We'll see how the world reacts when we get a proper look at Spellcasters Chronicles.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars: Eclipse Developer Quantic Dream Working on "Competitive Multiplayer" Game]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-competitive-multiplayer-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-working-on-competitive-multiplayer-game.1326814/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Star Wars: Eclipse&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human&nbsp;</em>developer Quantic Dream has teased another project in the works, and according to studio head David Cage, it's a departure from what the company is known for.</p>

<p>That's according to a new blog post on Quantic Dream's official website, titled "Writing a New Chapter". In the post, Cage says his studio has "decided to take a new step" after "years as a single-project studio", and that new step is a "competitive multiplayer experience".</p>

<p>Cage acknowledges Quantic Dream's lack of experience in the area, but he says that together with the community's "support and feedback", he believes the studio can create "something truly unique".</p>

<p>Quantic Dream itself was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-acquired-by-netease" rel="nofollow">subsequently acquired</a> by Chinese gaming giant NetEase, but the developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-unaffected-netease-layoffs" rel="nofollow">remained "unaffected"</a> by the layoffs and cancellations that have recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">swept</a> many of that company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">subsidiaries</a>.</p>

            <p>Too many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> rounds of Conquest have been ending in a dissatisfying time-out, Uncle EA have found, with rival teams failing to completely devour each other's supply of spawning tickets. We've all known engagements like that - tit-for-tat exchanges between mostly AFK recon players. Irresolutions that might yawn forever were it not for everybody's <em>real</em> enemy, the clock. The gutsy response would have been to retitle Conquest "Bathos", or "War on Terror" if they wanted to sadden George Bush, or "Waiting for Bravo" if they wanted to amuse the Beckett fans, or "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>" if they wanted to tweak Valve's whiskers. Instead, EA have taken the coward's way out and chopped the allowance of tickets on a per map basis.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"We've reduced the starting ticket count across all Conquest maps so matches finish at a more natural pace," the devs explain on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978462075488817479">MechaHitler.com</a>. "Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets. We'll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right." 
</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the cuts, from which you might be able to deduce map sizes, if you've yet to play Battlefield 6. Operation Firestorm is a whopper with much open/burning desert between capture points, hence the dramatically lower new ticket total. Empire State is relatively tiddly and crowded, and has accordingly received a smaller haircut. There are probably more nuanced observations to make of each map's layout. Hey, don't look at me - I spend most of my Operation Firestorm matches pretending to be a cactus.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Empire State from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Liberation Peak from 1000 to 800</li>
<li>Manhattan Bridge from 1000 to 800 </li>
<li>Operation Firestorm from 1000 to 700 </li>
<li>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900 </li>
<li>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700 </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The chops follow a number of Battlefield 6 updates and hotfixes to, amongst other things, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-gets-a-hotfix-targeting-bugged-hit-damage-and-ea-are-busy-inspecting-bouncy-ladders">get rid of ladders that behave like trebuchets</a>,  and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-backend-tweaks-tune-down-some-sniper-rifles-and-shotguns-as-ea-keep-fiddling-with-little-knobs">defang certain sniper rifles and shotguns</a>. How are you getting on with it, if you're playing?</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-warhammer-40k-review-how-long-review-ps5-1851639029"><i>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</i></a> is getting a free demo for anyone who hasn’t already played one of the best shooters of 2025. It’ll give players access to a couple of story missions and almost the full suite of multiplayer activities before they decide if they want to buy it or not.</p> <p>The free demo will be available from October 16-20 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S and until October 23 on PC via Steam. It’ll include the intro and first mission of the story campaign as well as unlimited multiplayer for the Inferno, Decapitation and Vox Liberatis Operations (online co-op missions) as well as all Eternal War modes except for the recently added Helbrute Onslaught which is basically the game’s horde mode.</p>

 <p><em>Space Marine 2</em> is a sequel to the cult-favorite Xbox 360-era third-person shooter that delivers an old-school emphasis on meat and potatoes gunplay but with the impressive visuals of a modern blockbuster. It takes place during the Fourth Tyrannic War and is steeped in the lore and politics of the Warhammer 40K universe but doesn’t require you to have any working knowledge of the tabletop source material to enjoy the great art direction and <a href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-saber-ceo-asmongold-youtube-comment-1851650858">old-school, AA charm</a>.</p> <p>If you choose to take the plunge, <em>Space Marine 2</em> is currently half-off on console ($35) and 55 percent off on PC ($30). The DLC is all discounted as well. But don’t forget, you’ll need a Game Pass or PS Plus subscription to play multiplayer on Xbox and PlayStation, even with the free demo, unfortunately.</p>

              <p>Quantic Dream, responsible for just&nbsp;<em>so</em> many over-hyped, anticlimactic, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-fans-of-detroit-become-human-hate-most-of-th-1828260985">faintly</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/heavy-rains-most-gruesome-scene-is-still-gut-wrenching-1796855768">racist</a> games, is back with some big news! Not only is it still, allegedly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-biggest-gaming-disappointments-of-2021-1848249172">developing a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> game</a>, but the studio known for single-player story-focused games is now also working on a competitive multiplayer game called <em>Spellcasters</em>.</p> <p>David Cage’s Quantic Dream is world-renowned for its cinematic story-driven games that promise extraordinary levels of interaction and choice and sometimes instead deliver <a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/quantic-dream/david-cages-writing-has-a-message-but-its-not-what">badly written nonsense</a> about ninjas or something. So who better than the developers of&nbsp;<em>Indigo Prophesy</em> and&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human</em> to pick up the endlessly dropped baton of the next great <em>Overwatch</em>-like? That’s the plan according to Cage who, in <a href="https://blog.quanticdream.com/writing-a-new-chapter/">a blog post on the company’s site</a>, explained the much-expanded studio is working on a “competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us.”</p>

 <p>“This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far,” Cage continues. “But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been part of our DNA.”</p>

  <p>It’s honestly hard to see any of this innovative originality in the trailer that dropped as I was writing this.&nbsp;<em>Spellcasters</em> might end up being completely brilliant for all I know, but the 3×3 hero shooter looks astonishingly generic to my eyes, indistinguishable from a dozen other wannabes.</p>

 <p>Quantic Dream has had quite the odd last few years, perhaps driving its desire for radical change. <a href="https://kotaku.com/david-cages-quantic-dreams-accused-of-being-a-toxic-wor-1822068440#_ga=2.116815942.1198361688.1524304403-255961593.1515548411">The studio was accused by multiple former and current staff of being a “toxic workplace”</a> that featured homophobia, racism and punishing crunch; claims which were furiously refuted by the two bosses, Cage and Guillaume de Fondaumière. So angered were the pair that in 2018 <a href="https://kotaku.com/detroit-developer-quantic-dream-sues-french-media-over-1825453518">they sued the French media outlets that published the claims</a>, which led to <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-quantic-dream-executives-cry-ask-if-they-can-l-1847036252">astonishing scenes in a 2021 court case</a> where de Fondaumière asked if they were allowed to lie because they weren’t under oath, while Cage was reported to have cried, stamped, screamed and eventually stormed out of the court room. Then, for one final surreal twist, <a href="https://kotaku.com/detroit-dev-quantic-dreams-wins-lawsuit-without-actuall-1847716375">Quantic Dream won part of this case but without ever disproving the allegations</a>. (It’s even weirder, because despite&nbsp;<em>Le Monde</em> and&nbsp;<em>Mediapart</em> collaborating on its reporting about the studio, QD somehow won against one and lost against the other. Meanwhile, the third outlet involved,&nbsp;<em>Canard PC</em>, wasn’t sued at all.) However, given it lost another part, it means much of the reporting was upheld by the courts.</p>

 <h2>But what about&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em>?</h2> <p>So anyway, it’s that lot making the next hopeful to enter the live-service multiplayer arena. And that’s also, we are led to believe, still making <em>Star Wars: Eclipse.</em> The game was&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-quantic-dreams-dramatic-new-star-war-1848176894"> announced in 2021</a> (following <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-ve-heard-about-a-quantic-dream-star-wars-game-1847708431">widespread rumors</a>), before going extremely quiet for a couple of years. Then in 2023 <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-eclipse-quantic-dream-game-delayed-anyone-die-1850865409">we learned it would not feature any “game overs” and that any character could die</a>. But then, another two years of silence. So is it dead? Apparently not. Cage makes a&nbsp;<em>very</em> brief reference to the game in his post, stating, “Of course, development of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em> continues, and we are eager to share more with you in the future.”</p>

  <p>But literally nothing else. It doesn’t bode well, honestly, given it’s been four years and you have to think Disney would like something to show off. It has in fact been over seven years since the developer released a game, with its focus seemingly shifted toward publishing in the interim. It published last year’s&nbsp;<em>Dustborn</em>&nbsp;alongside&nbsp;<em>Under the Waves</em>, in addition to helping out with motion capture for <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p> <p>Now the company is splitting its focus, clearly hoping to do what Sony and so many others couldn’t, and release a hit hero shooter.</p>

              <p>If you’ve ever tried transferring a batch of 4K videos to an external hard drive and ended up waiting forever, you know how crucial a good SSD can be. <strong>Speed, reliability, and toughness</strong>: that’s what really matters when you’re juggling files between your laptop or camera. The SanDisk 2TB <em>Extreme</em> portable SSD checks all those boxes while hitting its lowest price ever on Amazon. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/">it’s down to $149 from $209 which is the cheapest it’s ever been for this storage powerhouse</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portable Power, Tough Build, And Lightning Speed</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with speed, since that’s where this SSD really boasts its strongest performance: The SanDisk Extreme SSD employs <strong>NVMe technology and up to 1050 MB/s read and 1000 MB/s write speeds are possible with it</strong>. That’s about ten times the speed of the run-of-the-mill external hard drive (HDD) so you can transfer massive video projects or backup your laptop in minutes, not hours.</p>



<p>Apart from its ruggedness and light weight, the reason for the popularity of this drive is consistency: You plug it in a Mac, PC, or tablet and the performance is rock steady. It <strong>plugs in via USB‑C and comes with USB 3.2 Gen 2 for full bandwidth</strong> and also operates with older USB‑A with the cable included.</p>
<p>On top of the existing 29% discount, it’s probably the lowest price-to-performance ratio available from SanDisk in years.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/will-battlefield-6-battle-royale-be-free-to-play.1326793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s going to be a huge moment when we get to drop into Battlefield 6’s battle royale mode. The spiritual successor to Firestorm and Hazard Zone will be a historic occasion, and we’re checking to see if it’s free-to-play, plus anything else cost-related, or what you need to hop in.</p>



<p>Battle royale is an interesting one in 2025. The genre’s peak days feel behind us more than they are ahead, but millions of players are still dropping into huge maps slowly being engulfed by electricity, storms, and gas. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> launched with a decent campaign and a brilliant multiplayer mode, but we’ve always known a battle royale extra was lurking in the background.</p>



<p>It’s fascinating to see how destruction is factored into the fray. Before we get there, however, let’s see if you’ve got to pay to take the ride.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play">Is Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Free To Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An all-out war approaches. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to Insider Gaming sources, yes, the Battle Royale game mode will be completely free-to-play under the Battlefield 6 umbrella.</strong></p>



<p>We exclusively reported on Feb. 27, 2024, that EA was working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale mode</a> for the (then) upcoming Battlefield 6. Pretty much everything in that story came to fruition. But the story also added:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Ripple Effect, the studio that is working on a ‘new experience’ for the Battlefield franchise is working on a new Battle Royale title that’s currently aimed to be <strong>free-to-play</strong> and follow a similar strategy to the highly successful Call of Duty: Warzone that will see the free-to-play experience tie-in with its premium release.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Officially, all we know in this moment is that BF 6’s battle royale is happening. EA hasn’t confirmed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-pois-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>, nor officially confirmed our report that it will be free. Stay tuned for further updates, but we’ll be shocked if you have to pay an extra penny for BF 6’s battle royale—perhaps with one slight caveat.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-battlefield-6-battle-royale-be-a-standalone-game-like-warzone">Will Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Be A Standalone Game Like Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>There has been no news or leaks to say if Battlefield 6’s battle royale game is included in the overall BF 6 package, or if it’ll be a free-to-play download like Call of Duty: Warzone.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s that caveat we mentioned. We haven’t heard anything regarding EA’s final decision on the battle royale being completely free, or only free to paying Battlefield 6 customers.</p>



<p>Warzone is a Call of Duty game, but it’s a separate (free) download. We’ll have to see if the new battle royale component follows its path.</p>



<p>If we can and do learn more about the battle royale mode, you’ll hear it from us. We haven’t steered you far wrong when it comes to BF 6 news and leaks, so we’ll keep our eyes open on more battle royale news. Are you looking forward to seeing how different a BF 6 BR looks in 2025?
