		<p>Two Point Studios and Sega have announced Two Point Museum, the next game in their irreverent management sim series. Two Point Museum is ‘coming soon’ for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | Announcement Trailer (PEGI - ENG)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oM5dGYAS-eY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The successor to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-hospital">Two Point Hospital</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-campus">Two Point Campus</a>, Two Point Museum will try to tickle your dinosaur’s funny bone while getting you to manage and curate spectacular exhibits that fill museum goers with a sense of entertainment and wonder.</p>
<p>You might wonder how Two Point Studios are going to make museums weird and humorous, considering the real world counterparts, but you can immediately see from the announcement trailer how they’re going to go about things. Dinosaur skeletons and recreations have been given quirky designs and humorous expressions, there’s truly gigantic foot prints, and even prehistoric computers made out of rock.</p>
<p>You’ll have to go out and hunt for those relics, sending archeologists and explorers to undiscovered areas to find unusual relics to match the styles and rarity types for your museum. A new ‘endless’ star scoring system will keep you trying to tweak the museum layout and improve on previous collections that you curated, and that star rating will also rely on keeping staff and guests happy – organise guided tours for the latter with guides feeding visitors information and generating buzz that can lead to donations.</p>

<p>You’ll have to keep a keen eye for naughty types, with vandals, thieves and mischievous children all potentially up to no good, and certain items (like frozen cavemen) will have to be kept in the right temperature.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t forget the gift shop.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing more of Two Point Museum, given our love of the first two Two Point games. We said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/04/two-point-campus-review/">Two Point Campus review</a>, “If Two Point Hospital was a triumphant return of the Theme Hospital style management sim, then Two Point Campus is a true heir. It takes the same tongue-in-cheek tone and applies it to a new setting, it learns from the journey its predecessor went through, and it deepens the experience for anyone that wants it.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-launches-on-playstation-5-and-pc-october-4/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Until Dawn is one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-state-of-play-trailer-updated-characters-visuals/">most well-known games</a> created by Supermassive Games. It's time for the game to shine again. Released in 2015, it was a huge success for the PlayStation 4 and spurred Supermassive Games to make more games, such as The Quarry and The Dark Pictures Anthology. Now, it's time for Until Dawn to take the limelight again, as it's gotten an official release date for when it will launch on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>The story for Until Dawn will still be the same, but the game has been revamped massively to showcase the best cinematic experience of the game. To make the most of Until Dawn, the developers recreated the game in Unreal Engine 5, giving players access to a more intimate experience throughout the unfolding horrific events.</p>
<p>Using Unreal Engine 5, they have updated the character models and environments, improved visual effects and animations, and maximized the visual experience of Until Dawn for new and returning players. The developers spent much time on the character models, "bringing them in line with modern advances in character modeling and rendering," <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/14/until-dawn-rebuilt-and-enhanced-for-ps5-and-pc-launches-october-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says Neil McEwan</a>, the Creative Director of Ballistic Moon. Ballistic Moon is a British games studio that has helped with this massive project to deliver it in the Fall of 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Until Dawn - Comparison Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bIkuM5y0Bjw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To give Until Dawn an extra boost of realism, they added the injury mask system, which allows the characters in-game to look extra gritty. This system adds elements such as cuts, bruises, tears, and even snow to the characters for a more realistic finish.</p>
<p>Overall, the game looks to have a more polished experience with a new camera mechanic that will make navigating the game easier. Instead of the camera from before, players will now experience fixed shots and over-the-shoulder camera views so that fans can see the world of Until Dawn and give players brand new perspectives as they explore.</p>
<p>In addition to some fine-tuning narrative tweaks, they've also reworked their accessibility settings to help the game be more accessible and enjoyable to all horror fans. There is a new alternative to the "Don't Move" mechanic called "Stay Calm," which utilizes third-party peripherals that don't feature a gyroscope or for players who prefer a different challenge.</p>
<p>Until Dawn will be available for pre-order from August 21. It's important to note that if you want to play this game on a PC, you must have a PlayStation Network account to play the game. Until Dawn will be available on PC and PlayStation 5 on October 4.</p>

Your options are Maelstrom in Limsa Lominsa, Twin Adder in Gridania, and Immortal Flames in Ul’Dah. Your choice will have no bearing, as they all lead to a quest that unlocks Chocobos, however they do affect the next Main Scenario Quest (MSQ) with Maelstrom members receiving “Till Sea Swallows All,” Twin Adder members picking up “Woods Will Be Done,” and Immortal Flames members obtaining “For Coin and Country.”<br></p><p>Once these quests are completed, you can talk to each faction’s representative to accept a new Feature Quest titled “My Little Chocobo.” This is the quest that will reward a Chocobo on completion.</p><h2 id="h127591"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Complete My Little Chocobo</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="221cea4c37b91d4d084834da26905176" data-recommend-id="image://221cea4c37b91d4d084834da26905176" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a lovely shop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's a lovely shop." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="221cea4c37b91d4d084834da26905176" data-recommend-id="image://221cea4c37b91d4d084834da26905176" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a lovely shop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are some small differences in how you complete “My Little Chocobo” depending on which Company you joined. Each variation will require you to obtain a Chocobo Issuance, which can be purchased from your Company’s shop using “Seals.” Seals are a type of currency issued by your Grand Company for completing different in-game tasks that can be used to buy exclusive items such as the key item for this quest.<br></p><p>It should be mentioned that the Seals used are exclusive to that company, so you cannot use the currency from Twin Adder to buy items from the Immortal Flames. Each Company’s shop should be right next to the quest giver for “My Little Chocobo.” Once it is obtained, you will have to present it to that region’s Chocokeep to receive your mount. Below are the types of seals each Company uses, the type of Chocobo Issuance you will need, and who it should be presented to.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Maelstrom Members will need 200 Storm Seals to buy a Storm Chocobo Issuance and present it to Fraegeim in Limsa Lominsa.</li><li>Twin Adder Members will need 200 Serpent Seals to buy a Serpent Chocobo Issuance and present it to Cingur in Gridania.</li><li>Immortal Flames Members will need 200 Flame Seals to buy a Flame Chocobo Issuance and present it Mimigun in Ul’Dah.</li></ul><figure id="" data-id="7017dc91cd5892bf629cc10981228ec8" data-recommend-id="image://7017dc91cd5892bf629cc10981228ec8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1123" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Why look, a Chocobo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Why look, a Chocobo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7017dc91cd5892bf629cc10981228ec8" data-recommend-id="image://7017dc91cd5892bf629cc10981228ec8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1123" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Why look, a Chocobo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once this is done, you will need to name their Chocobo and then speak to their respective Chocokeep (Fraegeim, Cingur or Mimigun) to turn in their quest, at which point you will unlock Mounts and be awarded a Chocobo Whistle.<br></p><h2 id="h127592"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Obtain Seals?</strong></h2><p>That may have explained how to complete the quest, but now you may be wondering, “How do I get seals for my Chocobo Issuance form?”. Remember that quest you completed earlier to unlock “My Little Chocobo”? It provided a reward of 300 seals from your respective Company, so you should have enough to pick up the Issuance and turn it in for a Chocobo! If you already spent it, the easiest way to grind for more is by participating in small combat events called FATEs, scattered around the world.</p><h2 id="h127593"><a id=""></a><strong>How Do I Summon My Chocobo?</strong></h2><p>You may have noticed that the reward for “My Little Chocobo” was not the bird itself, but a Chocobo Whistle. This is an item that needs to be used to actually register the mount to your character. To do so, navigate to your inventory and find the Chocobo Whistle. Select the “Use” Option. Now you will have a Chocobo ready to ride! Note that any mount you receive will be provided to you in this way, so if you are confused why a specific one you should have isn’t showing up in your Mount Options, check your inventory and make sure you used its corresponding item.</p><figure id="" data-id="d3cd0ea14cd44b95f2b72343fb222f47" data-recommend-id="image://d3cd0ea14cd44b95f2b72343fb222f47" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's the menu tab.

Select the Chocobo Icon and select summon to bring it to the field. This action can also be set to your hotbar to summon instantly, and can be repeated for future mounts as well.</p><figure id="" data-id="074b8d9327146a8e5841bed2c1e29d30" data-recommend-id="image://074b8d9327146a8e5841bed2c1e29d30" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The mount list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The mount list." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="074b8d9327146a8e5841bed2c1e29d30" data-recommend-id="image://074b8d9327146a8e5841bed2c1e29d30" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The mount list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is a lot of running around in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, so you are sure to get a lot of mileage out of your new ride. Just remember to save the Seals you obtain from the MSQ until you are able to trade them for a Chocobo Issuance, or else you may have to grind some out to obtain your giant bird. Also don’t panic if you don’t see your Chocobo when you finish the mission. You probably just need to blow the whistle and then you’re off to the races!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another studio has announced major layoffs as TerraTech developer Payload Studios has laid off 25 percent (25%) of its staff this week. The announcement comes via the studio’s founder and CEO Russ Clarke <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7229083322172223488/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via LinkedIn</a>.</p>



<p>“We tried very hard to avoid this, and I won’t pretend that we got everything right over the last few years – but ultimately the games market has been very tough in recent times, and shows little sign of getting easier,” he said. “Small independents like us have no protection from this, other than ‘nailing it’ every time, which is much easier said than done.”</p>



<p>While Clarke said that 25% of the team would be let go, there was no specific number mentioned. According to Rocket Reach, the company has 48 employees. If that’s accurate, at least 12 people will have lost their jobs from this news.</p>



<p>“Payload will carry on, and bounce back from this, I firmly believe; but it’s a hard road and it will stay hard for a good while longer,” Clarke continued. “TerraTech and TerraTech Worlds will continue to be maintained and developed without interruption – we thank our wonderful community for their support, and we wish the best to those amazing co-workers with whom we have shared this incredible journey, but must now regretfully part ways.”</p>



<p>With the layoffs at Payload Studios, the gaming industry has seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">over 11,600 people</a>, at least, lose their jobs in 2024 alone.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uRI3WOfER0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Sega announced Two Point Museum from developer Two Point Studios with a new cinematic and gameplay trailer.</p>



<p>The trailer did not confirm a release window or date, but it does conclude by saying the game is “coming soon.” The rating is still pending in today’s footage, so it may take a little while for the devs to offer concrete release details.</p>



<p>The new trailer also reveals Two Point Museum will be available on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Fans can wishlist the game now.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Two Point Museum | Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1uRI3WOfER0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The announcement trailer showcases a variety of new objects for the museum theme, concentrating on a range of dinosaur skeletons. </p>



<p>It also features Two Point Studios’ trademark sense of humor, calling 3-year-old computers ancient history and teasing zany antics.</p>



<p>The trailer description elaborates on the game, revealing that players will “coordinate experts on expeditions to uncover exciting artefacts.” </p>



<p>Players must also “strategically decorate and plan your exhibits” for guests, keep staff happy, secure donations, and more. </p>



<p>There are options to customize decorations, manage tours and pricing. Some of the in-game obstacles include thieves and carnivorous plants.</p>



<p>Most recently, Sega also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-trademarks-yakuza-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a new trademark</a> for “Yakuza Wars” last week. Fans quickly speculated that Sega could be planning on a major announcement for the mystery project during September’s anticipated Tokyo Game Show.</p>

A release date was not announced. <span id="more-905784"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via SEGA:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>As fledgling curators, you have the task of designing and refining your very own museums to create the ultimate guest experience. Coordinate Experts on far-flung expeditions to discover new Exhibits, generating Buzz to entice droves of knowledge-hungry guests who will expect top info-tainment if they’re to leave impressed. This is all while you keep your Exhibits safe, rooms clean, staff happy… and children off the dinosaur bones.</p><p><strong>Exploring for Exhibits</strong></p><p>As Curator, the design and management of your expanding museum is in your hands! Send your team of partially trained Experts on Expeditions in search of rare and mostly well-preserved artefacts. When (and hopefully not if) your Experts return from their adventure, proudly display their fantastic finds in your museum.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You’ll unlock new locations as you decide where the next adventure takes you, and complete a sticker book to document your journey as a souvenir of your discoveries.</p><p>Your work doesn’t end there; Exhibit maintenance is crucial. While some Experts are gallivanting across Two Point County and beyond, you’re in charge of managing staff back home to ensure Exhibits and the museum stay in tip-top condition. If taking care of the carnivorous Chomper isn’t enough, there are also meddling thieves to watch out for. Thieves, and more frequently, children, are known for touching and grubbing up the displays, so make sure enough security is guarding your prized collection!</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_905791"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Design-osaurs</strong></p><p>Get creative to design your museum layout your way! You have decorative freedom, so design thematic areas to guide your guests’ visit. Splash paint and lay carpet as you lovingly arrange each prehistoric fern, potentially melting iceman, and dinosaur remains wherever you see fit.</p><p>Once you’ve created the perfect atmosphere, arrange guided tours with custom routes led by a charismatic Expert. Tours are a fantastic way to enrich your guests’ experience. To keep guests enthused, showcase Exhibits with the highest Buzz – those that are top quality, provide ample info and beautiful decorations are likely to attract the most donations!</p><p><strong>Guest-ertainment</strong></p><p>Guests know best! The different types of guests who will frequent your museum may have different interests, but they do have some things in common… they expect the place to be kept clean, have plenty of refreshments, ample toilets, and a gift shop filled with goodies. And, of course, they need to be dazzled with knowledge of your Exhibits, which are kept well-maintained… or else you could make them sick.</p><p>Two Point County will bring a variety of guests to your museum, and they all hope to discover their new favorite Exhibit… From dino fanatics and botany buffs to haunted horror seekers, you’ll need to cater to their personal preferences to meet their needs. By exceeding their expectations, you can keep them engaged, leading to longer visits, increased donations, and glowing reviews!</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

		<p>Developer Pixelatom&nbsp;and publisher&nbsp;Blowfish Studios have announced that Anarkade, a platform fighter, will be available from September 23rd on PC via Steam, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anarkade - Coming 23rd September | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rejUkOamlck?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Anarkade&nbsp;is a fun, fast-paced party game at heart,”</em> said Javier Arias, Founder and Lead Developer, Pixelatom. <em>“We’ve crafted a balanced experience, mixing action, shooting, and platforming with unpredictable scenarios that make for an dynamic, ever changing experience for shooters to play over and over again.”</em></p>
<p>Anarkade will feature six different stages with each of them having their own hazards and quirks. For example, in the Space stage the battle wills be fought in low gravity, while ice stages have slippery surfaces. The layouts will change as each is procedurally generated. There will be various weapons available to use in the fights too including a knife, Python revolver, the gatling gun, and the bowling bomb. At the start of each fight, players will be randomly assigned their weapons and will have to fight to grab crates to change weapons.&nbsp;Anarkade will feature both local and online multiplayer. Game modes will include single matches, or tournament matches that include Deathmatches and collecting loot in Cratebox.</p>

					<p>I didn't know what to expect when I first booted up the game. I went in without knowing it and didn't even look it up on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/721180/Dustborn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>. I installed Dustborn, developed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/dustborn-qa-red-threads-first-attempt-at-action-adventure/">Red Thread Games</a> and got stuck in. However, after some time playing the game, it felt familiar.</p>
<p>For a while, I couldn't place my finger on what felt so familiar about Dustborn until I realized that it reminded me of the Telltale games, specifically Tales from the Borderlands. The characters had the same kooky vibes as those of Tales from the Borderlands.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I also found it similar to a Telltale game was the art style. It carried the same comic book aesthetic, one of the biggest factors that drew me into Dustborn. While the art style was similar, Dustborn has a more authentic comic-book feel, which I loved as someone who avidly reads comic books.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/dustborn-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Off the bat, the game is incredibly accessible. While it did tell me to play with a controller, I decided to forgo the warning and use a mouse and keyboard. Even then, I found the game perfectly playable. My only issue was that I couldn't change the keybinds, which I do in every game for the optimal experience. For those who need subtitles, there was the option to stack the subtitles and have different colors for character subtitles, making it easier to digest the conversation.</p>
<p>If, like me, you sometimes miss crucial dialogue, accessing the menu shows you the full dialogue on the right-hand side, which I loved as a feature. Additionally, for those who struggle with QTEs (Quick-Time Events), there was the option for simplified QTEs.</p>
<p>The game opens with a scene introducing the four main characters in a car. In the driver's seat, there is Sai, with pigtails and vitiligo, who is freaking out about the cargo that they have picked up. Sai is very explosive, her moods changing with a drop of the hat. With how dramatic she is, she quickly became my least favorite. Then there are the two passengers in the back: A non-binary person named Noam with silver hair and a masculine Latino named Theo. Along the way, you are introduced to other important characters, like a sweet lady named Luna, who is working on getting you to Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>You play as the protagonist, Pax, a black woman with powers who can utilize them to manipulate language and saves her and her team a fair few times. She gets tired of their bickering and utilizes her powers to "block" them, stopping them from talking entirely until she releases them. Her ability to have powers makes her someone who is called Anomal. In addition, Noam's powers gaslight people and make them feel a certain way. Pax has a bullet wound, and Noam manages to gaslight her to make her feel okay again. Then there is Sai, whose powers turn her into stone. Which proves to be mildly problematic throughout the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ss_dc5d02bbec90aa90fcf5eebb3c2279ae067f6166-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Pax has been hired to deliver a very important package from Pacifica to Nova Scotia, a long and troublesome journey. In addition, you get to see every inner thought that Pax has; through this, you see her refer to herself as a "kid." It quickly becomes apparent that she isn't on about herself and is pregnant, which is a huge secret she is hiding from the others.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I wasn't confident in their abilities when I was first introduced to the ragtag team. While I swear like a soldier, I felt that the amount of swearing from Sai was unnecessary, making the opening cutscene long and tedious. The other characters were incredibly likable, with Noam quickly becoming my favorite. One of the main things that I found incredibly bizarre in the prologue of Dustborn was the rhythm mini-game. It felt incredibly out of place, and I wasn't sure if that was what I would expect from the rest of the game.</p>
<p>Once the prologue was over, I found the experience much more enjoyable. There was space to explore and connect with others and enemies to battle. However, during cutscenes where Pax was in charge of making decisions, I often found myself irritated by Sai's passive-aggressive rebuttals. They all comment on Sai being emotionally charged, which becomes evident quickly.</p>
<p>Dustborn is a politically charged game where you deliver "supplies" across the border. These include pamphlets, manifestos, and books banned from libraries in the American Republic, a fascist state that has outlawed all politics that oppose their views. During a specific scene where Pax is confronted with the "tree in the stillness," she hears politically charged whispers from the far-right, talking about how scientists lie to people and are putting things in the vaccines. From this scene alone, it became clear that Dustborn is a metaphor for everything happening in the real world, and I was here for it.</p>
<p>My one gripe with this game is how long it takes to get into the nitty-gritty. While the prologue is intense and dramatic from the outset, after that initial cutscene, it slows down. Many of the conversations are bonding sessions where Pax is trying to navigate her relationships with the other crew members.</p>
<p>Throughout the game, many words were either bolded or capitalized to provide emphasis. Even now, I am still confused about what some words mean or whether they are just alternative words used to describe things. For example, I see Anomal's powers described as "Words," "Vox," and then the other character-specific terms, such as "Block" and "Trigger," for Pax.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ss_99a0bcba5ecbf6bf151e4948229c245a6fdaecf6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Music is also important in the game, with mini rhythm games throughout. I found this quite bizarre and wasn't sure what this added. While your cover is part of a Punk Rock band, with all of you playing different instruments, it still felt peculiar and out of place.</p>
<p>The story and interactions were the most fun parts of the game. However, I didn't mesh with the combat system and found it a little lacking. While there was the opportunity for fun combos and using your powers to make the fight easier, it wasn't what I wanted from the combat system.</p>
<p>Overall, I did enjoy my time with Dustborn. It wasn't at all what I expected, but it was a lot of fun, even if I did have some minor gripes on the personality of a particular character.</p>
<p><em>Reviewed on PC (code provided by the publisher).</em></p>

					
					

<p>Overall, it was enjoyable to watch the relationships between the characters unfold. However, the prologue soured it early on for me, as it felt a bit too overexaggerated. The conversations and getting to explore new environments were&nbsp;some of the best parts of Dustborn, while I unfortunately found the combat system to be a little lacking in places. Still, the idea for this game is incredibly unique and one that I really enjoyed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-600m-revenue-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, Valve's immensely popular multiplayer shooter&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>has already made a staggering amount of money in 2024, and the year is nowhere near done yet.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/which-steam-games-won-the-first-half" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GameDiscoverCo's Simon Carless</a>,&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>racked up an astonishing $610 million in the first half of 2024. It's not hard to imagine the game breaking a billion dollars in revenue before the year is through.</p>
<p>It's a pretty big leap from&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike&nbsp;</em>to the next game on GameDiscoverCo's list,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/helldivers-2"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, which racked up "just" $458 million. An impressive number by any metric, but it probably could have been even higher if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">that whole PlayStation ID debacle</a> hadn't happened.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-revenue-report-shooting.jpg?itok=4FK7N0H8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-revenue-report-shooting.jpg?itok=G2HS7bMU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>is big business for Valve, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>It's another fairly big leap from&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/palworld"><em>Palworld</em></a>'s $378 million, which secures it a bronze medal, with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>&nbsp;</em>bringing up fourth and fifth with $276 million and $159 million, respectively.</p>
<p>The first single-player game (although it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/baldurs-gate-3-multiplayer-coop">does also support multiplayer</a>) on the list is&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, which raked in $127 million for the first half of 2024. That's not bad at all considering it was released last year.</p>
<p>Predictably enough,&nbsp;<em>Dota 2&nbsp;</em>is in seventh place with $119 million, although&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dragons-dogma-2"><em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em></a>'s eighth-place $108 million finish is something of a surprise, especially given that it's beaten&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, which sits in ninth with $100 million.</p>
<p>Finally, rounding out the top ten spot is&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, which made $91 million in the first half of the year. That's probably not going to serve as much of a balm to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">200-plus staff let go from developer Bungie</a> last month, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-steam-revenue.jpg?itok=LocflwwK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-steam-revenue.jpg?itok=KexQw2yc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>sits in tenth place on GameDiscoverCo's Steam revenue report for the first half of 2024.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're interested, here's a rundown of the rest of the top 20 list as reported by GameDiscoverCo and Simon Carless.</p>
<ul><li>11.&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>&nbsp;- $56 million</li>
<li>12.&nbsp;<em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>- $54 million</li>
<li>13.&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>- $49 million</li>
<li>14.&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>&nbsp;- $48 million</li>
<li>15.&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut&nbsp;</em>- $48 million</li>
<li>16.&nbsp;<em>Warframe&nbsp;</em>- $46 million</li>
<li>17.&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty HQ&nbsp;</em>- $41 million</li>
<li>18.&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>- $40 million</li>
<li>19.&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>- $40 million</li>
<li>20.&nbsp;<em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>- $36 million</li>
</ul><h2>Steam is also cracking down on link spam in store descriptions</h2>
<p>Elsewhere in Steam news, Valve has also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4201376568915048836" rel="noopener" target="_blank">detailed a new set of changes</a> coming to Steam store page descriptions in order to combat excessive link spam.</p>
<p>The changes essentially limit what it's possible to include in a Steam game's store page description; publishers will no longer be able to include links to other websites, for instance, nor will they be able to include "embedded imagery that mimics Steam store UI or buttons".</p>
<p>Also prohibited are "images, links, or widgets pointing to other games on Steam". Starting from early September, an update for Steam will be rolled out that will hide instances of URLs being included in games' descriptions or "other text section[s]".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-store-page-descriptions-forest-ranger-simulator.jpg?itok=NTy6kvgo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-store-page-descriptions-forest-ranger-simulator.jpg?itok=IznvoH7t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll soon be seeing less of this sort of thing.</figcaption></figure><p>Valve says it doesn't like "store pages linking prominently off to other store pages", and that the changes are also intended to nudge publishers towards using Steam's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-overhauls-steam-demos">new demo features</a> rather than releasing a separate "Prologue" for their games and linking to the main game from that prologue's store page.</p>
<p>You're unlikely to notice a huge amount of changes when this new Steam update drops, but it should at least make navigating Steam a bit easier. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Out December 13, <em>Kraven the Hunter</em>’s latest trailer also introduces us to the titular anti-hero’s gangster dad played by Russell Crowe. </p><p>Take a look:</p><p>As Johnny Cash sings in the background, we see Kraven doing all of his hunter things, from dodging bear traps and knifing guys in the leg to running on all fours like he just finished watching James McAvoy in <em>Glass</em>. The trailer also sets up Rhino as the big bad, described as an animal “stronger than you can imagine.” It ends with the two fighting out in a valley amid a stampede of water buffalo. </p><p> <em>Kraven’s Last Hunt</em> is considered to be one of the top comic book arcs in Marvel’s repertoire, but with no Spider-Man to pull on, Sony’s origin story for Kraven, who was also featured in last year’s PlayStation 5 hit S<em>pider-Man 2, </em>appears to be going more for an action movie revenge flick vibe in the vein of <em>John Wick</em> or <em>The Equalizer</em>. Whether it can actually succeed on its own merits is the big question. The first <em>Venom </em>aside, Sony’s recent Spider-Man B-sides track record has been full of major misses like <em>Morbius </em>and <em>Madame Web</em>. </p><p>One thing Sony clearly does want audiences to know is that <em>Kraven the Hunter</em> won’t be shying away from brutal violence. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-box-office-flop-bomb-2024-gearbox-1851619588&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-box-office-flop-bomb-2024-gearbox-1851619588">Given <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>’s recent $1 billion box office blowout</a></span>, shattering records for R-rated movies, it’s a strategy that makes sense. At the same time, it’s going to take a lot more than a few decapitations to purge Sony’s current comic book movie malaise. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>An ambitious-sounding Call of Duty mod is coming this week, ushering in what its developers describe as a recreation of the original Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer experience "with new twists." Some fans, however, are concerned that <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-fans-fear-h2m-mod-will-get-shut-down-as-sales-skyrocket-2860448/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision will step in and shut the whole thing down</a> like it did with the <a href="https://x.com/sm2game/status/1658745182819598337" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fan-made Call of Duty SM2 mod in 2023.</a></p><p>The mod is for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered, and it includes numerous maps (50+ in total), an updated progression system, more camos, and custom attachments. The killstreaks you remember from Modern Warfare 2 are in the mod, too.</p><p>There is a lot of excitement and hype around this mod, in part because 2020's Modern Warfare II Remastered was campaign-only and did not include any multiplayer support. At the time, Activision's explanation for why it didn't release a multiplayer experience <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-cod-modern-warfare-2-remastered-lacks-multipla/1100-6475496/" data-ref-id="1100-6475496">left a lot of people shaking their heads and trying to understand.</a> And now, Call of Duty fans are taking matters into their own hands and doing it themselves.</p><p>The H2M mod, as it's called, requires a copy of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered, which was originally released in 2017. The mod launcher will arrive on August 16.</p><p>To install H2M-Mod, you will need to own Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered. Presumably due to the great anticipation for the mod's release, Modern Warfare Remastered has surged up the sales charts and currently sits at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers&amp;os=win" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 3 overall on Steam's top-sellers chart.</a> Black Ops 6, the next entry in the series that's due out this October, is No. 15, for comparison.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwBEmMPxuRU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VwBEmMPxuRU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The H2M mod includes all the Modern Warfare Remastered maps, as well as original MW2 maps that the community creators brought forward. Additionally, some of the campaign play spaces from the MW2 Campaign Remastered release are playable in the mod as custom maps.</p><p>As for progression, the modders said there will be 70 ranks to make your way through and 10 prestige levels. After prestige 10, players can work their way up to level 1000.</p><p>In other Call of Duty news, Activision will reveal what's next for Black Ops 6 during the Call of Duty Next event on August 28. Shortly after that, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">Black Ops 6 beta begins on August 30.</a></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzwdhdoaPI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Player First Games revealed new MultiVersus gameplay featuring Beetlejuice and confirmed they will join the roster on August 20, 2024.</p>



<p>The trailer showcases some of Beetlejuice’s kit as an Assassin class fighter, an archetype that only offers a few other characters like Arya Stark and Marvin the Martian. It also reveals new voice lines, interactions, and potential cosmetics. </p>



<p>The new trailer closes with a brief nod to Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, the upcoming movie sequel. Director Tim Burton returns for the film, which premieres in early September this year.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Today’s announcement for August follows just a month after leaker AusilMV claimed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-leak-teases-beetlejuice-is-possibly-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MultiVersus could add Beetlejuice</a> sometime soon. </p>



<p>That lends more validity to AusilMV’s previous leaks from May 2024, which teased even more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-leaks-tease-possible-new-characters-stages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential characters and stages</a>. They claimed they found these additions by datamining the game.</p>



<p>Beetlejuice’s moveset features a variety of thematic abilities, like falling into a coffin or transforming hands into a weapon. Most notably, that also includes the addition of the sandworm, iconic enough to be worked into the popcorn bucket merch for the upcoming film.</p>



<p>Late last July, Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially acquired</a> MultiVersus developer Player First Games. The developer’s co-founder Tony Huynh said that “having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/whats-new-in-escape-from-tarkov-patch-0-15/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This past wipe was currently the longest in the history of Escape From Tarkov. As such, most of us long-time players find ourselves rather anxious to jump into a brand-new wipe with new content to explore, new mechanics, weapons, and more. It’s a long time coming, but here’s everything new in Escape From Tarkov patch 0.15!</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-new-in-patch-0-15-of-escape-from-tarkov">Everything New in Patch 0.15 of Escape From Tarkov</h2>



<p>To announce patch 0.15 of Escape From Tarkov, Battlestate Games published a brand-new trailer showcasing the game’s new boss enemy, Partisan, a few of the all-new weapons we get to play around with, the reworked Factory map, and so much more!</p>



<figure><p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reworked Factory</strong></li>



<li><strong>New Guns</strong>
<ul>
<li>9mm UZI SMG</li>



<li>Desert Eagle</li>



<li>M60</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>New Boss – Partisan</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tripwires</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>As soon as Battlestate Games releases the official patch notes, which will include far more additions to the game than what we saw in the trailer, we’ll update this piece so you’re in the know!</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-tarkov-wipe-august-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Next Tarkov Wipe Arrives August 20, Battlestate Reveals</a></p>



<h2 id="h-does-patch-0-15-come-with-a-wipe">Does Patch 0.15 Come With a Wipe?</h2>



<p>It does, actually! The upcoming patch 0.15 for Escape From Tarkov is a massive addition to the game, with so much new content and mechanics that it warrants a wipe. Thankfully, for those who have eagerly awaited the next wipe, it’s coming on August 20. It will, of course, coincide with the release of the new patch.</p>



<p>The last wipe in Escape From Tarkov occurred in December! It has been approximately 230 days since the last one, and I don’t know about you, but my stash is overflowing. I don’t even have gear fear; it’s just an accumulation from many months of play.</p>



<hr>



<p>While Escape From Tarkov slept, upcoming extraction shooters such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-early-access-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arena Breakout: Infinite launched into Early Access</a>. Do you think Tarkov should be worried about the competition?</p>

            <p>We now have a release date for the upcoming, current-gen version of Supermassive Games' slasher horror Until Dawn.</p>
<p>The game will arrive on both PC and PlayStation 5 this autumn, on 4th October. What better way to get yourself ready for the run up to halloween than doing your utmost to save that poor group of unsuspecting teens from the horrors of the night.</p>
<p>In addition to announcing a release date, the Until Dawn team has also <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/14/until-dawn-rebuilt-and-enhanced-for-ps5-and-pc-launches-october-4/?sf274260483=1">shared a few details</a> about how it has enhanced the game with changes to graphics, gameplay, story elements and "more". Before I get into all that, though, you can check out a new trailer for Until Dawn showing off some comparisons between the remaster and original below.</p>

<p>Right, time for those aforementioned enhancements.</p>
<p>First off, and as you will have seen in the trailer, the team has overhauled the Until Dawn's visuals, with the game being "built from the ground up" using Unreal Engine 5. This means that the character models, environments, props players can interact with and so on have all been updated. The game has also been "completely relit" and includes raytracing, which has allowed the developer to focus on "a more atmospheric and 'modern horror' experience".</p>
<p>Until Dawn will also have a new camera control mechanic on its release, which will allow players to "see the world... from entirely new perspectives".</p>
<p>"Blending the cinematography of the original with the introduction of a modern third-person camera, we hope to bring new life to characters and locations. The camera's flexibility allows us to place new emphasis on important moments and tell the story from a view closer to the characters," the Until Dawn team said.</p>
<p>From a narrative point of view, this version of Until Dawn's story will feature a reworked prologue. While the original narrative is "intact", adjustments have been made to the prologue to help with some pacing. This includes more screen time with the Washington family, but I won't say any more to avoid potential spoilers. The developer hopes the adjustments here will increase the emotional impact of the prologue.</p>
<p>In addition to nicer visuals and the like, Until Dawn's rerelease will also provide players with new collectables to scoop up and the implementation of new accessibility and usability settings.</p>
<p>If you didn't play Until Dawn on its original PS4 release, I would recommend giving it a bash. Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-review">Until Dawn review</a> from 2015 called the game "weird, gory and surprisingly moving".</p>
<p>You can pre-order Until Dawn from 21st August. And yes, a PSN account is required on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/obsidian-ceo-would-love-to-make-a-shadowrun-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Obsidian Entertainment CEO Feargus Urquhart was just featured in an hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADkKzjY6j7Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with YouTube channel Limit Break Network. When asked which Xbox IP he'd like to tackle if given the chance, Urquhart singled out Shadowrun.</p>
<p><em>I love Shadowrun. I think it's super cool. Within, like, two months of Obsidian getting acquired I asked for the list. It's just a spreadsheet. I think I got the latest version and I looked through all the stuff. I mean, there's a lot of stuff on there. It's been a while since I looked at it, but it's a pretty incredible thing, and now you add in Activision and all the stuff that they have... But yeah, if you had to pin me down on one, yes, it would be Shadowrun. I bought the book of the first edition when it first came out. I probably own four of the six editions. I think it's a super cool IP.</em></p>
<p>Personally, I agree with the Obsidian CEO. Shadowrun has a lot of potential to flourish and even go mainstream with the right project and budget. I <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-harebrained-schemes-should-be-microsofts-next-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocated</a> for Microsoft to purchase Harebrained Schemes, which made the latest Shadowrun games, but it looks like they're <a href="https://wccftech.com/graft-is-harebraineds-new-game-slated-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">busy</a> with something else. Obsidian could be an amazing fit.</p>
<p>Of course, this question followed the more obvious one: would the studio head like to make Fallout New Vegas 2? Urquhart again said yes without giving away anything else.</p>
<p><em>Fallout is very dear to me. I put an incredible amount of my own time into Fallout. I wrote dialogues, I designed maps, and I was a lead designer. That was back at Black Isle. For Obsidian, it was an incredibly important game, not just from the standpoint of how much people love it, but it got us to make a big open-world game, and we learned a lot from it, and so I think it's important to us.&nbsp;Fallout's just fun. I mean, that's why the series also worked well. It's so silly. For me, I would love to make another Fallout game. I always say that, I never back away from it. We'll see. That's the best thing I can say, but if that opportunity comes out, I'd love to do it.</em></p>
<p>There's been a lot of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-talks-reportedly-happening-at-microsoft-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculation</a> on Fallout New Vegas 2, and it was rekindled after the show's success and the second season tease of New Vegas. On the other hand, Bethesda seems staunchly against lending their franchise to someone else, so Shadowrun may really be the best option for Obsidian.</p>
<p>Of course, the studio is already busy with its own franchises, such as The Outer Worlds and Pillars of Eternity, which is about to get the action RPG spin-off Avowed. On that note, the Obsidian CEO talked about some changes made to the beginning of the game (now <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-officially-delayed-to-february-18-2025-new-live-stream-set-for-august-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to February 18, 2025).</p>
<p><em>We made a specific decision about a year ago. Where the game started a year ago is not where it starts. It now basically starts with a prologue. Where we're putting character creation within that and how much we were asking the player to actually do within character creation has been a lot of that. With the prologue, we basically said hey, we need to create a much more directed experience for people to get a taste for a lot of the stuff. Not all the depth that they will be able to do with a character, but give them enough of a taste so they can understand what this game is. It also helped the game introduce players to a taste of what's going on with the conflict and a taste of this part of the world of Eora. In this case, we did make changes specifically because we wanted people to get in quicker and not just hit a wall of too much exposition.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/visions-of-mana-preview-cute-relaxing-and-fun<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stepping into the 18th <em>Mana </em>game as a newcomer to the series was daunting, but I was enchanted by the characters, combat, and semi-open-world traveling of <em>Visions of Mana</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, I was able to preview <em>Visions of Mana</em>. The game is focused on Val, a Soul Guard, and several Alms, who are chosen adventurers dedicated to sacrificing themselves to preserve the flow of mana in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This simple story setup lets the rest of the game shine. The preview of <em>Visions of Mana</em> only saw a bit of story, mostly creating the backdrop for the characters as a group and a introducing a bit about the politics of the world.</p>
<h2>The Colorful Cast of <em>Visions of Mana</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-morley-and-the-moon.jpg?itok=q_al3RJk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-morley-and-the-moon.jpg?itok=NYwQfs9e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The characters and the world in&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>are stunning.​​​</figcaption></figure><p>The characters are quirky in the best ways possible, and the range of personalities in the five-person group I experienced was delightful. From mellow, happy Hinna to sassy, spirited Careena to somber, serious Morley, the party was well-rounded and kept things interesting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The original characters, Val and Hinna, are cute and happy-go-lucky at the start. However, the stage set during the preview makes it look like they’ll get heavy character development. Some of the other characters grew a bit during the early hours of gameplay, which makes investing in them emotionally a breeze.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, most of the crew sounded as good as their characters were written. Cutscenes are much more enjoyable when the characters sound good, and for the most part, they did.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Visions of Mana</em>&nbsp;Has Charming Combat</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kraken-fight-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=iGJAHSA8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kraken-fight-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=avi2wFaR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enemies were as well-designed as the characters in&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The combat in <em>Visions of Mana</em>&nbsp;is well done. It’s not offering fast-paced ARPG fighting but instead takes things a bit slower. Characters move pretty slowly, which felt sluggish at first. However, after the first few fights, it was clear that the slower-paced combat helped focus on playing smarter instead of spamming buttons.</p>
<p>I started with the easiest difficulty option: beginner. However, combat still wasn’t a breeze even at this level. It was challenging even here, which just shows how challenging the game is meant to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combat is also pretty varied. Each character can change classes with elemental objects. This was fun to mess around with – building teams that played well together while using elemental objects was a challenge since each object could only be with one person at a time.</p>
<p>And, of course, the outfit changes show off just how great the character’s designs in general are.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Frolicking in Fields in <em>Visions of Mana</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-giant-wolf.jpg?itok=GVDunKt2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-giant-wolf.jpg?itok=DNmwax9j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players can ride this adorable wolf, Pikul, after meeting Morley, and it's one of the cutest parts of&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most surprising parts of <em>Visions of Mana</em> was the open-world areas. The game isn’t open world, though some areas are large enough to have multiple fast travel points.</p>
<p>Traveling through these areas was both satisfying and rewarding. There’s a lot to collect, including money. Considering the prices of items in-game, the currency alone makes exploring worth it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The movement and banter between characters are part of what makes exploring so fun. Jumping and running is so smooth that it felt like I was constantly racing myself. Plus, a lot of rewards can be obtained just by running over them, adding to this feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The banter between characters is entertaining and kept me laughing while I did this. Combined with great sound design, exploring may have been my favorite part of the preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-release-date"><em>Visions of Mana</em></a> has a lot to love, and while parts of it might take some getting used to, it’s worth it. It’s set to release on August 29, 2024, on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/until-dawn-remake-release-date-set-for-the-spookiest-month-of-the-year.952737/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Ballistic Moon have announced the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake release date, and I'll give you three guesses as to which month this spooky horror adventure is launching in.</p>
<p>That's right: the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake's official release date is October 4th. Halloween falls on a Thursday this year, so I suppose launching on that date wouldn't have been an option, but hey - at least the month is right!</p>
<p>Unlike the original&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, which was a PlayStation exclusive, this reimagined version will launch on both PS5 and PC simultaneously, so you'll have your pick of which platform you want to play it on (unless you want to play it on Xbox or Switch, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-remake-release-date-mountain.jpg?itok=3c1FDmXw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-remake-release-date-mountain.jpg?itok=QQE1wk1Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake officially arrives in October.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with announcing the release date, Sony and Ballistic Moon have also released a comparison trailer that shows off some of the changes the two studios have made since the original 2015&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>was released.</p>
<p>These changes include alterations to some of the game's plot points, as well as a visual overhaul that should make the game look as pretty as you'd expect it to in 2024.</p>
<p>Handily, the trailer includes side-by-side shots to show you exactly what's different, so if you have played the original&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, you should get a kick out of seeing what Ballistic Moon has done with the place, so to speak.</p>
<p>You can check out the new&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>comparison trailer right here.</p>

<p><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>is an enhanced remake of the 2015 narrative horror adventure. If you want a rough idea of what Sony and Ballistic Moon are going for with the remake, think&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part I&nbsp;</em>(although hopefully without the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-accknowledges-last-of-us-part-i-issues-on-pc-promises-updates-coming-next">well-documented PC issues</a>).</p>
<p>Although many changes have been made, including visual and narrative differences that you'll definitely notice if you've played the original,&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>still has the same basic premise as its predecessor, so you can enjoy this one whether or not you've experienced the 2015 game.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that original&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>developer Supermassive Games isn't involved with this remake, although you can still get your horror kicks from that studio thanks to upcoming games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-casting-of-frank-stone-release-date">The Casting of Frank Stone</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed"><em>Little Nightmares 3</em></a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/until-dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on October 4th.

            <title><![CDATA[Next Tarkov Wipe Arrives August 20, Battlestate Reveals]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/next-tarkov-wipe-august-20/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-tarkov-wipe-arrives-august-20-battlestate-reveals.952731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/next-tarkov-wipe-august-20/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has finally been revealed (after more than 230 days) that the next Escape from Tarkov wipe will land on August 20. It’ll go hand-in-hand with the typical Twitch Drops campaign that’ll reward users for watching top Tarkov streamers broadcast gameplay on the purple platform, Battlestate Games has announced.</p>



<p>This marks the end of the longest wipe in Tarkov history and it ushers in the 0.15 patch that’s set to change <strong>plenty </strong>about the most popular extraction shooter game in the world.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-to-escape">Prepare To Escape</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games has just posted a trailer online for the 0.15 patch that accompanies the first wipe since December 2023:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape from Tarkov Beta - 0.15 Patch trailer (feat. Partisan)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Jlyhs7yOLY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In this trailer, we get our first full-fledged look at the Factory expansion, which seems as though it’s blowing the map wide open. As one of the oldest Tarkov maps, Factory has been the place to go for short, aggressive matches for several years, and this change marks the first time it has been expanded by Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>The trailer for the next Tarkov wipe also reveals new weapons, including the 9mm Uzi SMG and the sought-after Desert Eagle. In one scene, BSG’s capture artists are scene blasting down Killa with the .50 handgun.</p>



<p>Right now, pre-wipe events are unfolding like wildfire in the game, with Battlestate Games tweaking various elements of the game in the final few days of this ‘season’. Before long, everything in the game will be reduced in price to just a few roubles, and players will have the entire game unlocked as they make the most of what’s left of this patch.</p>



<p>Next Tuesday, Escape from Tarkov will wipe, and hundreds of thousands of people will return to the game – then the cycle begins all over again.</p>



<p>Are you planning on playing Tarkov once the 0.15 patch has been deployed?</p>

<p>In a new PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/14/until-dawn-rebuilt-and-enhanced-for-ps5-and-pc-launches-october-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, developer Ballistic Moon announced that the anticipated rebuilt version of Until Dawn will launch on October 4, 2024. </p>



<p>Creative director Neil McEwan explained that “our intention has not been to alter the events.” However, they added that the enhanced version will rework the prologue to adjust its pacing.</p>



<p>McEwan also broke down the new build, which adds “updated character models, environments, interactable props, visual effects, and animations.” These improvements will be available in both the PC and PlayStation 5 versions. </p>



<p>Ballistic Moon also offered a new comparison trailer, including a few side-by-side glimpses of cinematics and gameplay.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Today’s blog mentioned that the rebuilt Until Dawn will also feature new collectibles, accessibility and usability settings, and the Stay Calm mechanic. Stay Calm is an alternative “for third party peripherals that do not feature a gyroscope or for players who prefer a different challenge.”</p>



<p>The new version just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-for-pc-playstation-5-gets-esrb-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got an ESRB rating</a> a couple of weeks ago. Fans can pre-order the “rebuilt and enhanced” version of Until Dawn starting August 21, 2024, ahead of the October release.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Until Dawn fans can also look forward to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action movie adaptation</a> from Screen Gems and PlayStation Productions. The cast of the film <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-cast-grows-peter-stormare-possibly-reprising-dr-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently expanded</a>, including the return of Peter Stormare, who played Dr. Hill in Supermassive Games’ original Until Dawn.</p>
