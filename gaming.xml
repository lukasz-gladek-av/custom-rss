Announced for Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S VR headsets, this new game will see players control the merc with a mouth--voiced by actor Neil Patrick Harris--as he takes on classic villains like X-Men villains like Mojo and Lady Deathstrike.</p><p>Developer Twisted Pixel, known for a few other funny games, like 'Splosion Man, announced the game with a trailer that captures a lot of Deadpool's ridiculous banter, as well as a bunch of the flippy-shooty mayhem you'll get up to in the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/4Jof1MtYccs?si=p2Jj-77huVQLPq-U" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Watch it right here</a>.</p><p>The game features an all-new, original Deadpool story that finds the quippy hero sucked through a portal to Mojoworld, where he's tasked with traveling across the Marvel universe to take on a bunch of villains. Gameplay combines shooting, stabbing, and parkour, and also looks to let you to leverage Deadpool's regenerative superpowers so you can get blown up and dismembered yourself, if that's what it takes to get the job done.</p><p>Marvel's Deadpool is set to launch later this year.</p><p>This isn't the first time that a VR game based on an iconic comic book character has been announced for Quest headsets, as last year saw the release of the highly acclaimed Batman: Arkham Shadow. The game earned positive reviews for translating the core Arkham experience into VR, as players were able to engage in detective work, stalk enemies, and brawl with them.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-upcoming-superhero-game-to-look-out-for-in-2024-and-beyond/2900-5051/">several other Marvel games are in development right now</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion/">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> looks like an old-school tribute to '90s beat-'em-ups, and the June State of Play livestream ended with a bang as Guilty Gear developer Arc System Works announced it was developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-marvel-fighting-game-is-coming-from-arc-system-works/1100-6532114/">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>.</p><p>The 4v4 fighting game features fresh redesigns of classic characters like Captain America and Iron Man, and it's scheduled to be out in 2026.

After escaping from a decade in captivity and the horrific experiments performed on him by the Baron, Crane makes his way to the once-bustling tourist destination in search of vengeance and finds it overrun with zombies.</p><p>Like previous games, the infected people stalking the streets during the day will be the least of your worries, because once the sun sets, the worst of the zombie horde comes out to play. Fortunately, Crane has parkour skills and an off-road vehicle to help him outrun enemies, and when push comes to shove, the zombie DNA in his blood gives him an edge in combat.</p><p>Techland's new trailer showed off Crane's savage side, as he can now tap into his rage-fueled powers to smash through zombies. If brute force isn't enough, Crane can also make use of various melee weapons and firearms to even the odds. Priced at $60 for the standard edition, preorders will unlock the Hero of Harran Bundle. This includes the following DLC:</p><ul><li>Ultimate Survivor Outfit</li><li>Harran Combat Knife</li><li>The Follower Crossbow</li><li>In Jade’s Memory Pistol</li><li>Castor Woods Patrol</li></ul><p>Dying Light: The Beast is just one of several big reveals from Summer Game Fest 2025, and for more, you can check out our feature on all the announcements from the annual gaming showcase.</p>

Jurassic World Evolution 3 is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 21, 2025, and like the games that came before it, players will manage dinosaur species and the park experience for guests.</p><p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 has more than 80 dinosaur species, and players will be able to breed and nurture them "across entire generations." That's right: We're getting baby dinos.</p><p>"Rear them from playful juveniles into awe-inspiring adults, each with distinct female, male, and juvenile variants," the developer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cmEUXCTn8Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6cmEUXCTn8Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In terms of the park-building elements, players can use new terrain-editing tools. In short, Frontier says players can "build and tweak every aspect" of the park to their liking. The game also supports the Frontier Workshop, allowing players to upload and share their creations.</p><p>Dr. Ian Malcolm from the Jurassic Park movie series appears in the game, and he's voiced by actor Jeff Goldblum. He also does the narration in the announcement trailer above.</p><p>The Jurassic World Evolution 3 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958130/Jurassic_World_Evolution_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> confirms that the game uses generative AI.

                <p>The studio behind Lego Builder's Journey debuted its next game at Summer Game Fest, and it's an adorable co-op adventure starring--you guessed it--a pair of little Lego bricks. The brief trailer showed a blooming friendship between blue and orange 1x1 bricks as they worked together to solve puzzling challenges.</p><p>The game is built around two-player co-op--locally, or you can invite your friends to play for free with a Friend's Pass. Like Builder's Journey, the narrative is delivered without words. The world looks entirely built out of bricks, so you can snap and join your way through obstacles together.</p><p>The art style looks very similar to Builder's Journey, with a similar isometric perspective through some segments. But the two also find themselves floating down-river, navigating highways and trains, and joining themselves with other bricks to carry them. They seem to be making their way towards a rocket through most of the trailer, which ends with them watching it take off.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYggKzKdg08" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bYggKzKdg08" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to the announcement, the story centers around friendship, the value of being connected, and "letting your imagination run wild when looking up at the sky." No release window was given.</p>

Fans will be able to play as Rocket Raccoon and She-Hulk, easily switching between the two as they shoot and smash their way through hordes of enemies. At least, that's the way it looks via a new trailer showcased during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-cosmic-invasions-she-hulk-and-rocket-raccoon-revealed-at-summer-game-fest/1100-6532207/" data-ref-id="1100-6532207">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> show.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn7FWkzOyq4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xn7FWkzOyq4?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Joining the cast of 15 Marvel characters--alongside the likes of Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, and Storm--She-Hulk and Raccoon will offer their own brand of beatdown when facing Annihilus' forces. And considering Dotemu's work on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/streets-of-rage-4/" data-ref-id="5000-486300">Streets of Rage </a>4, one can only image the creative combos players will be able to come up with when playing as these heroes.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, we didn't get a release date for Marvel Cosmic Invasion. We know that some of Marvel's best are going to wage war with Annihilus as he pulls strings from the Negative Zone. We just don't know when it's all going down. That said, it's apparent that when the "annihilation wave" hits the fan, players will have enough firepower (and in She-Hulk's case, muscle) to win when the game is released on Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC later this year.</p>

            <p>The team that bought us all <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-builders-journey">Lego Builder's Journey</a> is back with some more bricky goodness, this time in the form of Lego Voyagers.</p>
<p>Announced at this evening's Summer Game Fest opening night, Lego Voyagers is a two-player co-op adventure all about "bricks, friendship and play", which sounds very wholesome. "When two friends make it their mission to rescue an abandoned spaceship, they embark on a journey beyond their wildest dreams, ultimately learning the value of being connected," reads the official blurb.</p>
<p>In this game, players will be able to actually experience "what it feels like to a Lego brick". No, it doesn't mean you will find out what it feels like when I accidentally step on you in the middle of the night and then try to hold in expletives while I check on my son. Rather, it means you will be able to find out what it means to "tumble, jump, snap together, and build your way through rich brick worlds". You can check out the trailer below.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> Overture, a DLC expansion for the original game, has just been shadow dropped during Summer Game Fest. This surprise came following a new gameplay trailer that shows off a variety of new bosses and areas to explore and get beaten up in.</p>
<p>Overture, a DLC expansion to the game, offers a lot of new content to tackle as you'd expect, but it also comes with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-receive-difficulty-options-in-free-update-alongside-overture-dlc">three difficulty options</a>.

            <p>
If there's still some lingering enthusiasm for HBO's Game of Thrones in your bones, you're in luck. The original TV show is getting yet another video game adaptation, this time in the form of Game of Thrones: War for Westeros, a real-time strategy game that's out next year.
</p>
<p>
Annouced during this year's Summer Game Fest showcase, Game of Thrones: War for Westeros is the work of developer PlaySide and promises "ruthless free-for-all battles where trust is fleeting and power is everything".
</p>
<p>
"Command the Great Houses in epic real-time strategy battles," explains its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2838950/Game_of_Thrones_War_For_Westeros/">newly revealed Steam page</a>, "forge strategic alliances, or weave deceit against your rivals." And that begins by picking your preferred faction, whether it be House Stark, House Lannister, House Targaryen, or even the Night King's army of the dead. Each promises asymmetric strategies, alongside their own signature units and mechanics, that'll need to be deployed wisely as War for Westeros' real-time battles play out across a range of iconic locations.

"Deploy infantry, cavalry, siege engines, giants, and dragons to break enemy lines," PlaySide continues. "Outplay your rivals with smart manoeuvring, inspiring hero abilities, and the ruthless instinct of a true war commander."
</p>
<p>
Solo and multiplayer modes are also promised, and you can expect more details ahead of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2838950/Game_of_Thrones_War_For_Westeros/">Game of Thrones: War for Westeros' launch on Steam</a> sometime next year.

		<p>Techland has confirmed the release date for Dying Light: The Beast. This standalone expansion-sequel to their parkour-laden zombie series will launch on 22nd August 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast - Gameplay Premiere Trailer | Summer Game Fest 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0GCr2P9510?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Kyle Crane is back, and he’s frickin’ angry, so he’s going to channel that against the undead and everyone that stands in his way.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/dying-light-the-beast-preview-the-long-awaited-return-of-kyle-crane/">previewed The Beast back at Gamescom</a> last year, Dom saying “As we approach the tenth anniversary of the franchise, it seems fitting to be returning to the world of Dying Light. Perhaps most surprising is that The Beast is going to be available at no extra cost for owners of Dying Light 2: Ultimate Edition, fulfilling the promise of a second DLC expansion for that game. Going so far beyond the minimum bar feels indicative of Techland’s approach to their premiere series, and to its fans. Thus far, The Beast looks stunning, with visceral and spectacular action tied to the franchise’s most impressive visuals yet. We can’t wait to see more.”</p>

		<p>During Summer Games Fest, it was announced that Lies of P’s recently revealed Overture DLC had a release date. And that release date is today. That’s right, you can get the new Lies of P content right now. You can check out the new launch trailer which was shown at Summer Games Fest below.</p>

<p>The description for Lies of P Overture says, “They were waiting in the dark. Now they rise. Face fierce new bosses and carve your path through the shadows of Krat’s history. Lies of P: Overture is a brutal new expansion to the acclaimed Soulslike/Action RPG.”</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/13/lies-of-p-review/">Lies of P Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Lies of P review, Reuben said, <em>“Smooth combat, seamless exploration and a set of well-executed mechanics makes Lies of P an excellent Soulslike. When you add in the gorgeous visuals, desolate world design, stark sound design and engrossing story, it raises the experience above a lot of its contemporaries. All in all, although Lies of P is essentially Bloodborne featuring Timothée Chalamet, it does more than enough to mark itself out as a unique title worth your time – and I’m not lying.”</em></p>

		<p>Get a first look at the Torrisi Family business in this new story trailer for Mafia: The Old Country.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - “Loyalty is Everything” Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2XLJZHw6rm4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Mafia: The Old Country is a focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar&nbsp;<em>Mafia</em>&nbsp;gameplay,” said Hangar 13 President Nick Baynes. “That focus allows us to deliver a story that’s gritty, grounded, brutal and emotional. Embracing early 1900s era Sicily, this is a mafia origin story that follows our protagonist, Enzo Favara, as he takes the oath and works his way up Don Torrisi’s crime family.”</p>
<p>Unlike previous Mafia games that were set in the US, Mafia: The Old Country takes us to the very beginning of the Mafia and its base in Sicily. Enzo Favara is a brand new protagonist in the series and with the time setting, we will not see any of the characters from previous titles as most of them haven’t been born yet. In addition to the gameplay trailer, Hanger 13 has also released some developer insights that you can watch too. This video focuses on how the studio created the setting for the story of Mafia: The Old Country.</p>
<p>Two editions for Mafia: The Old Country have been revealed too, and both are available to pre-order.&nbsp; These editions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Standard Edition</strong> includes the full base game and will be available for £44.99 on&nbsp; PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Deluxe Edition</strong> lets players descend into Sicily’s criminal underworld in true Cosa Nostra style with a variety of bonus items and will be available for £54.99 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam. This edition includes the Padrino Pack, featuring “Lupara Speciale” Shotgun, “Vendetti Speciale” Pistol, “Immortale” Charm, “Padrino” Outfit, “Stiletto Speciale” Knife, “Eckhart Speciale” Limousine and “Cosimo” Horse and Accessories. Additionally, it offers the Gatto Nero Pack with the “Bodeo Nero” Pistol, “Velocità” Charm, “Gatto Nero” Racing Outfit and “Carozella Nero” Race Car, plus digital bonus materials including the Original Score and Digital Artbook full of concept art and developer notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those who pre-order will also get a bonus of the Soldato Pack featuring the “Soldato” Outfit, “Scannaturi Speciale” Knife, “Tesoro” Horse and Accessories and “Lupara” Charm.</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country will launch on August 8th for PS5, PC, Xbox Series XS, and NVIDIA’s GeForce Now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-october-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Embark Studios announced during the Summer Game Fest 2025 showcase that its new PvPvE third-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-shows-off-new-trailer-ahead-of-arc-raiders-playtest-this-week/">ARC Raiders</a> will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on <strong>October 30, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The fact that Embark Studios previous release, The Finals, was shadow-dropped during one of Geoff Keighley's other big annual showcases had players hoping that Arc Raiders would also be shadow-dropped today. Unfortunately for those hopefuls, that was not the case, and we'll still have to wait a few more months to jump into Arc Raiders.</p>
<p>Unless of course, you were able to get into the tech test last month, which went incredibly well, according to Embark. "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">The tech test was the best rehearsal we could get, ahead of what's shaping up as a big release this fall. It’s clear that players recognize the passion, effort, and craftsmanship that’s been poured into the making of&nbsp;</span>ARC Raiders,</em>" said executive producer on Arc Raiders, <span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Aleksander Grøndal, in a press release.</span></p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">The test also honed in on concrete things we’re addressing in this last stretch of</span></em> <em>development</em>," he continued.</p>
<p><em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"There are bugs to squash, as well as general polish and performance improvements to be done. We're also fine-tuning game balance and the player economy, and will work on an even better onboarding experience for players who come in new to this genre. At release, the game will be further expanded, with more locations to explore, more adventures to embark on, and more for players to strive towards and discover.</span></em>"</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo got the chance to join the tech test for ARC Raiders</a>, and though it's nearly impossible to determine the fate of any new multiplayer game nowadays, even from a team like Embark that has already broken through with a new game in The Finals, he found that ARC Raiders is at least promising.</p>
<p>"<em>So far, ARC Raiders shows promise. It's too early to tell whether it'll be the next big extraction shooter or just a passing trend, but Embark seems to have mixed in enough familiar and new elements to create an exciting recipe.</em>"</p>

			<p>Today at Summer Game Fest 2025, Playside Studios unveiled Game of Thrones: War for Westeros. This is a premium PC real time strategy game set in George R.R. Martin's beloved fantasy setting, and it's something that fans have been waiting a long time for.</p>
<p>Ryan McMahon, Game Director at PlaySide Studios, stated:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Game of Thrones: War for Westeros takes fans back to the Seven Kingdoms. This time, you’re not watching the ‘Game of Thrones’ - you’re playing it. War for Westeros puts you in the seat of power, whether you’re leading the Starks, Targaryens, or Lannisters, or even commanding the Night King and his army of the dead, you’ll wield real power and rewrite the fate of the realm.</em></p>

<p>In Game of Thrones: War for Westeros, players lead the armies of House Stark, House Lannister, House Targaryen, or even the dreadful Night King. They'll engage in epic real-time strategy battles where forming strategic alliances and deceiving rival forces will be key. Each faction offers deeply asymmetric strategies, signature heroes, armies, and mechanics forged from the brutal legacy of Westeros. Players can deploy infantry, cavalry, siege engines, giants, and dragons to break enemy lines, working to outplay and outmaneuver rivals with the help of inspiring hero abilities and the ruthless instincts of a true war commander.</p>
<p>From the Wall to King's Landing, players can jump into skirmish matches or embark on a longer war across the Seven Kingdoms, either alone or with others. Every decision matters, and every battle carries forward. Whether playing alone or with friends, Game of Thrones: War for Westeros aims to give fans the chance to reimagine the most iconic battles and turning points from the series, manipulating the realm's politics to rally powerful bannermen, sway loyalties, and outmanoeuver enemies in a shifting struggle for power.</p>
<p>The game will be released in 2026. Meanwhile, wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2838950/Game_of_Thrones_War_For_Westeros/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p>

			<p>During Summer Game Fest 2025, Atomic Heart developer Mundfish also unveiled a new project called The CUBE. It still takes place in the same setting as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomic-heart-soviet-bioshock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original game</a> and the freshly announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ii-announced-coming-to-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a>, but it will be a much different game: an MMORPG shooter.</p>
<p>The developers are trying to mix unique worldbuilding, an intriguing narrative, and exciting quests into one game. The goal is to create a living world full of memorable characters, diverse biomes, and tons of enemies, including powerful bosses. The backstory is that a giant cube appeared in the sky and players will have to scour its ever-shifting environments and mysteries.</p>
<p>Robert Bagratuni, Founder and CEO of Mundfish, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>At Mundfish, we were the first in the industry to implement a technology that allows thousands of objects to move and rotate simultaneously across massive stretches of terrain — online and in real time. No other game has ever done this before. This became possible thanks to our innovative proprietary split-rendering system, which redefines how motion is handled in interactive environments. The technology delivers maximum performance even under extreme load. In The CUBE, physics, ballistics, and gravity feel completely natural — but under the hood, it’s powered by rocket science. The system enables seamless transitions, precise object tracking, and synchronized multiplayer in a living, ever-evolving world. It’s a true technological breakthrough.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="The CUBE - Announcement Trailer I SGF25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YHHJM-KZfss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The CUBE has no release date yet, but given the genre, it might take a while. Meanwhile, you can already <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3230430/The_CUBE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add it</a> to your Steam wishlist. The game is also being developed for consoles, by the way.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yacht-club-games-mina-the-hollower-set-to-launch-in-october.1210080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mina-the-hollower-release-date-yacht-club<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mina the Hollower</em>&nbsp;made it to the biggest show of the season, with its release day being unveiled during Geoff Keighley's Summer Games Fest presentation. Finally, players can get their hands on the full release later this year -- but if you can't wait, there's also a demo.</p>



<h2>When&nbsp;can you play&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower</em>?</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875580/Mina_the_Hollower/" rel="nofollow">full version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>comes out on October 31, 2025, the perfect date for the game's spooky and gothic aesthetic. Meanwhile, a demo is available to play now and during Steam Next Fest, which starts on June 9 and ends on June 16.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This comes after a series of delays in order to improve the quality and widen the scope of&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower</em>. Developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/yacht-club-games" rel="nofollow">Yacht Club Games</a> launched a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mina-hollower-yacht-club-games-sets-sail-with-new-ip" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter</a> for&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower</em>&nbsp;in 2022 and surpassed its goal quickly. It earned over a million dollars in funding from its campaign and achieved numerous stretch goals in the process.</p>



<h2>What's&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower </em>about?</h2>

<p>Having gotten a chance to play the game several times during its development,&nbsp;TechRaptor's very own Austin Suther (that's me) found it to be an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mina-the-hollower-preview-small-mouse-big-world" rel="nofollow">excellent homage</a> to classic Game Boy Color titles. This is in the same vein as Yacht Club Games' previous title,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/shovel-knight" rel="nofollow"><em>Shovel Knight</em></a>, which was a modern interpretation of classic NES games.</p>

<p>The demo on Steam Next Fest takes players through the opening half hour-or-so of&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower.&nbsp;</em>Players take the role of the eponymous mouse and inventor, Mina, who, on the way to visit a friend, finds herself shipwrecked on the coast of Tenebrous Isle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From there, players will fight and dig their way across the isle and arrive at their destination: the town of Ossex. The path forward is fraught with peril as you fight off monsters and get a grasp for&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower</em>'s mechanics. Near the end of the demo, we also get a taste for the narrative, which has a darker tone compared to that of&nbsp;<em>Shovel Knight</em>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to pick your starter weapon, and from there find others later on in the game. The demo ends with an exciting boss fight against one of&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower</em>'s main antagonists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you choose to pick up the full release, progress from this demo will carry over to the final game once <em>Mina the Hollower</em>&nbsp;launches later this year on Halloween, which is, as always, October 31st.</p>

            <p>Too many cosy games about mindlessly planting turnips. Not enough cosy games about the house slowly being taken over by viscera. Fractured Blooms is tagged on Steam as "cute" and "anime" and "psychological horror". It was announced at the Summer Game Fest, where presenter Geoff Keighly described the game as "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doki-doki-literature-club">Doki Doki Literature Club</a> meets Silent Hill". There's no release date, but here's a trailer.</p>

<p>Kinda afraid to find out what the true story is behind this one. "Play as Angie, a girl who finds herself stuck in a time loop and a world that is soft and still," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3730310/Fractured_Blooms/">the Steam page</a>. "Every loop is a strategic game of resource management and discovery. Plan each day carefully to manage your food and stamina. Only by mastering your routine and finding ways around challenging tasks can you dig deeper into the blessed reality around you."</p>
<p>You cook meals, tend the vegetable patch, and wake up every day in slightly new surroundings, and it's all "a deeply personal narrative inspired by a true story. The more you play, the more this broken story blooms. Don’t let them touch you. What are you trying to keep alive?" Okay, as someone keen to see the wholesome game genre eviscerated for once, I'm intrigued.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lego-builders-journey">Lego Builder's Journey</a> is rare not because it's a Lego game, but because it's a Lego game that actually requires you to do Lego stuff, like build and clack blocks together. So it seems to be with the new game from the same studio, Lego Voyagers. The difference this time is that it's two-player co-op with a more expansive world to explore. It looks grand in the trailer below.

<p>I tried introducing my kid to Builder's Journey a few years back and he didn't click with it. It was too contemplative, too much of a puzzle game for an actual kid to play. Time may well have solved that problem already, but if not co-op should do it, and there also seems to be more of a sense of humour this time around. More swingy physics, anyway.
</p>
<p>Voyagers will also have a Friends Pass, meaning two people can play together with only one purchased copy of the game. That seems pretty essential for co-op games, these days.
</p>
<p>It's being published by Annapurna and developed by Light Brick Studio. There's no specific release date yet except that it's coming in 2025, and you can find more screenshots over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538550/LEGO_Voyagers/">on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You play as Ezra "Fuzz-E" Wright, who has opted to fight through the "Tournament of a Million Punches" in order to save an orphanage. The story mode will last about 8-12 hours, they say. Every fight is a boss fight. </p>
<p>"Felt That: Boxing blends tactile, physics-driven combat with responsive controls for a satisfying, skill-based brawling experience," says the Steam page. "Players punch, dodge, block, and super-smack their way through handcrafted arenas inspired by puppet-theater flair and Saturday-morning cartoons."</p>
<p>The studio behind the game, Sans Strings Studio, is headed by Sébastien Deguy, an animator who has been posting <a href="https://x.com/SebDeguy/status/1739030367460532555">muppety mayhem on social media</a> for a while now.
