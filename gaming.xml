			<p>Grand Theft Auto IV with the iCEnhancer 4.0 mod is the remaster that Rockstar Games still doesn't seem interested in releasing, introducing plenty of improvements that enhance the game's visuals considerably.</p>



<p>The release of the new version of a classic mod for the fourth entry in the series, which has been in the works for quite some time, has been announced with a new trailer which highlights the improvements it brings, including new physically-based lighting, new shaders that bring better fog rendering and water and more. As of now, the mod only works with version 1.0.3.0 and 1.0.4.0 of the game, as they are the ones that work best with ENB, so make sure to have either version installed before downloading the mod from its <a href="https://icelaglace.com/mods/ice4.html">official website.</a></p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto IV has originally been released back in 2008, and it is the only 3D entry in the series that is not natively playable on current-generation systems, although Xbox Series X and S owners can play the original Xbox 360 release via backward compatibility. An official remaster has been rumored to be in the works for a while, but it has never materialized, nor has any straightforward port, although one is rumored to have been in the works for a year and may be released <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-iv-port-current-generation-max-payne-3/">before the end of the year</a>. With <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Grand Theft Auto VI slipping to May 2026</a>, the port releasing before the end of 2025 would make a lot of sense, so hopefully, the rumors are true, and the fourth entry in the series will indeed make its return to current generation systems to make the wait for the next entry in the series much more bearable.</p>

<p>Are you excited? Because we are excited! Yes, it's getting mighty close to the return of everyone's favourite video game ape, and to celebrate Nintendo has posted a little movie on its social media (and to its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today</a> app, naturally) to remind us all that there are precisely <em>three days to go</em> until the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

<p>Nice! We hope DK gets over that rather crushing blow in time for our adventures later this week, though.</p>
<p>Of course, for a game that hadn't really got us particularly excited in the lead up to the launch of the Switch 2 itself, Bananza has rapidly become one of our most-anticipated games of the year over the past month or so.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8jptxoh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The game's excellent Direct did lots to whet our appetites, revealing the clever layered world and smashing traversal styles at the heart of it all, and finding out that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">the Super Mario Odyssey team are behind this one</a> has now got us 100% on board.</p>
<p>It seems that physical copies of the game have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/uh-oh-it-looks-like-donkey-kong-bananza-is-already-out-in-the-wild">found their way into gamers' hands already</a>, but the rest of us don't have too long to wait until the Thursday launch. How many days was it again? Make sure to check out our preview of the game, too, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/donkey-kong-bananza-dks-getting-his-own-odyssey-and-its-a-helluva-trip">which is sounding mighty positive thus far</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the DK sphere, the game's director has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-director-acknowledges-performance-drops-we-prioritized-fun-and-playability">acknowledged some performance dips</a>, and a copyright filing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-might-be-getting-his-own-movie">suggests</a> the ape may be getting his very own movie.<em><br></em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The prices for the two ROG Xbox Ally models have leaked online, and they are surprisingly reasonable, considering what they offer.</p>



<p>As spotted by Spanish publication 3D Juegos, ASUS itself leaked the price of the two systems for Europe. The cheaper model will cost €599, around $650, while the premium, more powerful X model will cost €899, around $975. While these prices may look steep for the average user, they are in line with the other handheld PCs on the market and are in the ballpark of the price most expected. </p>



<p>The ROG Xbox Ally systems were rumored to be in the works for some time, and have been officially announced last month during this year's Xbox Game Showcase. The base model will be powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor and will balance performance and power consumption to maximize battery life. The premium X model will be powered by the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, delivering higher framerates and sharper visuals than the base model. Neither of the two models will come with an<a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesnt-have-an-oled-screen/">&nbsp;OLED display</a>, which was ruled out by the necessity of having VRR support and balancing power draw and costs.</p>



<p>As of now, we do not know when the two ROG Xbox Ally models will launch worldwide. Earlier rumors suggested the handheld systems will launch sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-launching-october-price/">October,</a> and with the prices leaking online, there's a good chance ASUS and Microsoft are gearing up for an official price and release date announcement.</p>

A single slot might not seem like much on its own, but with up to seven of the right trinkets equipped, your humble pixelated self transforms from target practice to terror incarnate.</p><p dir="ltr">There’s no shortage of options, especially once you start combining effects or tinkering with modifiers. So, rather than flood you with 37 “great picks” and a dozen situational caveats, we’re cutting through the fat and crowning the best-in-class endgame accessories for each of Terraria’s four core playstyles: Melee, Ranged, Magic, and Summoner. Simple as that.</p><p dir="ltr">And yes, you should absolutely still stack damage, crit, and movement speed modifiers like your life depends on it, because it does.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529528-melee-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529528" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529528-melee-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529528"></a><figcaption>Melee accessories</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529528-melee-terraria-accessories.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Best accessories for melee</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Fire Gauntlet</strong>: +100% knockback, up to +12% damage, +10% melee weapon size, enables autoswing, inflicts fire damage over time</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mechanical glove</strong>: +12% melee damage and speed, +10% melee weapon size, enables autoswing</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Warrior Emblem</strong>: +15% melee damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Frozen Shield</strong>: Immune to knockback, reduces damage by 25% (when below 50% health), absorbs 25% of teammate damage (when above 25% health)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Yoyo Bag</strong>: Increased yoyo range, can wield two yoyos</li></ul><p dir="ltr">It all starts with a modest little pair of claws. Then you fuse it with a Titan Glove. Then you wrap it in lava. Welcome to the Fire Gauntlet, the undisputed king of melee accessories.</p><p dir="ltr">The appeal is straightforward. More damage, faster swings, increased knockback, and automatic autoswing on everything from katanas to solar eruption whips. This thing turns your character into a buzzsaw. Whether you’re carving through Plantera’s vines or trying not to get deleted by a Moon Lord phase change, the Fire Gauntlet keeps your offence brutal and relentless.</p><p>It also applies a permanent Hellfire or On Fire! debuff on hit depending on your platform, which stacks with other damage-over-time effects to shred enemies faster than they can blink. If you’re running a melee build, you want this. And ideally with a Warding modifier, unless you’ve got a death wish and a nurse on speed dial.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529529-ranged-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529529" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529529-ranged-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529529"></a><figcaption>Ranged accessories</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529529-ranged-terraria-accessories.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Best accessories for ranged</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Molton Quiver</strong>: +10% damage, increased arrow speed, 20% chance not to consume arrows, and turns Wooden Arrows into Flaming Arrows</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Stalker’s Quiver</strong>: +10% arrow damage, increased arrow speed, 20% chance not to consume arrows, and enemies are less likely to target you</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ranger Emblem</strong>: +15% ranged damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recon Scope</strong>: + 10% ranged damage, +10% critical strike chance, enemies are less likely to target you, and increases view range for guns</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Let’s not beat around the bush. Guns and bows don’t hit their stride until you start buffing the hell out of their crit rate and projectile behaviour. That’s where the Recon Scope steps in.</p><p dir="ltr">Born from the union of Putrid Scent and a Sniper Scope, the Recon Scope does two things exceptionally well. It increases ranged damage and boosts critical strike chance. Combine that with its long-range targeting assist and it turns you into Terraria’s deadliest cameraman, blowing heads off from a safe distance.</p><p dir="ltr">The real magic, though, lies in how it works with multi-projectile weapons. Fire a Tsunami or Daedalus Stormbow and you’re suddenly raining death with terrifying precision. It’s especially lethal in multiplayer, where you can comfortably sit behind your meat shield friends and delete bosses before they even notice you.</p><p dir="ltr">Bonus points: Stack it with a Molten Quiver or Stalker’s Quiver for synergy with bows. Yes, they stack. Yes, it’s busted. No, we’re not complaining.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529531-magic-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529531" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529531-magic-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529531"></a><figcaption>Magic accessories</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529531-magic-terraria-accessories.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Best accessories for magic</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Celestial Emblem</strong>: +15% magic damage, increased Mana Star pickup range</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Celestial Cuffs</strong>: Restores mana when damaged, +20 increased maximum mana, increased Mana Star pickup range</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Sorcerer Emblem</strong>: +15% magic damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mana Regeneration Band</strong>: +20 increased maximum mana, increases mana regeneration rate</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mana Cloak</strong>: -8% mana cost, uses mana potions automatically, causes stars to fall upon damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Arcane Flower</strong>: -8% mana cost, uses mana potions automatically, and enemies are less likely to target you</li></ul><p dir="ltr">You don’t need to be a wizard to know that mana is a problem in early Hardmode. That’s why many players rush the Celestial Cuffs, a surprisingly stacked accessory that restores mana when you take damage and sucks in mana stars from across the screen like a magical Dyson. Pair that with a Mana Cloak, and you’ll generate the very stars you need to keep afloat.</p><p dir="ltr">But if we’re choosing the top-tier pick for endgame spell-slinging, there’s only one champion. The Celestial Emblem.</p><p dir="ltr">This bad boy grants a flat 15% boost to all magic damage, and if you’ve ever nuked a boss with Nebula Blaze or decimated crowds with Last Prism, you know how much that multiplier matters. The emblem synergises perfectly with high-DPS magic builds, making it the clear favourite for mages who want to kill first and mana-manage later.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529533-summoner-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529533" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529533-summoner-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529533"></a><figcaption>Summoner accessories</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529533-summoner-terraria-accessories.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><span>Best accessories for Summoner</span></h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Papyrus Scarab</strong>: +1 max minion count, +15% summon weapon damage, and +2 minion knockback</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Hercules Beetle</strong>: +15% summon damage, +2 minion knockback</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Summoner Emblem</strong>: +15% summon damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Necromatic Scroll</strong>: +1 max minion count, +10% summon damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Pygmy Necklace</strong>: +1 max minion count</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Summoners have always had it rough in Terraria.

That might not sound revolutionary, but when your build revolves around overwhelming the screen with spiderlings, Stardust Dragons, or Terraprisma clones, more is always better.</p><p dir="ltr">Papyrus Scarab is a fusion of the Necromantic Scroll and Hercules Beetle, both found post-Plantera, so it’s a late-game investment. But summoners are used to that. The payoff? You become a walking army, effortlessly chewing through invasions and bosses while you stand back and admire your minions like the world’s most bloodthirsty talent scout.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The bottom line</h2><p dir="ltr">Accessories in Terraria aren’t just side perks. They’re the spine of every build. Whether you’re swinging swords, firing arrows, hurling magic, or sending your minions to do the dirty work, the right pick for your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-weapon-types/1100-6533073/" data-ref-id="1100-6533073">Terraria weapons</a> amplifies your power, shores up your weaknesses, and gives you the edge you need when the screen starts flashing red.</p><p dir="ltr">Want to go even further? You can. With accessory slots expanding thanks to items like the Demon Heart and the Void Bag letting you swap builds on the fly, there’s plenty of room for experimentation. But if you’re looking for a definitive loadout anchor per class, this is it.</p>

                <p>There's nothing worse in The Sims 4 than encountering bugs in gameplay, especially when you've run into something unusual that's difficult to do a Google search about. It's an inevitable thing, though. The Sims 4 is more than a decade old--it's an early PlayStation 4 game, after all--and so some serious creakiness is to be expected. Things just break down and get messy from time to time.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, The Sims 4 has been so popular that it'd be tough to encounter a bug that's completely unique to you. At this point, we've got a fairly clear set of steps you can take to figure out what's wrong when your game is just kinda freaking out on you. Scroll on for your best options.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Reset your Sim(s)</h2><p dir="ltr">Sometimes your Sims will be going about their business when they just stop responding to orders and seemingly freeze up. It's the most common issue in The Sims 4, and the first thing to try in those situations is to reset the bugged-out Sim in question. To do this, open the cheat console by pressing ctrl+shft+C on PC, or by holding down all four shoulder buttons on Xbox or Playstation. Next, type ResetSim and then the name of the Sim in question--like "ResetSim Dina Caliente." If you've activated cheats (console command "testingcheats true"), PC and Mac users will also have the quicker option of pressing shift while clicking on the Sim, and then choosing the option "Reset Sim (Debug)."</p><p dir="ltr">Resetting a Sim clears out all their random impulses from their action queue. Sometimes, Sims just get too many things going at the same time, like a bunch of other Sims trying to get their attention all at once, and it overloads their li'l computer brains and locks them up while they try to figure out what has the highest priority. Resetting will free their mind, so to speak.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Clear the cache</h2><p dir="ltr">Likewise, the cache for The Sims 4 as a whole can become overloaded in the same way that a Sim itself can be, but we can solve that one by clearing the game cache. Clearing the cache on PC or Mac is simple, as it merely involves deleting two files. First, navigate to Documents &gt; Electronic Arts &gt; The Sims 4. Once you're there, you'll delete two files: localthumbcache.package and avatarcache.package.</p><p dir="ltr">If you play The Sims 4 on Xbox or PlayStation, clearing the cache is even easier than it is on PC. Just turn your system all the way off--not rest mode--and then unplug it for 60 seconds. This clears the cache for the entire system.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Check your mods</h2><p dir="ltr">For a lot of Sims PC players, it's tough to imagine playing without mods. But it's those same mods that often get us into trouble, usually when they haven't been kept up to date. And after 11 years, there are<em> a lot</em> of old, abandoned mods out there. Unfortunately, it's not always easy to tell which mod is causing you problems, or whether it really is a mod that's responsible for your problems at all. So we've got a couple steps you can take to pinpoint whether a mod is the issue, and narrow down which mod it might be.</p><p dir="ltr">First, you'll want to test if a mod is the culprit at all by disabling them completely. You can do this by going to the Other section of the game settings, and unchecking this check box:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529568-sims4screenshot2025.07.03-00.45.29.63%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529568" data-ratio="0.65407407407407" data-width="1350" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529568-sims4screenshot2025.07.03-00.45.29.63%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529568"></a><figcaption>This is where you can disable all your mods at once.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529568-sims4screenshot2025.07.03-00.45.29.63%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Save your settings, restart the game, and see how it works. If your bug isn't presenting itself anymore, then it was probably a mod that caused it. Now you'll need to narrow down which mod is the issue. One relatively easy test you can try is to pull half of your mods from the mods folder in your Documents folder, clear the cache, then load your game again. If you still have the bug, then one of your active mods is the problem--and if you don't, then it means one of the inactive ones is causing the trouble. You can continue narrowing it down from there by doing the same thing with the half that seems to have the problem mod, or if you've narrowed it down to your satisfaction, you may want to start removing specific mods you think might be the culprit.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529570-screenshot%28152%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4529570" data-ratio="0.56289129197496" data-width="1757" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529570-screenshot%28152%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4529570"></a><figcaption>Here is where you can repair your Sims 4 installation in the EA app.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529570-screenshot%28152%29.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Repair installation</h2><p dir="ltr">You may have key game files that are missing or corrupted--another occasional side effect of using out-of-date mods. In these situations, you can use the EA app to check your installation directory and replace any crucial files that have gone missing or been corrupted. Just navigate to the main Sims 4 page in the app, and click on the Manage button to the left of Play. Select Repair from the dropdown menu. The EA app will then scan all your base game and DLC files for anything anomalous. This process <em><strong>does not</strong></em> check your mods, only the game files themselves.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Consider culling Sims</h2><p dir="ltr">There is a limit to how many Sims that The Sims 4 can support at once. By default, the game caps the total population at 200, but you can remove that cap in the settings if you want. But no matter how good your computer may be, The Sims 4 will eventually slow down significantly if you add too many Sims. Even playing on a modern gaming rig with an RTX 4080 and an i9 CPU like I do, The Sims 4 tends to get real creaky when my world's population gets past 750 or so.</p><p dir="ltr">The Sims 4 is built to prevent that creakiness from happening by culling unplayed Sim families from the game periodically, but you can also protect a household from being culled by adding them to your list of played households. If your game has way too many Sims, the population could be the source of your problems. Moving inessential households over to the unplayed bucket will allow the game to remove them when or if it needs to. This is only a concern for players who have more than a couple hundred Sims in their game, however.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Consult the community</h2><p>Lastly, there are two immense community resources you can take advantage of if the above checklist doesn't handle your issues: the <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/the-sims-4-bug-reports-archive-en/re-read-first-compiled-list-of-reported-issues/11182959" rel="nofollow ">EA forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1lp8wwd/troubleshooting_thread_bugs_errors_mod_issues_ea/" rel="nofollow ">Reddit</a>. Those have been the two most central discussion hubs for The Sims 4 since it launched--presuming your problem isn't unique to your setup, there's a very good chance you'll be able to find somebody else who's had the same issue in the past.</p>

            <p>Morning all! The working week once again looms above us like a bulldozer driven by raucous and somehow loveable sheepdogs in top hats and cufflinks. Quickly now, lob a few new PC game releases under the caterpillar treads to slow its passage. It's not clear where those sheepdogs are going, but your and my wellbeing are clearly of secondary importance.</p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 14th July</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today is all about factory games, apparently. My highlights among the mass producers are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kaizen-a-factory-story">Kaizen: A Factory Story</a>, a craftsmanlike automation puzzler from former Zachtronics devs, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3320980/MoteMancer/">MoteMancer</a>, in which you build fantastical factories in different dimensions that overlap in real-time. Note: the MoteMancer devs have said that genAI was used to "ideate" the art, though the final art assets were created by regular humans - or "skinloads" as we are known in the trade.</li>
<li>If you despise factories, please take your resentments to the tiles of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3040170/Arashi_Gaiden/">Arashi Gaiden</a>, a turn-based ninja slicer. Where is my ninja factory sim, games industry.
</li></ul>
<h2>Tuesday 15th July</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today is all about comebacks of one kind or another. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738630/Dungeons__Dragons_Neverwinter_Nights_2_Enhanced_Edition/">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition</a> is Aspyr Media's revamping of one of the D&amp;D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> people venerated before "D&amp;D RPG" became synonymous with "Baldur's Gate 3".</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3024040/Stronghold_Crusader_Definitive_Edition/">Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition</a> is Firefly's remastering of 2002's answer to Angry Birds.</li>
<li>Troubled Bungie FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> has a new edition and DLC rollout - Year Of Prophecy. The first of the new DLC packs is The Edge Of Fate, which includes a new planet featuring lost humans and forgotten Fallen houses.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/becoming-saint">Becoming Saint</a> is today's token Actual New Game. It's a pleasantly cracked real-time tactics roguelite in which you try to get yourself canonised before you are martyred.
</li></ul>
<h2>Wednesday 16th July</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today, it is time to exsanguinate Pikmin and daub gory geometry in occult squad tactics puzzler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/worship">Worship</a>, which should remind you instantly of Cult Of The Lamb.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 17th July</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1315320/The_Necromancers_Tale/">The Necromancer's Tale</a> (pictured) is an open world RPG with Disco Elysium-esque dialogue windows in which you are a questing liche (quiche?), building up your rotten retinue (rotinue? Let's go with it) while going to the occasional ball.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3343160/Fill_Up_The_Hole/">Fill Up The Hole</a> is a chirpy 2D landfill empire simulator. Can't spell wholesome without hole, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-labyrinth">Shadow Labyrinth</a> attempts to make a horror game out of Pac-Man, overlooking that Pac-Man is already perfectly horrible. Pac-Man, a game in which you are an insatiable orb in a maze of ghosts.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-drifter">The Drifter</a> could be this week's highlight. It's a pulp adventure joint inspired by "King, Crichton and Carpenter, with a dash of 70s Aussie grindhouse", in which you a homeless man asked to investigate his own murder.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 18th July</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do you enjoy besieging Rainbows? Do you enjoy kicking doors? Have some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2841770/Phantom_Squad/">Phantom Squad</a>, then.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are we denizens of the Treehouse up to this week? Well, Nic and Jeremy spent a lot of this week's all-hands meeting complaining about gardening - possibly gardening in a video game. I can't quite remember, because I was myself too busy complaining about the 1990s. Possibly the 1990s in a videogame - again, I can't quite remember. This happens a lot at the minute. </p>
<p>Mark has some embargoed stuff on the boil, and James is just back from break, freshly bronzed and hungry for words. Ollie is tidying up some bits and pieces before he, too, embarks on holiday. Graham is staring at us all patiently from the corner of the video call, waiting for people to shut up about their roots. What are you up to this week? Assuming you haven't been smooshed by sheepdogs.</p></div>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> creator Kinetic Games will be creatively involved in the recently announced film, and, the studio has told Eurogamer, it will begin seeding lore across the game in order to develop a story for it.</p>
<p>"Yeah, we are involved in the creative side of it as well," the game's creator, Daniel Knight, told me as part of a longer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">Phasmophobia interview</a>. "We do want to make sure it is a Phasmophobia film and it's what everybody will expect going in. We're not just making a ghost-hunting film. It will be a Phasmophobia-themed film, and it's our job to make sure it's what everybody wants."</p>
<p>But as people pointed out in reaction to the film's announcement, the game doesn't really have a story. It follows a series of procedurally generated ghost hunts that take place across apparently unconnected properties. How does that translate into a film?</p>

<p>"There's some very minor story parts in the game right now," Knight responded. "We do have a lore update planned as well. We were planning on doing that before the whole film stuff came about.</p>
<p>"We'll do our own lore and story for the game and design it in a way where it's a puzzle for people to figure out," he added. "There's not going to be any story mode or campaign or anything like that. You're just going to be poking around in different locations. And that will be used for the film stuff as well."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-has-earned-itself-a-movie-adaptation-from-m3gan-and-five-nights-at-freddys-production-company-blumhouse">The Phasmophobia film was announced in June</a> as a collaboration between Kinetic and Blumhouse (M3gan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a>), and production company Atomic Monster (Annabelle, The Nun, The Conjuring). But apparently Blumhouse wasn't the first film studio to express interest.</p>

<p>"We had a few different studios reach out," Knight told me. "We had quite a lot of interest. Even shortly after release, we had quite a big studio reach out," he said. I asked him who this was but he couldn't remember; I pursued this and genuinely seemed unable to recall the name. "We had quite a few over the years," he added, "and then Blumhouse reached out and we're all fans of all their horror films, and they were the perfect fit.</p>
<p>"A lot of them all play the game as well," he said. "I think it'll be like they will take the game stuff into the film, rather than the other way around."</p>
<p>It's been an extraordinary five years for Knight and Kinetic Games since Phasmophobia was released. Still only in Early Access, the game has sold more than 25 million copies - a new grand total Knight gave me when we spoke. The recent console releases and major Chronicle update have rejuvenated player activity in the game, and now all eyes turn to 2026 and the major 1.0 release, which is so significant, Knight said you should feel like you're playing a new game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">The full story of Phasmophobia</a>, from near-miss to extraordinary success, is live elsewhere on Eurogamer now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-will-begin-seeding-lore-to-build-story-for-the-film]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Chains of Freedom is a turn-based strategy game, similar to XCOM, but set in a post-apocalyptic Eastern European country instead of an alien invasion. As with every other apocalypse, the land is messed up, full of unhinged lunatics, and there’s mutants about. It’s a good thing that you’ve got a squad of tactically minded folks to fight through these enemies with.</p>
<p><iframe title="CHAINS OF FREEDOM | Official Launch trailer | Nordcurrent Labs" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZuXpfuYO4tM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story of Chains of Freedom isn’t going to blow your mind and the characters aren’t exactly novel, but it’s enough to keep you going to the next combat at least. A mysterious disease called EDEN is spreading through the land and those it doesn’t just kill become deformed, crystalline monsters who, naturally, make up a good chunk of the enemies you’ll be facing. Again, it’s not particularly unique, but I found some moments to be enjoyable enough even if I ended up treating the story as a thread to connect the combat encounters.</p>


<p>The biggest issue with the story is that it will take characters from your party without warning, suddenly replacing them with other characters who have different abilities. These new characters are perfectly functional, of course, but you’ve just spent hours with the others and equipped them with essential tools. When they’re taken away it means the time you spent preparing them was wasted, and if anyone can be gone at any given moment, it becomes very easy to not care at all about any of them. I only truly cared about a character when they had unique abilities, but even then sometimes they’re taken away from you, leaving you without that ability. Whilst this does force you to switch up your tactics, not being able to rely on having your carefully assembled squad of characters is a pain.</p>


<p>Thankfully the actual combat is pretty great. If you’ve played XCOM, you know what to expect here. Each character has action points that are spent on moving, attacking, and using abilities or consumables. A few abilities can make certain characters feel really quite powerful, such as a grappling hook which I was using to reposition a sniper, but could also be used to quickly get into or out of combat for a little melee punishment, or to flank around hunkered down enemies. Another character could sacrifice a third of her health to gain 20AP, which has saved her life many times, not to mention ended quite a few enemies’ lives. Since there are no limitations on how many times you can attack per turn, she could attack four times with that ability, making her very powerful.</p>
<p>The other side of this is that the game does feel a little bit easy, with the only real challenges being bosses, and even they’re not that tough. There are a few enemies that I would consider annoying, but not really challenging, such as one that teleports away when damaged, leaving behind a lesser enemy, which wasn’t really difficult to handle, but made the combat longer and more laborious. Some combat encounters will also bring in a few waves of reinforcements, often just appearing right next to your characters upon arrival, which is rather annoying in a game about tactics. Despite these issues, the combat can be very satisfying and was the real reason I wanted to keep playing.</p>

<p>Characters are customisable, though mostly by equipping weapons, tool, and consumables that you find whilst exploring the environment and looting defeated enemies. Favouring sniper characters to keep enemies at a distance, I found a crossbow that causes bleed and burning on enemies that I was partial to, but there’s plenty of variety through shotguns, flamethrowers, as well as various types of grenades, like cryogenic grenades. They provide a lot of effective options, so long as you don’t mind combing every area for loot. The walk speed is needlessly slow and there’s little of interest in the environments other than the loot, so exploration can feel a bit dull. Crafting materials will allow you to craft many of the aforementioned things, as well as ammunition for all your guns, which I had to do a lot as I was constantly running out.</p>
<p>The most interesting things you find through exploring are biocrystals. These are a weaponized form of the EDEN virus that will give a character a bonus. Some are incredibly useful, whilst others are basically useless, but at least there’s a lot of options if you find them. Characters can be upgraded to be able to equip more biocrystals,&nbsp;but only at certain shrines that can only grant a limited amount of biocrystal slots. This is how your character progresses and since it seems like you can miss some of these shrines &nbsp;– there’s been a few moments where I realised I hadn’t seen one for a while and got suspicious – it also seems to be possible to just miss some character progression. Also, as mentioned, you can give these upgrades to characters only for them to suddenly be removed from your party and replaced with someone else, wasting all your time and investment.</p>

<p>The graphics in Chains of Freedom are good, but not that impressive. It does the job well enough. Being post-apocalyptic, the environments are all drab, broken down buildings and such like that aren’t particularly interesting to look at in addition to the game not being pretty on a technical level, so the only draw for exploration is the loot you can find. The game sounds good enough as well, with some punchy gun sounds, though the voice acting oscillates between “serviceable” and “a bit off”.</p>

<p>Yes, the Switch 2's flagship title has landed the gold medal once again, but it wasn't without competition. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> made a gnarly arrival, kickflipping into second in its debut week (with only 11% and 10% of sales coming from Switch 2 and Switch 1, mind you) and the likes of <strong>The Sims 4: Enchanted by Nature</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/legacy_of_kain_soul_reaver_1_and_2_remastered">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered</a> also put up good enough numbers in the first week to disturb the waters of the chart's upper ranking.</p>
<p>Everything else is a pretty familiar sight, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">EA Sports FC 25</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> all hanging about in the top 10. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has taken a bit of a tumble this week and now finds itself in tenth, while <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has made an almighty leap from 25th to fifth.</p>
<p>That's a brief overview of the numbers, but here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <p>It's time. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s gotten a randomiser mod, just in case the base game isn't quite maxing out your unexpected chaos-per-run meter at this point, despite its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-hero-for-our-times-elden-ring-nightreign-boss-becomes-unbeatable-by-refusing-to-show-up">revamped bosses</a>.</p>
<p>While FromSoft's roguelike-ish twist on the established souls formula already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review">switches things up</a> in a manner that's a bit like a randomiser <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-best-mods">mod</a> makeover of one of the series' traditional entries, modder thefifthmatt has still found ways to tinker with it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Enter their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/277?tab=description">Nightreign randomiser and derandomiser</a>, which can be used to scramble map layouts beyond what's possible in the base game, which has a finite range of different map patterns it can chuck at you per Nightlord. It's a first foray into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a> randomising that the author says will serve as a "basis for more advanced randomisation" down the line.</p>
<p>"At a base level, the only difference you might notice using the randomizer is that Night Bosses are more varied for a given Nightlord," thefifthmatt wrote. "Under the hood, it's creating map patterns nearly from scratch and has a tremendous amount of freedom in its placements. In the future this can be extended to randomising enemies and bosses within maps and in-depth placement customisation."</p>
<p>The randomiser works by modifying files when you start up the game, and comes with three distinct randomness presets, "similar to base game", "balanced random", "extra random". They all basically do what they say on the tin, with "balanced" looking like the one you'll want to try first, while "extra" ditches some "placement restrictions which are normally helpful for balancing purposes" to make things tougher for uber-hardcore folks.</p>
<p>You can also pick "any custom combination of these options or other options like greatly increasing the frequency of double Night Bosses". Plus, thefifthmatt's chucked in extra options like increasing the chance of shifting earth being a factor or reverting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-its-first-patch-but-more-importantly-a-trailer-thatll-really-help-you-wake-up">patch 1.01's tweaks</a> to runes and revives so uber-sweaty solo players can wind back the clock to a time of enhanced hardness.</p>
<p>Not every aspect of the maps has been made randomness-eligible yet, but as the modder says, it's a start, and one that's compatible with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-you-wait-for-an-official-update-elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod">Nightreign's Seamless Co-op mod</a> so you can dive in with however many buddies you like. If you fancy giving it a go, you'll need to grab <a href="https://me3.help/en/latest/">Mod Engine 3</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-inevitable-randomiser-mod-is-here-to-spice-up-your-runs-with-extra-funky-map-scrambling]]></content:encoded>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-card-shop-robbed-of-valuable-cards-by-other-pokemon-card-shop-a-few-blocks-away/">Automaton</a>, a 35-year-old Japanese man was arrested on suspicion of robbery on 9th July 2025 and is alleged to have stolen 123 items at knifepoint worth approximately $94,000 from a Pokémon Trading Card store. The twist? The accused is apparently the owner of his own Pokémon and One Piece-focused trading card shop within the same neighbourhood.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fvtronx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Although the police didn't disclose such information, the owner of the target store posted a message on <a href="https://x.com/MASTERS_gifu/status/1943158484863693250">X</a> to confirm that the accused is the manager of a competing store. The post concludes by stating that anybody else involved in the crime should "surrender immediately", asking those who might have information to come forward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the robbery incident that occurred at our store on 6/14,<br>
following Sakaguchi and Ando, the manager of the neighboring store Treca Junky @toreca_junky, Yuji Watanabe, has also been arrested as an accomplice in the robbery.</p>
<p>Those still involved should surrender immediately.<br>
Thinking you won’t get caught is impossible.</p>
<p>We will absolutely catch everyone.</p>
<p>We welcome any information, no matter how small.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The post has since attracted quite a bit of attention, though it remains unclear whether there have been any further developments at this stage.</p>
<p>It's good that at least <em>some</em> progress is being made to get the whole thing sorted, mind. It's likely pretty difficult to deduct who might be perpetrating such crimes at the best of times, but when the stolen goods are then sold on immediately in a rival store..? Gosh, that must be rough.</p>

<p>Relic have confirmed that Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War: ReDawned: War For All: Come Get Some War Down Ya: One Dawntillion Wardollars Edition will be compatible with "over 20 years of lovingly crafted community mods". Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War: This Dawn, Its Warsenal Edition <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/relic-reveal-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-with-full-dlc-and-mod-support">also comes bundled with all four expansions</a>.</p>
<p>All told, the full package contains four campaigns and nine factions, namely Orks, Eldar, Spicy Eldar, Space Marines, Spicy Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Tau, Necrons, and Sisters Of Battle. Tyranids were never released, but you have to remember this was 2004, and the idea of having a swarming species of hive-minded purple bug aliens in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> was ridiculous.</p>
<p>In terms of multiplayer, Relic <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3556750/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Definitive_Edition/">say they've</a> been "fixing some of the most egregious legacy bugs", though balance will remain the same. They also plan to hang around for a bit after launch to fix "high priority issues", and experiment with with changes to things like flying unit behaviour, unit pathing, and "quality-of-life settings such as grid key presets".</p>
<p>As for general improvements, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of Phwoar, That's A Lot Of War(hammer) edition features: image-based lighting, unit texture upscaling ("at least four times their original resolution), new world lighting, unit reflections, surface gloss, emissive lighting, and new shadows. There's also an integrated mod manager, an "improved camera", better draw distances, 4K support, and a better HUD for widescreen.</p>
<p>There is apparently a very minor controversy going on over the new trailer (above) replacing a Space Marine's scream. The word 'iconic' has been used. This does not bother me, because everything that has ever come out of a Space Marine's mouth is stupid, and the setting would be vastly improved if you replaced it all with goat noises. Although, as an Ork enjoyer, I realise I'm throwing stones from the glassiest of houses here.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-gets-an-august-release-date-with-a-chunky-discount-for-anniversary-owners]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Nintendo and Universal Pictures have registered the copyright for a Donkey Kong film, suggesting the forthcoming Mario sequel and Legend of Zelda film could be followed by Nintendo's gorilla.</p>
<p>Few details are currently known, beyond the existence of the <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/rmm_voyager_V01503556900000">copyright itself</a>, but the news is in line with a response from Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa in a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">investor call</a>.</p>
<p>Furukawa was asked about the future of the "visual content business" - films, essentially. The president replied the company has been "working on initiatives beyond our dedicated video game platforms for several years" and that it's "deeply involved in production".</p>

<p>He added: "Although we cannot discuss our plans beyond The Legend of Zelda movie at this time, we are working on various other projects."</p>
<p>It seems a Donkey Kong film will be the next project.</p>
<p>A Donkey Kong film would certainly make sense. To begin with, the gorilla is a prominent character in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, voiced by Seth Rogan, and will likely feature in the sequel - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-super-mario-movie-title-quietly-announced-then-quickly-removed-by-nbcuniversal">expected to be called Super Mario World</a>.</p>
<p>Then there are the theme parks, which have expanded from just the Mario universe to include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> releasing as a launch period game this week for Nintendo's new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> console, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>All of which is to say Nintendo is putting great emphasis on Donkey Kong at present, meaning it's understandable why a Donkey Kong film would be prioritised as the next project after Mario and Zelda.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">Mario sequel film is set to release in April 2026</a>, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-has-delayed-its-legend-of-zelda-film">Zelda film was recently delayed to March 2027</a>. There's no indication as to when the Donkey Kong film will be released but, perhaps Spring 2028 if they're a year apart?</p>
<p>Nintendo confirmed ahead of its release that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananza-is-being-made-by-the-mario-odyssey-team">Donkey Kong Bananza is being made by the Mario Odyssey development team</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on">hands-on with Donkey Kong Bananza recently</a>, stating "it's clear to me that the Nintendo developers in Japan have paid an enormous amount of attention to the entirety of Donkey Kong's history - and the result is a Nintendo Japan game that has a rare energy".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-film-copyright-registered-by-nintendo-as-gorillas-prominence-continues]]></content:encoded>

        <p>You suddenly wake up in an unfamiliar room. You step through a door only to find yourself in yet another strange room. This mysterious space is a collection of interconnected rooms, coming one after the other with no exit in sight.</p><p>What’s worse, you’ve lost your memories. Inside the rooms, you run into other girls who also have no idea who they are or how they got here. But as you keep exploring, you realize something: these rooms are built from your memories. Yours and the other girls’.</p><p>Who are you?<br>Why are you here?<br>And how can you escape this seemingly endless collection of rooms?</p><p><strong>Restore Memories by Placing Items</strong></p><p>As you explore, you’ll find various items. Place them in specific spots to trigger memories associated with a specific combination of items and locations.</p><p>For example, placing a knife in a kitchen might bring back memories of <a title="Genres > Cooking [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>… but that same knife, placed in another room, could remind you of something entirely different.</p><p>However, not all the memories you’ll find will be your own. Some may belong to the other people trapped in this strange space. Sort through the memories, find out whom they belong to, and the truth will finally come into focus.</p><p><strong>A Shifting Space, Changing Every Time You Wake up</strong></p><p>Every time you fall asleep and wake up, you’ll find that the layout of the rooms, how they connect, and the items you find in them all change.</p><p>You can explore, find items, and uncover memories how many times you like, but remember: no two attemps will be the same.</p><p><strong>The More You Do, the Sleepier You Get</strong></p><p>Each <a title="Genres > Action [2,871 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> you take adds to your Sleepiness gauge. Once the gauge is full, you’ll fall asleep… and who knows where you’ll wake up.</p><p>You’ll also lose the items you were carrying, so you’ll need to carefully plan your every step, from the rooms you explore to the items you place in them.</p><p><strong>Meet the Others Trapped Within</strong></p><p>Just like you, the girls inside this space have lost their memories. As you find out more about them, they’ll surely repay the favor by giving you hints.</p><p>The real question is… should you trust them?</p><p>Everyone here has their own forgotten past and their own secrets. Uncovering those may be the key to learning the truth.</p><p><strong>Staff</strong></p><ul><li>Published by: KAMITSUBAKI STUDIO</li><li>Scenario and Programming: Kazuhide Oka</li><li>3DCG and Art: Moe Katakura</li><li>Music: agehasprings <a title="Genres > Party [99 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a></li><li>Logo Design: JEFF99</li><li>English Translation: Marco Godano</li><li>Simplified / Traditional Chinese Translation: flankoi</li></ul></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/kamitsubaki-studio-and-kazuhide-oka-announce-psychological-space-exploration-adventure-game-platonica-space-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

                <p>8BitDo has partnered with Xbox on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7Q3VG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new edition of its Ultimate Mobile Bluetooth Controller</a>. Unlike the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DLFVGYJP,B0DK37CSHP,B0DK36N98Q,B0F5WRZ3LJ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original model</a> that 8BitDo debuted last holiday season, the Xbox-licensed model supports iPhone. We'll be testing the revised model in the coming weeks and will update this article with our impressions, but it has the same features as the Android-only original--and that controller is great.</p><p>Like all 8BitDo controllers, the Ultimate Mobile Bluetooth carries a budget-friendly price: $50. But even from a manufacturer known for offering customizable pro-style controllers with high-end performance at low prices, the $50 price is a bit surprising. 8BitDo's other collaborations with Xbox--<a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DMTLLSBN,B0DMVLD2HC,B0F18T675W,B0D1VHH4C5,B0D1VHT3S6,B0F9L7Q3VG,B0F9L7L7CJ,B0929K9W4N,B0F7RMB4RH,B0CH4SFPSW,B0C4YKQ7ZF,B0CNPST9GY,B0D7P5M1Q3,B0CSPFFVRT,B0CX52RYR4,B0CX4YP82L,B0D3HJ8T3C,B0D1TV3HGB,B0D3HHZK8D,B0D1T96W4L,B0D1TDYNPS,B0CYZKNSS1,B0CYZH52ZY,B0DNZB28FR,B0DNQBQNG7,B0DNZD53VF,B0DNQ9FXJW,B0DNZFCJ5S,B0DNQD9HPS,B0BXSV78R6,B09B2R2GRM,B0CMH7DR3Y,B0D5LPJ2NN,B0BGPX25FP,B0BGPTPSCM,B0BGPQSCMM&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Series X|S controllers, arcade sticks, a keyboard and matching mouse</a>--generally cost a bit more than comparable versions without the Xbox license. But the $50 price here matches the cost of the Android version, and the new one supports iPhone <em>and </em>Android. It swaps the normal 8BitDo home button for an Xbox button, which can be used to pull up the Xbox Cloud Gaming guide menu.</p><div title="[8BitDo] - Ultimate Mobile Controller for iOS and Android" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3881" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[8BitDo] - Ultimate Mobile Controller for iOS and Android" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7Q3VG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F9L7Q3VG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7Q3VG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Bluetooth Controller for iOS &amp; Android (Black)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7Q3VG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F9L7Q3VG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7Q3VG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$50 | Officially licensed by Xbox</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Bluetooth Controller is ready to ship now at Amazon with Prime delivery. It's available in two colors, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7Q3VG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white</a>. Both models have black sticks, face buttons with the standard Xbox color scheme, and the retro-style D-pad found on most 8BitDo controller. It has tactile handles that are contoured to look and feel quite similar to a console/PC controller.</p><p>The Ultimate's numerous premium components and features make it a serious competitor to mobile controllers that retail for double the price (or more). It has two remappable back buttons that will feel familiar to those who have used one of 8BitDo's Ultimate Controllers for PC or Nintendo Switch.</p><p>The full-sized thumbsticks utilize Hall Effect sensors, which offer a smoother feel and are generally more durable than conventional analog sticks because you don't have to worry about stick drift. The right and left triggers are activated via Hall Effect sensors as well. With 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2, you can remap inputs, adjust stick and trigger sensitivity, and create up to three custom profiles.</p><p>The stretchable bridge is large enough to fit all iPhone models and most Android phones. As long as your device is within the range of 100-170mm (3.93-6.69in) in length, you're good to go. For reference, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Apple's largest edition so far, is 6.42 inches.</p><p>The phone cradle offers a secure fit thanks to a few design features.

Made in collaboration with XR glasses manufacturer Viture, the translucent black <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Mobile Controller with USB-C</a> is only compatible with Android and costs $79. An iPhone version of the Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate is in the works and is expected to release this year. You don't need <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Viture XR Glasses</a> to use the USB-C version, but we'd recommend checking out the XR glasses regardless because the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/viture-pro-xr-glasses-prime-day-deal-save-big-on-wearable-135-inch-display/1100-6529930/" data-ref-id="1100-6529930">wearable display tech</a> is immensely impressive.</p><h2>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller vs. the competition for iPhone</h2><p>The Ultimate Mobile Bluetooth Controller is half the <i>regular </i>price of the popular Backbone One. Regular is in italics because <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CCT2TJW4,B0CCT2LWT8,B0CT17GPNT,B0CT1BRLZ9,B0DQM23MLZ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon has the Backbone One 2nd Gen for $70 (was $100)</a></strong> and the 1st Gen models for $60 right now. From a build perspective, I preferred the original 8BitDo Mobile Controller for Android over the Backbone One. That said, Backbone's app is also a pretty awesome console-like launcher, whereas 8BitDo's Ultimate Software is just for control configuration. The Backbone connects to your phone's USB-C or Lightning port, which is typically better than Bluetooth in terms of input response times--though many people won't notice the difference. The Backbone One doesn't have back buttons or full-sized sticks; for those features, you have to make the jump to the recently released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone Pro</a>.

Just last month, the popular manufacturer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razers-kishi-v3-pro-xl-controller-turns-your-ipad-pro-into-a-giant-handheld/1100-6532399/" data-ref-id="1100-6532399">released the Kishi V3 series</a> with three different models starting at $100. Only the $100 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F233Y5YL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kishi V3 base model</a> is comparable to the 8BitDo Ultimate or Backbone, but it's a rather impressive option thanks to TMR electromagnetic sticks, remappable back buttons, and a premium build. The $150 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kishi V3 Pro</a> also works on iPhone and Android phones as well as 8-inch tablets. It has extra features such as remappable claw bumpers and Razer's mecha-tactile, mouse-like button.

It connects to iPhone 15/16 and small tablets like the iPad Mini via USB-C. This model doesn't have back buttons, but it does have Hall Effect sticks. GameSir also has its own app called GameHub with a launcher UI similar to Backbone.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It is perhaps the most beloved intro cinematic in Warhammer 40,000 video game history, a precious relic of a bygone era that is seared into the memories of fans of Games Workshop’s grimdark setting. And woe betide anyone who dares to change it, lest the wrath of all four Chaos gods descend upon them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s how I imagine the developers at Relic Entertainment felt after releasing a high quality version of <a href="https://youtu.be/_oqr06cHAGw?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dawn of War’s iconic intro cinematic</a> to accompany the announcement of the August 14 release date of the Definitive Edition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video, below, reveals the insertion of dialogue from the 2004 Dawn of War real-time strategy game into its intro cinematic, replacing some of the original audio along the way. Chief among the changes is the removal of an “iconic” (at least, for Warhammer 40,000 fans!) guttural scream bellowed by the Space Marine who leads the forces of the Blood Ravens to battle against the monstrous Orks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In its stead is the battlecry of Gabriel Angelos, Chapter Master of the Blood Ravens, as it is heard in Dawn of War gameplay. The thing is, that’s not even Gabriel Angelos screaming in the trailer. It’s a Blood Raven sergeant. And, Dawn of War fans say, the new dialogue compares poorly to the heroic scream it replaced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. Those with keen hearing and an even keener memory will notice other audio changes. The Dreadnought’s dramatic entrance is “ruined,” some say, by the addition of voice lines that distract from the heart-pumping sound of its Assault Cannon revving up and unleashing on the enemy lines. New Ork lines are inserted, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“THEY'VE RUINED IT! THEY REMOVED THE SERGEANT'S HOLY SCREAM!” declared one Emperor-living fanatic in the YouTube comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The original sound effects were PERFECT.  You didn't need to add all those voices. I'll be honest, they kind of ruined it,” said another devotee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Makes it feel less well done and not as cohesive. They just seemed so out of place and you can tell they're just shoved on top.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The new audio is awful. Really takes me out of it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Leaving the sergeant's scream out is a crime against humanity, and therefore heresy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mind fixing the cinematic by restoring the original audio? The new stuff spliced in doesn't work at all and it kinda ruins the nostalgia for us. Hopefully it can be reverted by launch,” said another, perhaps more considered worshipper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps that’s exactly what Relic will do. I asked the developer for comment on this online complaint barrage, and its response suggested the whole thing has taken the studio by surprise.</p><blockquote>“We decided to change the scream as the original audio was quite distorted which was notable when compared to some of the audio touch ups in the enhanced trailer. That said, we’ve heard the feedback from fans — the roar was even more beloved than we realized! Who knows, we may have something for OG roar enjoyers before long.”</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it sounds like Relic has a solution up its sleeve, which will hopefully go some way to placating the wrath of Warhammer 40,000’s passionate fanbase. I realize, however, that for the uninitiated, all this fuss may sound like an overreaction. All we're talking about here are a few audio changes, after all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s something unmistakingly gritty about the original intro trailer’s look, feel, and, yes, old-school audio. It reminds fans of a time in PC gaming’s history when RTS ruled the roost, the Astra Militarum were called the Imperial Guard, and Warhammer 40,000 superfan Henry Cavill had just finished filming Hellraiser: Hellworld. The original rekindles memories of hazy summer days spent hammering out Heretics, my flatmate desperately trying to outmaneuver my attacks. This new and “improved” intro cinematic is too clean, too… nice, and it will always be too recent.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">None of this is to say Relic’s Dawn of War Definitive Edition is on a hiding to nothing. I’m genuinely excited to play it, and not just for a short-lived trip down memory lane. It’s a fantastic game — perhaps the greatest Warhammer 40,000 video game ever made — and I look forward to hammering out those Heretics all over again. Perhaps I’ll even convince my old flatmate to join me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to the trailer! <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-interview-i-am-going-back-and-fixing-typos-i-made-20-years-ago">I interviewed design director Philippe Boulle back in May when the Definitive Edition was announced</a>, and we gushed over Dawn of War’s intro cinematic. Here’s why it’s so good, according to Boulle:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was an amazing accomplishment at the time in terms of the fidelity. We really hadn't seen that for 40K at that time, and it really stood up as something that would reach out and grab you and say, ‘Hey, this is awesome. You need to pay attention.’ And it will still be in the game. It will be playing in beautiful 4K.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The thing that amazes me about it when we look back at it is the directing really holds up. That I think is the undervalued key to it. For the time the rendering was phenomenal, but what really holds up is the pacing, the drama, the ending on this guy running up the hill and getting shot, planting that flag and the drop pods coming down… that just works and that didn't need any changing obviously. That just was like, ‘Oh yeah, that's the stuff.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fun fact! Dave Wilson, executive producer and supervising director of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-40000-secret-level-animation-is-a-sequel-to-space-marine-2">the excellent Warhammer 40,000 episode of Prime Video’s Secret Level animated anthology series</a>, led the creation of the Dawn of War intro cinematic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
