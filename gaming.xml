<p>As it does every year, The Game Awards made some huge announcements during the 2025 edition. Geoff Keighley stood there and rifled off some big trailers, game reveals, and Insider Gaming has picked out six headline moments.</p>



<p>The annual end-of-year celebration of all things gaming is in the books once more. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> presented nearly 30 awards and showcased many game reveals, new trailers, and much more. Throughout the course of the nearly four-hour show, some segments happened that are sure to live long in the memory.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-the-game-awards-2025-announcements-amp-game-reveals">Best The Game Awards 2025 Announcements &amp; Game Reveals</h2>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Fate Of The Old Republic</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Arcanaut Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Who saw this one coming? The Star Wars community has spent years waiting impatiently for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/old-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-images-appear-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>. Reports have gone back and forth on whether the remake is happening, but what everyone does know is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-shockingly-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is in development</a>. It’s a spiritual successor to KOTOR and promises to capture the essence and magic of why KOTOR is so popular.</p>







<p>The bad news is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-years-away-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is likely years away from release</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-divinity">Divinity</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Larian Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Larian Studios was quite cunning in the lead-up to TGA 2025. The company proclaimed that there were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-plans-for-divinity-original-sin-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no current plans for Divinity: Original Sin 3</a>. Evidently, this was the case. This didn’t stop the developer from solving the frustrating mystery of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-statue-mystery-possibly-solved-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards Statue</a> by announcing Divinity—a new entry in the franchise.</p>



<p>Despite Baldur’s Gate 3’s success, Larian is shifting gears back to the series that launched the company to success. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-3-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Divinity announcement</a> certainly was a bombshell.</p>



<h3 id="h-resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Plenty of Resident Evil Requiem has been seen already. The game isn’t a secret, and its release date is getting ever closer. So why does it make this list? Confirmation was finally revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-the-game-awards-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon Kennedy</a> is one of the two playable characters. Alyssa Ashcroft will handle the survival-horror and puzzle-based sections of gameplay, whereas Leon is an ass-kicking machine.</p>



<p>Over 20 years after we first saw Leon being chased by chainsaw-wielding freaks, it’s fitting that the former RPD officer now gets his own eviscerating machine.</p>



<h3 id="h-control-2-resonant">Control 2: Resonant</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Control 2 has been a constant rumor with even more constant buzz, and TGA 2025 finally revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-resonant-confirmed-the-game-awards-remedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Control: Resonant</a>. Original protagonist Jesse Faden looks to be taking a backseat in Resonant as a new character gets to experience the usual mind-bending chaos associated with the FBC. It looks just as trippy and psychologically challenging as the first title, and Remedy has a certain penchant for infusing the weird with the wondrous.</p>



<h3 id="h-tomb-raider">Tomb Raider</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Crystal Dynamics</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s always a shame when something leaks ahead of time (the irony is not lost here), and news came out before The Game Awards 2025 that two new Tomb Raider games were about to be unveiled. In a shock to no one, this is what happened. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Tomb Raider Remake</a> of the first TR game was shown, and we also got wind of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-catalyst-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>—a completely brand-new entry in the franchise. There has been nothing on the Lara gaming front since 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and now she’s pulling double-duty!</p>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Fuse Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Galactic Racer was revealed at The Game Awards</a>, and the world felt like a better place. Racing games aren’t as frequent and in abundance as they once were, and you’ll have to dust off the cobwebs to find the last Star Wars racing game. Galactic Racer is being made by Fuse Games—comprised of devs who’ve worked on Burnout and Need for Speed games—and this should give everyone…A New Hope.</p>

                <p>From 1999 to 2017, Bruce Straley was one of the key players at Naughty Dog, and the co-director of two its best-selling games, The Last of Us and Uncharted 4. However, Straley essentially left the game industry for several years despite that impressive track record. Now, Straley is sharing more details regarding his departure, following up on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-director-reveals-why-he-left-naught/1100-6456223/" data-ref-id="1100-6456223">comments he made years ago</a>.</p><p>"I had been there 18 years. That's a long time for anybody to be anywhere," Straley told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/bruce-straley-naughty-dog-exit-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>. "I need new problems to solve, I need new creative outlets. I'm not saying there wouldn't be opportunities there, but couple that feeling with the idea that I was working really, really hard at something that wasn’t mine."</p><p>Straley went on to explain that he didn't jump to another AAA studio because he felt Naughty Dog was the "pinnacle" of developers that made the games he was interested in. And he didn't want to deal with "a whole different bureaucratic or cultural system."</p><p>"It really comes down to: Do you want to continue working for someone else and put in all the effort to build an IP, to build characters, to build things that a franchise could be built out of? I got paid very well there," added Straley. "I got some appreciation there, but it felt like it was time to break out and try it on my own. It felt like it was time to evolve my concepts and build a new team. It might fail miserably, but I thought that it was at least my failure based on my choice."</p><p>During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">The Game Awards</a>, Straley's new team at Wildflower Interactive debuted their inaugural title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/debut-title-from-last-of-us-and-uncharted-co-director-revealed/1100-6536829/" data-ref-id="1100-6536829">Coven of the Chicken Foot</a>. It's a wordless single-player adventure that's completely unlike the games Straley made at Naughty Dog. Players assume control of a witch named Gertie and her creature companion as they try to fulfill her oath. The game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-research-shiny-charm-2000652209"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span> completes the base game’s incomplete </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Mega Pokédex</span></a><span>. Now, every monster that can undergo one of these superpowered transformations can do so in the RPG, including ones that were omitted from the original roster. However, there </span><i><span>is </span></i><span>one of these evolutions that is still missing from the game; you just might not know about it if you haven’t been paying attention to the leaks and datamining communities.</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>introduces Z forms for two Pokémon who were already able to Mega Evolve. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602"><span>Lucario</span></a><span> and Absol have had standard Megas since the mechanic was introduced in </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, and the DLC adds new ones that change their appearance and give them a special mechanic that lets them speed up their cooldowns at the expense of a prolonged transformation. It seemed odd that Game Freak would create a whole new mechanic for only two monsters, so perhaps it’s not surprising that a third one is in the game’s code, but isn’t obtainable in the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Garchomp is apparently the third Z form in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, but at the moment, the only traces of it are in datamined models. Fans hypothesize that Game Freak is planning on giving players a new Mega Stone to transform their own dragon/ground beasts into this new form in <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mewtwo-mega-evolution-stones-quest-2000649609">an upcoming event</a>. Despite this, dataminers have unearthed the new form’s model, which you can see below:</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="es" dir="ltr">Mega Garchomp Z <a href="https://t.co/iPy8aHPHD8">pic.twitter.com/iPy8aHPHD8</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1998838515866431571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>I knew about Garchomp Z from <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670">previous leaks</a>, and was surprised I hadn’t seen it after putting over a dozen hours into </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>thus far. I’ve faced new Megas for Legendary and Mythical monsters already, and I know Garchomp is a ferocious beast, but it doesn’t seem like something you’d turn into an endgame battle after players have faced the final boss, so this explanation makes some sense. We’ll see if the Garchomp Z stone is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-hyperspace-donuts-tips-2000652670"><span>as much of a grind</span></a><span> to get as most other things in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span> whenever Game Freak releases it.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic Is Likely Years Away From Release]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-years-away-release/</link>
            <guid>1382128</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of the bigger announcements of this year’s The Game Awards was the reveal of a brand-new single-player Star Wars game called Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic. And while the hype surrounding the new game was understandably strong, a release date for Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is likely still many years away.</p>



<p>In a new interview at <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">StarWars.com</a>, it was confirmed that the studio working on the game, Arcanaut Studios, was formed in 2025. </p>







<p>That was followed up with a post on Bluesky on Friday by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, who says that a release date of 2030 could be an “optimistic guess” for the game. It’s important to note, however, that this is his guess and not an official report on it. </p>



<p>As far as why a game would be announced so early on in development, it’s often done as a way to show progress ahead of mass hiring. With tangible proof of the game progressing, it makes hiring an easier task for many development studios. </p>

<p>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is a single-player player narrative action RPG. It’s also not a direct sequel or continuation of the story. The game is being led by Casey Hudson, the director of the original Knights of the Old Republic and the Mass Effect trilogy.</p>







<p><strong>“Blending innovative storytelling, memorable characters, and heart-pounding combat,&nbsp;Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic&nbsp;will immerse you in an unforgettable experience where every decision deepens your journey toward the light…or the darkness,” </strong>Arcanaut said. </p>



<p>The game is still <strong>“in the early stages of development and creation</strong>” and more details on the game will come at a later date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Polish indie developer The Astronauts announced that its RPG shooter game, Witchfire, has sold <span>over 500,000 units since its&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-early-access-release-overview-trailer/" target="_blank">Early Access debut&nbsp;</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-early-access-release-overview-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two years ago</a>. </p>



<p>A major new update titled 'The Reckoning' is also now live. The Reckoning takes Witchfire's combat beyond pure gunplay by introducing four new melee weapons, including a Morgenstern, Katar, and Shield. These provide players with powerful alternatives to the default fist and offer unique abilities or utility that witch hunters can seamlessly incorporate into their gunplay.</p>



<p>The melee arsenal is complemented by three new firearms, including the highly anticipated triple-barrel shotgun, the Tribunal, which encourages a run-and-gun playstyle, letting players dash or slide to charge upcoming shots. Charged overkills unleash a devastating shock explosion on enemies. Combined with the arsenal of brutal melee weaponry, players can now fluidly blend close-quarters aggression with ranged lethality and spell-slinging.</p>



<p>A shooting range featuring an interactive bestiary has been added to allow players to hone their skills. This provides the perfect laboratory for experimentation and will enable players to pit their loadouts against already conquered enemies before venturing into expeditions.</p>



<p>Witchfire is now fully verified on Steam Deck, and the development team has also introduced new accessibility options like font size adjustments and an arachnophobia filter. The latter is available just in time for a new spider-themed calamity — a powerful cursed event from the Witch's arsenal. Finally, extraction from expeditions has been completely overhauled and two new gameplay modifiers have been introduced to challenge even the most seasoned witch hunter. A complete list of changes and fixes can be found in the Steam patch notes or <a href="https://www.theastronauts.com/2023/09/witchfire-patch-notes/?mc_cid=7aa883fefe&amp;mc_eid=22f0f6c8d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the developer's website</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Witchfire blends RPG shooter tension with roguelite progression and Souls-like challenge. Players take on the role of a Preyer, an undead assassin fueled by the titular Witchfire who must battle the Witch of the Black Sea and her army. Each expedition offers meaningful choices, and between runs, the Hermitorium serves as a base of operations where players can craft distinct builds from an expanding arsenal of weapons, spells, and artefacts, all while piecing together the Witch's story.</p>



<p>It's been more than eight years since The Astronauts <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-dark-fantasy-fps-astronauts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first talked about the game</a>, their first project since 2014's The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. The game was supposed to debut in early access in 2022, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-dark-fantasy-fps-is-delayed-to-2023-to-add-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it got delayed by around a year to add an open world-like experience</a>. Similarly, version 1.0 was originally scheduled for release before the end of 2025; however, a delay in the launch of the previous Witch Mountain update pushed Witchfire's full launch back to 2026. In the meantime, you can temporarily grab its early access version at a 20% discount on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3156770/Witchfire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/witchfire-db273e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When Is Deadpool Coming To Marvel Rivals? Deadpool Release Period & Voice Actor, Explained]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Deadpool is bringing his outlandish brand of violence and very quick one-liners to break down the walls in Marvel Rivals—primarily the fourth one. If you’re looking forward to using Wade Wilson in Marvel Rivals, the Deadpool release period is needed, as is the lore on the likely voice actor.</p>



<p>You’ll be hard-pressed to find many people who dislike Ryan Reynolds’ portrayal of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deadpool-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool</a>. It’s the definition of someone being born to play a role. It’s time to step away from the MCU version of Deadpool and bring Wade to Marvel Rivals to walk alongside some of the universe’s biggest names and faces.</p>



<p>The Game Awards 2025 delivered the Deadpool reveal for Marvel Rivals fans, and there’s more to Deadpool’s arrival than initially meets the eye.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-deadpool-coming-to-marvel-rivals">When Is Deadpool Coming To Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We see you. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Deadpool will debut in Marvel Rivals “Soon,” according to the game’s official social media, and Wade will likely be a big-time character addition during Season 6, when it starts in January 2026.</strong></p>







<p>NetEase likes to keep everyone waiting, unfortunately. Delays can always impact live-service games, which is why some companies are reluctant to slap exact dates on content. But the Game Awards 2025 trailer showing off Deadpool had the hero posing next to the Season 6 start date—<strong>January 16</strong>.</p>



<p>This does mean this is the earliest Deadpool will arrive. It’s more than likely that Wade Wilson becomes available halfway through the season, so you can likely look forward to using Deadpool around early to mid-February.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Marvel Rivals Season 6: Night at the Museum arrives January 16th, 2026 UTC.<br>And yes – Deadpool is coming.

<h2 id="h-who-voices-deadpool-in-marvel-rivals">Who Voices Deadpool In Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A few have donned the mask. Image via Marvel</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s unconfirmed, but the internet has suggested Alejandro Saab is the voice behind Deadpool, although the actor is trying to distance themself from the notion.</strong></p>



<p>It’s an interesting one, as so far, Saab has indicated to fans that he is <em>not </em>the voice. When Deadpool’s segment appeared during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>, there was immediate speculation that it was Alejandro Saab.</p>



<p>The voice actor posted a sus emoji on X of a mouth with its lips zipped up, and followed this up with an interesting message: “I meant it as it’s not me, guys.”</p>



<p>Needless to say, the community isn’t having it. The voice very much has a Saab flair to it, and the denial is what many voice actors do to deflect and shy away from the fact that something is official until they can talk about it.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We’ll have to wait and see if it is Alejandro Saab. The actor has been slaying it for years with roles in Borderlands 4, Date Everything, Zenless Zone Zero, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, and hundreds of other roles across TV, anime, and gaming.</p>



<p>Who do you think is the voice actor for Marvel Rivals’ Deadpool? Are you hoping the assassin arrives sooner rather than later?

The director has spoken in the past about his plans to feature John Constantine, Swamp Thing, The Spectre and Deadman in the team-up movie, which at one point would have been part of the now-defunct DC Extended Universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, del Toro has revealed more about the project — which would have featured Constantine as its star, and seen his crew call on a certain Bruce Wayne for backup.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/gettyimages-2250573491-1765556520872.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Guillermo del Toro. Image credit: Lia Toby/Getty Images for Netflix.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"[The lead] was Constantine, and the plot made absolute, perfect sense," del Toro said. "I really loved how they got tangled into the Floronic Man as one of the villains, Swamp Thing was really fleshed out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was not casting yet," del Toro continued when asked who he'd wanted to play Constantine. At one point, the project had been planned to feature Constantine TV series star Matt Ryan reprising his role, though it was previously reported that this idea fell through when the show was not renewed for a second season. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I knew I wanted Doug Jones to be Deadman," he continued, referencing the DC superhero capable of possessing other people's bodies, "only because I knew physically he could do the suit, I knew his mannerisms." Jones would of course go on to star in del Toro's The Shape of Water instead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">DCEU Movie Teases That Were Never Paid Off</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing his favorite planned setpiece from the movie, del Toro said it would have featured a chase sequence where Deadman is seen "jumping from one body to the next. It would have been an 80-year-old lady in Central Park, running after the antagonist and then jumping into a traffic cop, or mounted cop... it would have been a thrilling thing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How else might Justice League Dark have tied into the DCEU? Well, in a surprising admission, del Toro revealed he had planned for the film to also feature a Batman cameo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There was a moment where Batman came in briefly," del Toro revealed. "[The team] said, 'We need a plane,’ and [Deadman] said, 'I know a friend of mine has a plane.' And then you were in Bruce Wayne's office. You know I would have loved to have done that, but now I wouldn't, you know."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, perhaps the most startling moment of the whole interview comes as del Toro is asked about the long-standing suggestion he was once in the frame to direct Superman movie Man of Steel (a job that ultimately went to Zack Snyder). When the question is asked, del Toro pauses for a very long time, before ultimately breaking the moment's tension by simply saying: "Next."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">DC Universe: Every Upcoming Movie and TV Show</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time del Toro has been questioned about being offered the job. Back in 2010, in an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2010/09/toronto-qa-julias-eyes-and-biutiful-producer-guillermo-del-toro-66712/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, del Toro was asked about a couple of Warner Bros. projects he was apparently offered, including a new Wizard of Oz movie and the job of resurrecting Superman. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I came out of The Hobbit, and it was the biggest heartbreak I've experienced as a filmmaker, because I will never know what that movie would have been," del Toro answered back in 2010, referencing the period where he was once set to direct The Hobbit before The Lord of The Rings director Peter Jackson came on board instead. "I was very mindful that I didn't want to have a rebound movie, as happens sometimes when somebody comes off a long romance." He concluded: "There were very big, lucrative, beautiful projects on the table."

              <p>In a night filled with gory trailers for loud action games, one of the new reveals at The Game Awards stood out for its gentle nature: <em>Coven of the Chicken Foot</em>. The game defied almost every trend of the night: it was a single-player game, in a beautiful cel-shaded animation style, in which the main character is an elderly woman. This, it turns out, is the first new game from Bruce Straley, one of the co-directors of the original&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, since he left Naughty Dog in 2017.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/bruce-straley-naughty-dog-exit-interview/">an interview with&nbsp;<em>Polygon</em></a>, Straley spoke for the first time about his surprise exit from Naughty Dog, soon after shipping his last game with the company,&nbsp;<em>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End</em>. After 18 years at the developer, Straley found himself struggling with a sense of repetition as the studio settled into making, you know, Naughty Dog sorts of games. (In the two decades prior, the company had also put out both <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> and&nbsp;<em>Jak and Daxter</em> games, before settling on the cinematic action of <em>Uncharted</em> and&nbsp;<em>TLOU</em>, the only game series Naughty Dog has released since 2007.)</p>

 <p>“I felt like I was answering the same questions over and over again,” Straley told <em>Polygon</em>. “We were kind of in this paradigm of this style of game—that I was part of creating! But it felt like I’ve been in this position before. My brain isn’t good with that type of repetition. I need new problems to solve, I need new creative outlets. I’m not saying there wouldn’t be opportunities there, but couple that feeling with the idea that I was working really, really hard at something that wasn’t mine.”</p>

  <p><em>Coven of the Chicken Foot</em><em>&nbsp;</em>is certainly a significant step away. The first game from Wildflower Interactive, a 16-person team established in 2021, it describes itself as an “emotionally rich, stylized, single-player adventure.” You play as an elderly witch called Gertie, accompanied by a peculiar creature who will learn from Gertie’s actions how to best assist her in their journeys through woods, dungeons and bogs. The claim is that this unnamed beast will be an NPC dynamically shaped by how you play the game.</p> <p>Elderly women are extraordinarily under-represented in video games, almost always confined to being evil antagonists—the only other example of a playable elderly woman I can think of is in Tale of Tales’ 2008 tiny game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/27020/The_Graveyard/"><em>The Graveyard</em></a> (which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/preview-the-graveyard">I loved</a>).&nbsp;<em>Coven</em> looks charming, if a little too close to&nbsp;<em>Ori </em>in its&nbsp;creature design (and vocal sounds for that matter) for my liking. There’s no release date at this point, but you can of course already <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041680/Coven_of_the_Chicken_Foot/">wishlist the game on Steam</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic: Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>With the lengthy development cycles that high-profile games undergo these days, we're probably years away from seeing anything concrete from Fate of the Old Republic, and even further from a release. Skepticism about the game even releasing this decade is quite reasonable.</p><p>"We’re still early in development, with many challenges ahead," Hudson told StarWars.com. "I'm grateful to have enjoyed the support of KOTOR<i> </i>fans for many years, and I look forward to embarking upon this journey together, sharing more of what we’re doing as soon as we can!"</p><p>Since his work on the original KOTOR, Hudson stayed in contact with Lucasfilm, and the opportunity arose to make a new title in the Star Wars universe sometime after Arcanaut's founding.</p><p>Details are sparse on the premise. It isn't a direct sequel to Knights of the Old Republic, but Hudson says that the new game introduces new characters and will tell an "all-new story crafted specifically to deliver on the combination of player agency and immersion in Star Wars<i> </i>that was at the heart of KOTOR."</p><p>The Old Republic has been making the headlines as of late, with a report claiming that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-full-star-wars-kotor-2-remake-was-in-development-report/1100-6536775/" data-ref-id="1100-6536775">KOTOR 2 remake was once in development</a> before being put on hold. And in other Star Wars news, The Game Awards 2025 also included a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-galactic-racer-announced-the-game-awards/1100-6536876/" data-ref-id="1100-6536876">reveal for Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-series-creator-reportedly-going-to-netease-while-tencent-is-rumored-to-be-acquiring-a-japanese-studio/">left SEGA in 2021 after 32 years with the publisher</a>, and announced his new studio, Nagoshi Studios, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nagoshi-studio-unveiled-by-netease-focused-on-global-console-games/">which he formed in partnership with NetEase a year later in 2022</a>. Now, at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, Nagoshi Studio has announced its debut project, Gang of Dragon.</p>



<p>The new action-adventure game is proof that Nagoshi made good on his promise to players in 2022, which was that <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-creator-promises-he-wont-make-smartphone-games-at-netease/">he wouldn't start making mobile games just because he formed his new studio under NetEase,</a> a Chinese publisher and developer known for its success in mobile and live-service titles. </p>



<p>Instead, Gang of Dragon looks to be directly in Nagoshi's wheelhouse, as the cinematic trailer reveals a tone similar to that of the Yakuza series, without necessarily having to strictly keep to the pillars of what defines those games.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gang of Dragon World Premiere Trailer from The Game Awards 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KX2pzle9dkE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Gang of Dragon is set in Kabukicho, Shinjuku, a nightlife district in Tokyo and stars South Korean actor Ma Dong-seok, also known as Don Lee, as the lead character and high-ranking member of a Korean crime syndicate, Shin Ji-seong.</p>



<p>You likely recognize Don Lee for his work in films like Train to Busan, Marvel's Eternals, and The Outlaws, or his recent role in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach as Samson Hook.</p>



<p>"<em>I'm both relieved and deeply focused as we finally reach the day to unveil Gang of Dragon,</em>" said Nagoshi in a press release. "<em>This project depicts, with unwavering honesty, the lives of outlaws who inhabit the real streets of Kabukicho. Through gameplay, my team and I are committed to delivering a powerful new human drama born from this world. What is shown in this teaser represents only a small part of what Gang of Dragon truly has in store, and we look forward to sharing much more with you in the future</em>."</p>



<p>There's currently no word on when to expect Gang of Dragon, or what platforms it'll arrive on beyond PC. The game is reportedly "<em>deep in development</em>," however, so now that it has been unveiled, it might become a game we see at future events throughout 2026 with a 2027 release window, but that's just a guess.</p>

		<p><em>There is a moment in every young person's life where a story hits you in the chest. Maybe you end up scared, maybe you end up crying, maybe it's your first crush. And maybe it's some strange combination of all three?</em></p><p><em>The conversation around the indie horror game Horses got Patrick thinking about challenging art, and the way art pushes and pulls you in different ways depending on how old you are, what you're seeking out, and how expectations radically change over time time.</em></p><p><em>For Rob, of course, it was a chance to talk about Little Women.</em></p><p><em>Of course.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Do you remember the first piece of art that fucked you up?</p><p>I have this very distinct memory of my mom bringing home a VHS copy of <em>E.T. </em>and the family gathering on the couch. Me, my younger brother, my mom, and one of her best friends <em>E.T. </em>came out in 1982 and I wasn’t even born until 1985, so I have no idea what age we were watching the movie at, but like—we were very young. My mom had seen the movie before and was excited to share it with us. She had also forgotten the hardcore jump scare that kicks the movie off in the cornfield <em>and</em> the whole sequence where <em>E.T. </em>almost dies. I mean, that shot of <em>E.T. </em>in the fucking ditch has lived rent free in my head for decades. My brother and I were bawling, while my mom reportedly looked over to her friend and said “I don’t remember all this!”</p><p><em>E.T. i</em>s the definition of a popcorn flick, albeit a very good one. But it was the first time a movie—or a piece of art—really drove a sharp emotional response from me. I didn’t process it that way at the time, but in hindsight, that was a big moment. (By contrast, the first time my nine-year-old cried during a movie was watching 2009’s <em>Hotel For Dogs,</em> in which she was hysterically crying towards the end. It seemed like the literal “hotel for dogs” at the center of the film was being destroyed, leaving the dogs without a home. The hotel, thankfully, lived on.)</p><p>You can draw a pretty straight line between many of my personal interests and that moment!</p><p>What I’ve always enjoyed about horror is feeling uncomfortable. It wants to push you. I feel physically and psychologically moved when I engage with an effective piece of horror, and probably more than any other genre, you can arrive at an emotional <em>moment</em> very quickly.</p><p>I started thinking about this because of our recent discussion about <em>Horses</em>, the indie horror game that spurred a bunch of discussion about art, censorship, and the roles of platform holders like Steam. You weren’t present for that conversation, but I assume you’re aware of the beats.</p><p>One of the pleas I made on the podcast was to seek out uncomfortable art. Go to storefronts where you might find something that is genuinely surprising. Understand that storefronts are carefully curated, and while it might feature many good things, curation is a judgment call. Find an .exe that gives you pause about whether there might be a virus hiding in the file structure.</p><p>I think <em>Horses</em> is…okay. I’m glad I played it, but I won’t think about it a week from now. It mostly reminded me that I need to spend more time taking my own advice and experiencing weird stuff.</p><p>My wife and I do have a process to get outside of our comfort zone with movies, at least. It’s going to sound kinda boring and normie, but I do value that we follow this process every year.&nbsp;</p><p>We watch every single movie that’s up for Best Picture at the Oscars. No, this does not mean I am experiencing the most avante-garde art from indie filmmakers on a shoestring budget pushing at the definitional edges of filmmaking, but most years, I can barely keep up with the fun and goofy blockbusters rolling out. Plus, fun and goofy blockbusters pair well with a Saturday evening as you split a bottle (or two) of wine with a partner. Less so with sad movies!</p><p>I can’t remember how long we’ve been doing this watch-every-nominated-film schtick, but I managed to get my neighbors to get in on the action, too, and it’s led to some hysterically fun conversations about movies that click, movies that don’t, and just generally watching stuff that I would not otherwise click to rent on iTunes or whatever. (<em>Sing Sing</em> is one of the best movies I’ve seen in the past decade, and I’m not sure I would have watched it without this in place.)</p><p>Anyway, I’ve gone on long enough. What movie—or other form of art—fucked you up, Rob?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Is this where Patrick admits he hasn't actually seen </span><i><em>Goodfellas</em></i><span>?</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Okay, so my dad loved mob movies and so they were on in the background a lot growing up. Which means that the image of Robert De Niro sitting down in his car and then being blown into oblivion by a car bomb is engraved in my brain, though until recently I'd also seamlessly blended that scene with the opening of <em>Backdraft</em>, where the killer's first victim in the film opens their front door and gets blasted by the titular backdraft and their entire head is shown melted in the next scene.</p><p>All that was bad enough but then my dad had <em>The Godfather </em>playing and nothing rattled me about that movie. Not the horse's head, not what happens to Sonny, not Michael shooting the police captain. But then, right when things seem to be going well for Michael in Italy, what happens? That's right: car bombing.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming has learned that a new game based on the Alien franchise is back in development.</p>



<p>According to sources, this new Alien title is a single-player arcade survival horror game that sees players trying to survive being aboard a decaying space station. They’ll have to evade a mix of xenomorphs and spec ops units in what was described to Insider Gaming as being “Shadow of Tomb Raider with xenomorphs” at its current stage.</p>







<p>The game, which has been in the works since at least 2020 under a variety of names and was even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-alien-game-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first reported on</a> by Insider Gaming in November 2022. What was once codenamed “Marathon” and others that Insider Gaming promised not to share to protect sources, was believed to be dead for a few years. It had switched developers multiple times, but recent documents dated from earlier this year show that the current studio working on Alien is Eidos Montreal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to gameplay, its planned to have a mix of combat, platforming, and puzzles. Players will need to rely on stealth, resource management, and problem-solving, with puzzles ranging from repairing machinery to cracking codes. And during combat, enemies won’t just rush blindly. The AI is designed to adapt and react to whatever tactics you use.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Documents also show at least three characters in the game. The main character Aubrey is an engineer who has the ability to use items like grappling hooks and magnetic boots, among others. Another new character is Ryuzo who uses the space station as his fortress and is likely an antagonist of some sort. Finally, there’s Ripley 8. In the movies, she was famously played by Sigourney Weaver and there’s an internal hope that she could reprise her role for the game. That said, only a first approach has been made as of now with nothing set in stone.</p>







<p>The early budget for the game is less than $75 million, but it’s higher than the earlier budget of $30 million from a few years ago. It’s also slated for release in 2028 for all major platforms. However, it was emphasized that the game is still in “early development”, and that the date, along with other game details, could very well be changed. Sources say, though, that the state of the game is in a good place at this point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Eidos Montreal nor Embracer responded to multiple requests for comment on this story.</p>

<p>The best way to spread Holiday cheer is by playing Fortnite Winterfest 2025 loud for all to hear. If you’re staying up past your bedtime, eating milk and cookies to keep a lookout for Winterfest 2025 details, this guide can help.</p>



<p>Unless Epic Games decides everyone needs coal in their stockings this year, expect <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-suggest-overwatch-crossover-could-happen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> Winterfest 2025 to drop and get the community into the festive spirit. Like Santa, it comes once a year and delivers a bunch of fun gifts to enrich the Fortnite festive spirit!</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has gathered up the latest leaks and tidbits about Fortnite Winterfest 2025.</p>

<p><strong>It’s looking likely that Fortnite Winterfest 2025 will start the week of December 15, potentially launching as late as Friday, December 19.</strong></p>







<p>This is not a guarantee, and it’s simply using leaks and logic from previous Winterfest events. Firstly, HYPEX declared on December 10 that: “FORTNITE WINTERFEST 2025 STARTS NEXT WEEK.”</p>



<p>As of writing, today is Friday, and it’s looking unlikely that Winterfest 205 is dropping sadly. However, this would be in keeping with previous years, as Winterfest has never dropped before December 13—as it did in 2022.</p>



<p>Winterfest 2024 was the most recent incarnation, and it went live on December 20, 2024, which was the third Friday of the month. December 19 would be the third Friday of the month this year. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Winterfest does have a history of launching on different days throughout the week, though, so don’t rule it out starting a bit earlier.</p>

<p><strong>A Harry Potter collaboration is expected to be the main attraction for Fortnite’s Winterfest 2025 event and theme; the Cabin is expected to return, and there will be other Xmas-themed activities and a boss.</strong></p>



<p>There’s a lot to wrap and unpack this Christmas! Let’s start with Fortnite Winterfest 2025’s Harry Potter collaboration. Insider Gaming reported a while ago that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite and Harry Potter collab was coming soon</a>.</p>



<p>The official Fortnite account has posted about the expected collab: “Unlock the Chocolate Frog Back Bling before it hops away AND get ready for customizable Hogwarts house-themed Outfits in the Shop later this month!</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Something magical is brewing…</p><p>Unlock the Chocolate Frog Back Bling before it hops away AND get ready for customizable Hogwarts house-themed Outfits in the Shop later this month! <a href="https://t.co/dxU8F0don5">pic.twitter.com/dxU8F0don5</a></p></div>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1999359954533462056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In addition to this, Shiina (through <a href="https://x.com/itsmeleaky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@itsmeleaky</a> &amp; <a href="https://x.com/blortzen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@blortzen</a>) has revealed a leaked Winter Hatsune Miku skin.</p>

<p>Along with a Harry Potter skin.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you thought this was all, well, be prepared to have your Muggle mind blown with the reveal of more skins and a broom!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, another leak from <a href="https://x.com/FinnLeakss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Finn | Fortnite Leaks &amp; News</a> suggests a ‘Yule Trooper Boss’ is coming to cause trouble.</p>

<figcaption>id Software has officially unionized.</figcaption>

<p>Producer Andrew Willis says unionization is "incredibly important" for developers "across the industry" in order to "push back on all the unilateral workplace changes" being imposed on workers by "industry executives".</p><p>Local 6215 president Ron Swaggerty (which, by the way, is an excellent name), meanwhile, says that id Software's native Texas is now a "force in building collective power" in the gaming industry, and that the union looks forward to negotiating a contract that "reflects the skill, creativity, and dedication" of the studio's workers.</p><p>This isn't the first time a studio at Microsoft has unionized, of course. id Software follows in the footsteps of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-overwatch-union" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c8571b8-a998-407f-adb5-66bec141aeba" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">developers at Blizzard</a>, Bethesda's parent company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenimax-qa-union-strike" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="09d99387-8c9a-4aef-8a3d-6226b7553603" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">ZeniMax</a>, and <em>Call of Duty </em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raven-software-activision-microsoft-labor-complaint" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e5cbcf28-95af-4834-91c2-6ea91eaef2c5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Raven Software</a>, to name but a few.</p><p>The topic of unionization is a particularly pertinent one at the moment, too; back in November, <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>developer Rockstar was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2fb963bf-6dd1-47b3-bfbd-3f16511b3076" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">accused of union-busting</a> after firing a number of employees who were involved in union activity.

<p>Workers in Rockstar's native UK are unionizing, too; <em>Disco Elysium </em>studio ZA/UM (although there's debate regarding exactly how much of the studio is still the <em>Disco Elysium </em>developer) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-zaum-union" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6f3e8ab4-4fcd-4a59-a200-ac197c4a274c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">formed the nation's first official gaming union</a> back in October.</p><p>Here's hoping efforts to unionize across the industry continue; after all, there's no better way for workers to get themselves a seat at the table and to hold meaningful conversations with management.

"This is a game made by adults for adults," is a line that features in a recent interview with Ryan Hill, creative strategist at CI Games, talking of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen-2">Lords of the Fallen 2</a> in tandem with its Geoff's Night of Pretending to Like Video Games gameplay reveal trailer. The reason this line comes up is because the upcoming sequel is a violent one, one that hopes to be bloodier and gorier than its predecessor, to the point that you can, if you like, chop off any limb you can see in the game.

"When we asked our community just how far we should push the gore in the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a>, the answer was loud and unanimous: 'go all in'," Hill told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-limb-can-be-removed-lords-of-the-fallen-ii-publisher-discusses-dismemberment-lore-and-learnings-for-the-sequel-the-game-awards-2025-ign">IGN</a> in said interview.

"Soulslikes thrive on challenge, and that rush you get when defeating an enemy is unlike anything else. Enhancing that moment with a dynamic dismemberment system takes the satisfaction to another level - instead of enemies simply ragdolling to the floor, players can literally tear them apart."
</p><p>
Hill also made sure to clarify that again, yes, "every limb can be removed." You can see some of that in the gameplay trailer up above, and yeah, that sure does look like some limb slicing, though how that affects moment to moment gameplay isn't immediately apparent just yet.

As a reminder Lords of the Fallen 2 is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ci-games-reveal-new-lords-of-the-fallen-sniper-ghost-warrior-and-a-major-new-action-rpg">follow-up to Lords of the Fallen</a> (2023), not Lords of the Fallen (2014), in case you lost track of which Lords of the Fallen came out when, and maybe where. The sequel is supposedly launching in 2026, but if I've learned anything in my time doing this work, it is that betting on dates is as clever as pissing in the wind.

            <guid>1381990</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Almost everyone has that one mysterious corner of the house where the internet simply refuses to cooperate. You step into that corner, suddenly your phone can’t load a webpage, your videos start buffering, downloads stall, and frustration sets in — especially if that dead zone happens to be somewhere you actually need reliable service, like the bathroom. We will not go back to reading the back of a shampoo bottle like they did in cave man times.</p>
<p>A Wi-Fi range extender is an easy and effective way to eliminate those annoying weak zones. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6367/">Right now, this Wi-Fi 7 one from TP-Link has been cut in price by 25%</a>. For a limited time, you can pick one up for just $90. It’s normally selling for $120, so you end up saving yourself both $30 and a lot of headaches of dealing with crap internet coverage.</p>
<p>With Wi-Fi 7 technology, you can enjoy incredibly fast download and upload speeds totaling up to 3.2 Gbps. That means smooth 8K streaming, lag-free online gaming, and a noticeably more responsive connection throughout your home. This TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 extender supports dual-band 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz signals, with the 2.4 GHz band delivering up to 688 Mbps and the 5 GHz band reaching up to 2,594 Mbps. Note that this particular model does not include support for a 6 GHz band. Also you’ll only reach these speeds if your router, modem, and plan with your internet provider reach those speeds as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6367/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Wi-Fi Coverage in Every Corner of Your Home</h2>
<p>This TPL-Link Wi-Fi 7 range extender can provide additional coverage in your home of up to nearly 2,400 square feet. Its two high-performance antennas work together to broaden and strengthen your wireless signal, helping it pass through walls and reach areas your router couldn’t reliably cover on its own. The extender also boosts your network’s device capacity, allowing you to connect as many as 64 additional devices at once. That means more room for your smartphones, smart TVs, streaming sticks, Alexa Echo units, security cameras, smart bulbs, and all the other connected gadgets you rely on every day.</p>
<p>The range extender employs smart adaptive roaming. This means you’re devices will automatically connect to whichever is the strongest signal in your home. So if you have your main router on the first floor, and then the TP-Link range extender is upstairs, your phone can shift between the two when you go up and down the stairs, moving throughout your home with no extra effort from you.</p>



<p>If you’re home is already working on a mesh network, great news. The TP-Link ranger extender is EasyMesh-compatible. It can work in unison with other EasyMesh-compatible routers or nodes to keep increasing the Wi-Fi coverage of your property.</p>
<p>With the right range extender, you can finally enjoy strong, stable Wi-Fi in every corner of your home.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6367/"> And now that the TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 range extender is on sale for 25% off, now’s a great time to upgrade.</a></p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/epic-celebrates-the-end-of-the-apple-tax-after-appeals-court-win-in-ios-payments-case/</link>
            <guid>1381987</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Back in April, District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/fortnite-will-return-to-ios-after-court-slams-apples-obvious-cover-up/">delivered a scathing judgment</a> finding that Apple was in “willful violation” of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/injunction-apple-must-open-up-app-store-payments-in-90-days/">her 2021 injunction</a> intended to open up iOS App Store payments. That contempt of court finding has now been almost entirely upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, a development that Epic Games’ Tim Sweeney tells Ars he hopes will “do a lot of good for developers and start to really change the App Store situation worldwide, I think.”</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/US-Court-of-Appeals-for-the-Ninth-Circuit-December-11-.pdf">The ruling</a>, signed by a panel of three appellate court judges, affirmed that Apple’s initial attempts to charge a 27 percent fee to iOS developers using outside payment options “had a prohibitive effect, in violation of the injunction.” Similarly, Apple’s restrictions on how those outside links had to be designed were overly broad; the appeals court suggests that Apple can only ensure that internal and external payment options are presented in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>The appeals court also agreed that Apple acted in “bad faith” by refusing to comply with the injunction, rejecting viable, compliant alternatives in internal discussions. And the appeals court was also not convinced by Apple’s process-focused arguments, saying the district court properly evaluated materials Apple argued were protected by attorney-client privilege.</p>
<p>While the district court barred Apple from charging <em>any</em> fees for payments made outside of its App Store, the appeals court now suggests that Apple should still be able to charge a “reasonable fee” based on its “actual costs to ensure user security and privacy.” It will be up to Apple and the district court to determine what that kind of “reasonable fee” should look like going forward.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters Thursday night, though, Epic founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said he believes those should be “super super minor fees,” on the order of “tens or hundreds of dollars” every time an iOS app update goes through Apple for review. That should be more than enough to compensate the employees reviewing the apps to make sure outside payment links are not scams and lead to a system of “normal fees for normal businesses that sell normal things to normal customers,” Sweeney said.</p>

                <p>Fortnite's latest collab is with Kim Kardashian, and in a new interview, the megastar discussed how the partnership came to be, how good she is at Fortnite, and how closely she worked with Epic to bring her vision to life.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a69700805/kim-kardashian-fortnite-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elle Magazine</a>, Kardashian said she is a "decent" Fortnite player. "I wouldn't say I'm great, but I wouldn't say I'm horrible," she said. She added that her son, Saint, is "definitely better than I am."</p><p>"But, you know, he doesn't teach me all of his tricks," she said.</p><p>As for how she came to know Fortnite, Kardashian said her brother introduced her to the game years ago. And while she does play Fortnite, she only does so "moderately" because she believes things should be enjoyed "in moderation."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1t45vRyCs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EE1t45vRyCs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Kardashian also confirmed that she worked closely alongside Epic Games on the collab, saying she spent an hour each night--from 10 to 11 PM--talking with Epic to "perfect everything" and ensure that "everything looked as realistic as possible."</p><p>Also in the interview, Kardashian said Fortnite is an "iconic" game and she is happy to join the ranks of high-profile people and brands that have come to the game over the years. "Just to have seen all of the previous characters and how cute they look, I was really excited to have my own character," she said.</p><p>Kardashian previously worked with Glu Mobile on the popular mobile game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-kim-kardashians-mobile-game-is-really-popular/1100-6434875/" data-ref-id="1100-6434875">Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</a>, but it closed down in early 2024 after about a decade of operation. "I love the gaming space," she said in the interview with Elle.</p><p>One of the emotes for Kardashian in Fortnite is called "Slurp the Internet," and it's a reference to her famous "Break the Internet" shoot for Paper Magazine years ago. In that photo, she has a champagne glass on her butt, but in Fortnite, the champagne glass is on her foot. This is "because it could just fit better and look better," she said. Her other emote is called "Diamond Drop," and it's a reference to how she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnJ7butR77g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped a diamond earring in the ocean in Bora Bora while filming Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>. She said she was "brutalized" over the mishap, and is now having some fun with it.</p><p>"You lose your diamonds in the ocean, and a little boat appears. You're just sitting, crying wherever you're at in the game. We got pretty creative with our emotes," she said.</p><p>Additionally, one of her weapons is a purse, and it's modeled after the one she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U26-nQ-1AdA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smacked Khloé Kardashian with</a>, and it even features the "same movement that I hit her with," she said.</p><p>Kardashian arrives in Fortnite on December 13.

                <p>The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has shot back at Rockstar Games regarding the firing of 30+ staffers, saying that the company's latest statement is "littered with falsehoods and disinformation."</p><p>IWGB released a statement clarifying its take on Rockstar Games' justification for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">terminating the 30+ UK and international employees</a> in October 2025. Parent company Take-Two Interactive explained that the GTA developer fired those workers for "gross misconduct, and for no other reason." More specifically, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-insists-gta-6-devs-were-fired-for-leaks-not-unionizing/1100-6536894/" data-ref-id="1100-6536894">Rockstar Games told GameSpot</a> that those developers were let go for discussing "specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles" and other "confidential information" in a public forum. IWGB took issue with that, telling GameSpot that the characterization is inaccurate.</p><p>"Rockstar's latest statement is littered with falsehoods and disinformation--they have given multiple, conflicting reasons to explain why the workers were fired, as if attempting to reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals," the union said in an emailed statement. "Once again, they have chosen to mischaracterise workers speaking about their working conditions in a private forum as 'leaking information.' It is hard to understand this statement as anything but a desperate attempt to deflect from the global scrutiny they have come under over the last month. From the UK Prime Minister in the House of Commons, to the game developers across the world erupting in protest--all eyes are on Rockstar and their lawless attack on the people who make them their billions."</p><p>The situation has intensified since bursting in October 2025. Protests were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/07/uk-union-accuses-gta-maker-rockstar-games-of-firing-employees-attempting-to-organise" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">formed outside Rockstar North's office</a> in Edinburgh. Over 200 Rockstar Games developers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-200-rockstar-devs-sign-letter-demanding-fired-staff-be-reinstated/1100-6536181/" data-ref-id="1100-6536181">signed a letter</a> demanding that those ousted workers be reinstated. Even the UK's Prime Minister said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/united-kingdoms-ministers-will-look-into-rockstars-dev-firings-says-prime-minister/1100-6536840/" data-ref-id="1100-6536840">they will keep pressure on Rockstar Games</a> regarding the incident. All eyes are truly on this matter, as Rockstar Games and IWGB debate back and forth over how and why those developers were terminated and what sould be done about the situation.</p><p>In other union news, Doom developer id Software has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-dev-id-software-forms-a-wall-to-wall-union/1100-6536938/" data-ref-id="1100-6536938">formed a "wall-to-wall" union</a> to protect its 165-person, Texas-based studio against AI while delivering better benefits. Microsoft has recognized that union.</p>
