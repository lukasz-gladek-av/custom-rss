            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/darktide-ps5-review-warhammer-40k/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The wait for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> on PS5 was made a little more bearable for 40K fans earlier this year with the release of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a>. Saber Interactive’s surprise sequel to the 2011 hack n’ slash/shooter hybrid has achieved phenomenal success, and is certainly a tough act to follow.</p>
<p>However, Darktide is a markedly different kind of game, hailing from the same school of shooter as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> and indeed developer Fatshark’s flagship title, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-end-times-vermintide">Warhammer: Vermintide</a>. No doubt seeing how popular their co-op action series has grown, the Swedish studio applied a similar template to Game Workshop’s gritty sci-fi universe.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - PlayStation &amp; Grim Protocols Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MqQH6IJgpSA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For the most part, it’s a great fit. Darktide delves deep into the dark underbelly of 40K, far away from the warring Space Marines and their xenos rivals, instead focusing on the spreading corruption of Chaos within the Hive City of Tertium. Here, hiding within a labyrinth of habitat zones, factories, and pleasure districts, sedition manifests in the form of mutant cults who have turned their backs on the Emperor, seeking salvation instead from dark and ancient deities.</p>
<p>One major difference between Darktide and Vermintide is the shift away from named playable heroes. Instead, you create your own avatar, choosing from one of four classes that each have their own distinct weapon loadouts and abilities though all are equally capable in combat. As you’d expect, the hulking Ogryn is a bullet sponge who excels in taunting foes and pulling aggro away from squishier squadmates such as the magic-wielding Psykers. Although Darktide gives you the tools to customise your own grimdark misfit, this isn’t to say they’re devoid of any character. In fact, there’s plenty to be gleaned about the 40K universe from the banter, barbs, and exchanges between heroes as they go about their Chaos-thumping crusade.</p>


<p>We won’t do a complete retread of our original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/19/warhammer-40000-darktide-review/">Darktide review</a>, though what we praised about the game at launch still rings true. There’s an immense amount of joy to be had shooting and pummelling huge waves of enemies as you steadily push along each gauntlet-like stage, completing objectives. On the lowest rung of the difficulty ladder it can be presented as mindless fun though there’s plenty of challenge to be had, pressing even the most coordinated of strike teams to work together.</p>
<p>One common critique of Darktide is also still true. Repetition is pretty much baked into the core experience, encouraging players to rerun stages over and over, gradually dialling up the difficulty while earning experience points, as well as new weapons and abilities. This is a game about perfecting your ideal loadout rather than seeing a concise narrative unfold from beginning to end. Thanks to various updates and major content drops – including the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/02/cry-havoc-let-loose-the-grim-protocols-of-warhammer-40000-darktide/">Grim Protocols</a> – Darktide gives players much more to see and do while expanding the previously limited character progression system.</p>

<p>Through two years of toil and improvements, PlayStation fans get to experience Warhammer 40,000: Darktide at its very best complete with system-specific features such as DualSense haptics and a PS5 Pro performance boost. Online crossplay is another big boon, allowing you to matchmake with Xbox and PC players (something that was disappointingly absent from Vermintide 2). Speaking of which, Fatshark’s Skaven-stomping sequel is now long in the tooth and tail yet remains an ongoing success story within the blighted realm of live service video games – one that Darktide is looking to emulate.</p>
<p>Die hard fans have already managed to wring plenty of value from the game so far and there’s plenty of room to expand, though we doubt Fatshark will want to fragment its matchmaking pool by introducing premium maps. Having launched on all platforms, we’re eager to see what’s next as we go into 2025 and beyond, whether it’s new playable classes, enemies, and endgame modes.</p>

		<p><strong>Update 11AM 09/12</strong> – It looks like itch.io is back online, hopefully for good.</p>
<p><em>The original story follows.</em></p>


<hr>
<p>Popular indie game marketplace itch.io has been taken offline, the company blaming “bogus phishing reports” submitted AI brand protection used by Funko. Yeah. The plastic toys company…</p>
<p>Taking to <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866017758040993829">social media</a>, the company explains:</p>
<p>I kid you not, itch.io has been taken down by [Funko] because they use some trash “AI Powered” Brand Protection Software called [BrandShield] that created some bogus Phishing report to our registrar, iwantmyname, who ignored our response and just disabled the domain. […]
</p><p>Also, for transparency, we *did* take the disputed page down as soon as we got the notice because it’s not worth fighting stuff like that. Regardless, our registrar’s automated system likely kicked to disable the domain since no one read our confirmation of removal.</p>

<p>This is potentially a major headache for all the developers who rely on the platform. While itch.io is often a compliment to hosting and selling games on Steam in particular, it also has other opportunities that Steam doesn’t necessarily accommodate – it can host game jams, it’s great for prototyping and it’s DRM free.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is able to be resolved quickly, though itch.io say they will try to get a new domain if downtime lasts longer than 8 hours.</p>
<p>We’re probably going to wait this one out. We considered putting up a new domain but there are implications with third party services that make it not a trivial swap. In the meantime, if you know how to tweak your hosts file use: 45.33.107.166</p>
<p>It’s a situation that highlights the flaws of both “AI powered” automation and online copyright claims, which can often be used indiscriminately or extra-judiciously by large companies to take down things they don’t like, whether they have an actual case or not. Adding AI to the mix without human hands as a check and balance doesn’t exactly help the situation…</p>

Well shatter my Infinity Stones. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-hero-shooter-marvel-rivals-off-to-heroic-start-on-steam">Marvel Rivals' supercharged start</a> has now seen an astonishing 10 million players assemble over the game's opening weekend. 
</p>
<p>
A free-to-play six-on-six team shooter from Chinese giant NetEase, Marvel Rivals launched last Friday for PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, on PlayStation 5 and on Xbox Series X/S. 
</p>
<p>
As of midnight last night, NetEase <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851">announced</a> that 10 million players had joined in across the game's various platforms. Excelsior!

Marvel Rivals' roster of current and upcoming characters includes Marvel Cinematic Universe stalwarts such as Iron Man, Hulk, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Wolverine and Groot, along with other fan favourites such as Iron Fist, Cloak and Dagger and, of course, Squirrel Girl.

<p>
As for how it plays, well, Marvel Rivals has been compared to Blizzard's hero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Indeed, over the weekend, Blizzard's former boss - the ever-chatty Mike Ybarra - suggested Marvel Rivals was as much of an Overwatch copycat as the widely-discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-also-coming-to-ps5-of-all-platforms">Horizon Zero Dawn clone Light of Motiram</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-blizzard-boss-blasts-marvel-rivals-similarity-to-overwatch">Ybarra also seemed to suggest Marvel Rivals had copied Overwatch's character of Widowmaker</a> for Black Widow. The character - played by Scarlett Johansson in the MCU - was created by Marvel legend Stan Lee in 1964.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/michel-ancel-explains-what-went-wrong-with-beyond-good-evil-2-and-wild/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Video game designer Michel Ancel is primarily known for his work on Rayman, Beyond Good &amp; Evil, and Rabbids, although he also became infamous for two big failed projects attached to his name: Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 and WiLD.</p>
<p>Ancel <a href="https://wccftech.com/michel-ancel-retires-from-the-industry-wild-and-beyond-good-and-evil-2-development-to-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retired</a> from the games industry in September 2020, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-development-disarray-michel-ancel-toxic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegations of toxic management</a>. Since then, he's been busy with something entirely different: an ecological project for the preservation of nature. However, French website <a href="https://www.superpouvoir.com/entretien-avec-michel-ancel-le-createur-de-rayman-et-beyond-good-evil-se-confie-sur-sa-nouvelle-vie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superpouvoir</a> (which tipped us about the article) managed to score an interview with him to discuss the aforementioned unsuccessful game projects.</p>
<p>When it comes to Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, Michel Ancel cited issues with the other key figures in the studio at Ubisoft Montpellier. Apparently, they couldn't agree on a singular vision for the game.</p>
<p><em>On BGE2, there were too many problems between managers. The artistic director wanted to redo everything constantly, the game director wanted to make a game of generated dungeons and I dreamed of a space adventure. We simply could not agree and the game director took the project in other directions.</em></p>
<p><em>In this type of situation, teams find themselves tossed around and don't even know who's in charge and making decisions. The producer is supposed to sort things out, but that didn't happen. Yves Guillemot even had to go down to Montpellier to get things back on track, but that wasn't enough and the game director continued in his stubbornness. When I read in Libé that I was the one directing the game and asking for changes, I thought I was going to choke. BGE2 is the game on which I don't think I've ever questioned a decision. I'd be happy to discuss this topic with any potential detractors.</em></p>
<p><em>In the end, all this is a matter of passionate managers who did not get along. I believe that for some time now, these people have been thanked and the project has found a certain balance with new managers. These management concerns are of course very damaging for the teams. All this shows that indeed, it is not simple: a lot of egos and a lot of issues with clearly improvable human management.</em></p>
<p><em>There is a huge difference between developing a BGE2 that requires new technology and a project with known tech and gameplay. I believe that for a long time, the complexity of such a project was beyond many people at Ubisoft… and also in the press that did not hesitate to take shortcuts to sell paper at the time of the Parisian affairs.</em></p>
<p><em>There was not a single big bad guy but a sum of key concerns, unresolved at the level of the managers, of which I was one. I have my share of responsibility, and I should have defended the project better, been more present and more conciliatory with the collaborators.</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Michel Ancel had also founded his own studio, Wild Sheep, which was working on the PlayStation exclusive <a href="http://wccftech.com/ancel-working-hard-ps4-exclusive-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WiLD</a>, a survival game set in a procedurally generated Neolithic world. It was announced at Gamescom 2014 and shown once again at Paris Games Week 2015, but then the studio went silent for a long time. The development reportedly continued after Ancel retired, but a few months ago, creative director Steven ter Heide <a href="https://x.com/StevenTerHeide1/status/1818716603942400382?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the project is no longer being actively worked on.</p>
<p>In the interview, Ancel explained why this project also had what he described as a 'very unfortunate fate':</p>
<p><em>In 2018, we had a very nice playable version, but we took time to upgrade the game on PS5, which slowed down production. On the Sony side, there were big management changes and the game was stopped. Ubisoft offered to take it back, and shortly after, Sony decided to take it back by even offering to double the budgets! Unfortunately, the contracts with Ubisoft were well advanced and we refused Sony's proposal. What a shame!</em></p>
<p><em>It was during this period that I had my burnout and, unfortunately, the game fell into the hands of the Ubisoft editorial department in Paris, itself in full chaos. I was no longer there to defend the game, which was literally crushed by people from this department who asked for all sorts of changes without really playing the game. A real scandal. After two years of wandering, the game was abandoned on the pretext that it no longer corresponded to the initial game... You have to understand that at this time, the editorial department was in full explosion following the internal affairs surrounding Tommy François, who was also in charge of WiLD.</em></p>
<p>Michel Ancel also revealed that he doesn't really have much time to play anymore. He did not completely shut down the door to a return to the industry, although he clarified the context would have to be 'optimal'.</p>

            <p>The only sound that greets you upon booting up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eclipsium">Eclipsium</a> is a loudly throbbing heart. As one must when encountering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> media, the game and I immediately enter a spiritual staring contest, each of us knowing the<em> real</em> game here was it trying to freak me out. "It’s fine", I decided. "It’s just a heart! I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of". Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. "If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon."</p>
<p>So starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2419670/Eclipsium/">demo if you’re curious</a> and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me. Well.</p>

<p>The first thing I really honed in on with Eclipsium is its use of the first person perspective, and specifically the hands. Your right hand is permanently held out, palm facing forward, as if to clamber through darkness or prepare to bop a potentially aggressive dog on the nose with the heel. Your fingers move slightly as you look about, and there’s an extra layer of unnerving presence in the hand posture being very similar to the one I use for my ergonomic mouse. One idle animation has you briefly flex it into the claw. It all contributes one of the most effective and unique horror game tricks I’ve seen in a hot minute. There’s an utter vulnerability to at once being reminded your character has a physical body, and is also completely lacking a shotgun.</p><p>You start the game in a cabin, and as you explore, your hand will automatically stretch out at interactable objects. A globe. The shrieking plant. A key. The cabin is lit warmly in warped orange hues, and utterly depressing classical music plays. I unlock the door, step out into the woods, and turn around to ascertain the dimensions of the cabin. It is now dark, the music has stopped, and all the furnishings are gone. You’re trying to horror me up, aren’t you, Eclipsium? You’re trying to rustle my shirt buttons, and it’s absolutely working.</p>

<p>The midnight woods are lit by a bright red blood sky, and I get lost quite quickly, finding a strange mushroom in the woods that makes my vision go even more fuzzy than it already was. As is customary, I stare at my hands for a bit until the effects fade. The woods eventually offer up their greatest bounty: an axe, which I use to chop down a tree to make a bridge across a ravine. This breaks the axe. As I cross the tree, I think back to all the good times I had with the axe. A truly wonderful four seconds, it was. Now I am axe-less, and the woods are very threatening.</p>
<p>I will not tell what lay in the cave I found at the end of that path, but I will say that Eclipsium’s atmosphere is so thick and frightening you could cut it with, well, a deceptively sturdy axe. Here are some solid oak Steam facts:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Explore over a dozen vivid and surreal environments</li>
<li>Multiple carefully crafted full-motion video cutscenes</li>
<li>Intuitive and atmospheric puzzles</li>
<li>Painstakingly created hand animations</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>They did not lie about the hand animations, I’ll tell you that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>“Hang on a sec. Haven’t I seen this exact genre of little guy before?” was my reaction upon encountering the yellow-eyed, hat-shrouded mage of isometric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> Oolo. Some quick internet sleuthing turned up <a href="https://wintesm.tumblr.com/post/120149267193/an-old-2013-ish-hexafusion-of-vivi-from-final">this lovely bit of art</a> featuring <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>’s Vivi, Journey’s Traveller, and He-Man’s Orko. It’s a great feeling to begin your week identifying an archetype of diminutive magician, and I hope it becomes a regular occurrence. Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2819920/OOLO/">this link</a> to it’s free demo.</p>
<p>(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way? I tend to alternate. It’s obviously redundant but I feel writing ‘free’ gives it a certain gravitas. Free tax rebate. Free sunrise. Free oxygen. It makes things sound <em>better</em>.)</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Oolo is, I gather, the name of your purple wizard. The Steam page promises a sort of homage to isometric adventures of yore, and this moony yore-gazing is immediately apparent in a couple of nice ways. Firstly, the goal of the demo is to find a glowy green trinket named the ‘earth key’. Love that. Love not needing to worry about absent love ones or societal threats and just setting out to find a bloody lovely shiny key.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/oolo-2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Riddle Master Productions</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The second is the music, starting with a few plaintive key plucks before growing into some rushy, synthy brass that evokes two dudes with opposite vocal ranges shouting the word ‘adventure!’ at you really fast in either ear, layered over with some hobbity strings. Adventure it is!</p><p>The music gets ever lovelier as you start to explore, ambling your way through one isometric room at a time. You hop around, with a deeply satisfying thud when you fall off high ledges, and solve a few jumping puzzles. These feel a little tricky with the viewpoint, but the game lets you tilt rooms and switch between movement control schemes for precision. Soon, you collect a pair of gauntlets that let you push blocks. It’s all very classic Zelda in its flourishes, with hints of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> through the multiple paths and ever-expanding map.</p>
<p>I manage to die after falling on to some spikes after a bit, upon which the game informs me that “the world flame” has burnt out. Nothing’s ever simple is it? I knew it couldn’t just be a key! Still, world-saving labour or not, I’m quite smitten by Oolo, which is clearly a labour of love. Here are some touted features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Explore a vast world with over 400 interconnected rooms!</li>
<li>Venture through dark forests, subterranean crypts, deadly swamps, and more.</li>
<li>Find new artifacts that change the way you move and interact with the world.</li>
<li>Move blocks, ride enemies, and jump your way to exciting new areas.</li>
<li>Non-violent fun for the entire family!</li>
<li>Scour the land for the six elemental keys that will unlock the portal to the World Flame.</li>
<li>Secret areas and hidden powers await the heartiest adventurers.</li>
<li>Discover memories of keepers who rekindled the flame in generations past to give you hints for your journey!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I would argue that Oolo falling on those spikes <em>suggests</em> violence, but only if you think about too hard. Otherwise, a fine entry in the pantheon of yellow-eyed conjurers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/royal-ravens-on-top-following-first-week-of-the-cdl-2025-season.1055466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/royal-ravens-on-top-cdl-2025-season/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The first week of the CDL 2025 season has wrapped and it’s the Carolina Royal Ravens that sit atop the standings. With a record of 2 – 0 and a win/loss of 6 – 2, the Royal Ravens outpaced the other eleven teams in the CDL this past weekend. First, the team handed a smackdown to Team Falcons, and that was followed up with an unexpected win over LAG M8.</p>



<p>The power players are getting well-established quite early on this year, with LAT, Rokkr, and Toronto Ultra all bursting out of the gate without a single loss this week.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-miserable-elsewhere">Miserable Elsewhere</h2>



<p>Uncharacteristically, Atlanta FaZe sits near the bottom of the CDL standings after the opening weekend of play. The squad failed to secure a point, being beaten down by both LAT and Toronto Ultra. The LAT match was a burner, though – almost every round (except the opening Hardpoint, oof) went down to the wire.</p>



<p>Cloud9, Vegas Falcons, and LAG M8 all also failed to secure any CDL points, with C9 NY putting up the worst record – just one single map won out of seven played, tieing the squad with Team Falcons, which many predict will be the worst-performing org this season.</p>



<p>Out of the twelve teams in the CDL 2025 season, the ones to watch have been made clear.</p>



<p>LAT’s combination of Scrap, HyDra, Envoy, and Ghosty is a nasty one. Scrap and HyDra are running wild slaying out (props to HyDra’s 40-bomb), while Ghosty’s IGL role and Envoy’s veteran support bolsters the squad immeasurably. It could be LAT’s year, and it’s well deserved, given how much Nadeshot has poured into the organisation this time around.</p>



<p>Ultra had a great weekend, too. They dealt a massive blow to Atlanta FaZe and followed that up by taking Surge down a peg. The Canadian side made some major changes heading into the new season, picking up Beans and JoeDeceives to flesh out the EU-dominant roster that includes long-timers Insight and CleanX.</p>



<p>This was a fantastic weekend of play all round, and a few technical blips didn’t do too much to mar the entertainment. It’s no big secret that viewership could have been better, but co-streams and watch parties will undoubtedly do bits for the CDL this year.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later.1055448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>MachineGames has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/509566179781640981" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the first update for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which technically launches today even though early access actually started last Friday for pre-order customers who purchased the Premium Edition.</p>
<p>This patch's highlight is undoubtedly the addition of full-blown path tracing, which was missing from the review build, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as I noted in my article</a>. Now, owners of NVIDIA RTX graphics cards can activate the computationally expensive (the developers recommend at least 12GB of VRAM) yet visually impressive mode.</p>
<p>YouTuber Tyrian has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmeGdJD4_w4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> the first video comparison to demonstrate the graphics improvements enabled by path tracing in the game. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle supports ray traced sun shadows, ray traced reflections, and ray traced indirect illumination, all of which can now be toggled in the graphics settings. After turning everything on, the improvement is easily noticeable. However, the performance hit is just as stark, with Tyrian's RTX 4080 graphics card having its frame rate cut in half (or even lower) when path tracing is enabled.</p>
<p>Still, it should be manageable for the RTX 4080 by setting DLSS Super Resolution to Performance and activating the obligatory DLSS Frame Generation. Of course, the top-class RTX 4090 remains the best choice for anyone who wants to go all-in with path tracing - at least until its successor, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-blackwell-gb202-gpu-flagship-geforce-rtx-5090-to-measure-around-744mm2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX 5090</a>, launches next month.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Path Tracing ON vs OFF! RTX 4080 4K DLSS" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AmeGdJD4_w4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Indiana Jones and the Great Circle update also fixes a number of bugs, as you'd expect for any first post-launch patch nowadays, including a bug I had reported to the developers during the review process (HDR and DLSS sometimes produced a moiré effect when enabled together). Moreover, MachineGames is also thinking about AMD users. They promised that FidelityFX Super Resolution would be integrated into the game in a future update. There is still a known issue that the developers pointed out to the community. Sometimes, when starting the game with DLSS enabled, the game will run slower than intended. When this happens, until a final fix is released, you should switch from DLSS to TAA and then back to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is available now on PC and Xbox Series S|X, and Game Pass subscribers can access it without any additional cost. The game will&nbsp;<span>also be&nbsp;released next Spring for PlayStation 5</span>. It's certainly worth keeping an eye out for PS5 users, as I mentioned in my review:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>

			<p>Sony's move to make a series of "Grand Theft Auto" entries as exclusive PlayStation titles was apparently influenced by the release of Microsoft's Xbox, reveals former PlayStation EU President.</p>
<p>Well, Rockstar's GTA series being exclusive to PlayStation wasn't just an unplanned move. According to an interview with Chris Deering (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/stories-from-30-years-of-playstation">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>), a former PlayStation official, it is revealed that the franchise was purposefully limited to Sony's game consoles in an attempt to steer off interest in the upcoming "Xbox" release at that time. Deering says that folks at PlayStation were apparently "worried" about Microsoft's console, and the idea of making the Grand Theft Auto franchise exclusive popped up "randomly".</p>
<p><em>We were worried when we saw Xbox coming. We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields, like Sky TV with sports. Just as Christmas was approaching when Xbox would launch, a few of us went out to our favourite third-party publishers and developers, and we asked them, 'How would you like a special deal if you keep your next generation game on PlayStation exclusive for a two-year period?'</em></p>
<p><em>And one of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn't clear that Grand Theft Auto 3 was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top down game. It was very lucky for us. And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid. Those deals aren't uncommon in industries with platforms. Including today with things like social media</em></p>
<p>So, the Sony x Take-Two partnership was driven by Microsoft's Xbox release, and it won't be wrong to say that this decision has been pivotal for the success of Sony's past consoles and the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Ultimately, the collaboration was a win-win for both parties, and whether this move managed to overshadow the Xbox release is now a thing of the past.</p>
<p>For Grand Theft Auto 6, exclusivity for PlayStation is certainly out of the equation for now since the franchise is expected to follow a <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-version-release-not-mentioned-by-rockstar-consoles-2025/">similar release strategy</a> to what they did with GTA 5. That means consoles first, then other platforms such as PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-new-all-time-high-user-count/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Steam has once again proven that PC gaming is on the up, securing a new all-time high peak user count and notching up 39,205,447 concurrent players. This record came during a busy weekend that saw the successful launches of Marvel Rivals and Path of Exile II in early access, among others.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>Steam has gone from strength to strength in recent years, seeing a sharp increase in user activity during the COVID-19 pandemic and never really slowing down since. The data revealed in charts on SteamDB tell the story from the last twenty years:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The ‘A’ flag on the chart is the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic. This event saw millions of gamers worldwide locked down by their respective governments, and more than ever before turned to gaming and content creation as a way of occupying their time – and perhaps making a little money.</p>



<p>That of course warranted a massive growth in the number of PC players around the world.</p>



<p>This weekend, the popular PC platform hit almost 40 million concurrent users – a staggering number by all accounts. Since 2024 kicked off, Steam has been soaring, but some games understandably contribute to that success much more than others.</p>



<p>For example, Counter-Strike 2 maintains a regular 24-hour peak of around 1.5 million users, with PUBG and Dota 2 coming in behind with around 700,000 players. This weekend, Marvel Rivals hit a peak of almost 500,000 players, and Path of Exile II, which is in early access, stormed the charts and racked up 578,000 concurrent users.</p>



<p>It’s worth highlighting that the number displayed is <strong>peak concurrent users</strong>. That doesn’t mean they’re actively playing a game, they’re just <strong>online </strong>on Steam. At the time that the 39 million mark was hit, just over 12 million users were playing games.</p>



<p>Are you one of the 40 million concurrent users enjoying Steam right now? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>On December 6, Grand Theft Hamlet was released across the UK and Ireland in select theatres, and it’s coming to streaming platforms next year. This zany representation of Shakespeare’s work was planned, performed, and recorded entirely in GTA Online by Pinny Grylls and Sam Crane, and it’s making a wealth of impressions on critics worldwide.</p>



<p>In recent weeks, the ‘documentary’ has won awards at film festivals everywhere, including SXSW, Vancouver, and Philadelphia, and it scooped a prize and several nominations at the British Independent Film Awards.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-yes-it-s-real">Yes, It’s Real</h2>



<p>When I say ‘Grand Theft Hamlet’, that’s what I mean. It’s a story showcasing the telling of Shakespeare’s Hamlet <strong>in </strong>Grand Theft Auto Online.</p>



<p>The idea was concocted by Sam Crane during the COVID-induced lockdown in the United Kingdom in 2021, and he roped in Mark Oosterveen to star alongside him. Pinny Grylls was eventually brought in to direct the documentary, which is proving to be a rip-roaring success with critics and viewers.</p>



<p>The recently released theatrical trailer gives you an indication of the origins of the project:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="GRAND THEFT HAMLET  | UK theatrical trailer | IN CINEMAS FRIDAY 6TH DECEMBER from TULL STORIES" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLpGIHjwhNE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Most of the documentary is spent unveiling the trials and tribulations of the team making their way towards the ultimate performance, which unravels at the end of the 90-minute flick.</p>



<p>The reviews speak for themselves. In <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/grand-theft-hamlet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Empire</a>, Grand Theft Hamlet was dubbed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘…a riotously funny, unexpectedly poignant ode to gaming, Shakespeare, the indestructible nature of art, and the benefits of befriending bazooka wielding extraterrestrials.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://theface.com/culture/grand-theft-auto-gta-hamlet-film-mubi-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Face</a>, Grylls explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that it’s also important to think about the fact that&nbsp;<em>GTA Hamlet</em>&nbsp;is not really just a&nbsp;film of the play. It’s a&nbsp;story about this crazy adventure to try and put on this play which seems impossible. It’s a&nbsp;kind of comedy adventure story and it was edited to be really, really entertaining and fun, like the big eighties blockbuster movies Sam and I&nbsp;grew up watching, like&nbsp;<em>Back to the Future.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>This isn’t the first time a video game has been used as a platform for a production like this – but it’s certainly the most impactful occurrence. </p>



<p>For instance, the ‘Wasteland Theatre Company’ in Bethesda’s Fallout 76 pieced together and staged a performance of Shakespeare’s works in the post-apocalyptic MMORPG a year or two ago.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is taking the gaming world by storm, and NetEase just revealed that the hero shooter hit 10 million players in just <strong>three days</strong>. It’s aided by the fact it’s a free-to-play, multi-platform title, but it <strong>also helps </strong>that Marvel Rivals is a solid game that stands as a real competitor to games like Overwatch and Deadlock.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ignite-the-battle">Ignite the Battle</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, the NetEase team revealed:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Marvel Rivals offers a breathtaking experience with an unparalleled roster of Marvel-based heroes. From Wolverine to Moon Knight, and from Iron Fist to Thor, players are finding their main and enjoying every second of Marvel Rivals, which is set to challenge the hero shooter paradigm held by the likes of Overwatch for many years.</p>



<p>On Sunday evening, Marvel Rivals <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launch-performance-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secured a new all-time high</a> on some platforms, including Steam. On PC, Marvel Rivals hit 480,990 peak concurrent users, putting it above the likes of Fallout 4, Helldivers 2, and Grand Theft Auto 5. The volume of users trying to get into the game has presented some server issues in various regions, but it’s nothing that has marred the overall launch of the game.</p>



<p>The game has also carved out a sizeable piece of the global streaming estate, netting a peak viewer count of 278,000 users on Twitch and sitting in the platform’s top ten categories by viewers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bandai Namco’s Failed ‘Blue Protocol’ is Back But Under a New Name and Studio]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blue-protocol-return-new-name-studio/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bandai-namco%E2%80%99s-failed-%E2%80%98blue-protocol%E2%80%99-is-back-but-under-a-new-name-and-studio.1055412/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/blue-protocol-return-new-name-studio/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In August, Bandai Namco and Amazon Games confirmed the cancellation of Blue Protocol, which failed to surface in Western markets after flopping in Japan. This ‘anime MMO’ is being taken offline forever in January after having been in development since <strong>2015</strong>.</p>



<p>It seems that’s not the end of the road for Blue Protocol, though.</p>



<p>Recently, a Chinese studio named Shanghai Bokura Technology – a Tencent subsidiary – revealed a game called Star Resonance, a PC and mobile-based MMORPG that’s looking like a second outing for Blue Protocol.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-for-the-better">Back for the Better</h2>



<p>A recent report published by <a href="https://simulationdaily.com/news/blue-protocol-star-resonance-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simulation Daily</a> explained that Blue Protocol’s licensure was provided by Bandai Namco to Tencent’s Shanghai Bokura. The new game, named Star Resonance, is deeply reminiscent of Blue Protocol, the cancelled and failed MMORPG.</p>



<p>Sure enough, I managed to dredge up <a href="https://www.bokura.com.cn/news/3b747306-41d1-419c-b137-2a341bd3c80e/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a> published by Shanghai Bokura several months ago that confirmed a collaboration between itself and the Bandai Namco team that originally worked on Blue Protocol.</p>



<p>The press release mentioned Star Resonance (which wasn’t named back then) is ‘based on the world view’ of Blue Protocol but is a completely different game to the one that was released in Japan. </p>



<p>With that being said, the trailer certainly showcases something as close to Blue Protocol as you could hope to get:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Resonance ACGN style MMO-ARPG based on the Blue Protocol IP" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ee2wT-3n3TU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Here’s a snippet from that press release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“PROJECT SKY BLUE” is a project team jointly formed by Bandai Namco Online Inc. and Bandai Namco Studios Inc., aiming to create a new entertainment IP that can move the world, and is responsible for the planning and development of its content. With the online action role-playing game “Blue Law” as one of the core contents, various developments are being planned.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many prospective fans were disappointed by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blue-protocol-shut-down-bandai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of Blue Protocol</a>. Perhaps Bokura’s Star Resonance can fill that gap that was created in their lives.</p>

The Elite Series 2's superb weighting, incredibly solid build and high-quality components make it feel like a controller that's worth its $180 asking price. It's an absolute steal at $124. Numerous third-party brands have tried to outshine the Elite Series 2 in recent years, and although there have been a few controllers that have come close, all of the solid wireless alternatives cost either the same price or higher.

To their credit, each controller has at least one feature that is arguably better than the Elite Series 2. The Victrix Pro BFG is a modular controller, so you can swap the thumbsticks to be be offset or aligned. It also comes with a six-button fight pad module. The Wolverine V3 Pro, meanwhile, has excellent microswitch face buttons, and two extra bumpers in addition to four back triggers. It also has Hall Effect sticks, which is the main aspect of controller technology where the Elite Series 2 shows its age.</p><p>That said, Razer's Wolverine V3 Pro costs $200, and the Victrix Pro BFG is normally $180. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Remappable-Customizable-Console/dp/B0CQ3NL4QG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Victrix Pro BFG for Xbox is actually on sale for the first time</a> right now.

<p>It’s all stations go in the streaming world today as Ludwig announces a return to Twitch after a three-year platform hiatus <strong>and </strong>Adin Ross reveals he’s stepping down from Kick.com ‘indefinitely’. These bombshell announcements left the content creation community reeling, but Ross’ revelation was much more impactful than Ludwig’s tidbit.</p>



<p>Multiple streamers have returned to Twitch in recent weeks, particularly as exclusivity deals with YouTube dry up and expire.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ludwig-and-ross-back-on-twitch">Ludwig and Ross Back on Twitch</h2>



<p>Adin Ross has an obstacle to overcome before he makes it back to Twitch, and that’s his permanent ban from the popular streaming platform. The controversial creator has cleaned up his act in recent months, but will it be enough to sway the Twitch leadership team and earn him a prestigious spot back on the site?</p>



<p>In a post on Twitter, Adin Ross revealed his split from Kick.com:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I will be making a full video on why I am leaving Kick indefinitely. I am stepping down officially and will be going into detail about this this week. I will tell you all everything.</p>



<p>With that being said, I am going to fully focus on being reinstated on Twitch. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsewhere, Ludwig, one of the world’s most popular streamers, revealed <a href="https://x.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1865882864652546356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a video on social media</a> that after three years of YouTube exclusivity, he’s back on Twitch. Recently, Ludwig scooped the Best Streamed Event award at The Streamer Awards, and he’s still got  more lined up for the future.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see Ludwig back on Twitch? Would you rather see Adin Ross remain on Kick.com? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The retailer no longer discloses whether you are getting a North American release or an imported game. All Nintendo Switch games are region-free, and every game in the list above is playable in English. That said, this is important to consider for games with DLC, such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet. If you do not get a North American version and want the DLC, you will need to purchase that content from the eShop matching your game. So if you get a UK game, you need to download DLC from the UK eShop, which requires making a separate Nintendo account. Not many games in the list above--or Nintendo games in general--have DLC, but this is worth keeping in mind.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4411880-4411613-nintendoswitchgameswootdeals.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411880" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4411880-4411613-nintendoswitchgameswootdeals.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411880"></a><figcaption>Nintendo Switch games box art</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4411880-4411613-nintendoswitchgameswootdeals.png"></figure><p>A trio of Mario platformers have received big discounts: <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsuper-mario-odyssey-2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwoot-has-over-40-nintendo-switch-game-deals-including-many-of-the-best-exclusives-and-rare-finds%2F1100-6528302%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Odyssey</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fnew-super-mario-bros-u-deluxe&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwoot-has-over-40-nintendo-switch-game-deals-including-many-of-the-best-exclusives-and-rare-finds%2F1100-6528302%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">New Super Mario Bros.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-og-has-up-to-90-bots-per-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following the highly successful launch and return of Fortnite OG, it has been claimed that some matches can have up to 90 bots in a single game.</p>



<p>That’s according to reputable Fortnite data miners and leakers such as <a href="https://x.com/osirion_gg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">osirion_gg</a>, who’s claimed that Fortnite OG lobbies will have 90 bots per match in low skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) lobbies. Low SBMM lobbies are essentially players who are not good at the game, so they need to be matched with similarly skilled players, or in this case, a huge amount of bots, to make them feel like they are doing well when playing.</p>



<p>According to leakers, the move was made because of the influx of skilled players returning to Fortnite because of Fortnite OG, which likely led to lower-skilled players not having fun and not playing. The same leaker also said that in high SBMM lobbies, there are only ten bots and 90 real players. </p>



<p>Following the leaks, several videos of players that appear to be low-skilled bots have <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1865513248457474262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">surfaced online</a>. </p>



<p>SBMM has become a huge discussion in recent years, with players arguing that it makes them less inclined to continue playing multiplayer games. On the flip side, Activision, who has implemented a stronger SBMM system in Call of Duty in recent years argues that it has seen an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-reveal-sbmm-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improvement in player retention because of it</a>. </p>



<p>Epic Games is yet to officially comment on the addition of bots and skill based matchmaking in Fortnite, but if there is an official announcement, we’ll be sure to update this article.</p>

			<p>If you're getting stuck into<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2677660/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the latest game by MachineGames</a>, you'll know that there is a ton of exploration to do in Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. It can be pretty overwhelming. However, there are certain things within the game that will make your life a little bit more manageable so that you don't find yourself getting overwhelmed trying to find every little item in the game. There are side quests that you can undertake if you want more of the story, but of course, they aren't necessary. Here are some top tips for playing Indiana Jones and The Great Circle.</p>
<h2>Top Tips For Playing Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>While you can find guides for pretty much everything in this game online already, you may feel that you want to solve things by yourself with minimal handholding. Luckily, the game has a built-in hint mode, which is achieved by using the camera you are given. When there is something to take a picture of, a camera icon will appear. This is a sign that you can take pictures of certain items, people, or landmarks in this area, which will provide information on what you want to do next. Additionally, they provide Adventure Points, which are key to using Skill Books.</p>
<p>Skill Books are also a great way to give you an advantage in Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, as they can upgrade your abilities. They can also upgrade Indiana's strength, health, and stamina. You can get Adventure Points in a variety of ways by exploring and collecting them, such as taking pictures and finding collectibles in the game. By doing so and being thorough in your exploration, you can rack up Adventure Points pretty fast.</p>
<p>Stealth is a huge part of Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Of course, you don't have to be stealthy in the game if you don't want to, as you can choose to fight your way through the enemies. However, if you do choose to be stealthy, it will show up on your HUD that there is a little eye that shows you're being watched. This is helpful if you're trying to be sneaky around specific areas and trying to loot everything you see depending on what clearance you have in the area (depending on the costume Indiana Jones is wearing). This eyeball icon doesn't necessarily mean that they are suspicious of you, but they will be if you steal from them directly in front of them.</p>
<p>Looting food and bandages is key to your survival in Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, regardless of what difficulty you play it. You never know when you're going to take damage or when things will get dicey. Food can help replenish stamina, which you may need if you're in a lot of difficult fights. Additionally, you can get your hands on Medicine Bottles to exchange with an NPC in Vatican City. Using this item will provide you with a permanent boost to your health and stamina.</p>
<p>These are some tips that will help you survive and explore Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Good luck out there, adventurer.

			<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim may have celebrated its thirteenth birthday around a month ago, but its modding community is more alive than ever. The last few days brought several exciting developments, starting with the long-awaited release of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Shaders 1.0</a>, a plugin that introduces advanced graphics features to the open world roleplaying game.</p>
<p>Historically, Boris Vorontsov's ENB has been the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-visuals-natural-culminated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go-to graphics enhancement framework for Skyrim</a> and many other PC games. However, at least when it comes to Bethesda's best-selling game, CS 1.0 has arguably surpassed it with the latest release, mainly due to the introduction of PBR - also known as Physically Based Rendering.</p>
<p>PBR was a major advancement that was introduced to new games in late 2015 and early 2016. One of the first titles to adopt physically based rendering <a href="http://wccftech.com/the-division-features-pbr-dynamic-gi-realtime-bounce-lighting-completely-dynamic-light-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was Ubisoft Massive's Tom Clancy The Division</a>. With PBR, materials are realistically influenced by lighting, making for a dramatic visual improvement.</p>
<p>While main Community Shaders modder doodlum (the same author of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-light-mod-greatly-improves-visuals-starfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light Limit Fix mod</a> that backported Starfield's clustered shading to introduce limitless dynamic light sources to Skyrim) worked on this major new release, some of the most active texture modders began adapting their work to the new graphics feature. I'm told by <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/RealExist?gameId=1704" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RealExist</a>, one of the texture modders who already produced several PBR mods, that it was not easy as the game's lighting did not work well at first with PBR (it was not built for it, after all). The modders also had to come up with a mesh patcher (<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ParallaxGen</a>) that enables meshes to be compatible with the new PBR textures.</p>
<p>As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words, so you can take a look at the first examples below, with several mods already available on Nexus and others to follow.</p>

<p>There's more. CS 1.0 also supports <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135817" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terrain Shadows</a>, a new feature developed by modder ProfJack that enables rough terrain shadows with infinite distance, both in Skyrim and on the game's world map. You can check out a preview in the impressive GIF above.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, Community Shaders 1.0 supports <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127557" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light Placer</a>, the latest framework developed by powerofthree, the author of several key frameworks for Skyrim (Spell Perk Item Distributor, Base Object Swapper, and Keyword Item Distributor, to name a few). With Light Placer, modders can manually add real light bulbs with unlimited range and brightness to actors and objects. These lights can flicker, affect detection, change color based on the time of day, and so on. Light Placer has great potential to improve lighting by allowing modders to add many more lights across the whole game (and its many content mods, potentially) as they see fit.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 is far from the final release of Community Shaders. The authors are already testing new big features such as Screen Space Global Illumination (SSGI), Skylighting, Cloud Shadows, proper support for HDR displays, built-in Frame Generation, Capsule Shadows/Ambient Occlusion, sharper textures when using anti-aliasing, and more.</p>
<p>I plan to delve deeper into the realm of Skyrim modding soon. Stay tuned for a much more detailed article on everything that's going on in this vibrant mod scene.</p>
