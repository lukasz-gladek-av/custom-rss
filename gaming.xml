While some deals will be available to everyone during the four-day sales event (July 8-11), many of the best offers will be exclusive to Prime members.

<figure><a title="Final Fantasy IX Calendar" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d0cb0e6398e67/final-fantasy-ix-calendar.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Yuya Ishihata / Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_ix">Final Fantasy IX</a> is about to celebrate its 25th anniversary; the incredible turn-based RPG launched on the PS1 on 7th July 2000, and in 2025, Square Enix has been busy building up to the event with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/final-fantasy-9-remake-hopes-rise-as-square-enix-teases-anniversary-projects">frequent new merch drops</a> (much to the chagrin of this author and her wallet).</p>
<p>Over the past few days, the developer has upped the ante and has been sharing brand new artwork. We're up to three already, and it's causing fans online to go into overdrive.</p>
<p>Let's start with the newest piece, which dropped overnight. This beautiful piece sees Zidane, Garnet, and the rest of the party overlooking the Iifa Tree, an important location in the game's story. Drawn by the game's character designer Toshiyuki Itahana, you can see the two planets in the sky and the Silver Dragon in the distance.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lvqsnp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Oh, and we'd be remiss not to point out Vivi and Steiner at the bottom there. So. Cute.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy IX Iifa Tree" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0debb91419928/final-fantasy-ix-iifa-tree.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1940214096668115057">Toshiyuki Itahana / Square Enix</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Responses to the piece are... not-so-measured, as you'd expect. A Final Fantasy IX remake has been rumoured for an extremely long time, and what better time to reveal it than the game's 25th anniversary? Especially when you're giving it <em>this</em> much promotion.</p>
<p>So some fans suspect that these art pieces are actually <a href="https://x.com/TinaClarkwinkel/status/1940003601377620033">concept art</a> for that reimagining. Others just think it's a <a href="https://x.com/YunalesckaGames/status/1940281425472950462">tantalising tease</a> for some kind of announcement. We've even got <a href="https://x.com/FtMonkey/status/1940226445835657532">box art mock-ups</a>. Whatever it is, Final Fantasy IX fans are going a little nuts.</p>
<p>There are two more stunning pieces to look at, anyway. First up is a calendar illustration featuring the main cast on the stage of the M.S. Prima Vista, the Tantalus' theatre ship. This one's done by Yuya Ishihata, who's created a ton of beautiful artwork for the <a href="http://www.square-enix-shop.com/jp/ff-tcg//card/illust_YuyaIshihata.html">Final Fantasy X Magic the Gathering collab</a>.</p>
<p>The usual suspects, including Beatrix, are all here, but if you look in the crowd, you can also see members of the Theatre Troupe, the group of thieves Zidane is part of, there; Marcus, Blank, Cinna, Ruby, Baku, and Benero and Zenero.</p>

<p>Last and by no means least is another piece from character designer Itahana. This one shows the game's primary antagonist, Kuja, standing inside the Iifa Tree, next to his Silver Dragon.</p>
<p>It's oddly peaceful as Kuja looks out towards the sunlight, either waiting for the party towards the end of Disc 2 or perhaps just there to plot.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy IX Kuja" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9cc3ce1ac5887/final-fantasy-ix-kuja.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1939881904750395674">Toshiyuki Itahana / Square Enix</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, perhaps even more artwork will pop up over the next week. We should stress that there's no guarantee Square Enix will announce <em>anything</em> when 7th July rolls around, so don't be too disappointed if that happens. The Final Fantasy IX remake isn't official, and if it's real, it'll come when it comes.</p>
<p>After all, it's kind of fun just to see the game get a lot of love in the form of <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/final-fantasy-ix-just-got-a-picture-book-prequel-in-japan-featuring-the-games-best-character">picture book prequels</a>, vinyl releases, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/random-is-this-the-best-piece-of-final-fantasy-merch-ever">the most adorable mug you've ever seen</a>, right?</p>

<p>It's been 23 years since the first Battlefield game, and the video game industry is nearly unrecognizable to anyone who was immersed in it then. Many people who loved the games of that era have since become frustrated with where AAA (big budget) games have ended up.</p>
<p>Today, publisher EA is in full production on the next Battlefield title—but sources close to the project say it has faced culture clashes, ballooning budgets, and major disruptions that have left many team members fearful that parts of the game will not be finished to players' satisfaction in time for launch during EA's fiscal year.</p>
<p>They also say the company has made major structural and cultural changes to how Battlefield games are created to ensure it can release titles of unprecedented scope and scale. This is all to compete with incumbents like the Call of Duty games and <em>Fortnite</em>, even though no prior Battlefield has achieved anywhere close to that level of popular and commercial success.</p>
<p>I spoke with current and former EA employees who work or have recently worked directly on the game—they span multiple studios, disciplines, and seniority levels and all agreed to talk about the project on the condition of anonymity. Asked to address the reporting in this article, EA declined to comment.</p>
<p>According to these first-hand accounts, the changes have led to extraordinary stress and long hours. Every employee I spoke to across several studios either took exhaustion leave themselves or directly knew staffers who did. Two people who had worked on other AAA projects within EA or elsewhere in the industry said this project had more people burning out and needing to take leave than they'd ever seen before.</p>
<p>Each of the sources I spoke with shared sincere hopes that the game will still be a hit with players, pointing to its strong conceptual start and the talent, passion, and pedigree of its development team. Whatever the end result, the inside story of the game's development illuminates why the medium and the industry are in the state they're in today.</p>

<h2>The road to Glacier</h2>
<p>To understand exactly what's going on with the next Battlefield title—codenamed Glacier—we need to rewind a bit.</p>
<p>In the early 2010s, <em>Battlefield 3</em> and <em>Battlefield 4</em> expanded the franchise audience to more directly compete with Call of Duty, the heavy hitter at the time. Developed primarily by EA-owned, Sweden-based studio DICE, the Battlefield games mixed the franchise's promise of combined arms warfare and high player counts with Call of Duty's faster pace and greater platform accessibility.</p>
<p>This was a golden age for Battlefield. However, 2018's <em>Battlefield V</em> launched to a mixed reception, and EA began losing players' attention in an expanding industry.</p>

<p>Instead, the hot new online shooters were <em>Overwatch</em> (2016), <em>Fortnite</em> (2017), and a resurgent Call of Duty. <em>Fortnite</em> was driven by a popular new gameplay mode called Battle Royale, and while EA attempted a Battle Royale mode in <em>Battlefield V</em>, it didn't achieve the desired level of popularity.</p>
<p>After <em>V</em>, DICE worked on a Battlefield title that was positioned as a throwback to the glory days of <em>3</em> and <em>4</em>. That game would be called <em>Battlefield 2042</em> (after the future year in which it was set), and it would launch in 2021.</p>
<p>The launch of <em>Battlefield 2042</em> is where Glacier's development story begins. Simply put, the game was not fun enough, and <em>Battlefield 2042</em> launched as a dud. </p>

<h3>Don't repeat past mistakes</h3>
<p>Players were disappointed—but so were those who worked on <em>2042</em>. Sources tell me that prior to launch, <em>Battlefield 2042</em> "massively missed" its alpha target—a milestone by which most or all of the foundational features of the game are meant to be in place. Because of this, the game's final release would need to be delayed in order to deliver on the developers' intent (and on players' expectations).</p>
<p>"Realistically, they have to delay the game by at least six months to complete it. Now, they eventually only delayed it by, I think, four or five weeks, which from a development point of view means very little," said one person who worked closely with the project at the time.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>Developers at DICE had hoped for more time. Morale fell, but the team marched ahead to the game's lukewarm launch.</p>
<p>Ultimately, EA made back some ground with what the company calls "live operations"—additional content and updates in the months following launch—but the game never fulfilled its ambitions.</p>
<p>Plans were already underway for the next Battlefield game, so a postmortem was performed on <em>2042</em>. It concluded that the problems had been in execution, not vision. New processes were put into place so that issues could be identified earlier and milestones like the alpha wouldn't be missed.</p>
<p>To help achieve this, EA hired three industry luminaries to lead Glacier, all of them based in the United States.</p>
<h3>The franchise leadership dream team</h3>
<p>2021 saw EA <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-new-general-manager-ex-call-of-duty">bring on</a> Byron Beede as general manager for Battlefield; he had previously been general manager for both Call of Duty (including the Warzone Battle Royale) and the influential shooter <em>Destiny</em>. EA also hired Marcus Lehto—co-creator of <em>Halo</em>—as creative chief of a newly formed Seattle studio called Ridgeline Games, which would <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/ea-announces-new-battlefield-studio-ridgeline-games/">lead the development</a> of Glacier's single-player campaign.</p>
<p>Finally, there was Vince Zampella, one of the leaders of the team that initially created <em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;in 2003. He joined EA in 2010 to work on other franchises, but in 2021, EA <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814517/ea-battlefield-vince-zampella-apex-legends-respawn-boss-ceo-shakeup">announced</a> that Zampella would oversee Battlefield moving forward.</p>
<p>In the wake of these changes, some prominent members of DICE departed, including General Manager Oskar Gabrielson and Creative Director Lars Gustavsson, who had been known by the nickname "Mr. Battlefield." With this changing of the guard, EA was ready to place a bigger bet than ever on the next Battlefield title.</p>
<h2>100 million players</h2>
<p>While <em>2042</em> struggled, competitors <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> were posting astonishing player and revenue numbers, thanks in large part to the popularity of their Battle Royale modes.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>EA's executive leadership believed Battlefield had the potential to stand toe to toe with them, if the right calls were made and enough was invested.</p>
<p>A lofty player target was set for Glacier: 100 million players over a set period of time that included post-launch.</p>

<p>"Obviously, Battlefield has never achieved those numbers before," one EA employee told me. "It's important to understand that over about that same period, 2042 has only gotten 22 million," another said. Even 2016's <em>Battlefield 1</em>—the most successful game in the franchise by numbers—had achieved "maybe 30 million plus."</p>
<p>Of course, most previous Battlefield titles had been premium releases, with an up-front purchase cost and no free-to-play mode, whereas successful competitors like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em> made their Battle Royale modes freely available, monetizing users with in-game purchases and season passes that unlocked post-launch content.</p>
<p>It was thought that if Glacier did the same, it could achieve comparable numbers, so a free-to-play Battle Royale mode was made a core offering for the title, alongside a six-hour single-player campaign, traditional Battlefield multiplayer modes like Conquest and&nbsp; Rush, a new F2P mode called Gauntlet, and a community content mode called Portal.</p>

<h3>The most expensive Battlefield ever</h3>
<p>All this meant that Glacier would have a broader scope than its predecessors. Developers say it has the largest budget of any Battlefield title to date.</p>
<p>The project targeted a budget of more than $400 million back in early 2023, which was already more than was originally planned at the start.</p>
<p>However, major setbacks significantly disrupted production in 2023 (more on that in a moment) and hundreds of additional developers were brought onto Glacier from various EA-owned studios to get things back on track, significantly increasing the cost. Multiple team members with knowledge of the project's finances told me that the current projections are now well north of that $400 million amount.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<h3>Skepticism in the ranks</h3>
<p>Despite the big ambitions of the new leadership team and EA executives, "very few people" working in the studios believed the 100 million target was achievable, two sources told me. Many of those who had worked on Battlefield for a long time at DICE in Stockholm were particularly skeptical.</p>
<p>"Among the things that we are predicting is that we won't have to cannibalize anyone else's sales," one developer said. "That there's just such an appetite out there for shooters of this kind that we will just naturally be able to get the audience that we need."</p>
<p>Regarding the lofty player and revenue targets, one source said that "nothing in the market research or our quality deliverables indicates that we would be anywhere near that."</p>
<p>"I think people are surprised that they actually worked on a next Battlefield game and then increased the ambitions to what they are right now," said another.</p>
<p>In 2023, a significant disruption to the project put one game mode in jeopardy, foreshadowing a more troubled development than anyone initially imagined.</p>
<h2>Ridgeline implodes</h2>
<p>Battlefield games have a reputation for middling single-player campaigns, and <em>Battlefield 2042</em> didn't include one at all. But part of this big bet on Glacier was the idea of offering the complete package, so Ridgeline Games scaled up while working on a campaign EA hoped would keep Battlefield competitive with Call of Duty, which usually has included a single-player campaign in its releases.</p>
<p>The studio worked on the campaign for about two years while it was also scaling and hiring talent to catch up to established studios within the Battlefield family.</p>
<p>It didn't work out. In February of 2024, Ridgeline was shuttered, Halo luminary Marcus Lehto left the company, and the rest of the studios were left to pick up the pieces. When a certain review came up not long before the studio was shuttered, Glacier's top leadership were dissatisfied with the progress they were seeing, and the call was made.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Sources in EA teams outside Ridgeline told me that there weren't proper check-ins and internal reviews on the progress, obscuring the true state of the project until the fateful review.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those closer to Ridgeline described a situation in which the team couldn't possibly complete its objectives, as it was expected to hire and scale up from zero while also meeting the same milestones as established studios with resources already in place. "They kept reallocating funds—essentially staff months—out of our budget," one person told me. "And, you know, we're sitting there trying to adapt to doing more with less."</p>

      </figure>

<p>After the shuttering of Ridgeline, ownership of single-player shifted to three other EA studios: Criterion, DICE, and Motive. But those teams had a difficult road ahead, as "there was essentially nothing left that Ridgeline had spent two years working on that they could pick up on and build, so they had to redo essentially everything from scratch within the same constraints of when the game had to release."</p>
<p>Single-player was two years behind. As of late spring, it was the only game mode that had failed to reach alpha, well over a year after the initial overall alpha target for the project.</p>
<p>Multiple sources said its implosion was symptomatic of some broader cultural and process problems that affected the rest of the project, too.</p>

<h2>Culture shock</h2>
<p>Speaking with people who have worked or currently work at DICE in Sweden, the tension between some at that studio and the new, US-based leadership team was obvious—and to a degree, that's expected.</p>
<p>DICE had "the pride of having started Battlefield and owned that IP," but now the studio was just "supporting it for American leadership," said one person who worked there. Further, "there's a lot of distrust and disbelief... when it comes to just operating toward numbers that very few people believe in apart from the leadership."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But the tensions appear to go deeper than that. Two other major factors were at play: scaling pains as the scope of the project expanded and differences in cultural values between US leadership and the workers in Europe.</p>
<p>"DICE being originally a Swedish studio, they are a bit more humble. They want to build the best game, and they want to achieve the greatest in terms of the game experience," one developer told me. "Of course, when you're operated by EA, you have to set financial expectations in order to be as profitable as possible."</p>
<p>That tension wasn't new. But before <em>2042</em> failed to meet expectations, DICE Stockholm employees say they were given more leeway to set the vision for the game, as well as greater influence on timeline and targets.</p>
<p>Some EU-based team members were vocally dismayed at how top-down directives from far-flung offices, along with the US company's emphasis on quarterly profits, have affected Glacier's development far more than with previous Battlefield titles.</p>
<p>This came up less in talking to US-based staff, but everyone I spoke with on both continents agreed on one thing: Growing pains accompanied the transition from a production environment where one studio leads and others offer support to a new setup with <em>four</em> primary studios—plus outside support from all over EA—and all of it helmed by LA-based leadership.</p>
<p>EA is not alone in adopting this approach; it's also used by competitor Activision-Blizzard on the Call of Duty franchise (though it's worth noting that a big hit like Epic Games' <em>Fortnite</em> has a very different structure).</p>
<p>Whereas publishers like EA and Activision-Blizzard used to house several studios, each of which worked on its own AAA game, they now increasingly make bigger bets on singular games-as-a-service offerings, with several of their studios working in tandem on a single project.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>"Development of games has changed so much in the last 10 to 15 years," said one developer. The new arrangement excites investors and shareholders, who can imagine returns from the next big unicorn release, but it can be a less creatively fulfilling way to work, as directives come from the top down, and much time is spent on dealing with inter-studio process. Further, it amplifies the effects of failures, with a higher human cost to people working on projects that don't meet expectations.</p>
<p>It has also made the problems that affected <em>Battlefield 2042</em>'s development more difficult to avoid.</p>

<h2>Clearing the gates</h2>
<p>EA studios use a system of "gates" to set the pace of development. Projects have to meet certain criteria to pass each gate.</p>
<p>For gate one, teams must have a clear sense of what they want to make and some proof of concept showing that this vision is achievable.</p>
<p>As they approach gate two, they're building out and testing key technology, asking themselves if it can work at scale.</p>
<p>Gate three signifies full production. Glacier was expected to pass gate three in early 2023, but it was significantly delayed. When it did pass, some on the ground questioned whether it should have.</p>
<p>"I did not see robust budget, staff plan, feature list, risk planning, et cetera, as we left gate three," said one person. In the way EA usually works, these things would all be expected at this stage.</p>
<p>As the project approached gate three and then alpha, several people within the organization tried to communicate that the game wasn't on footing as firm as the top-level planning suggested. One person attributed this to the lack of a single source of truth within the organization. While developers tracked issues and progress in one tool, others (including project leadership) leaned on other sources of information that weren't as tied to on-the-ground reality when making decisions.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>A former employee with direct knowledge of production plans told me that as gate three approached, prototypes of some important game features were not ready, but since there wasn't time to complete proofs of concept, the decision was handed down to move ahead to production even though the normal prerequisites were not met.</p>
<p>"If you don't have those things fleshed out when you're leaving pre-pro[duction], you're just going to be playing catch-up the entire time you're in production," this source said.</p>
<p>In some cases, employees who flagged the problems believed they were being punished. Two EA employees each told me they found themselves cut out of meetings once they raised concerns like this.</p>
<p>Gate three was ultimately declared clear, and as of late May 2025, alpha was achieved for everything except the single-player campaign. But I'm told that this occurred with some tasks still un-estimated and many discrepancies remaining, leaving the door open to problems and compromises down the road.</p>
<h3>The consequences for players</h3>
<p>Because of these issues, the majority of the people I spoke with said they expect planned features or content to be cut before the game actually launches—which is normal, to a degree. But these common game development problems can contribute to other aspects of modern AAA gaming that many consumers find frustrating.</p>
<p>First off, making major decisions so late in the process can lead to huge day-one patches. Players of all types of AAA games often take to Reddit and social media to malign day-one patches as a frustrating annoyance for modern titles.</p>
<p><em>Battlefield 2042</em> had a sizable <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-2042-day-one-patch-0-2-1-fixes">day-one patch</a>. When multiplayer RPG <em>Anthem</em> (another big investment by EA) launched to negative reviews, that was partly because critics and others with pre-launch access were playing a build <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">that was weeks old</a>; a day-one patch significantly improved some aspects of the game, but that came after the negative press began to pour out.</p>

<p>Glacier's late arrival to Alpha and the teams' problems with estimating the status of features could lead to a similarly significant day-one patch. That's in part because EA has to deliver the work to external partners far in advance of the actual launch date.</p>
<p>"They have these external deadlines to do with the submissions into what EA calls 'first-party'—that's your PlayStation and Xbox submissions," one person explained. "They have to at least have builds ready that they can submit."</p>
<p>What ends up on the disc or what pre-loads from online marketplaces must be finalized long before the game's actual release date. When a project is far behind or prone to surprises in the final stretch, those last few weeks are where a lot of vital work happens, so big launch patches become a necessity.</p>
<p>These struggles over content often lead to another pet peeve of players: planned launch content being held until later. "There's a bit of project management within the Battlefield project that they can modify," a former senior EA employee who worked on the project explained. "They might push it into Season 1 or Season 2."</p>
<p>That way, players ultimately get the intended feature or content, but in some cases, they may end up paying more for it, as it ends up being part of a post-launch package like a battle pass.</p>
<p>These challenges are a natural extension of the fiscal-quarter-oriented planning that large publishers like EA adhere to. "The final timelines don't change. The final numbers don't change," said one source. "So there is an enormous amount of pressure."</p>

<h3>A campaign conundrum</h3>
<p>Single-player is also a problem. "Single-player in itself is massively late—it's the latest part of the game," I was told. "Without an enormous patch on day one or early access to the game, it's unrealistic that they're going to be able to release it to what they needed it to do."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>If the single-player mode is a linear, narrative campaign as originally planned, it may not be possible to delay missions or other content from the campaign to post-launch seasons.</p>
<p>"Single-player is secondary to multiplayer, so they will shift the priority to make sure that single-player meets some minimal expectations, however you want to measure that. But the multiplayer is the main focus," an EA employee said.</p>
<p>"They might have to cut a part of the single-player out in order for the game to release with a single-player [campaign] on it," they continued. "Or they would have to severely work through the summer and into the later part of this year and try to fix that."</p>
<p>That—and the potential for a disappointing product—is a cost for players, but there are costs for the developers who work on the game, too.</p>
<p>Because timelines must be kept, and not everything can be cut or moved post-launch, it falls on employees to make up the gap. As we've seen in countless similar reports about AAA video game development before, that sometimes means longer hours and heavier stress.</p>
<h2>AAA’s burnout problem</h2>
<p>More than two decades ago, the spouse of an EA employee famously wrote <a href="https://ea-spouse.livejournal.com/274.html?es=1">an open letter</a> to bring attention to the long hours and high stress developers there were facing.</p>
<p>Since then, some things have improved. People at all levels within EA are more conscious of the problems that were highlighted, and there have been efforts to mitigate some of them, like more comp time and mental health resources. However, many of those old problems linger in some form.</p>
<p>I heard several first-hand accounts of people working on Glacier who had to take stress or mental or exhaustion health leave, ranging from a couple of weeks to several months.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>"There's like—I would hesitate to count—but a large number compared to other projects I've been on who have taken mental exhaustion leave here. Some as short as two weeks to a month, some as long as eight months and nine," one staffer told me after saying they had taken some time themselves.</p>
<p>This was partly because of long hours that were required when working directly with studios in both the US and Europe—a symptom of the new, multi-studio structure.</p>
<p>"My day could start as early as 5:00 [am]," one person said. The first half of the day involved meetings with a studio in one part of the world while the second included meetings with a studio in another region. "Then my evenings would be spent doing my work because I'd be tied up juggling things all across the board and across time zones."</p>
<p>This sort of workload was not limited to a brief, planned period of focused work, the employees said. Long hours were particularly an issue for those working in or closely with Ridgeline, the studio initially tasked with making the game's single-player campaign.</p>
<p>From the beginning, members of the Ridgeline team felt they were expected to deliver work at a similar level to that of established studios like DICE or Ripple Effect before they were even fully staffed.</p>
<p>"They've done it before," one person who was involved with Ridgeline said of DICE. "They're a well-oiled machine." But Ridgeline was "starting from zero" and was "expected to produce the same stuff."</p>
<p>Within just six months of the starting line, some developers at Ridgeline said they were already feeling burnt out.</p>
<p>In the wake of the EA Spouses event, EA developed resources for employees. But in at least some cases, they weren't much help.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>"I sought some, I guess, mental help inside of EA. From HR or within that organization of some sort, just to be able to express it—the difficulties that I experienced personally or from coworkers on the development team that had experienced this, you know, that had lived through that," said another employee. "And the nature of that is there's nobody to listen. They pretend to listen, but nobody ultimately listens. Very few changes are made on the back of it."</p>
<p>This person went on to say that "many people" had sought similar help and felt the same way, as far back as the post-launch period for <em>2042</em>&nbsp;and as recently as a few months ago.</p>

<h2>Finding solutions</h2>
<p>There have been a lot of stories like this about the games industry over the years, and it can feel relentlessly grim to keep reading them—especially when they're coming alongside frequent news of layoffs, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-05-01/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-of-workers">including at EA</a>. Problems are exposed, but solutions don't get as much attention.</p>
<p>In that spirit, let's wrap up by listening to what some in the industry have said about what doing things better could look like—with the admitted caveat that these proposals are still not always common practice in AAA development.</p>
<h3>“Build more slowly”</h3>
<p>When Swen Vincke—studio head for Larian Studios and game director for the runaway success <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>—accepted an award at the Game Developers Conference, he took his moment on stage to express frustration at publishers like EA.</p>
<p>"I've been fighting publishers my entire life, and I keep on seeing the same, same, same mistakes over and over and over," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-boss-blasts-publisher-greed-behind-layoffs">he said</a>. "It's always the quarterly profits. The only thing that matters are the numbers."</p>
<p>After the awards show, he <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1770834130852315517">took to X</a> to clarify his statements, saying, "This message was for those who try to double their revenue year after year. You don't have to do that. Build more slowly and make your aim improving the state of the art, not squeezing out the last drop."</p>

<p>In planning projects like Glacier, publicly traded companies often pursue huge wins—and there's even more pressure to do so if a competing company has already achieved big success with similar titles.</p>
<p>But going bigger isn't always the answer, and many in the industry believe the "one big game" strategy is increasingly nonviable.</p>
<h3>In this attention economy?</h3>
<p>There may not be enough player time or attention to go around, given the numerous games-as-a-service titles that are as large in scope as Call of Duty games or <em>Fortnite</em>. Despite the recent success of new entrant&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, there have been more big AAA live service shooter flops than wins in recent years.</p>
<p>Just last week, a data-based report by prominent games marketing newsletter GameDiscoverCo came to a prescient <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/which-genres-have-ruled-steam-a-new">realization</a>. "Genres like Arena Shooter, Battle Royale, and Hero Shooter look amazing from a revenue perspective. But there’s only 29 games in all of Steam’s history that have grossed &gt;$1m in those subgenres," wrote GameDiscoverCo's Simon Carless.</p>
<p>It gets worse. "Only <em>Naraka Bladepoint</em>, <em>Overwatch 2</em> &amp; <em>Marvel Rivals</em> have grossed &gt;$25m and launched since 2020 in those subgenres," Carless added. (It's important to clarify that he is just talking Steam numbers here, though.) That's a stark counterpoint to reports that <em>Call of Duty</em> has&nbsp;earned <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/06/08/call-duty-future-modern-warfare-2-warzone-2/">more than $30 billion in lifetime revenue. </a></p>
<p>Employees of game publishers and studios are deeply concerned about this. In a 2025 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results?utm_source=chatgpt.com">survey</a> of professional game developers, "one of the biggest issues mentioned was market oversaturation, with many developers noting how tough it is to break through and build a sustainable player base."</p>
<p>Despite those headwinds, publishers like EA are making big bets in well-established spaces rather than placing a variety of smaller bets in newer areas ripe for development. Some of the biggest recent multiplayer hits on Steam have come from smaller studios that used creative ideas, fresh genres, strong execution, and the luck (or foresight) of reaching the market at exactly the right time.</p>

<p>That might suggest that throwing huge teams and large budgets up against well-fortified competitors is an especially risky strategy—hence some of the anxiety from the EA developers I spoke with.</p>
<h3>Working smarter, not harder</h3>
<p>That anxiety has led to steadily growing unionization efforts across the industry. From <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/zenimax-qa-union-reaches-a-tentative-contract-agreement-with-microsoft-including-substantial-across-the-board-wage-increases-worker-protections-and-more/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">QA workers at Bethesda</a> to more wide-ranging unions <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/overwatch-2-team-union-blizzard-entertainment-microsoft">at Blizzard</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/following-layoffs-at-cd-projekt-red-staff-have-formed-a-union-for-polish-game-developers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">CD Projekt Red</a>, there's been more movement on this front in the past two or three years than there had been in decades beforehand.</p>
<p>Unionization isn't a cure-all, and it comes with its own set of new challenges—but it does have the potential to shift some of the conversations toward more sustainable practices, so that's another potential part of the solution.</p>
<p>Insomniac Games CEO Ted Price spoke authoritatively on sustainability and better work practices for the industry <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/insomniacs-ted-price-games-studios-must-break-the-habit-of-brute-forcing-through-problems#:~:text=Insomniac's%20Ted%20Price%3A%20Games%20studios,forcing%20through%20problems%20%7C%20GamesIndustry.biz">way back at</a> 2021's Develop:Brighton conference:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the default is to brute force the problem—in other words, to throw money or people at it, but that can actually cause more chaos and affect well-being, which goes against that balance. The harder and, in my opinion, more effective solution is to be more creative within constraints... In the stress of hectic production, we often feel we can't take our foot off the gas pedal—but that's often what it takes.</p></blockquote>
<p>That means publishers and studios should plan for problems and work from accurate data about where the team is at, but it also means having a willingness to give their people more time, provided the capital is available to do so.</p>
<p>Giving people what they need to do their jobs sounds like a simple solution to a complex problem, but it was at the heart of every conversation I had about Glacier.</p>
<p>Most EA developers—including leaders who are beholden to lofty targets—want to make a great game. "At the end of the day, they're all really good people and they work really hard and they really want to deliver a good product for their customer," one former EA developer assured me as we ended our call.</p>
<p>As for making the necessary shifts toward sustainability in the industry, "It's kind of in the best interest of making the best possible game for gamers," explained another. "I hope to God that they still achieve what they need to achieve within the timelines that they have, for the sake of Battlefield as a game to actually meet the expectations of the gamers and for people to maintain their jobs."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">There appears to be renewed enthusiasm for Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam after the recent release of Free Title Update 2. The action-adventure game saw a spike of 100,000 additional concurrent players on Valve's PC platform after the patch earlier this week.</p><p dir="ltr">On June 29, the peak concurrent player count for the day on Monster Hunter Wilds was 19,637 people, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2246340/charts/#1m" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>. When the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-monster-hunter-wilds-update-finally-addresses-poor-pc-performance/1100-6532814/">massive Free Title Update 2</a> landed June 30, the daily high hit 133,033 players, showing a reinvigorated playbase on PC--the game is also available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Capcom addressed issues with PC performance as part of the patch, as well as promising further optimizations in the future.</p>

            <p>Rare's fantasy adventure Everwild has reportedly been cancelled following layoffs at Xbox.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft began making layoffs across its gaming division today</a>, with staff at the likes of King and Zenimax reportedly affected. It now appears that Everwild is another casualty of these reductions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/">VGC</a> initially shared news of Everwild's alleged cancellation, and Eurogamer sources have since corroborated these reports. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyeysnjmk24">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> has additionally been told of the game's cancellation, citing those familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Everwild was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">revealed in late 2019</a>. At this time, Everwild was said to be the next "large" game from Rare, and one that would co-exist with the ongoing development of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>.</p>
<p>Everwild then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-new-everwild-trailer">surfaced again in 2020</a>, with a trailer showing groups of Eternals - beings with the gift "to sense and feel how magic flows through nature and connects every living thing" -  working together to heal a deer-like creature, and discovering a stag mural in some old ruins. </p>
<p>Since then, very little has been shared about Rare's game, although in February of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-rares-everwild-is-still-in-development-and-xbox-is-committed-to-giving-the-team-the-time-it-needs">Xbox head Phil Spencer assured the community the Everwild team was making progress</a>. "I was recently out at Rare. It's nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making," Spencer said at the time. "It has been [a while]. And we've been able to give those teams time in what they're doing which is good and still have a portfolio like we have.</p>
<p>"It's like a dream that Matt [Booty] and I have had for a long time, so it's finally good to be there. We can give those teams time."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Xbox for comment on Everwild's reported cancellation, and will update when we know more.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony’s Mark Cerny has revealed that “a drop-in replacement for the current PSSR” should be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> in 2026.</p>
<p>This will be part of the ongoing Project Amethyst partnership between AMD and Sony that began in 2023 and has seen the companies collaborate to improve their various temporal upscaling hardware. On the PlayStation side, that’s with the dedicated hardware for PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) on PS5 Pro, and on AMD’s side, the latest Radeon 9000 series GPUs now have hardware for FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution), which is a significant jump over the more general purpose FSR generations and widely seen as being much more competitive with Nvidia’s leading DLSS 4.</p>


<p>PSSR had a generally positive impact at release, but there were some notable issues with games like Silent Hill 2 having graphical glitching with PSSR added, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/21/darktide-space-marine-2-on-ps5-pro-a-tale-of-two-pssrs/">added unwanted noise in Darktide</a>. So what’s great to hear is this reaffirmation that Sony is able and willing to deliver software updates that make use of the silicon dedicated to PSSR, but also the pace and extent of this partnership with AMD, which will deliver benefits to both PlayStation and PC (and let’s be honest, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/xbox-and-amd-sign-a-new-multi-year-partnership-for-next-gen-gaming/">to Xbox as well</a>).</p>
<p>“This is not for proprietary technology,” <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-mark-cerny-explains-why-your-ps5-pro-is-getting-an-upgrade-in-2026">Cerny told Tom’s Guide</a>. “This is really trying to move the industry forward. Obviously we want to use these technologies on our consoles, but these technologies are available to any of AMD’s customers freely.”</p>
<p>Two examples of the collaboration are that Sony helped AMD have more demanding graphical scenes within their research, to better mimic real games, while AMD had Sony set up a QA team for vetting algorithmic improvements.&nbsp;This built momentum such that the algorithm that is now core to FSR 4 was created within around 9 months.</p>

<p>And here’s the best news for PS5 Pro owners:</p>
<p>“The algorithm they came up with could be implemented on current-generation hardware,” said Cerny. “So the co-developed algorithm has already been released by AMD as part of FSR 4 on PC. And we’re in the process of implementing it on PS5 and it will release next year on PS5 Pro.”</p>
<p>He contineud, “It’s not a cut-down [version] of the algorithm. It’s the full-fat version of the co-developed super resolution that we’ll be releasing on PS5 Pro.”</p>
<p>The tricky thing will be figuring out how to put this in the hands of developers. Will Sony be able to simply replace PSSR as it currently exists in games? Will it be down to developers to patch it in? Or will users have the ability to override a game’s PSSR, similar to FSR 4 overrides on PC?</p>
<p>Another element of Project Amethyst is the feedback loop of development for AMD’s graphics in general. Sony and Microsoft have previously collaborated with AMD to create the custom silicon within PlayStation and Xbox consoles, drawing upon the upcoming roadmap of CPU and GPU advancements to meet their demands and budgets. However, Cerny says that “Big chunks of RDNA 5, or whatever AMD ends up calling it, are coming out of engineering I am doing on the project. And again, this is coming out of trying to move things forward. There are no restrictions on the way any of it can be used.”</p>
<p>AMD has just released RDNA 4 GPUs in the form of the Radeon RX 9070 and 9060 cards. Already looking to the future, their next generation GPU will be called UDNA (not RDNA 5), with promises of another significant overhaul and step forward in their efforts to catch up to Nvidia’s dominance of upscaling and ray tracing techniques – ray reconstruction is a big new feature that significantly improves core details of ray-traced reflections and effects.</p>
<p>It’s also widely expected that UDNA will provide the basis for any new consoles released in late 2026 or 2027, with rumours that Xbox might try to get the jump on Sony.</p>

<p>Luke, Kimberly, and Jamie have all received their own amiibo, and we've managed to get our hands on the cover star himself.</p>
<p>As you can see from the photos below, Luke towers above Ryu, Ken, and Terry and feels more weighty and substantial.</p>

<figure><a title="Gallery: Street Fighter's Luke amiibo Is A Big Boy, And No Mistake 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56dca29547cf1/gallery-street-fighters-luke-amiibo-is-a-big-boy-and-no-mistake-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>It's not just his size which is a step up from other amiibo, however; like his fellow <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/where-to-buy-street-fighter-6-amiibo">Street Fighter 6 characters</a>, Luke unlocks special items in the game, such as unique music tracks, wallpapers and backgrounds (the latter being used with the in-game camera functionality).</p>
<p>Does this mean that Luke and company are worth the extra money? We'll let you decide on that score, but these larger figures do offer the potential for more detailed features.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<div><p>As new information regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft's mass layoffs</a> continues to trickle out online, the first reported project casualty appears to be Rare's next major title, Everwild, which <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyeysnjmk24">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/">VGC</a>, and others are now reporting has been cancelled as part of the cuts. </p><p>Everwild was first publicly announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-rare-new-ip-x019/">2019</a>, and has reportedly been in the works for the better part of a decade. Just months prior to this reported cancellation, Microsoft's chief executive officer of its gaming division, Phil Spencer, commented on Everwild, <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-is-making-good-progress-confirms-phil-spencer/">saying that it was "<em>making good progress</em>."</a> Now, it seems, we'll never know what that progress looked like, or get to see what Everwild would have become.</p><p>Which is unfortunate, though, that being said, its cancellation comes as less of a shock considering the reports regarding its development journey. It had previously been <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-obsidian-rpg-project-missouri-20220-everwild-real-mess/">described as a "<em>real mess</em>,"</a> due in part to the fact that when Everwild was revealed in 2019, Rare wasn't entirely sure what kind of game it was due to become. </p><p>The visuals featured in its reveal trailer and in media presented following the announcement always captivated players, but the question around what kind of game it was going to be was never entirely answered.</p></div>

</p></figure>



<div><p>Regardless, Rare is one of the industry's most iconic and respected studios for good reason. Whatever Everwild was going to become, players would have expected an incredible game, because that's what Rare is known for making.</p><p>Which only compounds the news of the game's cancellation, because it also means that Rare will lose some of its talented employees. Details around how many are being laid off remain unclear, as Microsoft is seemingly drip-feeding the news of just how many people have been impacted. According to reports, a total of 9,000 people across Microsoft are being laid off today.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Cygames has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another major milestone, around a year and a half after the game's initial release.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/881020/view/506206686159045888" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>has passed the two million sales mark, which means it's earned another million sales for itself since February last year.</p>

<p>That milestone was reached in around eleven days; it seems that sales have slowed pretty significantly since then, but two million is a very respectable number indeed for an action RPG based on what remains a relatively niche property.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/granblue-fantasy-relink-sales-2m-combat.jpg?itok=ZwZNWUZc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/granblue-fantasy-relink-sales-2m-combat.jpg?itok=uo-0beuh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>sales are doing very well for themselves, thank you very much.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em>, it's a third-person action RPG based on the mobile gacha game&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy</em>. Taking place in a land known as the Sky Realm, the game casts you as "the captain of a skyfaring crew", with whom you'll embark on adventures galore.</p>

<p>The game has had a long road to release; it was first revealed back in 2016 as a collaboration with PlatinumGames, but by 2019, the&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Wonderful 101&nbsp;</em>studio was no longer involved with the project.</p>

<p>Following that, it would spend a few more years in development before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-relink-gets-spectacular-new-trailer-release-in-2023-confirmed" rel="nofollow">slated for a 2023 release</a>, although it was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-opening-night-live-here-are-all-trailers-news-reveals" rel="nofollow">delayed to February 2024</a>. Thankfully, that's a date the action RPG did manage to make.</p>

<p><em>Relink&nbsp;</em>isn't the only&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>spinoff to grace PC and consoles, either. It's joined by the 2020 fighting game&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus</em>&nbsp;and its 2023 sequel&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em>, both of which pit characters from the world of&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>against one another in one-on-one bouts.</p>

            <p>Microsoft have cancelled Rare's wistful bucolic ramble <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a> as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">wider layoffs at the company this month</a>, according to a report. Microsoft themselves have yet to comment, but the news wouldn't be unexpected given that Everwild has been in development for around a decade, including its prototype phase, yet remains something of a mystery.</p><!--more-->
<p>The story comes from <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/">VGC</a>, who cite "people with knowledge of the project". The same sources claim that team members are likely to lose their jobs in the process.</p>
<p>Everwild was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-new-game-is-everwild-some-sort-of-fantasy-nature-y-thing">revealed back in 2019</a> as a verdant fantasy experience that seeks "new ways to play in a natural and magical world". It cast you as an "eternal" being communing with plants and animals by means of staff-wielding rites, and seemed devoid of video game staples like combat and progression.</p>
<p>Over the years we've been treated to more trailers and concept art, but Rare have never quite explained what players do in the game, possibly because they hadn't worked it out themselves. The developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rare-have-started-over-on-everwild-rumours-say">"restarted the project from scratch"</a> in 2021, according to rumours, following the departure of creative director Simon Woodroffe.</p>
<p>I myself liked the peacenik green-living stylings of Everwild's announcement trailer, and was intrigued rather than confused by Rare's elusiveness about tasks, goals and mechanics. Xbox boss wizard Phil Spencer was similarly positive when he <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/phil-spencer-provides-rare-update-on-missing-in-action-xbox-exclusive-everwild/">talked about the game earlier this year</a>, commenting "we've been able to give those teams time in what they're doing which is good and still have a portfolio like we have."</p>
<p>At the same time, Everwild has always felt like a hard sell within Microsoft, even given the relative success of the comparably playful and bloodshed-averse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>. Microsoft do not historically go in for this kind of hippy fairytale, to put it mildly. And when a game is in the works (in some form) for 10 years and still doesn't have a release date, a happy ending seems unlikely.</p>
<p>I'll mail Microsoft for comment. If you're employed at Rare, best of luck navigating all this.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft is making another round of sweeping layoffs across its businesses of around 4% of its worldwide employees, with Phil Spencer sending an internal memo which has immediately leaked publicly.</p>
<p>The memo has been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">reviewed and published by IGN</a>, who also had a source relay that Candy Crush developer King has been hit particularly hard, and that Bethesda’s London offices and marketing team are also affected.</p>


<p>In total, Microsoft is making layoffs of around 4%, per <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/">The Seattle Times</a>, or around 9,000 employees from the worldwide headcount of 228,000 as of June 2024. Individual teams and employees will be given specifics of what is happening over the coming days. This comes shortly after 6,000 employees were let go in May and June.</p>
<p>In Spencer’s memo, he said that “we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management”. He also acknowledges that this is at a time when Microsoft’s gaming business has a wider reach than ever before, he blows smoke up a future roadmap which has “never looked stronger”, but asserts that “The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously,” and that “a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities.”</p>
<p>This all sucks, and once again feels more callous than it really needs to be for a company that continues to be obscenely wealthy and profitable. We will have to wait and see the specifics of the job cuts, but our thoughts go to those affected.</p>

<p data-cy="paragraph">The silver lining is that Microsoft should be able to give supportive exit packages, including pay and healthcare coverage, while anyone being let go will have priority review for any open positions within Microsoft that they could apply for.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">The full message from Phil Spencer is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental — it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Phil</p></blockquote>

<figure><a title="Xbox Game Studios" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/afd3dfea7a4b5/xbox-game-studios.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Microsoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Microsoft has begun informing staff of a huge second wave of job cuts this year, and the layoffs are expected to hit over 9,000 employees.</p>
<p>In a report published by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, studios affected include King — the team behind Candy Crush — where around 200 staff (roughly 10%) are being laid off, and ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda. Staff have informed Schreier they weren't authorised to speak to the press.</p>
<p>Other US-based studios will be told of the cuts later today, and the cuts go beyond the gaming division. Many who are losing their jobs today only found out about the incoming cuts due to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division?srnd=undefined">a previous Bloomberg report</a>. These layoffs follow the 2,000 cuts made in January 2024, and the closure of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin in May 2024.</p>
<p>It's galling stuff, and it comes despite the fact that, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-laying-off-about-9000-employees-in-latest-round-of-cuts.html">CNBC</a>, " $26 billion in net income on $70 billion in revenue for the March quarter". As a result, it's reportedly one of the most profitable companies in the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKu_ZSYOos0cnYjMoZ4Emgzx0Wk4z-5LcUARMrLW2FCD-ZYxhyklcUDTygMIUSiLefK1-1OeNKSWM_l1u9MD9aYTQ_REJLnvOcWVKyoM2EgLGDenVhZTizdXJcASovGM9lfMplCFYMhblYNKLSoU7URjjmOlT3xcL_i9Ejt4b8TD">S&amp;P 500 index</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">IGN also reports</a> that Microsoft Gaming head Phil Spencer has been vague on the details, telling staff in a memo that organisational shifts and changes "will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days".</p>
<p>Below is Spencer's note in full, sent to staff and shared by IGN earlier today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Rare may also be part of the layoffs as the studio's upcoming action game <strong>Everwild</strong> — which was bound for Xbox and PC — has reportedly been cancelled as part of the cuts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">IGN</a> claim that MS have begun informing staff of the cuts today, June 2nd, with workers based in Europe seemingly the first to learn their fates.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division">Bloomberg</a> claim that Candy Crush developers King, acquired by Microsoft as part of the Activision Blizzard deal in 2023, are laying off 10% of their staff, which is "about 200 jobs". They also report that the European arm of Zenimax, Bethesda's parent company, are cutting staff, but there aren't any numbers to share as of this writing.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/">The Seattle Times</a>, Microsoft have said that as much as 4% of the company’s total employees, roughly 9,100 workers across all of its departments, could be affected by these layoffs.</p>
<p>While Microsoft have yet to comment on all this publicly, IGN have circulated an email from Xbox chief Phil Spencer to all of the staff in Microsoft's gaming division about today's layoffs. You can read it in full below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</p>
<p>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</p>
<p>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental — it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</p>
<p>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.</p></blockquote>
<p>This a breaking story, with more information likely to follow. We'll keep you posted.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I started testing headsets on my new Nintendo Switch 2, I dove in from a casual perspective seeking a pleasant experience with pals on GameChat while running some Knockout Tours in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. I’m not an audiophile, after all. I’m just a guy who enjoys an easy-to-use, comfy headset with generally good sound quality and solid battery life. I found a handful of such headsets that I’ve really enjoyed using on my Switch 2, and I’m here to tell you about them. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Note:</strong> Since the Switch 2 doesn’t allow mic input while using Bluetooth, every wireless headset on this list includes a USB dongle that allows for audio output <em>and</em> input. </p><h2 id="h34998"><a id="1"></a>Alienware Pro</h2><p>At $230, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-pro-wireless-gaming-headset/apd/520-bbkn/gaming-gaming-accessories&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-pro-wireless-gaming-headset/apd/520-bbkn/gaming-gaming-accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alienware Pro</a></span> is the most expensive headset I tested since the launch of the Switch 2, and I’d argue it’s (mostly) worth the asking price. Its exceptional ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) was miles above other headsets I tried. And it’s easily the most comfortable option in my current collection. Because of this, it’s been one of only two headsets I’ve used consistently since finishing my initial tests.</p><p>I found the Alienware Pro produces a somewhat muffled voice output, which is admittedly disappointing at this price point. But I’ve otherwise loved many of its other offerings, such as its sleek aesthetic, soft and cozy earpads, 70+ hour battery life, and detachable mic. The latter is especially nice, as it allows the Alienware Pro to function as attractive out-and-about headphones, too. </p><h2 id="h34999"><a id="2"></a>Razer BlackShark V2 Pro</h2><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-blackshark-v2-pro&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-blackshark-v2-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Razer BlackShark V2 Pro</a></span> is a $200 option that should appeal to competitive gamers. This award-winning headset is well-liked in the eSports community due to its excellent spatial audio and killer wideband mic that provides some of the clearest voice delivery I’ve ever heard from a headset. With the touch of a button, you can even select useful EQ presets, including a few created by pro players for specific games.</p><p>One of my favorite things about the BlackShark V2 Pro is its helicopter pilot-esque visual style, which gives it an understated vintage vibe that looks unique in an era of “gamery” devices. The fact that it’s so comfortable that I often forgot I was wearing it is also nice. If it only had noise canceling capabilities so I could drown out the sound of my cat summoning demons in the background while I’m getting my ass kicked in <em>Splatoon 3</em>, it’d be basically perfect.</p><h2 id="h35000"><a id="3"></a>Turtle Beach Stealth 700 (Gen 3)</h2><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/stealth-700-gen-3-headset&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/stealth-700-gen-3-headset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turtle Beach Stealth 700 (Gen 3)</a></span> mostly delivers on its $200 price tag thanks to stellar 60mm dual drivers that offer crisp audio, a cool flip-to-mute mic, phenomenal battery life (up to 80 hours), and sturdy build quality. Admittedly, the high clamp force of the headset occasionally caused minor discomfort after extensive use (4+ hours), but it was never so bad that I felt compelled to take it off. You really shouldn’t wear a headset that long without a break anyway.</p><p>But while the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 (Gen 3) isn’t necessarily the most <em>comfortable</em> headset I’ve used, one feature has kept me coming back: <strong>This bad boy sports two USB dongles out of the box so that you can swap between consoles (or PC) with the touch of a button.</strong> As someone who frequently jumps between PS5 and Switch 2, this is a godsend that keeps me from having to switch out headsets when doing so. Efficiency is king for lazy asses like me.</p><h2 id="h35001"><a id="4"></a>Razer Barracuda X Chroma</h2><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-barracuda-x-chroma&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-barracuda-x-chroma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Razer Barracuda X Chroma</a></span> sits at a cool $130, which places it in that sweet mid-range spot. And that seems about right for this aesthetically pleasing headset that does pretty much everything well without feeling like it needs to be particularly exceptional at any one thing. It provides great sound and mic quality, an ergonomic fit, and 65-70 hours of battery life that ensures you stay in the game and off the charger. It’s just a good all-arounder for the average user, and that’s a win in my book.</p><p>There’s also a nice selection of RGB customization on the Razer Barracuda X Chroma, though you probably won’t really get to see any of them since the headset is on your head, of course. I appreciate this neat touch for those with a penchant for some fun visual flair, even if it’s not my cup of tea. Just keep in mind that you’ll need to download a companion app to get all of this stuff up and running.</p><h2 id="h35002"><a id="5"></a>OXS Storm G2</h2><p>Landing just above the budget crowd and just below the mid-range selections is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://oxsaudio.com/products/oxs-storm-g2?srsltid=AfmBOooo8I9qExR8hLfoYqN8ydpI2S-QfXDEPPUEy0GyGDlwJE37znbh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://oxsaudio.com/products/oxs-storm-g2?srsltid=AfmBOooo8I9qExR8hLfoYqN8ydpI2S-QfXDEPPUEy0GyGDlwJE37znbh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OXS Storm G2</a></span>. And it’s a serviceable $80 headset that I found myself using quite a lot during the first week of owning my Switch 2. This is a good-looking set of cans with a solid sound profile, fairly decent mic quality, and a 40-hour battery life (20ish with RGB lighting turned on). And its lightweight design was so comfortable that I didn’t feel compelled to rip them off after my pals bounced out of GameChat for the night.</p><p>The cheap plastic build quality means you probably shouldn’t be tossing the headset around your game room or letting kids get too happy-go-lucky with it. But seeing as the OXS Storm G2 isn’t trying to fulfill the same promises as premium options, I’d say it’s still a catch at this price point. And I’ve frequently seen it drop down to $60 during sales, making it even more appealing.</p><h2 id="h35003"><a id="6"></a>Turtle Beach Recon 70</h2><p>Coming in at only $40, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/recon-70-headset&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/recon-70-headset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turtle Beach Recon 70</a></span> was one of the few wired headsets I tried on my Switch 2, and it was certainly my favorite budget option. I don’t like being tethered to my controller by a wire, so I probably won’t continue using this one, but it’s a satisfyingly low-cost option with sound quality that punches above its weight. Its mic quality is also significantly better than I’d expect from something twice its price.</p><p>Despite being made of plastic, the Turtle Beach Recon 70 is shockingly comfortable and sturdy, too, so I never felt like I had to be too careful with it. And since it plugs into a 3.5mm jack on your controller, there’s very little to fiddle with on the cups themselves. This lack of extra buttons and thingamajigs to keep up with makes this headset exceedingly easy to understand and use for casual players and youngsters alike.</p><p>Though the Switch 2 is still quite young, having only been out for about a month, there are already some great peripherals out there to upgrade your gaming experience.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-best-headsets-alienware-razer-turtle-beach-1851785500]]></content:encoded>
