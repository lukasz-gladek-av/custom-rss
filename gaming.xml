			<p>It's been less than a day since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official announcement of the PS5 Pro console</a>. The biggest news (largely a shock) was certainly Sony's pricing choice, but when it came to the hardware features, they were mostly in line with the leaks.</p>
<p>As early as July 2023, insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-rumored-to-launch-in-november-2024-with-accelerated-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> that the upgraded PlayStation 5 would feature 'accelerated ray tracing'. This March, YouTube channel Moore's Law Is Dead <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> from a leaked document that ray tracing performance could be twice or even thrice as fast as the original PlayStation 5, which was confirmed yesterday by Sony:</p>
<p><em><strong>Advanced Ray Tracing</strong>: We’ve added even more powerful ray tracing that provides more dynamic reflection and refraction of light. This allows the rays to be cast at double, and at times triple, the speeds of the current PS5 console.</em></p>
<p>While the PS5 Pro GPU is mainly based on the RDNA 3 architecture, it will anticipate several ray tracing enhancements that won't be seen until next year in AMD's first RDNA 4 PC graphics cards, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-rdna-4-gpus-feature-enhanced-ray-tracing-architecture-double-rt-intersect-engine-radeon-rx-8000-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double Ray Tracing Intersect Engine</li>
<li>RT Instance Node Transform</li>
<li>64B RT Node</li>
<li>Ray Tracing Tri-Pair Optimization</li>
<li>Change flags encoded in barycentric to simplify the detection of procedural nodes</li>
<li>BVH Footprint Improvement</li>
<li>RT support for OBB and Instance Node Intersection</li>
</ul>
<p>According to another leak, it may also include thread reordering to reduce data and execution divergence, similar to NVIDIA's Shader Execution Reordering (introduced with the Ada Lovelace architecture) and Intel Arc's Thread Sorting Unit.</p>
<p>Interestingly, PS5 Pro Lead System Architect Mark Cerny told <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/exclusive-hands-on-i-played-sonys-all-new-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNET</a> that Sony drove the development of these advanced ray tracing features at AMD.</p>
<p><em>PS5 Pro uses the new advanced ray tracing feature sets that AMD created as the next step in their roadmap architecture But if you look around, there are no other AMD GPUs that use it yet. We motivated the development, and I'm very happy we did so -- the response from the developers has been extraordinarily great.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, while AMD GPUs compete well enough in rasterization, they've historically trailed behind NVIDIA in this area. RDNA 4 hardware, starting with the PS5 Pro this November, is looking to change all that at a time when more and more game developers are implementing ray tracing in their games. Of course, NVIDIA is unlikely to rest on its laurels and may well have something up its sleeves for the GeForce RTX 50 Series 'Blackwell' GPUs, whose design is expected to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-550w-5080-350w-september-design-fianlize-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finished this month</a> for a tentative announcement at CES 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-feature-offline-modes-for-long-term-access/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has confirmed offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest “to ensure long-term access” for the community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2023, Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-taking-the-crew-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the original The Crew would be taken offline due to “upcoming server infrastructure and licensing constraints”. The news didn’t sit well with the fans, with many expressing disappointment all across social media. Additionally, the community took it upon themselves to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-is-being-revived-just-months-after-going-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revive the game</a>, with a dedicated team working to get it running by the Crew’s 10th anniversary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seems that Ubisoft understands the community’s sentiment and is committed to providing long-term access to both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. According to the new video on <a href="https://x.com/TheCrewGame/status/1833543516506435739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, the developers are “currently exploring different solutions and can confirm an offline mode” for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. More details about the offline mode will be revealed in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We heard your concerns about access to The Crew games</p><p>Today, we want to express our commitment to the future of The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. </p><p>We can confirm an offline mode to ensure long term access to both titles, stay tuned for more news in the next months. <a href="https://t.co/KDlz8h09OT">pic.twitter.com/KDlz8h09OT</a></p></div>— The Crew Motorfest (@TheCrewGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCrewGame/status/1833543516506435739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest are online-only racing games, the former released in 2018 and the latter in 2023. The decision to introduce an offline mode for these games has gone well with the fans, with many <a href="https://x.com/KlassikerGamer/status/1833632300824682976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">praising</a> Ubisoft’s decision. However, some still wonder whether an offline mode is possible for the <a href="https://x.com/DyhZar_/status/1833543606696554961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">original game</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Ubisoft was recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-being-pressured-to-go-private-as-share-prices-continue-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pressurised to go private</a> as share prices continue to fall. Also, Ubisoft has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vulkan-api-rainbow-six-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stripped Vulcan API </a>from Rainbow Six Siege. What are your thoughts on The Crew 2 and Motorfest receiving offline modes? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/the-crew-motorfest-and-the-crew-2-are-both-getting-offline-modes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft Ivory Tower have announced that both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/04/the-crew-2-review/">The Crew 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-crew-motorfest">The Crew Motorfest</a> will be getting support for offline play in a future update, ensuring that they will remain playable long after the servers are eventually shut down.</p>
<p>To mark this announcement, Ubisoft have put both games on sale for the next two weeks. The Crew Motorfest is reduced by up to 70% – it’s cheapest on PC at £18, while the Xbox Deluxe Edition is £22.50, and PlayStation seemingly hasn’t put discounts in place just yet. But you want an absolute steal? Well,&nbsp;you can get The Crew 2 for just 79p!</p>


<p>Say it with me:</p>
<p><iframe title="Robocop - I'd Buy That For a Dollar" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/85cL1HisrNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Patching in an offline mode is huge for game preservation, and it will also help Ubisoft get back some good will after making the original The Crew completely inaccessible to play with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/14/the-original-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-2024/">that game’s server shutdown earlier this year</a>. Now, The Crew 2 was a much better game than The Crew, but still, it sucks to see games effectively disappearing.</p>

<p>Motorfest owners have a lot to look forward to, as Ivory Tower announced plans for Year 2 in the game’s post-launch support. It will get its biggest update yet on 6th November, with the game map getting 50% bigger when they add the entire island of Maui… for free!</p>
<p>This will be integrated seamlessly, so you’ll be able to head over to the new island by sea, by air, or by driving across a connecting bridge, without any loading screens.</p>
<p>Once again, the team will be trying to honour real life with an abstracted recreation, though it will feature real roads and locations with the road to Hana, bamboo forests, waterfalls, Kaihalulu beach’s red sands, Haleakalā National Park, and more.</p>
<p>Year 2 will have another seasonal content plan, though with three seasons instead of 4. This will start with Season 5 and a new Made in Japan Volume 2 playlist. There will also be a new PvE mode included in the Year 2 Pass called The Chase Squad, which sadly won’t feature Bradley Walsh, but will have you trying to hunt down racing rivals across the island.</p>
<p>The Year 2 Pass is included with new versions of the Gold and Ultimate editions of The Crew Motorfest, or sold separately. It will add 20 more vehicles, nine of which are there on day one and the other 11 added in monthly drops through the year.</p>
<p>Launching last September, we said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/29/the-crew-motorfest-review/">The Crew Motorfest review</a>, “The Crew Motorfest provides plenty of fun arcade racing, though it does very little to break new ground for the genre. There’s plenty to get your teeth into, but there are some annoying design decisions and a few technical issues that take the shine off it. Still, I can see it finding plenty of fans, particularly on PS5 where the only competition from a ‘Horizon’ game involves robotic dinosaurs.”</p>

            <p>Abandon all hope, ye who are shackled to your workmates in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chained-together">Chained Together</a>. The "co-op" game about escaping hell now has a map editor that'll let you make your own infuriating obstacle courses for condemned souls to throw themselves upon. Finally, you can make the endless mountain of perdition you have dreamed about since being emotionally scarred by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This update is designed to unleash your creativity," say developers Anegar Games in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2567870/view/4606707511976656411">brief patch notes</a>. The editor will let you place moving platforms, swinging axes, pulsating spikes, and all the rest of the game's horrendous machinery. There are a few levels already up in the Steam Workshop, including the one pictured above, in which I slipped to my death five times before quitting to desktop. You win this time, spinning log. </p>
<p>We at RPS have already enjoyed a brief foray into the fiery pits. It was a journey that saw Edwin, Nic and I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">bickering about the correct way to perform a countdown</a> before committing to deadly leaps and scrambled sprints. The darkest place in hell is reserved for those who run into a gauntlet of lasers insisting "let's just eyeball it, boys".</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> multiplayer platformer Chained Together is cheap, silly, and unsurprisingly janky. In other words, pure streamer bait - the video game as meme. But I often admire games like this for their playground simplicity. It reminds me of Sen's Fortress as much as it does Bennet Foddy's cauldronised clamberer. Nic called it a "layer cake of fuckery", a description both accurate and pleasing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The esports industry has suffered from various challenges and tribulations over the last few years, and the path it has followed to become as big as it is has been a weary one. It’s not over yet, though. Sadly, many issues still plague the industry that leave people asking the question: ‘Is esports dying?’</p>



<p>In this walkthrough, we’re identifying the biggest blockers that are preventing the esports industry from being considered profitable and sustainable. If you’ve been wondering whether esports is a good career path to follow, you’ll want to check out this guide first.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-wrong-with-esports">What’s Wrong With Esports?</h2>



<p>The esports industry has suffered under the weight of many long-standing problems for more than a decade. It ebbs and flows like any other market, but it’s especially volatile, leading to organisations dipping in and out of the industry with an alarming regularity.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it almost always comes down to <strong>dollars and cents</strong>. In the last few years, we’ve seen funding, investments, and cash on hand dwindle across the wider market, but at the same time, player and staff salaries have remained almost <strong>too high</strong>. </p>



<p>In terms of companies, the market is fast becoming saturated. More <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-successful-esports-teams-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esports teams</a> are surfacing every day, but the structure of major esports tournaments doesn’t tend to change, which means there isn’t ‘enough room’ to accommodate these aspiring organisations.</p>



<p>That being said, viewership is increasing, the number of fans supporting the industry is growing, and other revenue streams, such as betting, merchandising, and brand sponsorship deals, remain quite consistent.</p>



<h2 id="h-so-is-esports-dying-now">So, Is Esports Dying Now?</h2>



<p>Esports isn’t dying, but it is still recovering from a monumental boom that ballooned the industry to epic proportions in a relatively short time. We saw hundreds of millions of dollars invested in the esports industry, and some tournaments exploded, pulling in staggering prize pools that ultimately proved unsustainable.</p>



<p>It’s now a matter of adjusting on a global scale.</p>



<p>It can be argued that sports and esports are nothing without the fans and the viewers, and that’s where the esports industry shines. Most <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-esports-games-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esports games</a> are seeing a growth in viewership that’s nothing short of promising.</p>



<p>Here are some key examples:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <strong>Six Invitational 2024 </strong>set a peak viewership record at 521,374 users and kickstarted a popularity boom for the game.</li>



<li>The <strong>League of Legends World Championship 2023 </strong>set a peak viewership record at 6,402,760 users, setting a new world record for the esports industry.</li>



<li>The <strong>FNCS 2024 Global Championship </strong>became the most-watched Fortnite tournament in five years, securing a peak viewer count of 809,854.</li>



<li>The <strong>PGL Major Copenhagen 2024 </strong>proved to be a huge boost for Counter-Strike 2, landing a peak viewer count of 1,853,954 users.</li>
</ul>



<p>The global fanbase is growing, and that means more ticket and merchandise sales. It also means better stability for investors and sponsors who are slowly but surely coming back into the fold. It means more ad revenue from boosted streams, co-streaming opportunities, and more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-betting-guide/">esports bettors</a> going out and placing wagers.</p>



<p>It’s tough for new esports games to surface, but that doesn’t mean developers have stopped trying. In recent months, we’ve seen the likes of The Finals, Spectre Divide, Tarkov Arena, Deadlock, Stormgate, and XDefiant all surface with the desire to become an esports game.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the appetite is there to make something special out of the esports industry. With almost half a billion enthusiasts worldwide, there’s a solid fanbase pooling, and with the likes of the Esports World Cup and the Olympic Esports Games trying hard to add further legitimacy to the industry, we’re likely only a few years away from a much more sustainable position.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The PS5 Pro is real, and it's coming soon. As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">Sony revealed during a livestream Tuesday morning</a>, the PS5 Pro will offer a bump in horsepower over the current PS5 and PS5 Slim models, making it possible to play PS5 games--and even some PS4 titles--in 4K resolution at 60fps. In other words, the PS5 Pro could make it possible to play games with the visual quality of fidelity mode and the smoothness of performance mode. The enhanced console is set to launch on November 7 for $700--$200 more than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Slim ($500)</a> and $250 more than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-Digital-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Slim Digital ($450)</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS5 Pro is a digital-only console, but it supports the $80 disc drive attachment PlayStation released last year. If you prefer to place your consoles upright, you'll need to buy the optional vertical stand for $30. All told, you could be looking at $820 plus your local tax rate. That's pretty steep for a mid-generation hardware refresh, but if the visual upgrades have already caught your eye, you can preorder the PS5 Pro starting September 26 at PlayStation Direct. Major retailers will begin taking preorders on October 10.</p><div title="6526406 - Ps5 pro preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2651" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6526406 - Ps5 pro preorders" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/gallery\/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game\/2900-5758\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/">Preorder PS5 Pro</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/gallery\/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game\/2900-5758\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/">$700</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The PS5 Pro features a larger GPU that, according to Sony, allows for 45% faster rendering and support for enhanced visual technology like AI-driven upscaling and advanced ray tracing. Additionally, it comes with a 2TB SSD, which is double the base storage space of the PS5 Slim models. The storage space is fairly significant from a cost standpoint, as adding 1TB to existing PS5 models typically costs around $100--or more if you opt for the latest NVMe SSDs from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Expansion-Compatible-Playstation5-MZ-V9P1T0GW/dp/B0BHJDK513?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Officially-Licensed-Expansion/dp/B0C48B3RGL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Western Digital</a>.</p><p>The console also features a minimal design refresh with wider "racing stripes" on the side panels.

            <p>
Just days after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-punishing-stealth-sequences-will-soon-be-easier">pledging</a> a fix for Star Wars Outlaws' "unfair" and "incredibly punishing" insta-fail stealth sequences, Ubisoft has released a brand-new patch doing just that - and it introduces a bunch of other features, including cross-progression support, too.
</p>
<p>
It's unclear how extensive these initial changes to stealth are in Outlaws' new Title Update 1.1.2, with today's patch notes failing to go into much detail. They do, however, promise "tweaks and improvement on some challenging stealth moments", with an additional note confirming the "level of detection [has been] adjusted depending on location", and that players are now "less likely to be detected while rolling."
</p>
<p>
1.1.2's next big addition is support for cross-progression and cross-saving via Ubisoft Connect, and that's accompanied by the likes of PC performance improvements and optimisations, crash fixes and stability improvements across all platforms, plus various bug fixes. The Hyperspace mission has been fixed, for instance, meaning players can finally take off, and PS5 players can now unlock the Old School Cool trophy and platinum the game.

Star Wars Outlaws' 1.1.2 update weighs in at 1.92GB on PS5, 2.25GB on Xbox Series X/S, and 1.89GB on PC. Full patch notes - which don't include all the planned tweaks Star Wars Outlaws director Julian Gerighty <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-punishing-stealth-sequences-will-soon-be-easier">recently outlined</a> - can be <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-sg/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/PCOasRfTRCek2FfFirser">found on Ubisoft's website</a>.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell felt Star Wars Outlaws' flaws ran considerably deeper than its wonky stealth in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">two out of five review</a>. "The result is a series of quite painful comparisons," he wrote. "It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed. It lacks the linear polish and charisma of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. Lacks the animation flow to its yellow-ledge platforming next to a Horizon, or the sheer joy of taking platforming and making it into an actual game in itself, as in Star Wars Jedi."

During a Q&amp;A segment, Okamura acknowledged the fans eagerly waiting to learn which games will be included in Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2. However, bringing some of the newer titles to modern audiences comes with a unique set of issues, including a desire to dodge the problems Vol. 1 faced at launch.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/06/22/metalgaer-1687441506936.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Konami wants to make sure it gets Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2 right.</figcaption></figure></output><p>While Okamura assures that an additional entry in the Master Collection is in the works, the team doesn’t want to run into <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-confirms-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-issues-to-be-addressed-post-launch"><u>the same issues</u></a> that plagued Vol. 1 buyers at launch. PC players, for example, were <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-is-packed-with-problems-on-pc"><u>quick to criticize the Metal Gear Solid collection’s</u></a> lack of display settings and locked 720p resolution. These issues as well as others saw its Steam reviews brought down to “mixed,” though it did eventually bounce back, with many titles from the collection now boasting a “very positive” banner.</p><p>“We’re also worried about how Vol. 1 had a pretty rough launch, with all of the issues,” Okamura added, “so we’re going to do everything we can not to repeat that, but we just have to ask for everyone to give us time.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There’s more than one reason Konami wants Vol. 2 to stay in the oven for a while longer, though. Games from last year’s collection, such as Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3, are based on pre-existing HD ports. It helped streamline the process for Konami, but it won’t have that leg up when it comes to the remastered versions of more recent Metal Gear titles.</p><p>“We had HD ports of MGS1, 2, and 3. Or, sorry, not really for 1, but the other two,” Okamura said. “But most of the titles released after those don’t have a pre-existing HD port we could use. Some are in HD, but those would all be really big titles, and that comes with its own set of issues.”</p><p>It’s because of these hurdles that Konami says it will “be a little while” before it commits to a lineup or release date for Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2. So, while Okamura isn’t ready to confirm whether fans will finally get the long-awaited Metal Gear Solid 4 port they’ve always dreamed of, he at least notes that they’ll reveal more information when the team is ready.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Konami isn’t ready to announce a Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2 release date, but that won’t stop fans from guessing which titles will make the cut. Players were able to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-fans-uncover-additional-evidence-of-possible-mgs-4-remaster-and-more"><u>uncover evidence</u></a> that games like Metal Gear Solid 4, 5, and Peace Walker will join the collection late last year. Konami itself has teased <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/solid-snake-actor-david-hayter-teases-this-is-only-the-beginning-for-the-metal-gear-franchise"><u>more to come in Vol. 2 since last October</u></a>, going as far as to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-about-metal-gear-solid-4-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-stay-tuned-konami-says"><u>tell fans to “stay tuned” just last month</u></a>.

                <p dir="ltr">In my years of reviewing NBA 2K games, I've come to appreciate--and even expect--the game to feel like an authentic love letter to basketball in so many ways. This has been a consistent attribute of the series going back over a decade. NBA 2K doesn't just capture the culture of basketball; it helps shape it. No other game--not even Madden, despite the head start gifted to it by simulating Americans' unique obsession with football--offers a total package as immersive and rewarding as NBA 2K. That's why, in addition to my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k25-review-luxury-taxed/1900-6418281/" data-ref-id="1900-6418281">NBA 2K25 review</a>--and so as not to become too bogged down in the ins and outs of it there--I'm also taking a moment to address the unfortunate pay-to-win economy still infecting what is otherwise the perennial sports game of the year.</p><p dir="ltr">If you don't play NBA 2K, you may be unfamiliar with its woes in this regard, and if you do play it, you may have normalized it to the point that you no longer see it as a concern. Unlike other sports games in which the focal point is often either the team-centric Franchise-style mode or the fantasy-card-collecting loot-box mode, Visual Concepts has built up its MyCareer mode and its social MMO hub, The City, to offer a compelling--and somehow, after all these years, still-unrivaled--tandem attraction in the sports gaming world.</p><p dir="ltr">Players create a character and decide on a build like in an RPG, which determines how their player will perform on the court. From there, they can follow a narrative-driven story mode, join an NBA team and play out many seasons of their career, and, best of all, jump into the game's thriving community in The City. The shared social space that offers an impressive range of things to do, like limited-time events, pick-up games on streetball-style courts, competitive 5v5 games with dedicated groups of teammates, and so much more. This year, they can even race go-karts.</p><p dir="ltr">The City and MyCareer combine to create sports gaming's deepest experience on the market, but it's hampered annually by a community that has been taught to spend extra cash on making their custom players competitive or else drown in a sea of others getting ahead with the virtual swipe of their debit cards. This is because the MyCareer player debuts as a terrible on-court performer--carrying a 60 overall (OVR) rating--and the in-game money, called Virtual Currency (VC), can be used to improve the MyCareer player, rather than just to buy cool shirts and sneakers for them. The community is so attuned to this reality that it's actually quite rare in my experience to see many players in the low 60s, even on the game's launch day.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365210-45ec1b55-8627-4941-8e57-f1e61ce6ba98.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365210" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365210-45ec1b55-8627-4941-8e57-f1e61ce6ba98.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365210"></a><figcaption>I tried waiting by the entrance to The City to find players with ratings in the 60s and could hardly ever find any. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365210-45ec1b55-8627-4941-8e57-f1e61ce6ba98.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While it surely isn't true, it <em>feels </em>like everyone is spending a bit extra to get their player up to an OVR where they can compete with others online, and the social pressures the game implies through its careful design choices over many years mean this problem feels like it's hardly ever improving. On launch day, I waited by the subway tunnel where players arrive in The City and tried to spot the players whose banners showed they were still hovering around 60 or even 70 OVR. It was rare that I found one, and when I did, they were standing still, suggesting the not-unlikely scenario that the human on the other end may have been buying their VC right then and there so they could upgrade their player.</p><p dir="ltr">A player who chooses not to invest in VC will start the game at 60 OVR and have to slowly improve through play, at the risk of being left out by their friends and teammates who spent more and aren't willing to have a low-level player on their team. A player paying <em>only </em>$70 on NBA 2K is liable to make games harder for everyone. If you're one of 10 people playing in a PvP game on launch day, and nine of them are 80+ OVR, and you're 60 OVR, you're going to have a bad time, and you're going to make your teammates' experience worse too. By 2024, the NBA 2K community has seemingly adapted to this reality by simply spending what they need to in order to remain viable as a player.</p><p dir="ltr">For this year's review, I tried a new method in which I didn't spend any of the 100,000 VC (roughly $30 worth) that comes with my review copy of the game so I could better experience it as a 60 OVR player trying to make my player better via training, playing different modes, and otherwise grinding it out. What I found was the game isn't very fun at all. In PvP, I was a consistent source of frustration for my teammates, as I couldn't cover far better players on the other team, whether they were humans or even the game's CPU bosses. In modes where you can see others' OVR ratings, some quickly backed out of matchmaking, maybe because they didn't want the headache I'd bring.</p><p dir="ltr">Other modes hide this number, but my player's low figurative ceiling meant they'd soon come to the same conclusion, in my experience. I was essentially being picked last for gym class because I didn't want to shell out another 30 or more dollars to make my player competent. Even in solo career games it felt like being stuck on the Pistons last season. I made it not 48 hours before I caved and used my VC to buy better attributes for my player just so I could accomplish anything of importance in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The slow grind from 60 OVR to something better would be enjoyable if everyone were in the same situation. Instead, the game's servers come online, and before players do anything else, a seemingly significant number of them immediately buy sums of in-game gold coins that could fill Scrooge McDuck's vault. It's remarkable to me that the annualized $100 version of the game, this year called the All-Star Edition, comes with enough VC to get players to about 80 OVR, and still many players are spending more on top of that because you easily find players eclipsing 85 or even 90 OVR right out of the gate. Players and media often discuss how many major games have moved to an expected price of $70, but NBA 2K appears to be the first de facto $100+ sports game. To pay less than that while being interested in the game's best mode invites frustration and ostracization.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365212-f8acd40d-c694-4e5f-9327-09eaff598263.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365212" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365212-f8acd40d-c694-4e5f-9327-09eaff598263.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365212"></a><figcaption>Playing through the game as myself is a lot of fun, until I find that bills are stacking up in my virtual world, too.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365212-f8acd40d-c694-4e5f-9327-09eaff598263.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This ties into something I wrote last year, in which I lamented how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/whats-even-the-point-of-sports-game-reviews/1100-6516988/">sports games get away with things like this</a> while other games can't. Most wouldn't try, and when others <em>do </em>try at times, like Overwatch 2 paywalling some heroes or Star Wars Battlefront 2 offering gameplay-altering upgrades as microtransactions, it's usually not long before the disapproving player base forces a change. I understand the cost of making a video game of this caliber is prohibitive, and so I've always been comfortable with ample cosmetic DLC options. Heck, I've spent plenty of my money in games like Fortnite, Sea of Thieves, and even NBA 2K, buying visually cool style options for my avatars. I've even come around on NBA 2K's The City mode looking like a virtual shopping mall--partly because it's wisely presented like a beach boardwalk in this year's game, so it feels less like a giant pop-up ad. But once you've allowed a game's currency to dramatically affect gameplay like NBA 2K has for many years now, a line has surely been crossed.</p><p dir="ltr">I get the sense these economic problems are not Visual Concepts' choice, and this is very likely closer to a publisher mandate. The Visual Concepts team clearly loves basketball, and I genuinely look forward to hearing about all the cool new things it's done with the NBA 2K series each year. This year's game is no different, and you should read my whole <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k25-review-luxury-taxed/1900-6418281/" data-ref-id="1900-6418281">NBA 2K25 review</a> to get a broader sense of how great this game otherwise is. It truly stands alone in so many ways, and it feels like the one sports game I could play forever and never run out of enjoyable things to do. It's just too bad that, for most players, there's a costly annual hurdle they must clear before stepping onto the court.</p>

The big difference between Game Pass Standard and Game Pass Ultimate, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">the now $20 a month version</a></span>, is that the former won’t include certain day-one additions to the library until <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-standard-day-one-cod-blops-6-1851626993&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-standard-day-one-cod-blops-6-1851626993">up to 12 months later or even longer in some cases</a></span>. The most notable example is <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, which will only be part of Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC when it launches on October 25. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But a list of the existing libraries</a></span> for each tier also reveals other discrepancies for games that already came to the service. <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, added last month, is notably absent. As is<em> Diablo IV</em>, added in the spring with a new expansion, <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, coming October 8. <em>Valorant</em>, Riot Games’ hero shooter that recently came to console, is free-to-play but locks certain characters behind a paywall. The Game Pass version that unlocks them all for free is part of Ultimate but not Standard. </p><p>There are some smaller day-and-date games missing as well.<em> Flintlock</em>, the colonial-era Soulslike, came to Game Pass in July but isn’t included in Standard’s library. Neither is<em> Another Crab’s Treasure</em>, the cartoony Soulslike that joined in April. <em>Still Wakes The Deep</em>, the horror walking sim that arrived in June, is also absent. It seems like a lot of recent day-one Game Pass releases, including Microsoft’s own <em>Age of Mythology Retold</em>, won’t be hitting Standard anytime soon, despite arriving on the service before the split was official. <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II </em>isn’t there either, nor<em> Starfield</em> which came out over a year ago. </p><p>When will we see these games and others make it to the middle tier? That’s the most confusing part of all. For now there doesn’t seem to be one standard approach, with all releases being staggered by the same number of months. Even for Microsoft’s own first-party releases, it seems like their arrival on Standard will happens when it happens. <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, for example, might not hit Game Pass Standard until it first arrives on PS5 in the spring. </p><p> Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-pro-x-burning-questions-sony-console-price-enhanced-gta<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>At long last, Sony has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-officially-revealed-gamescom-2024"><u>peeled back the curtain on the PlayStation 5 Pro</u></a>. This new console will be significantly more powerful than the standard PS5, delivering new upscaling tech, better framerates, and significantly improved ray tracing capabilities. But that increased power also comes at an increased cost.</p><p>While we wait for the November 7 release of the PS5 Pro, let’s break down the biggest questions surrounding this new console right now. Is the higher price tag justified? How many games will actually take advantage of this raw horsepower? And why the heck are we still being charged extra for a stand? These are our PS5 Pro burning questions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>PlayStation 5 Pro First Look</h3></div></output><h2>Is It Really Too Expensive?</h2><p>The PlayStation 5 Pro was easily one of the worst-kept secrets in the gaming world, so the announcement didn’t exactly come as a surprise to most gamers. What did shock many, however, was the price tag. Sony is charging $699 for the Pro, which is quite a jump over the $449 MSRP of the disc drive-less standard PS5. A lot of gamers feel that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/internet-reacts-to-ps5-pro-700-price-point-with-shock"><u>the PS5 Pro is simply too expensive</u></a>.</p><p>But is that a fair assessment? Yes, the price difference is quite a bit more than what we saw with the PS4 and PS4 Pro. But Sony is specifically touting the majorly upgraded GPU. When you consider that, on the PC gaming front, a decent midrange card like a Radeon RX 6800 costs in the neighborhood of $500 on its own, is $699 for a full-fledged, high-end gaming machine really such a bad deal?</p><p>Consider also that the PlayStation 3 originally launched at $600 back in 2006. This isn’t the first time Sony has put out new hardware at a significant premium over competitors. The PS3 may have been twice the price of the Nintendo Wii at the time, but it was also immensely more powerful. And let’s not forget that<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/iphone-16-series-announced-featuring-a-new-camera-button-ai-integration-and-more"><u> the newly announced iPhone 16</u></a>, which is designed to play AAA games with hardware-accelerated ray tracing, starts at an MSRP of $999. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Is $699 for a full-fledged, high-end gaming machine really such a bad deal?</p></div><p>On the other hand, the PS3 comparison doesn’t quite hold water when you consider that that console represented a generational leap forward in graphical fidelity. The PS5 Pro is merely a mid-generation overhaul of an existing console. </p><p>And as for the iPhone, it may be quite a bit more expensive than a PS5 Pro, but it’s also a far more versatile multimedia device (and, of course, a phone!). A Steam Deck may be a better point of comparison, and even the highest-end model is still cheaper than the PS5 Pro.</p><p>At the end of the day, the PS5 Pro probably isn’t overpriced for what it offers. Yes, you can build a modest gaming PC for $699, but that PC is not going to be capable of competing on the same graphical playing field. Even with a price tag this high, we wouldn’t be surprised if Sony is selling this console at a loss.</p><p>The real question is whether the PS5 Pro offers enough benefits to justify the 64% increase in price over the base model. We’ll have to wait until we see real-world benchmarks and get an idea of how games actually look and perform on the new console. </p><h2>How Many Games Will Be PS5 Pro Enhanced?</h2><p>The main selling point of the PS5 Pro is obvious - it’s meant to offer superior game performance compared to the standard PS5. The goal with this system is to eliminate the need for separate performance and fidelity modes. No longer do gamers need to choose between a high, stable framerate and the best possible resolution. The Pro does both at the same time. </p><p>It remains to be seen when and even if we’ll see games developed from the ground up with the PS5 Pro in mind. But we do know that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-game-enhanced-for-ps5-pro"><u>many existing PS5 games will be “PS5 Pro Enhanced</u></a>,” meaning they’ll receive updates to take full advantage of the more powerful hardware. That list includes Alan Wake 2, Gran Turismo 7, Hogwarts Legacy,  Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, among many others.</p><p>The question is just how many games will be PS5 Pro Enhanced. Will this become a standard feature going forward? Will Sony make it mandatory for new games to support the PS5 Pro? Will we continue to see older first-party titles added to the PS5 Pro Enhanced lineup, such as the God of War games or the earlier Spider-Man games?</p><p>And what about the PS4 catalog? We know that Sony is looking to enhance last-gen games as well through features like PS5 Pro Game Boost and Enhanced Image Quality. Just how much of the PS4 back catalog is supported, and will we see new games added to that lineup over time?</p><p>How devoted is Sony to ensuring that new and existing games take advantage of this more powerful hardware? And more to the point, what happens if the PS5 Pro doesn’t sell well out of the gate? Sony made a big push with VR gaming when the PSVR2 hit in February 2023, but that’s since tapered off as it’s become clear the headset is a niche product. If gamers aren’t sold on the PS5 Pro’s higher price tag, how aggressive will Sony be in marketing the PS5 Pro Enhanced catalog 6-12 months down the line?  </p><h2>Will Developers Charge for PS5 Pro Enhancement?</h2><p>We imagine Sony wants as many games as possible to be included in the PS5 Pro Enhanced catalog, and that every major game in development right now probably includes PS5 Pro support in one form or another. But will we see some developers charge for the ability to take advantage of the new hardware? Will “PS5 Pro Enhanced” become a paid upgrade in some cases?</p><p>For the most part, we’d guess not. Sony gave no indication in their presentation that these would be paid upgrades, and it might be a tough sell to expect gamers to fork over the money for the new hardware and pay even more on top of that to actually enjoy the full benefits of gaming on the PS5 Pro. </p><p>In the case of games that are also available on the PC, we imagine that most of the work has been done already when it comes to making enhanced game modes available for better hardware. In short, we doubt “PS5 Pro Enhanced” will be a paid upgrade in most cases, except when significantly more work is being done to update the base game for the new hardware. Charging more simply for a better framerate and resolution isn’t going to cut it.   </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>How Much Better Will GTA 6 Look on PS Pro?</h2><p>At this point, the PS5 Pro’s success may be inextricably tied to Grand Theft Auto 6. GTA 6 is quickly shaping up to be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-lot-riding-on-gta-6-and-not-just-for-rockstar-and-take-two"><u>one of the most important games ever released</u></a>, and it’s going to be a huge system seller. Will it wind up being the biggest argument in favor of buying a PS5 Pro?</p><p>The trailer for GTA 6 is nothing if not visually stunning, leaving us to wonder if the actual game can truly live up to that early tease. The incredibly detailed character models and environments and advanced lighting techniques promise to push the current-gen consoles to their limits. The standard PS5 and the Xbox Series X will probably be lucky to run at a stable 30 fps. Just how much better will the experience be on the PS5 Pro?</p><p>Based on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-gta-6-game-engine-looks-insane-igns-grand-theft-auto-6-performance-preview"><u>our technical analysis of the GTA 6 trailer</u></a>, the game seems to be running at 30 fps at an internal base resolution of 1440p. Can the PS5 Pro beat that? Will this be the only way to play GTA 6 at 60fps and/or 4K resolution? Is this where we’ll see what Sony’s new PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution tech is capable of?</p><p>With GTA 6 not hitting the PC immediately, it’s probably safe to assume that the PS5 Pro version of the game will be the best-looking and best-playing version of the game out of the gate. But just how stark a difference will there be? Will the game simply run more smoothly, or will it truly feel like a mid-generational leap in quality? If it’s the latter, we could see a whole lot more gamers suddenly making the switch to the PS5 Pro a year from now.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>PS5 Pro Reveal Event</h3></div></output><h2>Why Aren't the Disc Drive and Stand Included?</h2><p>As we’ve already explored, the PS5 Pro probably isn’t overpriced given the sheer, raw processing power Sony is working with here. But that doesn’t mean $699 isn’t a hard pill for most gamers to swallow. And Sony has made it that much more difficult to stomach by omitting two basic pieces of hardware - the disc drive and the stand. </p><p>The absence of the disc drive isn’t necessarily surprising, given how both Sony and Microsoft have begun to downplay discs in recent years. And it’s not as if the option isn’t still there. It just requires gamers to fork over $80 for the disc drive attachment.</p><p>Still, the absence of a disc drive stings. Sony really couldn’t have thrown us a bone and included a disc drive with their most expensive version of the PS5? With ridiculously high resolution being the big selling point here, don’t you want to encourage owners to take full advantage of the system and watch 4K Blu-rays rather than stream all their video content? And what about the people who are upgrading from a standard PS5 with disc drive to the Pro? Why force them to choose between paying an extra $80 and paying to “upgrade” to digital versions of their games?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>And what about the people who are upgrading from a standard PS5 with disc drive to the Pro? Why force them to choose between paying an extra $80 and paying to “upgrade” to digital versions of their games?</p></div><p>As for the stand, that’s just rubbing salt in the wound. Is it really necessary to charge $30 for a vertical stand? Sony really couldn’t have just thrown in the darned thing to the people forking over the better part of a month’s rent on their new console?</p><p>The real problem here is that these extra purchases quickly add up. If you want to be able to display your PS5 Pro standing up and use your collection of physical games and Blu-rays, suddenly the cost of a PS5 Pro is approaching $800. In this economy? Sony might be asking too much of gamers by nickel and dining them with these extra add-ons.   </p><p>But what do you think? Is the high price tag justified? Will the PS5 Pro be the ultimate way to play GTA 6? What are your biggest questions surrounding the new hardware? Let us know in the comments below.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Over 40 previously available titles shifted to Game Pass Ultimate tier.</p>

Back in July, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">sweeping changes to Xbox Game Pass</a> that would see day one releases being removed as a benefit to subscribers of the service's revised basic tier. That new tier - known as Game Pass Standard - is now live, but it turns out subscribers are missing out on more than just new releases: Microsoft has pulled access to over 40 previously available games, including major titles like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review">Hellblade 2</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's new £10.99/month Xbox Game Pass Standard tier replaces the older Xbox Game Pass for Console tier for new or lapsed subscribers wanting access to the Game Pass library and its "hundreds" of games. But while the company had previously confirmed the new Standard tier would no longer include access to first-party and other releases on day one (that benefit is now exclusive to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on consoles), Standard subscribers also won't have access to some of the most popular titles already in the Game Pass catalogue.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-standard-library-starfield-diablo-4-1851645117">spotted by Kotaku</a>, there are significant absences in the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/xbox-game-pass/games">Standard tier catalogue</a> that were previously available as part of a Game Pass for Console subscription. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-is-heading-to-xbox-game-pass-this-week">introduced to Game Pass back in July</a> - is gone, for instance, as is Diablo 4. Microsoft's Age of Mythology Retold, which released onto Game Pass last week, also isn't in the Standard catalogue, and numerous older first-party titles are missing too.

<p>
Starfield has been removed, as has Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2. And a whole bunch of smaller titles have also been whisked away from the Standard tier catalogue, including The Chinese Room's oil rig horror <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-review">Still Wakes the Deep</a>, oceanic Soulslike Another Crab's Treasure, cosy puzzler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/botany-manor-review">Botany Manor</a>, stop-motion adventure Harold Halibut, and Ashen developer A44 Games' Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn. In total - as detailed in a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-standard-for-console-players-now-available-day-1-games-excluded-listed-in-op.977379/">post over on Resetera</a> - more than 40 releases have been shorn from the Game Pass Standard catalogue, with the common pattern being that most were added as day one releases over the past year.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft recently confirmed it could be "up to 12 months or more" before day one releases on Game Pass Ultimate make their way to its Standard tier, suggesting the company has made the decision to apply its new rules retroactively, denying access to day one games added to the catalogue over the last 12 months - even if they were previously available on Xbox Game Pass for Console. These catalogue changes, it's worth noting, do not apply to the £9.99/month PC Game Pass, which will also continue to get day one games.
</p>
<p>
All this is likely to be an unpleasant surprise for new or lapsed Game Pass subscribers joining Standard, but I've reached out to Microsoft for clarity on the situation. And while we wait for a response, you'll find the full list of titles scrubbed from the Standard catalogue below:
</p>

			<p>A new patch for Star Wars Outlaws has been dropped on all platforms, hoping to smooth out some of the current wrinkles the game is experiencing. Player feedback has been plentiful, and by having access to that commentary, the developers have begun to fix some of the early game issues that players were experiencing to provide them with a smoother experience in the game. Those using <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/help/star-wars-outlaws/gameplay/article/cross-progression-in-star-wars-outlaws/000109498" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft Connect</a> can now utilize the Cross Progression and saves feature, with a blog post being uploaded to explain just how to use those features.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/PCOasRfTRCek2FfFirser/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This patch</a> is called Star Wars Outlaws Title Patch 1.1.2 and is bigger than the previous ones released, as it's the first major patch for the game. Despite being the first major patch, the Star Wars Outlaws Title Patch is relatively small and only requires a GB or two of space to download, depending on your platform, as seen below:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5: 1.92 GB</li>
<li>Xbox Series X|S: 2.25 GB</li>
<li>PC: 1.89 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>The blog post on Star Wars Outlaws details all of the changes made in this patch, including making the game look prettier for those using ray-tracing and frame-generation technologies. They've also improved the FPS drops that were happening in specific scenes, fixed the crashing issues, and provided stability improvements to all platforms.</p>
<p>One of the most critical fixes that was frequently complained about by players was the stealth missions. There have been some major tweaks and improvements to the stealth missions, so that players aren't <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-will-be-patched-to-improve-those-annoying-insta-fail-stealth-missions/">insta-failing</a> or having as hard a time trying to get through them in the early game.</p>
<p>Additionally, those who are on PlayStation 5 will now be able to unlock the "Old School Cool" trophy, which gives you the platinum for Star Wars Outlaws.</p>
<p>Of course, this patch includes many more fixes, including resolving the issue with the "Hyperspace" mission, where players were unable to take off. Bug fixes that occurred during specific story moments in the game were also implemented, so the immersion of the game wasn't tarred by awkward bugs and glitches that made the scene unbearable.</p>
<p>For those who are playing the game on ultra-wide monitors, the cutscenes are now fully supported, giving players an immersive experience when diving into Star Wars Outlaws. Undoubtedly, there are more patches to come, but this is the first Star Wars Outlaws Title Patch to make significant changes to the game to hopefully provide a more enjoyable experience.</p>
