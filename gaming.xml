However, about a month after enrolling at Kitafushi, He witnessed a female student from Kitafuji being harassed by Douju delinquents.

He apologized, took a few light punches and insults, and calmed the situation down. Later, he lured the three students who had harassed him into an alley and beat them up. Renmaru is my childhood friend. We were partners in junior high, but stopped seeing each other after an incident in our third year.

<p>The team at Digital Extremes recently shared a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warframe">Warframe</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/lhMk-jfl1m8">development update</a>, and it seems work on the Switch 2 version of the free-to-play title (<a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/50930-warframe-devs-can-t-wait-to-make-switch-2-version-still-waiting-for-dev-kit">which was originally teased in July during TennoCon 2025</a>) is finally underway.</p>
<p>Here's what the CEO Steve Sinclair had to say about this, after previously mentioning in July how the team couldn't wait <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/50930-warframe-devs-can-t-wait-to-make-switch-2-version-still-waiting-for-dev-kit">to get its hands on a dev kit</a> (<a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/52692-warframe-devs-reveal-switch-2-version-currently-in-the-works">via GoNintendo</a>):</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xhsmjt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>"We are working on Switch 2 stuff by the way. I don’t think that needs to be secret anymore. We finally have… thanks to our friends at Nintendo, we are on it, and there’s a lot of amazing things that are happening…</p>
<p>"…It is a very impressive piece of kit. Our tech leads are working on and are very excited about it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Digital Extremes Creative Director Rebecca Ford added to this, mentioning how the team would potentially capture gameplay of this particular version of Warframe and share it in an upcoming development stream.</p>
<p>This online third-person action shooter was previously released on the original Switch in 2018, and at the time, we called it a remarkable technical feat for Nintendo's hybrid hardware. This particular port was handled by the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/02/panic_button_hints_that_more_nintendo_switch_ports_are_in_the_pipeline">talented team at Panic Button</a>.</p>

Now, this package has been updated again for all platforms (including Switch).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in July,<a href="https://aftermath.site/civil-war-middle-age" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Riley went public with some very important news</a>: as a newly middle-aged man, he had developed a passion for historical armed conflicts, and was beginning to express it, as so many middle-aged men do, by playing dusty video games about them.</p><p>In an attempt to help coach him through this (sometimes) difficult transition from one stage of life to the next, myself and some other strategy game nerds got Riley into the hotseat for an episode of<a href="https://www.idlethumbs.net/3ma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Three Moves Ahead ("the leading strategy game themed podcast on the internet")</a>, in which we used Riley's growing thirst for the Civil War--and attempt to satisfy that thirst by playing a real-time strategy game about it, a genre he's not exactly comfortable with--as an opportunity to welcome him to the fold, to take him by the shoulder, ease him into his seat at the table.</p><p>Which was (hopefully) useful for Riley, but also for <em>us</em>, because it was a chance to re-examine the field of strategy games through fresh eyes, pondering everything from accessibility to core gameplay mechanics. Riley had been frustrated at the repeated death of his infantry in a tutorial mission, for example, and while that <em>could </em>have been an opportunity to make fun of him, it turns out he had uncovered a shortfall in so much strategy gaming, where gameplay mechanics and buttons are explained to the player in great detail, but not other, vital, prior-knowledge-taken-for-granted stuff like infantry tactics.</p><p>From there, the discussion moves to the meatier topic of playing strategy games based on conflicts like this and the Second World War, where at least one of the factions is, for want of a better term,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h242eDB84zY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the baddies</a>. And what it means to have<a href="https://aftermath.site/strategy-game-turn-based-tactics-movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a little fun moving guys around a map</a> when those conquests and victories on the battlefield had very real consequences.</p><p>A subject on which I'd like to make a little apology while I'm here! I say on this podcast that<a href="https://aftermath.site/order-of-battle-ww2-turn-based-tactics-game-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Order Of Battle</em>, my favourite empty-calories WW2 tactics game</a>, took a somewhat distant approach to depicting the German armed forces. After re-playing a German campaign since, that is <em>not </em>true! You unlock the Waffen SS as a whole sub-faction, can occupy cities and fly its little skull flag over them, and yikes, that is an error I would very much like to correct on the record, thank you!</p><p>Anyway, I'm saying all this because I really enjoyed being a part of the discussion, and think anyone interested in strategy games--and especially the underlying politics and sensibilities of playing them--<a href="https://www.idlethumbs.net/3ma/episodes/civil-war-midlife-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">should check the episode out</a>!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/unikat-32-33-indie-games-publisher-marketing"><h3>Running A Video Games Publisher AND Marketing Agency Sounds Absolutely Exhausting</h3></a><p>'Seeing all of your different efforts, ones that are synced by the work of many people, all being unveiled at once is a cool feeling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-author-immortal-image-comics-interview"><h3>The Author Immortal Is A Metanarrative Isekai Comic That Explores The Messiness Of Separating The Art From The Artist</h3></a><p>Amid canceled creators, cultural reckonings, and A.I.’s rise, Frank Barbiere and Morgan Beem’s new Image Comics series invites readers to reclaim fantasy and confront who stories truly serve

                <p>Next week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is getting its first DLC expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-expansion-launches-in-september/1100-6533445/" data-ref-id="1100-6533445">Claws of Awaji</a>. But before Naoe and Yasuke take on the Sanzoku Ippa in a new island region on September 16, Ubisoft is releasing the 1.1.1 update for Assassin's Creed Shadows on September 11.</p><p>As part of the Claws of Awaji storyline, Naoe and Yasuke's ally, Junjiro, goes on a quest to meet a legendary bo master, which will unlock a bo staff for Naoe. However, Ubisoft's new update will give the bo staff to every player in the game for free--even if they don't have the DLC--starting on September 16.</p><p>The previous update raised the level cap to 80, but <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/62imkAfEdpZSadOqfktQHv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update 1.1.1</a> will push the cap to level 100. Players will receive two additional upgrade levels for unique buildings and three new hideout levels. For anyone who favors running stealth missions at night, upgrading to Nando level 2 will allow players to meditate and advance time to either 6 AM or 6 PM.</p><p>Scouts will now be able to reveal viewpoints and safehouses upon upgrading Study to level 4, which can help Yasuke and Naoe fast travel. Uncovering every viewpoint in a province will also get rid of the fog once players reach Kakurega level 4. That means you'll get a clear view of the entire province as you plot your next move.</p><p>Naoe and Yasuke will be able to upgrade their gear to Mythic and Artifact tiers by upgrading Forge to level 6. Each item can be upgraded eight additional levels once it reaches a new quality. As an example, epic items can evolve into mythic items, while legendary items can be upgraded into artifact items.</p><p>Additionally, a new project called Sanctuary has been added to the Animus HUB, which will offer fans the chance to get Ezio-themed gear. For players who have the Claws of Awaji expansion, the Awaji region will have some new anomalies that can be discovered.</p><p>The rest of the Assassin's Creed Shadows 1.1.1 udpate notes can be found below.</p><h3>Uncapped Cutscenes</h3><ul><li>Cutscenes are no longer limited to 30 FPS (PC Only).</li></ul><h2>Bug Fixes</h2><h3>General</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the game crashed during the cutscene of the "Chained" rift.</li><li>Fixed various localization issues.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the vertical sliding sound effect continued if you switched characters during a slide.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some tutorials repeated themselves after unlocking Yasuke.</li></ul><h3>Gameplay</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the Naginata Ronin were not vulnerable after using the Vault ability.</li><li>Addressed an issue where the Scale of the Koi and Soaring Tatsu trinkets were not functioning as expected.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the aiming reticle option "Only While Aiming" was missing from the settings.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a persistent "New Item" notification appeared after looting weapons from scout supply chests.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to start horse archery in Iga because the quest giver had moved locations.

                <p>This week, Apple unveiled its next wave of hardware, including four new iPhone models and the next generations of the AirPods Pro and Apple Watch--and Apple users who are looking to grab the new releases can preorder several of the devices now. While the new iPhone 17 and iPhone Air are easily the marquee announcements of the presentation, we'll have to wait until September 12 for preorders to open.

Along with audio translations, the AirPods Pro 3 can connect to iOS devices to provide text translation as well.</p><p>The other big new feature for the AirPods Pro 3 is an integrated heart rate sensor--the smallest heart rate sensor in an Apple device yet. This means you can track workouts and get additional health data tracking just from the AirPods Pro 3 alone.</p><p>There are also several spec upgrades and feature overhauls compared to previous AirPods Pro models, including 4x more effective active noise cancelling (ANC) compared to the original AirPods Pro (and twice as effective compared to the AirPods Pro 2), plus new foam-infused eartips for added passive noise isolation.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cuomo%E2%80%99s-latest-strategy-to-resuscitate-his-flatlining-campaign-go-after-zohran-mamdani-for-associating-with-a-twitch-streamer.1294278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, is currently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/nyregion/mayor-poll-mamdani-cuomo.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 20 points ahead</a> of his nearest general election rival, Andrew Cuomo, who he already obliterated during the primary. Despite this, Cuomo has yet to slither back into the cavern of slime and obscurity which most assuredly awaits him in the near future. His latest attempt to jumpstart his raspy, dying cough of a campaign? Concern trolling over Mamdani’s decision to appear on a Twitch stream earlier this year.</p><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://x.com/hollypret/status/1965469787238400019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">near the World Trade Center memorial</a>, Cuomo accepted the endorsement of a 9/11 first responder who now has cancer, Sal Turturici, and his wife, Wendi. Behind them stood two conspicuous pieces of posterboard: one displaying a picture of leftist Twitch streamer Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker and his infamous “America deserved 9/11” quote from 2019 and another with two pictures of Mamdani and Piker clasping hands during their April 2025 stream together. Sans context, which is the way these sorts of things tend to travel around the internet, this made for <a href="https://x.com/MattBinder/status/1965491149122273722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an odd scene</a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.andrewcuomo.com/press/911-heroes-endorse-andrew-cuomo-mayor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a release from Cuomo’s camp</a> commemorating the occasion, Wendi lambasted Mamdani for talking to one of the few authentically consequential influencers on the left.&nbsp;</p><p>“I know firsthand what kind of leader Andrew Cuomo is,” she said. “As Governor, he fought to secure benefits for 9/11 families, and he treated our community with the respect and dignity we deserve. That’s the kind of leadership New York City needs again. … His opponent, Zohran Mamdani, proudly associates with Hasan Piker, a man who said ‘America deserved 9/11.’ To families like mine, that’s not politics, that’s life and death.&nbsp; His association with Hasan Piker disqualifies him to serve in any role for New York City, let alone one as important as Mayor.&nbsp; I am calling on Zohran Mamdani to disavow Hasan Piker and his hateful words.”</p><p>This elicited predictable headlines from the usual suspects, like the New York Post, which <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/09/us-news/9-11-family-blasts-zohran-mamdani-for-associating-with-terror-sympathizer-hasan-piker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came in extra hot</a> with “Terminally-ill 9/11 hero blasts Zohran Mamdani for associating with terror sympathizer Hasan Piker."</p><p>Piker has taken flack for his “America deserved 9/11” line for years, despite being correct. There is no point in relitigating it, so I’ll let my own book (<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Stream Big</em>, in stores now</a>) do it for me:</p><blockquote><p>In 2019, Twitch suspended [Piker’s] channel for seven days after he said, “America deserved 9/11,” igniting a full-on Fox News firestorm fronted by Republican congressman Dan Crenshaw. Granted, Piker made it personal by joking about Crenshaw’s eye during a Twitch stream (Crenshaw is a war veteran who’s missing an eye), but the bulk of his commentary was in response to Crenshaw’s assertion on an episode of the Joe Rogan podcast that prior to 9/11, Bin Laden had no reason to hate America except our “Western ideology” and that “millions” in places like Yemen and Iraq were “begging” for further United States intervention. Piker took issue with that, blaming America’s destabilizing foreign policies in the Middle East, which helped arm the groups that eventually became the Taliban and Al Qaeda, for sowing the seeds of 9/11. “We fucking totally brought it on ourselves, dude,” Piker said at the time. “We fucking did. Holy shit. Look at the way that this dipshit is running his fucking mouth, justifying genocide right now.”</p><p>This is not an uncommon set of beliefs among those who oppose American imperialism, but what Piker said—and the way he said it—was red meat to Fox’s red state crowd. Crenshaw and Fox News host Laura Ingraham largely used his comments as fodder for a conversation about how leftism is anti-American, ignoring the substance of Piker’s criticism and mocking how he spoke. It was a perfect snapshot of how difficult it can be to actually discuss thorny topics on the modern internet, especially from a socialist perspective in a country whose default is militaristic patriotism. In almost no time at all, Piker’s words were taken out of context by opportunists on Twitter and YouTube, who in turn escalated them up the opportunism food chain to Fox News. The end result was a game of telephone where everybody was screaming at the same time. Then everybody moved on, because nobody actually cared. It was all dust in the wind, all content in the end.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Since then, Piker has gone on to regularly advocate for Palestinians in the face of Israel’s genocide, which has prompted a “terror sympathizer” label from various politicans, media types, and influencers despite <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/11/un-special-committee-finds-israels-warfare-methods-gaza-consistent-genocide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observable reality</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Piker and others have called out Cuomo’s latest stunt for what it is: a sweaty, desperate ploy for relevance from a campaign that’s grasping at straws (when it’s not <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2025/07/andrew-cuomo-zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-election-adams.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">copying its supposed existentially threatening enemy outright</a>).</p><p>“These guys are incredibly desperate, and they’ll get even more racist as the election nears,” Piker said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjVeNKYJy3E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a recent stream</a>. “I suspect that they’ll do a big push around 9/11 as well to try to, like, associate Zohran Mamdani with 9/11, because they’re just leaning on Islamophobia. That’s it. Zohran is Muslim. They’re trying to fucking be like: ‘Yeah, Muslim guy kind of did 9/11. His people did 9/11. Remember 9/11? His people did it. Do you want an insider to do 9/11 again?’”</p><p>“Judge me by my enemies,” Piker <a href="https://x.com/hasanthehun/status/1965541497853636821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added on Twitter</a>, referencing Cuomo. “Another <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/26/cuomo-sexual-harassment-doj-00138140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sex pest</a>.”</p><p>Other political content creators asked a salient question: Who is this even for?</p><p>"Imagine you are a New Yorker who knows who Hasan Piker is,” said the Majority Report’s Sam Seder <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOZTB4cjqYx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a recent broadcast</a>. “When you see that picture of him with Zohran Mamdani, is your reaction going to be 'Oh my god, Mamdani has shook hands or had sat down at a table with Hasan Piker?’ Is your reaction gonna be like 'Oh my god, Zohran I was thinking of voting for, but Hasan Piker? Oh my god, that's terrifying.' This is so out of touch. It's fascinating."</p><p>"They're trying to audition for Zionist donors who hate Hasan," replied cohost Emma Vigeland.&nbsp;</p><p>"The only person above the age of 45 in New York City who knows who Hasan Piker is,” said Seder, “is the guy from the ADL.”</p><p>New York City voters are <a href="https://x.com/MichaelLangeNYC/status/1965763607653969957" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">significantly more sympathetic to Palestinians</a> than they are to Israel.</p><p>In a statement to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/andrew-cuomo-throws-9-11-at-zohran-mamdani.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NY Mag</a>, Mamdani’s campaign pulled no punches.</p><p>“Andrew Cuomo knows exactly what he’s doing. He’s holding a press conference to suggest that Zohran Mamdani – who is poised to become New York’s first Muslim mayor – somehow supported 9/11. It’s vile, it’s dangerous, and it’s deliberate,” the campaign wrote. “Cuomo would rather you forget his own record: that he had to be pressured into ever setting foot in a mosque, that he’s repeatedly trafficked in Islamophobia when it suited him politically, that he’s used Muslims as convenient punching bags for decades. New Yorkers can see this for what it is – a cynical attempt to recycle the ugliest playbook in our politics. Cuomo is not protecting the memory of 9/11 victims; he’s once again desecrating it by weaponizing grief and pain for his own ambition.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/unikat-32-33-indie-games-publisher-marketing"><h3>Running A Video Games Publisher AND Marketing Agency Sounds Absolutely Exhausting</h3></a><p>'Seeing all of your different efforts, ones that are synced by the work of many people, all being unveiled at once is a cool feeling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-author-immortal-image-comics-interview"><h3>The Author Immortal Is A Metanarrative Isekai Comic That Explores The Messiness Of Separating The Art From The Artist</h3></a><p>Amid canceled creators, cultural reckonings, and A.I.’s rise, Frank Barbiere and Morgan Beem’s new Image Comics series invites readers to reclaim fantasy and confront who stories truly serve

You want an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> update? You've got an Assassin's Creed Shadows update! Well, you will tomorrow, September 11th anyway, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> did release the patch notes for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game in any case. Here's what you can expect for the Assassin's Creed Shadows 1.1.1 title update! First up is the fact that the game will be ready for its first expansion, Claws of Awaji, which is due out next week, September 16th. The level cap is also being raised to 100 to account for the expansion!
</p>
<p>
For everyone who won't be picking up the expansion, there is a new free story quest, Go With The Bo. Here you'll join Junjiro as he sets out to meet a legendary Bo master and a new weapon that Naoe can use, the Bo staff. There's also new hideout upgrades, including two more upgrade levels, 20 new enhancements, and three new Hideout levels. Upgrading the Nando to level two will now give you the ability to meditate and move the time forward to the next six o'clock, AM or PM.
</p>
<p>
If you upgrade the study to level four, scouts will now have the ability to reveal viewpoints and safehouses, and with upgrading the Kakurega to the same level, uncovering all viewpoints within a province reveals it completely.
</p>
<p>
There are two new gear quality tiers that you can upgrade your kit to if you've got your forge to level six, called mythic and artifact. "Once an item reaches a new quality, it can be further upgraded through eight additional levels to unlock its full potential," the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/62imkAfEdpZSadOqfktQHv/ac-shadows-title-update-111-release-notes">patch notes</a> explain.
</p><p>
Ubisoft still can't seem to let go of Ezio either, as in the Animus Hub there are some fresh rewards for a new project called Sanctuary. These include Ezio's outfit, Ezio's outfit but for a cat, an Ezio-themed kusarigama, and a Charm of Firenze trinket.
</p>
<p>
There are also new anomalies to be found in Awaji if you own the expansion, and cutscenes are no longer limited to 30 FPS. You'll also find a number of other fixes and tweaks, but you can read the full patch notes to learn about those small details.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Nintendo Direct that fans have been waiting for is finally here and it’s a big one. September is usually when the company has its annual blowout showcase, and after a messy first half of 2025 ahead of the Switch 2 launch, it seems like we might be getting back into a familiar flow. After a quiet couple of years, the drought may finally be over. The Switch 2 is out and Nintendo can finally wheel out the big guns.</p> <p>With Nintendo promising an hour-long livestream, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-september-12-mario-metroid-prime-4-2000624629">the September 12 Direct</a> will be the longest in the company’s history outside of the April one earlier this year for revealing the Switch 2 hardware. It also comes just ahead of the 40th anniversary of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> on September 13, suggesting plenty of Mario-themed announcements may be in tow as well. And then there’s the flurry of recently leaks from self-proclaimed insiders, some with a good enough track record to take them seriously going into the event. Here’s what we’re likely to see at the latest Nintendo Direct this Friday, from rumors and best guesses to some wild longshots that are too cool not to think about.</p> <h2><em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, and more ports</h2> <p>According to <em>Resident Evil</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1965424695731478833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1965424695731478833%7Ctwgr%5E6786e5247f19b31b1c73c98ae9cc0dc0eabda24e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fa-bunch-of-resident-evil-games-are-reportedly-getting-switch-2-ports-2000624442">leaker Dusk Golem,</a> we should expect a whole lot of Capcom’s horror series to be coming to Switch 2 in the year ahead. That includes <em>Resident Evil 7 </em>and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em>, as well as the <em>Resident Evil 2</em>,<em> 3</em>, and<em> 4</em> remakes. Notably, all of these were created on the current RE Engine, which Capcom has been using for all of its new games. Dusk Golem has suggested the newest sequel,<em> Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, will arrive on Switch 2 at some point as well.</p>

 <p>While only a port of<em> RE7</em> has been claimed to be getting revealed at this week’s Direct, fans have already started speculating about what this will mean for Capcom’s other franchises on Switch 2. Both <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> were also developed in the RE Engine, as was <em>Street Fighter 6</em> which was a launch game for the hardware back in June.</p> <p><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094">isn’t out on Switch 2 yet</a>, but there are already rumors that <em>Rebirth</em> isn’t far behind. Reliable Switch leaker NateTheHate <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n9qetv/comment/ncoma6b/">recently claimed</a> the sequel is headed to Nintendo’s new console sometime in 2026. He’s also previously reported that <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-direct-july-mario-red-dead-2-1851786219"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is being ported</a> to Switch 2, which seems likely to arrive sooner than later. That doesn’t mean either will be at this week’s Direct but they are certainly in the mix. There are rumors that<em> Starfield</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will end up on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid at some point, too.</p>

 <p>Then there’s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n9qetv/comment/ncoma6b/">very messy riddle from leaker SwitchForce</a> who was the first to reveal that a Nintendo Direct was happening on September 12. The tease is that there will be three games at the showcase with the number seven in the title. Outside of<em> FF7</em>, there’s been speculation about <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> and <em>Ace Attorney 7</em> being the others, though SwitchForce said the long-running courtroom series <a href="https://xcancel.com/INRamos13/status/1964543031216157045?t=jnplNfO2lqZpB6lvD7zsoQ&amp;s=19">definitely wouldn’t be in the livestream</a>. A more obvious choice is<em> 007 First Light</em>, which was recently at the PlayStation State of Play as well.</p> <h2>The year of <em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em></h2> <p>SwitchForce has also been teasing big Mario news at the event. “They buy the new systems for the mustache,” <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1965782433674199051">read a tweet</a> featuring a GIF of Mario from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. One theory is that the <em>Odyssey</em> team split in two, with a younger offshoot working on <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> and another developing the next 3D <em>Mario</em> game. The timing makes the reveal of<em> Super Mario Odyssey</em>‘s successor feel all but assured, though it probably won’t be the only Mario announcement in the Direct.</p>

 <p>We’re also less than a year out from <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2</em> with no real info about what the story will be or which celebrities will be joining the English-language cast. At least an initial teaser, if not a full-blown trailer, could be in the cards. Maybe we’ll even get a double feature with a tease for the upcoming <em>Zelda</em> movie in 2027 as well? It could be as simple as confirmation of whether it will be a brand-new story or not, or whether it will be another isekai tale (people from the real world magically appearing in Hyrule).</p> <p>But back to Mario. It’s his time to shine after all. The way Nintendo usually likes to handle these anniversaries means we could get a new anthology of remasters or remixes of older games in the series, or ports of more recent entries that have been languishing on old hardware like <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>&nbsp;(I’m still holding out hope for <em>Super Mario Galaxy 3</em> myself). Another Switch Online exclusive multiplayer spin-off like<em> Super Mario Bros. 35</em> doesn’t sound out of the question either. Maybe this time it’ll go from 2D side-scrolling to a <em>Fall Guys</em>-style 3D battle royale mode.</p>

 <p>Finally, we know Nintendo loves its limited-edition accessories and merchandise. A <em>Mario Bros. </em>40th anniversary Switch 2, new Amiibo, and new Switch 2 Joy-Con colors feel like an easy prediction. More exciting would be some new sort of dedicated device like the Nintendo Game &amp; Watch: Super Mario Bros., only this time with more than just the first two games. And what’s going on with that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendos-detachable-dual-screen-patent-has-been-updated/">detachable dual-screen add-on</a> that Nintendo patented? Could the Switch 2 finally get DS games coming to its subscription service?</p> <h2><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> deserves a Switch 2 upgrade</h2> <p>If the original Switch taught us anything, it’s that Nintendo loves double-dipping. Half of the first-party library for that console was just Wii U games. And I fully expect the company to maintain that pattern with Switch 2 by continuing to roll out free and paid upgrades for older games. A recent Monolith Soft job posting on social media included <a href="https://x.com/SoSnake13/status/1959893819190824996#m">fresh footage of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em></a> that appeared to show it running at a much higher resolution. Those open-world RPGs have always struggled on the first Switch, leaving fans pining not only for <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 4</em> on Switch 2 but also upgrades for the last two numbered entries. They’re also still waiting to see what’s up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-hidden-60-fps-mode/"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>‘s hidden 60fps mode</a>.</p>

 <p>There are also still lots of other old games Nintendo can pull onto the Switch 2 in one form or another. A Wii U HD remaster of <em>Twilight Princess</em> is still MIA on modern platforms, and the original <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> could be remastered or added to the GameCube library on Switch Online. Nintendo’s also getting ready to release <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> (a release date reveal at this Direct would be nice!) and yet two of the games in the original trilogy still aren’t available to play on Switch.</p> <h2><i>Smash Bros., Animal Crossing, </i>and <em>Mother 3</em></h2> <p>Beyond the next <em>Mario</em>, there are plenty of other Nintendo franchises that are ripe for their next entries. <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> is five years old now, and <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> got its last DLC character in 2021. Despite multiple remakes in the series since, the last new<em> Luigi’s Mansion</em> was in 2019. It’s not quite time for a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> but we are getting close. And what about Nintendo’s back-bench franchises like <em>Star Fox</em>, <em>Punch-Out</em>, and <em>Pilotwings</em>? The company loves pulling from the past just as much as building new things.</p>

 <p>Speaking of new things, a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-splatoon-3-raiders-upgrade-price-maps-1851784179"><em>Splatoon</em> spin-off called <em>Raiders</em></a> was teased earlier this year and will no doubt make an appearance at the Direct if it’s coming out any time in the next 12 months. It would also be nice to see more of FromSoftware’s upcoming Switch 2 exclusive <em>The Duskbloods</em>. There’s also no word on what Platinum Games is working on for the console. Could Switch 2 be getting <em>Bayonetta 4</em> or <em>Astral Blades 2</em> anytime soon? And I know Team Ninja has been very busy lately, but it would be neat to see <em>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 4</em> confirmed.</p> <p>The deepest cut of all would be <em>Mother 3</em>, the GBA game never officially localized in the West but which is already available through Switch Online in Japan. There was a big exhibit for the series <a href="https://essential-japan.com/news/classic-rpg-earthbound-gets-major-new-exhibition-in-tokyo-this-summer/">in Tokyo this summer</a>, and this year marks the 30th anniversary of <em>Earthbound</em> coming out in the U.S. Meanwhile, 2026 will mark the 20th anniversary for <em>Mother 3</em>. Series creator Shigesato Itoi is already 76 and not getting any younger. It’s time. Seriously. Just give us <em>Mother 3</em>. Hell, give us <em>Mother 4</em>! Or even a 3D remake of <em>Earthbound</em>. How much money do I need to spend these <a href="https://www.1101.com/mother_project/items/goldbox5.html"><em>Earthbound</em> figures</a> to make it happen?</p>

              <p>Now that the film and TV industries have finally cracked the code to making decent, sometimes great, live-action adaptations of video games, there’s actually good reason to pay attention to the developments of these works. To be excited about them, even. One of the latest games to get the treatment is none other than Xbox 360-era darling <i>BioShock</i>. The first one (not <i>Infinite</i>, thank god).</p> <p>As reported by <i>The Direct</i>, producer Roy Lee (<a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345"><i>A Minecraft Movie</i></a>, <i>Weapons</i>, <i>The Long Walk</i>) said that while everything else about the movie must be kept secret, “it’s definitely going to be based on the first <i>BioShock</i> game.” The deep sea adaptation hit a snag after some necessary script work, but it looks like it’s on track; now it just awaits director Francis Lawrence (<i>Constantine</i>, <i>The Hunger Games</i>, <i>The Long Walk</i>) who first has to wrap work on <i>The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping</i>.</p> <p>While I’ve been something of a hater of the non-stop barrage of live-action video game adaptations, I find the idea of bringing the first <i>BioShock</i> “to life” as a big-budget movie a neat proposition. Sure, the story is the most obvious expression of why <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>’s themes are stupid, but the setting, the underwater city of Rapture, was a real treat to explore, and seeing it reproduced on the big screen should be a treat.</p> <p>As a thematic device, Rapture is a pretty straightforward tool for skewering libertarian-minded politics, but as a setting, it’s dreamy and atmospheric, with tremendous potential for some seriously cool set and prop design. And if Francis Lawrence’s work on 2007’s <i>I Am Legend</i> is anything to go by, the man knows how to work well with evocative settings. Who knows, maybe we’ll take some better lessons away from this trip down to the doomed ocean floor city than we did the first time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Yesterday, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/crusader-kings-iii-the-kotaku-review-1844848772">Crusader Kings 3</a></em> released a new DLC for the popular historical strategy game. The reaction to it was very negative, with complaints about it being small and broken, as well as including features that some players felt should have been in the main game. Now, the game’s QA manager has issued a lengthy apology and explained what happened.</p> <p>On September 9, Paradox Interactive released the “Coronations” DLC pack for <em>Crusader Kings 3</em>. This is just one of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/">many, many DLCs and expansions</a> that have been released for the large-scale strategy game since it launched back in 2020. However, shortly after Coronations launched on Steam, players began sharing negative reviews and complaining that one feature of the small DLC, oaths, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1nd6c2j/i_completed_my_oath_years_ago_wtf_paradox/">was completely broken and causing problems during campaigns</a>. Others complained that the small DLC should have been a free update and argued that Paradox has been squeezing player wallets more and more with these smaller DLCs. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3315520/Crusader_Kings_III_Coronations/">The Coronations DLC now has an overall negative rating on Steam</a>.</p> <p>In response to all this negative feedback and anger, Paradox’s QA manager has posted an apology, explained what happened, and promised that the studio would do better in the future to prevent this from happening again.</p>

 <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/517472660906573991">On Thursday, <em>Crusader Kings 3</em>‘s QA manager, Riad, shared a message</a> with fans on the game’s official Steam page. According to Riad, he’s been wanting to apologize to the community for the last 24 hours and asked the “higher-ups” for permission to write an apology.</p> <p>“I’m sorry. <wbr>Coronations was not up to the standard you deserve, and that’s on me,” said Riad. “As the QA Manager for the studio, it is my job to ensure that our releases meet the [quality assurance] vision we have set out. It is clear we didn’t give the project the resources and attention it needed, and the result was a release that let you down. You have every right to be upset, and I want to acknowledge that openly.”</p>

  <p>Riad explained that the studio has been “pouring enormous effort” into the next massive <em>Crusader Kings 3</em> expansion, All Under Heaven. According to the QA boss, it’s the biggest expansion the studio has ever made and “basically every resource” is “committed” to making sure the expansion is “up to [fan] expectations.” However, this led to other projects at Paradox, like the Coronations DLC, having fewer resources and staff. And while Riad is “very proud” of what the team was able to pull off with limited resources, the QA boss called the whole situation “unfair” to both fans and the devs. Riad also blamed “last-minute” changes for oaths being broken in the new DLC and claimed the studio was going to be more “stringent” about these tweaks.</p> <p>“Many of us on the team, myself included, joined Paradox as fans of the games. Meeting you at events…hearing your stories, and seeing how much <em>Crusader Kings 3 </em>means to you is what makes this work so meaningful,” said Riad. “That’s why it hurts so much when we fuck up like this. We don’t take your trust for granted, and I want to do my best to ensure we earn it back.”</p> <p>Riad says that there is at least one more patch on the way to fix more issues in the Coronations DLC and added, “Thank you for holding us accountable and for continuing to care about this game as much as we do. We will do better.”<wbr><wbr><wbr><wbr></p>

                <p>From Software's games tend to be challenging for most players, and the developer is making things even harder with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-about-to-get-harder-for-those-wanting-a-challenge/1100-6534351/" data-ref-id="1100-6534351">Deep of Night</a> mode. Before that launches later this week, Elden Ring Nightreign has received patch 1.02.2 with new bug fixes and gameplay tweaks. From Software has also shared a video that breaks down some of the changes coming in Deep of Night.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-qY-Lb37eE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M-qY-Lb37eE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>One of the ways Deep of Night will keep players on edge is that they won't know which Night Lord they're actually facing until the battle begins. Flexibility is going to be the key to overcoming those battles, and the video suggests preparing relic presets before going into those fights.</p><p>More powerful enemies will appear throughout Deep of Night, and players will have the opportunity to pick up weapons that can dispatch them. However, those weapons will have a detrimental effect on player characters that may make battles even more grueling. As players go deeper into Deep of Night, their enemies will become increasingly difficult.</p><p>In the patch notes, From Software indicated that Everdark Sovereign Libra may be a little easier going forward because his Condemned warriors will now have less damage negation and they will drop items that can help players in-battle.</p><p>Guardian class heroes will be receiving increased strength and dexterity when leveling up, as well as a larger range for their ultimate art's attack.

            <p>
Cooking is a thing I think about almost on a daily basis, not because of the usual pesky reason that is my mortal coil demanding sustenance, but because I love to do it! Having a family background in hospitality will do that to you. Of course, doing this whole writing about games thingy is a bit of a different beast, but cooking does still often crop up in games. My only problem is I often wish it was a central aspect of a game, rather than a singular, miniscule feature. Lucky for me, a new restaurant management <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-hearth-and-harbour">The Hearth and Harbour</a> from the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-pale-beyond">The Pale Beyond</a> has just been announced!
</p>
<p>
In The Hearth and Harbour, you play as Kit, who's left their home behind in hopes of finding a new life, all while trying to avoid a war that's on the way. Kit ends up in a harbour city called Lewthport, acquiring a rundown restaurant to restore - though this does require paying off a substantial loan. That's where you come in! It's up to you to decide what kind of establishment this becomes, like a greasy spoon, a fancy bistro, or something a bit gourmet.

<p>
What this means in practical terms is choosing the layout and decor in the first instance, and once you're up and running, The Hearth and Harbour turns into a turn-based tactical game where you have to seat customers, take orders, and make sure food arrives in good time. Happier customers, more money.
</p><p>
Outside of working hours, you're able to wander around Lewthport. There's a market to pick up ingredients from, you can build relationships with your suppliers, maybe head to the pub for a pint. There's an opportunity to build a community here, and subsequently that affects how successful your restaurant ends up. You have to make important narrative choices through conversations too, it all seems quite neatly complex.
</p>
<p>
Not only is it made by The Pale Beyond developer Saltstore Studios, but The Hearth and Harbour is set in the same world and time period as the survival game. There's no release date just yet, but you can count me in on keeping an eye on this one. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2528170/The_Hearth_and_Harbour/">wishlist it on Steam</a> now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sega has announced that a Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds single player demo is coming on 17th September, letting you check out the arcade kart racer ahead of its full release on 25th September.</p>
<p>The demo will be available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC and Nintendo Switch, but while the game is coming to PS4 and Xbox One, those platforms are being left out of the fun for now. This&nbsp;single player demo is following on from the Open Network Test that took place at the end of August – which had similar platform restrictions.</p>


<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is Sega’s latest crack at the kart racer, bringing an interdimensional twist to the familiar racing game formula. Each race will warp you to a zone known as a CrossWorld for the second of its three laps, while there’s an influx of non-Sega characters, including Hatsune Miku, Ichiban Kasuga from Like A Dragon, Joker from Persona 5. and even Pac-Man.</p>
<p>Perhaps more impactful, though, is the depth of customisation available to players through the Gadget Plates system.These let you equip a whole bunch of car-modifying Gadgets with two rows of three slots to fill up how you see fit. Gadgets take up a number of slots and then modifying everything from the vehicle speed and acceleration, to letting you carry three items, doubling boost, increasing the chances of particular item types, and making certain items more powerful.</p>

<p>We’ve been hands on with Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds a couple times, most recently experiencing the Race Park modes at Gamescom. I said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/26/sonic-racing-crossworlds-preview-teaming-up-in-the-race-park/">our preview</a>, “Is Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds going to be able to shine as brightly as a certain plumber’s karting escapades? You’d doubt it, but I certainly appreciate how different it looks and feels. This game is trying to put its own stamp on the genre, the visuals are right out of the classic blue sky Sega arcade game style, the racing is fast and snappy, and the customisation potential for the Gadget Plate is crazily broad. Adding various twists and spins on the core racing is just the icing on the Sonic-shaped cake.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/frys-electronics-store-abandoned-liminal-phoenix-az-2000624785</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/soon-to-be-demolished-fry%E2%80%99s-electronics-is-your-daily-dose-of-liminal-dread.1294182/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The world of gaming and consumer electronics kinda feels like a liminal space right now if you grew up during the ‘00s, ‘90s, or earlier decades. The brick-and-mortar locations that many of us would visit to pick up a new game or simply to wander around and kill some time are increasingly empty, destined for destruction or for uses far removed from what they were before. And as physical media continues to be squeezed out of gaming thanks to the convenience of digital distribution and silly stuff like Nintendo’s Game Key-Cards, it doesn’t look like that’s likely to change anytime soon.</p> <p>If you’re looking to steep yourself in that strange feeling of seeing a world frozen in a state of abandonment, might I divert your attention to a set of photos from a vacant Fry’s Electronics store in Phoenix Arizona?</p>  <p>This emptied store came up on my radar while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/comments/1nd42uk/frys_electronics_soon_to_be_demolished/">browsing Reddit’s r/LiminalSpace</a> (an experience that pairs well with <a href="https://somafm.com/darkzone/">SomaFM’s Dark Zone station</a>, I might add). Vast empty aisles and hanging signs advertising products that are nowhere to be found–it sure is a mood. And though the Aztec-themed stylings of this particular location use some different cultural affectations, its abandoned state reminds me of <a href="https://youtu.be/oysS9lBP644">the Las Vegas section of <i>Horizon: Forbidden West</i></a>, with notably less water and fewer robot dinosaurs (I hope).</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, this location is destined for demolition, so future Aloy will not be battling a Tideripper in here. Check out a walkthrough of <a href="https://youtu.be/Mx92kBmxzAY">this abandoned location here</a>:</p>   <p>Fry’s Electronics started closing all of its stores on February 24, 2021, a victim of the massive shift toward online shopping and the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. Being an East Coaster, I never had the chance to check out one of these stores. We have plenty of MicroCenters here, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/comments/1nd42uk/comment/ndejf78/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">as one Redditor commented</a>, MicroCenter “lacks the personality” of what we can see even in the shots of this abandoned Fry’s.</p>

 <p>Elsewhere in the comments of the Reddit post highlighting the Phoenix Fry’s location, folks are shouting out the variety of themes Fry’s had across its various locations. A San Fernando Valley one was<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5SBIy4xBdA/?hl=en"> based on <i>Alice in Wonderland</i></a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/kC9clA3oRPg">Another in Austin, Texas had music themes</a>, with a piano-shaped entrance. San Jose’s had <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CWUPs3TViVBdt5o28">a Mayan temple motif</a>.</p>  <p>It feels a bit strange to be basking mournfully in the liminal vibes of an abandoned big box store, since Fry’s was, after all, just another business like any other, a capitalist enterprise concerned only with amassing profit. Now the big chains are the food. Circle of capitalist life. I’m sure there’s an interesting academic article on that somewhere.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite's</a> latest update just introduced a fan-favorite game mode that will have players nostalgic for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-reach/" data-ref-id="5000-43545">Halo: Reach</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, Invasion has made its Halo Infinite debut, just in time for the 15th anniversary of Bungie's last Halo game on September 14. The asymmetrical, one-sided objective mode originally saw Spartans and Elites attacking or defending in Halo: Reach, with the objective for the attackers changing depending on what phase of the map was currently being played. Each team also sported unique weapon loadout options depending on whether they were on the Spartan or Elite side, further emphasizing the mode's asymmetrical nature.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwreSlUctI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CXwreSlUctI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As broken down in a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/invasion" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Halo Waypoint blog</a>, the Invasion in Halo Infinite is mostly as players remember, minus the ability to play as Elites. Instead, one team will play as Spartans affected by a malignant Banished AI and will sport more Banished/Covenant weapon loadouts similar to that used by the Elite team in Halo: Reach. The mode also originally featured the ability to spawn on a "buddy" on the same team, a feature returning for Halo: Infinite's version of the game mode.</p><p dir="ltr">There will be six Invasion maps made by the game's Forge community, two of which, Breakpoint and Recovery, are remakes of Halo: Reach Invasion maps.</p><p dir="ltr">Invasion is part of Halo Infinite's Warpath update, which additionally adds a new Operation Pass that includes the new Lancer armor set and additional weapon cosmetics. The Operation Pass is available for free until October 7, though the paid premium version of the pass doesn't expire and can be worked towards after that date.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, developer Halo Studios added the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-update-brings-back-something-missing-for-15-years/1100-6533677/" data-ref-id="1100-6533677">Falcon to Halo Infinite as part of its Fall Update 2025</a>, a flying vehicle that last appeared in Halo: Reach. That update additionally added a new weapon, the Vestige Carbine, that is in some ways similar to Halo: Reach's Needle Rifle.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the next entry in the Halo franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">Microsoft has confirmed multiple new Halo games</a> are in the works but haven't shared more details. Halo Studios (formerly 343) revealed last year that future games in the series would be built using Unreal Engine 5. Halo Studios has <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/06/halo-studios-confirms-major-reveal-to-take-place-later-this-year" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teased some kind of announcement for later this year</a>, but it remains to be seen what it could be.</p><p dir="ltr">The end of this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a> in June saw Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer allude to a new Halo title in 2026 as part of Xbox's 25th anniversary, stating fans would see "the return of a classic that's been with us since the beginning."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here-are-all-the-announcements-from-acclaim%E2%80%99s-showcase.1294155/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Acclaim has just finished its first showcase after the company was resurrected, having previously closed down in 2004. In today’s showcase, Acclaim has shown what games it has on the cards with lots of new IPs, with some of the announced games out today. So, what was announced. Keep reading to find out and get the details.</p>
<p><iframe title="GRIDbeat! – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TATp91aZGe0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>GRIDbeat was the first game announced during the Acclaim showcase, and it is described as a rhythm based dungeon crawler. In the game, you are a hacker who has breached the Knoss.OS, a corporate network from which you have stolen some files. However, the system will not let you escape easily, so you have to navigate 50 levels while avoiding the various security protocols. Every move you make has to be in line with the beat of the music. As you make progress you will unlock software tools to assist with fending off the security threats, and be guided by your assistant Dot. A release date is yet to be confirmed for GRIDbeat, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3243370/GRIDbeat/">wishlist it.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Basketball Classics – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_CRBRrUClc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Basketball Classics is not a new release but has been on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/819630/Basketball_Classics/">PC via Steam </a>since 2019. It is a pixel styled basketball game that spans decades and boasts thousands of players. As you can see from the trailer it is a simplified basketball game which includes a story mode, and you can unlock Legend characters for your teams too. It is currently on sale for £2.51, with the regular price being £7.19. Basketball Classics will be coming to consoles, though a release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pixel Washer – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHk6rCKKkEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pixel Washer looks like a game where someone was a fan of PowerWash Simulator but wondered how the game would play if you were a pig. In Pixel Washer, that question is answered as you are a pig that loves to power wash everything. You start cleaning at home with your basic washer, but as you earn money you can unlock more powerful washers and take on the bigger jobs around town. There also seem to be a couple of twists, with the trailer showing the pig fighting or washing a dragon. This is not a newly announced game, with it first appearing on Steam in 2023 but Acclaim is now taking on publishing duties. A release date has not been set.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Tossdown – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PgpOFBYTNKU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tossdown is a package delivery game with chaos imbued within it. At least that is what the trailer is saying and showing. In Tossdown, you have to deliver packages on time while avoiding hazards like meteors, missiles, enemy gunmen, and a lot more. You can unlock powerups and perks to help fight back against the various dangers, and to assist you with making sure deliveries are made on time. A release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GROUND ZERO HERO – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s6nmoH5bTTU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ground Zero Hero is a survival action roguelite in which you fight off various mutants that stalk you across a post apocalyptic wasteland. The best way to fight these mutants is to become a mutant yourself, which gives you access to different abilities that help you take on the hordes. There are different wastelands to explore with their own enemies and mutations to unlock. It seems you can combine different mutations to create a very powerful super mutant. There is a demo coming for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2570580/Ground_Zero_Hero/">Ground Zero Hero on Steam</a>, and a release date is yet to be set.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Talaka – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QiM8nJoUL_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Talaka is definitely one of the more interesting looking games to come out of the Acclaim showcase. The art style makes this action platformer roguelite look like a painting in motion. Talaka brings together Afro-Brazilian mythology, with some of the subjects of those myths out to kill Talaka. However, some of the Orisha gods are present to aid Talaka with blessings, but she will need to make choices that will affect the story and lead to branching narratives. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3815370/Talaka/">Talaka is available to wishlist on Steam</a> now. A release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="HyperYuki: Snowboard Syndicate – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hH9sIotgOk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>HyperYuki: Snowboard Syndicate may be one for those of you who played the SSX games, especially SSX Tricky. It looks like a stylised snowboarding racing game, and it will have three different modes. The first is Challenge Mode, in which you need to hit high scores by pulling off tricks, collect items, and complete objectives. Race Mode is self explanatory as you race against others to cross the finish line first. The final mode is Chill Mode where you can freely explore tracks and look for secrets. HyperYuki: Snowboard Syndicate will have multiplayer and it can be<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3082730/HYPERyuki_Snowboard_Syndicate/"> wishlisted on Steam.</a></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH07w3-bMv4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest is a 2D platformer set in the mind of Fletcher. After a psychologist appointment goes wrong, Fletcher gets trapped in his own mind prison and needs to navigate it to escape. The game is a another roguelike metroidvania, so you will need to throughly explore all of the various secrets locked up in Fletcher’s mind to get him out of there. You can wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2725470/The_Prisoning_Fletchers_Quest/">The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest</a>, and a demo is on the way too.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Katanaut – #PlayAcclaim | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OAvYl2TOwPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The final game announced during Acclaim’s showcase was Katanaut. It is a very gory 2D action platformer, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3032830/Katanaut/">it is out now on Steam</a> for the promotional price of £11.99. Katanaut is a roguelite set on a space station that has been overwhelmed by cosmic horrors. As you explore and slash your way through the hordes you can unlock new abilities and weapons to use across runs, with runs themselves differing as the pathways change around you.</p>

			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/acclaim-returns-from-the-dead-with-a-focus-on-supporting-indie-studios-and-original-ip/">announcing its return earlier this year</a>, 90s videogame publisher Acclaim is no longer just a former publisher from the 90s, but a modern-day publisher in today's videogame industry.

            <p>
It is always an exciting time when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/red-candle-games">Red Candle Games</a> are up to something. The sheer variety they've put on display with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detention">Detention</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a>, and most recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nine-sols">Nine Sols</a> is nothing to sniff at. Now, it appears they're gearing up for the next project in an appropriately mysterious way. Earlier today, the official Red Candle Games YouTube channel shared a video titled "The Dark Legacy of the Sun Tribe," and it certainly is… something.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing is done in one of those creepypasta kinda video essays, the kind where the voice over has either been pitched down, or performed by a robot, or both. And it's all a bit, well, for lack of a better word, creepy. It opens up with the line "are you really human?" which is a question I thought only Yoko Taro was allowed to ask in video games, but nevertheless, an off putting way to start things.
</p>

<a aria-label="The Dark Legacy of the Sun Tribe" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynAl_k7AkVM?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">
<span>The Dark Legacy of the Sun Tribe</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynAl_k7AkVM?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ynAl_k7AkVM?autoplay=1" title="The Dark Legacy of the Sun Tribe">
</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynAl_k7AkVM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
What proceeds is something that sounds like a conspiracy narrated by someone called Yuuki about human evolution, and that aforementioned dark legacy of the sun tribe. A tale is spun about an ancient bamboo scroll written in a language never seen before, a real Chinese alchemist named Xu Fu who sought after immortality by venturing to a place called Penglai, and a civilian scholar desperate to learn more.
</p><p>
A couple things worth noting here: the beginning of the video talks about people born with four fingers. Yi, the protagonist of Nine Sols, is a member of a race called the Solarians, who all have four fingers. Solarian obviously stems from solar, much like the sun tribe mentioned in this teaser. Immortality also comes up in Nine Sols, and Penglai is the name of the planet that Solarians are from. So, I don't know about you, but this sure does seem like something Nine Sols is on the way.
</p>
<p>
A sequel? DLC? Something else entirely? It's possible, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-pleasant-surprise-the-gorgeous-sekiro-like-metroidvania-nine-sols-has-a-prequel-manga">get a prequel manga earlier this year</a>. For now, we'll just have to let the conspiracy unravel itself…
