            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>AI tools aren’t exactly the demons most people make them out to be; if you know how to use them right. At this point, there are more than a dozen options out there, each offering a whole bunch of beneficial features that you can use to excel in studies, research, and even in your professional life. If you want to compare them all in one place and choose what works best for you, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p>ChatPlayground AI is a platform that lets you explore and compare outputs from 25+ top AI tools side by side, in a single place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6109/">A one-month subscription usually costs $29, but Stacksocial is offering<strong> lifetime access</strong> to the platform for just $80, after a whopping 87% discount.</a> It’s a leftover Black Friday deal, but it’s selling out fast. At the time of writing, over 500 subscriptions have already been sold, so you don’t have a lot of time left to save. Jump in on it while it’s still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6109/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>All Your Favorite AI Tools In One Place</h2>
<p>Starting with what the subscription gets you; it offers unlimited prompts across all the AI platforms, whether it’s GPT, Gemini, or DeepSeek. There is no lengthy requirement sheet with this one. Your system just needs to have the latest version of Chrome, Edge, or Firefox to get started. Once your purchase is successful, Stacksocial will send the relevant links and code to your email, which you need to redeem within 30 days of your purchase.</p>
<p>The platform gets you access to over 25 popular AI giants like GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 1.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3, and more. Entering a single prompt delivers instant results from various AI models simultaneously, letting you compare their responses and pick the best according to your needs. You can use it to create images using text, refine text, edit documents, generate summaries for research papers that would normally take hours to read, and get quick answers to all your questions. Importing your own files is supported just as well.</p>



<p>There’s a built-in web search feature for up-to-date responses, and you can even refer back to previous conversations you had with the AI tools whenever you want. The Chrome extension integrates the platform into your everyday life, making it easy to get the help you want within seconds, without even launching the program manually. Those struggling to get efficient responses can head over to the prompt library that includes a wide range of ready-to-use prompts for optimal results. Best of all, the models can understand and respond in over 100 languages, so you can use what you’re most comfortable with.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6109/">On a normal day, you’d pay around $619 to enjoy lifetime access to all these features, but this deal takes a massive $539 off that not-so-friendly price tag</a>. But as you’d expect, it expires soon, so it’s best to grab it while it’s still live. If you want to explore more, other plans are also discounted. For instance, a lifetime subscription to the Pro plan is going for $50 after an 85% discount, while the Basic plan can be yours for $35, down from $204. That said, there are plenty of other lingering Black Friday deals on Stacksocial that are still going strong, even after the main event has wrapped up. It’s a great time to treat yourself to a service that feels slightly out of reach the rest of the year, and even gift it to a loved one!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-out-of-time-with-thousands-of-galaxy-tab-a9-goes-zero-profit-for-cyber-monday-clearance-2000648929</link>
            <guid>1368748</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been waiting for Cyber Monday to get a cheap Samsung tablet, your wait is over – and we’re not talking about the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra which costs almost $1,000 with premium specs. Instead, we’re talking about a budget-friendly Galaxy Tab A9+ model that can handle everyday tasks without breaking the bank. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">has cut the price of this 64GB/WiFi version from $219 to $139</a>, which makes it a great deal for an 11-inch tablet that can do a lot of things.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>11-Inch Screen</h2>
<p>The <strong>Tab A9+ has an 11-inch TFT LCD panel with a resolution of 1920×1200</strong> which makes text sharp enough to read and colors bright enough to stream video. The <strong>90Hz refresh rate</strong> makes scrolling through social media and web pages feel much smoother than standard 60Hz displays, and it adds a little bit of fluidity that makes the whole experience better.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Atmos processing powers</strong> the quad speakers on all four edges which give surprisingly strong sound and it <strong>creates spatial sound</strong> that makes movies, games, and music sound better than most tablets in this price range. The speakers make dialogue clear without muddiness and are loud enough to fill a small room. This audio setup turns the tablet into a portable entertainment device that doesn’t need external speakers or headphones to enjoy content fully.</p>
<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 chipset and 4GB of RAM <strong>work together to handle everyday tasks</strong> like web browsing, email, social media, and streaming services without any annoying lag or stuttering. The 64GB of internal storage fills up quickly with apps, photos, and content that can be accessed offline. The good news is that there’s also a <strong>microSD card slot can hold cards up to 1TB</strong> which is a cheap way to add more storage.</p>



<p>With multi-window display, <strong>you can run more than one app on the same screen</strong> at the same time. For example, you can split the screen between a web browser and a note-taking app or watch YouTube while checking your email. This feature turns the tablet from a simple device for consuming content into a modest productivity tool that can handle basic work tasks or multitasking situations. <strong>Samsung’s One UI interface makes Android 13</strong> work better on larger screens by using gestures that are easy to understand and tablet-specific layouts that make better use of the space than phones that are blown up to tablet size.</p>
<p>With<em> Quick Share</em>, you can <strong>move files between Samsung devices and even iOS devices with just a few taps</strong>. This means you don’t have to email attachments or upload files to the cloud when you want to share photos or documents. You can charge the tablet with a USB-C cable and it usually lasts 8 to 10 hours of mixed use, like streaming, browsing, and light gaming, before you need to plug it in.</p>
<p>You can save $80 on a tablet that has really useful features at a low price by getting the Galaxy Tab A9+ for $139 instead of $219. For less than what many 8-inch tablets with worse specs cost, you get an 11-inch 90Hz display, quad speakers with Dolby Atmos, decent performance for everyday tasks, and Samsung’s polished software experience.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-forgot-profit-on-dualsense-for-cyber-monday-drops-below-black-friday-price-to-all-time-low-2000648926</link>
            <guid>1368742</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The DualSense Edge controller from Sony is rarely on sale because competitive gamers and PlayStation fans who want pro-level customization always want it. The price finally went down to $169 on Black Friday which is less than the usual $199 but Amazon is going even lower for Cyber Monday, bringing it down to $159. If you waited until Black Friday to see if the deal would get better, your patience has paid off with this new record low that makes upgrading to pro controller features much cheaper than it was just a few days ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6119/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Customized Controller</h2>
<p>Sony <strong>made the DualSense Edge with replaceable stick modules</strong> to fix the most common problem with modern controllers: worn potentiometers inside the thumbstick assemblies that cause analog stick drift. If you use the controller for months or years and it starts to drift, you can just replace the module instead of the whole $200 controller and this modular method saves money in the long run and keeps your investment working like new.</p>



<p>What’s more, <strong>the two back buttons can be attached to either backplate</strong> and give you a total of four extra inputs that you can program to act like any other button on the controller. This placement lets you keep your thumbs on the analog sticks during important times instead of moving them to the face buttons and it gives you an edge in shooters where jumping or crouching while keeping aim control makes the difference between winning and losing.</p>
<p>You <strong>can set how far the L2 and R2 triggers travel before registering a full press</strong> with adjustable trigger stops. There are three preset distances that cover everything from hair-trigger sensitivity to full range motion. The shortest setting is best for fast-paced FPS games because it lets you fire weapons with very little finger movement, which cuts down on reaction time by milliseconds that are important in competitive play.</p>
<p>You can<strong> completely change the functions of any button on the PS5</strong> by going to the accessory settings: You can also turn off certain buttons if you keep accidentally pressing them. You can change crouch from circle to a back button, jump from L1 to L2, or make your own layouts that work with how you remember how to play on other platforms. The controller saves these settings to three different profiles that are stored in the hardware: You can switch between them right away by holding down the profile button and picking the one you want. This means you can have a profile that works best for Call of Duty, one that works best for Fortnite, and one that works best for racing games without having to change settings every time you switch games.</p>



<p>The <strong>braided USB cable that comes with the controller has a connector housing that keeps it in place</strong> so you won’t accidentally disconnect it while you’re playing wired. This also means you won’t have to deal with the annoyance of losing connection in the middle of a match because the cable wiggled loose. The carrying case protects the controller and holds all the extra parts, like spare stick caps, back button sets, and the connector housing.</p>
<p>The battery life is a little shorter than the standard DualSense because of the extra hardware for customization features: It <strong>usually lasts 5–7 hours of active play</strong> while the base model lasts 8-12 hours.</p>
<p>Grabbing the DualSense Edge for $159 instead of $199 saves you $40 on professional controller features that typically command premium pricing across the gaming industry. With the Cyber Monday pricing ending soon, this record low represents your best opportunity to upgrade your PS5 gaming experience before stock clears.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-held-back-during-black-friday-now-crashes-headphones-to-record-low-to-empty-final-stock-2000648922</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bose surprised shoppers who thought Black Friday deals were over by dropping the price of its <em>QuietComfort</em> noise cancelling headphones to an all-time low on Cyber Monday, and this makes it much easier to choose between Sony, Sonos or Apple models. These headphones <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/">are now $199 on Amazon, down from their usual price of $349 which is a record-breaking 43% discount</a> that makes premium noise cancellation available at a mid-tier price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great ANC Headphones</h2>
<p>Bose designed these headphones with <strong>cutting-edge noise-canceling technology that uses both active electronic canceling and passive physical isolation</strong> from the over-ear design, and it makes a quiet bubble even in loud places like airplane cabins or busy coffee shops. The system listens to background noise thousands of times per second and makes sound waves that are exactly opposite to the noise coming in, so it cancels it out before it reaches your ears.</p>



<p>Aware mode changes things up by u<strong>sing external microphones to send sounds from the outside world into your ears</strong>: This lets you hear announcements, conversations or traffic without taking off your headphones. You can talk to people while wearing the headphones in this transparency mode, but voices sound a little different than when you hear them directly. You can also switch between modes with the push of a button, so you can do it right away when a flight attendant comes up to you or when you need to cross the street safely.</p>
<p>The <strong>audio quality has the warm, bass-heavy sound that Bose fans love</strong>&nbsp;<strong>with deep lows</strong> that make kick drums and basslines sound heavier without drowning out vocals or high-frequency details. You can change the bass, mid-range and treble levels in the Bose Music app to fit your preferences or make up for how you hear things. This changes the sound profile from bass-heavy to balanced or treble-focused, depending on what you like.</p>



<p>The soft memory foam and synthetic protein leather that make up the <strong>plush over-ear cushions feel good against your skin</strong> and make a good seal without putting too much pressure on your head. The padded headband spreads the weight evenly across the top of your head and stop the pressure points that make you uncomfortable after wearing them for hours at a time. These headphones are comfortable enough for long flights or full workdays without making your ears tired or giving you headaches.</p>
<p>With noise cancellation on, <strong>the battery can last up to 24 hours on a single charge</strong> which means you can go for days without needing to charge it again, even on long international flights. With USB-C quick charging, you can listen for 2.5 hours after just 15 minutes of charging, which is great if you forget to charge it overnight. When Bluetooth isn’t available or the battery runs out, the included audio cable with an inline microphone turns these into wired headphones.</p>
<p>Right now, you can get these <em>QuietComfort</em> headphones for $199 instead of $349, which is $150 less than the usual price for noise-canceling technology. You’re getting Bose’s best ANC performance, a battery life of 24 hours, comfortable all-day wear, and better sound quality for less than what Sony’s WH-1000XM4 usually costs on sale.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-all-in-for-cyber-monday-34-viewfinity-borderless-monitor-is-now-priced-like-a-budget-no-name-brand-2000648828</link>
            <guid>1368733</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The last place you want to feel cramped is your computer screen. You can only keep so many windows and tabs open at the same time before a small screen makes you feel claustrophobic, and small screens for gaming? Yeah, they suck. This year make Cyber Monday the day you lose your big-screen FOMO forever — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6107/">Samsung’s 34-inch ViewFinity Ultra-WQHD S50GC ultrawide monitor is practically begging you to click Buy Now at Amazon at just $210.</a></p>
<p>This Cyber Monday deal is taking an already well-priced ultrawide from a leading manufacturer — the ViewFinity S50 normally sells for $330 — and turns into an absolute must-have at 36% off. With this 21:9 ultrawide format creating an enormous horizontal space for work or play and doing it with outstanding resolution and super-fast refresh time, it’s one of the most versatile monitors available in this price range for Cyber Monday or any other day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6107/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Space, More Potential</h2>
<p>Unless you’ve already experienced the difference between a standard 16:9 monitor and a 21:9 ultrawide, it has to be seen to be truly believed. It’s not just the screen that’s bigger, the larger aspect ratio actually shows you more picture that is lost in 16:9 mode. That’s especially true for many games, where that extra peripheral vision comes in exceptionally handy.</p>
<p>The extra visual real estate isn’t wasted on a lousy picture, either. The Samsung ViewFinity S50’s WQHD (Wide Quad High Definition) images are delivered with a crisp 100Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync support for silky-smooth motion and no tearing. It’s HDR10 with support for over a billion colors and a 3000:1 static contrast ratio, so your photo or video editing work can be done on a sharp and color-accurate workspace, your streaming looks amazing and moves flawlessly, and your gaming is more immersive than ever before.</p>
<p>Here’s something your 16:9 monitor almost certainly can’t compete with — the ViewFinity S50 supports Picture-by-Picture (PBP) and Picture-in-Picture (PIP). You can connect two devices — a console via the HDMI input port and a PC via the DisplayPort, for example — and see them on the same screen at the same time. Or two PCs, or a PC and a Mac — you get the idea. It’s something a $210 monitor really has no business doing.</p>



<h2>Flat Is Fine</h2>
<p>Samsung’s vast fleet of high-quality monitors includes several curved models — the ViewFinity S50 is not one of them. But, while some people swear by a curved monitor, many don’t, and they’re the ones who will be most intrigued by an exceptional monitor that gives you the ultrawide 21:9 aspect ratio and larger field of view&nbsp;<em>without</em> being curved.</p>
<p>The performance of the ViewFinity S50 certainly isn’t diminished at all by not being curved, and with TÜV-certified Intelligent Eye Care features that include adaptive brightness, blue-light reduction, and flicker-free backlight, the ViewFinity S50 also won’t wear out your eyes.</p>
<p>Cyber Monday’s traditionally the day for amazing deals on tech upgrades, and if you have an average or slightly long-in-the-tooth older monitor, the Samsung ViewFinity S50 is most definitely going to be an upgrade. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6107/">The $210 price at Amazon is also pretty much unbeatable.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> fans are saying "no to AI slop" after some believe they've discovered AI-generated images in Epic's tentpole battle royale game.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/say_no_to_ai_slop_a_billiondollar_company_should/">Reddit post</a> entitled "Say 'No' to AI slop, a billion-dollar company should have no problem supporting real artists for real art", Fortnite players have shared their thoughts on a number of alleged AI-generated images, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrk1tw7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">in-game</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrkcw00/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">posters</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrk6ski/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sprays</a>, with some suggesting a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrk2fc9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">boycott</a>.</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1pahvnv/is_this_chapter_7_art_ai_generated/">Reddit post</a> shares an in-game poster showing what's thought to be a Yeti with nine toes.</p>

</span></p><p>The discoveries come just days after Epic boss Tim Sweeney suggested requiring developers to disclose whether or not generative AI has been used during the making of a game "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">makes no sense</a>".</p>
<p>Sweeney made the remarks responding to a social media post by a former Unreal Engine developer who <a href="https://x.com/cinedatabase/status/1993757796723306612">uses generative AI in his motion capture work</a> and suggested "Steam and all digital marketplaces need to drop the 'Made with AI' label. It doesn't matter any more".</p><p>"Agreed," agreed Sweeney. "The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-whats-coming-to-fortnite-chapter-7-pacific-break">10.5 million players logged on to see Fortnite's Chapter 6 finale</a>, with another three million clocking in via livestreams. To celebrate, Epic's pulled back the covers on Chapter 7: Pacific Break, revealing new map locations, new gameplay, Simple Build, and battle pass goodies.</p>

            <p>Industry leaders have attended a memorial service for Tomonobu Itagaki, the creator of Dead or Alive and the 3D Ninja Gaiden series, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-or-alive-and-ninja-gaiden-creator-tomonobu-itagaki-has-died-age-58">died last month aged 58</a>.</p>
<p>Tomonobu Itagaki was a celebrated figure in the Japanese video game development industry. He formed Team Ninja (originally called Tecmo Creative #3) back in the late 90s, creating not only the Dead or Alive series of fighting games, but also the 3D Ninja Gaiden games.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/comments/1p8ttbe/yosuke_hayashis_eulogy_about_itagaki/">Yosuke Hayashi's eulogy about Itagaki</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Royta15/">u/Royta15</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/">ninjagaiden</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Amongst the attendees, which included Tekken director <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1993986075782717449">Katsuhiro Harada</a>, executive VP of Koei Tecmo, Yosuke Hayashi, talked of meeting the developer, working for him, and getting back in touch shortly before his death.</p>
<p>"I never thought we'd meet like this," the executive said, as translated on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/comments/1p8ttbe/yosuke_hayashis_eulogy_about_itagaki/">Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-were-so-cool-koei-tecmo-exec-makes-heartfelt-speech-at-tomonobu-itagaki-memorial/">VGC</a>). "My encounter with Itagaki-san dates back to 2001, when I joined the company as a new graduate. I was assigned to your department as a game planner. You told me you had no work for me. That's what you told me. Two weeks after I was assigned, I really had no work, haha. At the time, I lamented my bad luck, thinking it was the worst possible encounter.</p><div>

</p></div>
<p>"My most memorable memory with Itagaki-san was the development of Xbox Ninja Gaiden from 2003 to 2004. The development team was in complete chaos, and it seemed like the game would never be completed, haha. But you were the only one who didn't give up. The two of us spent 12 hours every night checking every adjustment to the game. Those six months are a treasured part of my game-development career."</p>
<p>Itagaki left the company in 2008 shortly after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doa-producer-slapped-with-sex-suit/1100-6161240/">a former co-worker sued him for sexual harassment</a>. Although he was deemed innocent by Japanese courts in 2007, he ultimately lost his executive officer role. Later in 2010, Itagaki and Koei Tecmo reached a settlement after Itagaki claimed the company was withholding bonuses for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-or-alive-4">Dead or Alive 4</a>. Itagaki moved on to develop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devils-third">Devil's Third</a> at Valhalla Game Studios.</p>
<p>Before he left the company, Itagaki reportedly told Hayashi "don't change the [Koei Tecmo] logo".</p>
<p>"No other unnecessary words were exchanged. You were so pure and cool," the executive said.</p>
<p>Hayashi also shared his last message from Itagaki in which the developer wrote: "Thank you for remembering our promise [not to change the logo]. Times have changed lately, and selling a million copies doesn't earn you much recognition from the world anymore. That's the era we've entered. Please keep making great products from now on."</p>

<p>A new Chapter has arrived in Fortnite with the launch of Chapter 7 Season 1, which brings the customary refresh of weapons and equipment found in the loot pool alongside it.</p>



<p>Fortnite Chapter 7 kicked off on the back of the huge Zero Point live event, attended by over 10 million players, which saw stars from the likes of Star Wars, Marvel, DC Comics, The Simpsons, and K-Pop Demon Hunters unite to fend off the Dark Presence.</p>



<p>Spring Break has now arrived in Fortnite as a result, and Insider Gaming has all the details on the new and unvaulted weapons in Chapter 7 Season 1.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-new-weapons-amp-equipment-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All New Weapons &amp; Equipment in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Glide time. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are eight new weapons and pieces of equipment added in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, including a new mobility item—Wingsuits.</strong></p>



<p>The importance of Wingsuits early in the season is vital following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-the-battle-bus-fortnite-chapter-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destruction of the Battle Bus</a>, as surfing the waves onto the island provide limited landing spots. If you get your hands on a Wingsuit early, traversing the map becomes much easier and you can head to further locations to hunt for loot, where there’s likely to be less competition.</p>



<p>A full list of the new weapons and equipment found in Fortnite this season are below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Iron Pump Shotgun</li>



<li>Twin Hammer Shotguns</li>



<li>Deadeye Assault Rifle</li>



<li>Holo Rush SMG</li>



<li>Vengeful Sniper Rifle</li>



<li>Arc-Lightning Gun</li>



<li>Forsaken Vow Blade</li>



<li>Wingsuit</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-unvaulted-weapons-amp-equipment-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All Unvaulted Weapons &amp; Equipment in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<p><strong>Five weapons have been unvaulted for Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, alongside the return of the All Terrain Kart and a host of healing items.</strong></p>



<p>The likes of Chug Jugs, Shield Kegs, Med Kits, Bandages, and Shield Potions remain available, while players in Zero Build can continue to find Shield Bubble Jr and Port-a-Fort items to utilize.</p>



<p>On the weapon scene, the return of the Enforcer AR provides options from mid-to-long range, while there’s plenty of options for short-range combat with the Dual Micro SMGs and Tactical Pistol.</p>



<p>All the unvaulted weapons and equipment in Fortnite this season are below.</p>



<ul>
<li>All Terrain Kart</li>



<li>Enforcer AR</li>



<li>Tactical Pistol</li>



<li>Dual Micro SMGs</li>

            <p>Surprise! Chris Redfield, Excella Gionne, and an adult version of Sherry Birkin are all on their way to Resident Evil: Survival Unit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-new-resident-evil-game-has-been-announced">Resident Evil Survival Unit was unveiled over the summer</a>. Co-developed by Aniplex Inc and Joycity Corporation, with Capcom working in "close collaboration" with the studios to "ensure authenticity and quality", the free-to-play mobile strategy game is now available. Which is why fans have already poked around in the back end of the Android version and discovered references to as-yet unreleased characters.</p>

<p>The mobile game released with 19 characters, comprising a mix of new and fresh faces. As is usually the case, some are free and some are not, but as yet, we hadn't heard anything about series stalwart Chris Redfield at all, or been officially told of the pending arrival of Sherry and Excella.</p><p>However, as reported by Portuguese site <a href="https://residentevil.com.br/noticias/chris-redfield-sherry-birkin-e-excella-gionne-estao-nos-arquivos-de-resident-evil-survival-unit/">REvil</a>, skins of a young RE1-era Redfield, Sherry, and Excella have all been discovered in the character database of the Android version, along with images of an all-new monster created especially for this game, thought to be called Mortem.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-has-v11-vacuum-black-friday-leftovers-now-near-zero-profit-to-clear-stock-for-cyber-monday-2000648918</link>
            <guid>1368577</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson still sells older models like the V8 that launched nearly a decade ago, but if you want cleaning power that really removes embedded dirt from carpets, you need something more recent with stronger suction and better brush technology. The newest Gen5 models cost around $1,000 which feels excessive for a vacuum regardless of how good it performs so finding middle ground makes sense for most households.</p>
<p>The Dyson V11 Origin hits that sweet spot with powerful suction and modern features without the premium flagship pricing and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">Amazon just dropped it to $399 for Cyber Monday weekend, down from the usual $629</a>. This marks a record low for post-Black Friday clearance and offers 37% off one of Dyson’s most capable cordless vacuums.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>185 Air Watts That Clean Carpets Deeply</h2>
<p>The <strong>Dyson V11 has 185 air watts of suction power</strong> which is 60% more than earlier V-series models, and it has enough power to pull dirt that is stuck in carpet fibers that other cordless vacuums leave behind. The motorbar cleaner head has a<strong> motorized brush bar with anti-tangle technology</strong> that actively removes hair that has gotten stuck in it while you clean. This means you won’t have to cut hair off the roller every few days which is a pain, and it is very important if you have pets or long hair in the house because regular brush bars turn into useless tangles of hair after a week of use.</p>



<p>You can<strong> choose between three power modes to control the balance</strong> between suction strength and runtime. Auto mode automatically changes the power level based on the type of floor and the amount of dirt, giving you the best cleaning while using the least amount of battery power for everyday tasks. By lowering suction, Eco mode can extend runtime by up to 60 minutes which is great for quick touch-ups or cleaning big areas with light dirt. When you have to clean up a lot of tracked-in mud or pet accidents, boost mode gives you the most suction for about five minutes. The <strong>LCD screen shows the current power mode</strong>, how much time is left until the battery runs out (down to the second), maintenance alerts when the filters need to be cleaned and blockage alerts when something blocks the system.</p>
<p>The hair screw tool has a conical brush bar that is made to spiral long hair and pet hair into the collection bin without getting tangled: It makes it very useful for cleaning upholstery, stairs, and car interiors where pet hair gets stuck deep down. The crevice tool can get into tight spaces between cushions and along baseboards. The mini soft dusting brush, on the other hand, is great for cleaning delicate surfaces like lampshades and keyboards<strong>. In just a few seconds, you can also switch to handheld mode by taking off the wand</strong>.</p>



<p>Advanced <strong>whole-machine filtration catches 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong> and keeps allergens, dust mites, and pet dander inside the sealed system instead of letting them back into the air. People with allergies will benefit greatly from this HEPA-level filtration because the air that comes out is cleaner than the air in most homes. The bagless design lets you empty the bin with just one button press which ejects dirt without you having to touch it.</p>
<p>The lithium-ion battery keeps the suction strong as it drains, unlike older nickel-based batteries which lose power slowly over time. The docking station that hangs on the wall charges the vacuum and keeps the tools that come with it close at hand so everything is organized and ready for quick cleanups. And it <strong>takes about 4.5 hours to charge from empty to full</strong>&nbsp;and you can still take the battery out if you want to buy a spare for long cleaning sessions.</p>
<p>Instead of paying $629 for the V11 Origin, you can get it for $399 and it saves you $230 on a vacuum that usually stays at a high price because it is Dyson’s best-selling model between entry-level and flagship levels. This is your last chance to get premium Dyson performance before stock runs out and prices go back up.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-have-apple-devices-anker-3-in-1-magsafe-charger-is-flying-off-the-shelves-at-a-record-low-2000648819</link>

              <p>Anker has been breaking its own records with portable charging solutions lately, and we’re here for it. If you rely on multiple devices to get through your day, like your smartphone, smartwatch, and earbuds, you need something that can top all three up without the usual cord clutter. The Anker 3-in-1 MagGo UFO charger for iOS does exactly that, and today is a great time to pick one up without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6106/">On a regular day, you’d expect to pay around $90 for it, but thanks to Cyber Monday, this all-in-one charging solution just dropped to $57, after a nice 36% discount.</a> All color options are discounted, but the prices vary. For instance, the black and pink versions are sitting at $57, while the white is going for $56, $1 less. The Teal version, on the other hand, is up for grabs at $59. All the offers are open to all shoppers, meaning you can score the discount whether you’re a Prime member or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6106/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Size of a Baseball</h2>
<p>When folded, this charger is the size of a baseball and resembles a macaron in looks. It’s much more compact than traditional adapters, meaning you can just slip it into your pocket and get going. Sturdiness comes from the built-in silicone strap, while the skin-friendly texture makes it comfortable to take it with you on the go. When opened, it offers three charging stations for three of your essentials; iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods.</p>
<p>Just drop each on its respective station, and it’s going to top them up in no time. Even better, you don’t always have to lay the whole thing open to use it. Support for Standby mode lets you keep the charger folded and still use your phone in landscape, which is perfect for when you want to stream a show, set a timer, display a calendar, or take a quick video call while it’s being powered.</p>



<p>The 15W capacity isn’t massive, but it’s enough to power your devices without much waiting. It can get an iPhone 15 Pro to 20% in 15 minutes and an Apple Watch Series 9 to 30% in 22 minutes. As for the compatibility, the charger plays nicely with iPhone Series 12 through 17 (except iPhone SE), Apple Watch Series 11/10/9/8/7 Ultra, plus Apple Watch Series 1-6, AirPods 2/3/4, and AirPods Pro 2, as well as the latest Pro 3.</p>
<p>Safety is taken just as seriously. ActiveShield 2.0 monitors temperature over 3,000,000 times per day to prevent overheating. The box comes with the wireless charging station, a 40W adapter, a 5 ft (1.5 m) USB-C to USB-C cable, a welcome guide, and a 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>This early Cyber Monday deal lets you save an impressive $33 on a compact, all-in-one charging solution that’s both efficient and portable. You can use it on your trips if you like travelling light, or even at home to reduce the typical cord clutter. In fact, it can also make a great gift for a tech enthusiast in your life! There are multiple color options to choose from, which makes it easy to pick the ones that suit your aesthetics the best. Looking for something basic? Go for the black version. Want something with a bit more personality? The pink and teal versions look stunning. Again, you might want to act fast to grab the deal, and it won’t be around for long.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Chapter 7 has kicked off in Fortnite, but an array of popular modes, including Blitz, Reload, and Fortnite OG, are not yet available in Season 1, but the roadmap has been detailed.</p>



<p>Fortnite brought an end to Chapter 6 with the thrilling Zero Point live event, showcasing a wealth of collabs with recognisable faces from K-Pop Demon Hunter, Marvel, DC Comics, Star Wars, The Simpsons, and more, all featuring.</p>



<p>Chapter 7 Season 1 is now underway, and, while not all game modes are available, Insider Gaming has the details on when to expect their return.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-reload-return-to-fortnite">When Does Reload Return to Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New map. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Reload returns to Fortnite on December 4, once the Battle Bus is back in commission and available to take players to the new Surf City map.</strong></p>



<p>The Battle Bus was destroyed in the closing moments of the Chapter 7, Season 1 trailer, though Dummy is hard at work repairing the iconic mode of transportation, and <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-seven-pacific-break-v39-00-update-notes?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games shared a Fortnite roadmap</a> for the coming weeks.</p>



<p>When Reload returns, the new map, Surf City, will be available, featuring a smaller version of the main map, with POIs including Sus Studios, Divey Dam, and Battlewood Boulevard.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-blitz-return-to-fortnite">When Does Blitz Return to Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>Blitz returns to Fortnite on December 4, the same day as Reload is back and when Ranked is available again, when the Battle Bus is back in commission.</strong></p>



<p>A new map, Starfall Island, will serve as the environment for Blitz this season, with POIs including Ritzy Redux, Holloway House, and Flowberry Fields.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-fortnite-og-return">When Does Fortnite OG Return?</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite OG players will need to wait a little while longer for the return of the mode, as it will be out of commission until December 11.</strong></p>



<p>When Fortnite OG is back, Season 7 will kick off in the mode, and the arrival could come alongside the start of the fan-favorite Winterfest event, adding extra content to the game in preparation for the holiday season.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-delulu-return-to-fortnite">When Does Delulu Return to Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>Delulu players face the longest wait of all for the mode to return, as Delulu will not be available until December 12, Epic Games has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>The proximity-chat mode is expected to stay permanently; however, following an introduction in Chapter 6, it adds to the plethora of game modes available in Fortnite.</p>

<p>According to Epic, Chapter Seven: Pacific Break "kicks off a new era" for Fortnite Battle Royale, "where some of the greatest stories are told – the Golden Coast". Expect New POIs such as Battlewood Boulevard, Sandy Strip, Wonkeeland, Classified Canyon, and more, and while the Battle Bus is out of commission, players will "Storm Surf their way to the Island instead".</p>
<p>Players can also expect new gameplay, too.</p>
<p>"In the <em>very rare occasion </em>players are downed, they can use a Self-Revive Device to revive themselves while they’re DBNO (Down But Not Out)," Epic explained of the new Stay in the Game mechanic. "Additionally, new DBNO movement options include Roll &amp; Tumble, DBNO Sprint, and Stay on the Move. Lastly, Drivable Reboot Vans have rolled onto the Island."</p><div>

<p>You'll also be able to claim loot, powers, and transformative skills when you defeat a boss, with full Health and Shield, bonus max Health and Shield, infinite Energy, and a "powerful ability". Doing so, however, will ensure you're visible to nearby opponents, so be careful.</p>
<p>There's also Simple Build, an option in Settings (Game &gt; Building) that "makes learning how to build simpler".</p>
<p>"Turn it on, look in the direction you want to build, and just… build!" Epic said.</p>
<p>Of course, with each new chapter comes a new battle pass, and this one boasts The Bride, Marty McFly, and Fortnite Originals like Miles Cross and Cat Holloway. As Epic explained: "In addition to their other unlockable Styles, the Battle Pass includes special Styles for three of the Outfits: Cat Holloway, Carter Wu, and Dark Voyager (Reality Redacted). Unlock these additional Styles by completing Quests in Blitz Royale, Reload, and Battle Royale respectively."</p><p>Don't forget that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-narrative-sequel-to-kill-bill-is-premiering-in-fortnite">The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge will premiere in Fortnite later today</a> (30th November) at 2pm, ET / 11am PT / 7pm GMT / 8pm CET. It's an animated movie made in the Fortnite engine, directed and written by Quentin Tarantino. You can access the premiere 30 minutes before its starting time, so be sure to get there early.</p>
<p>This comes shortly after Fortnite gave the world <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-x-simpsons-caused-a-spike-in-new-and-returning-players">a hugely popular Simpsons crossover</a>, which brought back a record number of returning players.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-just-threw-the-breville-barista-coffee-machine-into-clearance-mode-right-after-black-friday-2000648660</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Can’t start your day without a warm (or cold) cup of joe first thing in the morning? You need a good coffee machine at home, because those instant options aren’t the most flavorful, and heading out to your local cafe in your pajamas isn’t very ideal. Yes, coffee machines can cost a pretty penny, but that’s what sales like Black Friday and Cyber Monday are for. Even though the event is over, there are still plenty of deals to be had across a wide range of categories, including kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5371/">One of our favorites? This 29% discount on the highly-rated Breville Barista Express espresso machine, which brings the price down to $500</a>. You’re saving a straightforward $200 on a machine that’s going to help you make delicious cappuccinos and lattes within minutes, and the discount applies to both Black Sesame and Brushed Stainless Steel options. Looking for something that makes a bold statement? Black looks absolutely stunning. Prefer sticking to the classics? You’re going to love the stainless steel version. There are no delivery charges to worry about either. Just add the item to your cart, checkout, and enjoy barista-level coffee from the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5371/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Rich Flavors Every Time, Without Stepping Out of Your Home</h2>
<p>Breville Barista Express uses a four-key formula to give you the results you want, including precision puck, extraction pressure, extraction temperature, and microfoam bubbles. It is part of the Barista Series that offers all-in-one espresso machines with an integrated grinder that lets you choose between 16 precision grind settings. These convert beans into espresso within seconds, extracting all the goodness hidden in there.</p>
<p>The thermocoil heating system controls water pressure, while the steam wands turn milk into smooth microfoam with a silky texture for you to get creative with latte art. To extract all that rich flavor and aroma, the coffee machine starts with a low-pressure infusion and then ramps it up gradually. The result? A well-balanced, rich cup that feels straight out of your favorite coffee shop.</p>



<p>All the controls are right there on the machine, and they’re pretty easy to follow. You can pick a grind amount, a filter size, a program, and the number of cups you’re hoping to fill. Your purchase will also come with 2 free bags of specialty coffee, which makes it easy to get started without paying anything extra. Other accessories include a razor-dose trimming tool, a 54mm stainless steel portafilter, 1 &amp; 2 cup single and dual wall filter baskets, coffee scoop, integrated tamper, stainless steel milk jug, cleaning disc, tablets, brush tool, allen key, water filter, and a filter holder. There’s also a 1-year limited warranty included for some peace of mind, just in case something goes wrong.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking for a convenient way of making professional-level coffee at home, this deal offers a great chance to grab one of the best coffee machines out there for less. It may look intimidating at first, but getting started is straightforward and shouldn’t take more than a couple of tries to perfect your coffee recipe. Pair the machine with some syrups, and you can have an entire coffee menu of your own. Make some cool Spanish latte, try out pumpkin spice, or go for roasted hazelnut; the possibilities and combinations are endless.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5371/"> Don’t miss out on this chance to save $200 on the Breville Barista Express espresso machine, but this appliance rarely sees any drops, despite being so high in demand all year-round.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[What Happened to The Battle Bus in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-the-battle-bus-fortnite-chapter-7/</link>
            <guid>1368547</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new Chapter in Fortnite has begun, and significant changes have arrived alongside it, including the absence of the Battle Bus when launching into a game of Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Rather than the familar approach of hitching a ride on the Battle Bus, players instead ride a huge wave to arrive at the island, which impacts landing zones as the maximum distance of travelling is shorter.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering what has happened to the Battle Bus and whether the change is permanent, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-is-the-battle-bus-in-fortnite">Where is The Battle Bus in Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>RIP. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battle Bus in Fortnite is no more, having been destroyed at the end of the launch trailer for Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, marking the end of an era.</strong></p>



<p>After the climatic battle to defeat the Dark Presence in the Zero Point event, which saw a who’s who of collabs featuring the likes of Star Wars, Marvel, Superman, K-Pop Demon Hunters, Homer Simpson, Godzilla, Hatsune Miku, and more, it appeared that the band of misfits had gotten by unscathed.</p>



<p>However, that was not the case as in the closing seconds of the Chapter 7 Season 1 launch trailer, the Battle Bus was blown out of the sky, and now, instead of thanking the bus driver when entering a match, you pay respects instead as you surf the waves on the way to the island.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-battle-bus-coming-back">Is the Battle Bus Coming Back?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, the Battle Bus is returning to Fortnite and is not gone permanently, and the absence of the Battle Bus is only for a few days, as it will be back in commission on December 4.</strong></p>



<p>The wreckage of the Battle Bus can be found on the island in Chapter 7, Season 1, and interacting with Dummy, an NPC, nearby results in a mini quest to gather materials to repair the bus, which Dummy intends to do.</p>



<p>At the start of Chapter 7, popular alternative modes to Battle Royale like Reload, Blitz, and Fortnite OG are not available, due to the bus being destroyed, but they will be back in the near future—which implies the bus will also be returning.</p>



<p>Expect the repair of the Battle Bus to play a major part in the early parts of the story in Chapter 7, Season 1, with more to be revealed in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov is once again blowing up as the game pushes through the 1.0 release window and into whatever comes next. Two weeks ago, the game graduated from a beta state it had sat in for almost eight years, moving into a full release format and being listed on Steam for the first time.</p>



<p>Now, thanks to an ongoing Twitch Drops campaign, the game is bigger than ever on the popular streaming platform, and the most-subscribed creators on the site are dedicated solely to Escape from Tarkov. They beat everyone from Kai Cenat to Caseoh, and from Jynxzi to Jason the Ween.</p>

<p>The biggest streamer in the world right now by active subscriptions on Twitch is Pestily, arguably the most prolific Escape from Tarkov streamer in the business. Pestily has been streaming Tarkov since the earliest days and is almost synonymous with the extraction shooter, having become something of a personal friend to the title’s developers at Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Pestily boasted a whopping 132,310 subscriptions, all thanks to an ongoing Twitch Drops campaign that sees Escape from Tarkov players rewarded for gifting subs to streamers broadcasting the game.</p>



<p>This makes Pestily the most-subscribed streamer on the planet.</p>



<p>He’s closely followed by LVNDMARK (read: Landmark), a North American creator who sat on 90,404 subscriptions at the time of publishing.</p>



<p>The list doesn’t end there, though, as here are some other Escape from Tarkov creators <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">topping the leaderboard</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>SheefGG – 53,942</li>



<li>Glorious_E – 31,240</li>



<li>WillerZ – 17,579</li>



<li>Gingy – 15,781</li>



<li>StankRat – 10,121</li>
</ul>



<p>Behind Pestily, the next closest streamer in terms of subscriptions is Kai Cenat, with 70,097.</p>



<p>Sure, most of these subscriptions will be short-lived, as they’ll have been gifted on a one-month basis that will see tens of thousands of them disappear when the renewal window rolls around next month, but it’s nothing if not indicative of the sheer power of Escape from Tarkov, even ten years after it hit the market in alpha.</p>
