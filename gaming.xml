		<p>The closure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bluepoint-games/">Bluepoint Games</a> has once again raised the question of why they were never tasked to remake Bloodborne for PS5. Fans wanted it, and it seems a perfect fit for the studio, so why did it not happen?</p>
<p>Over on Bloomberg, Jason Schreier has said that Bluepoint did indeed pitch to remake Bloodborne in 2025 and “the studio was told that the numbers made sense, but FromSoftware didn’t want it to happen, according to people familiar with the process.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMsGB2PItes">interview</a> last year, former PlayStation Boss Shuhei Yoshida seemingly backed this up, saying FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki did want more from the Bloodborne world, perhaps including a remake, but he is far too busy and &nbsp;“doesn’t want anyone else to touch it.”</p>


<p>Sony do not need FromSoftware’s permission, they own Bloodborne, but Sony would rather keep FromSoftware happy rather than go ahead with any remake. FromSoftware had a massive hit with Elden Ring, and they are still open to exclusives as their next game, The Duskbloods, is only on Switch 2, so Sony keeping them onside with a view to a future exclusive makes sense.</p>


<p>Bloodborne is still selling well, with nearly 2 million units sold between February 2022 and November 2025, 10 years after it launched.</p>
<p>Bluepoint had previously been working on a live service game in the God of War universe in which Atreus would have found himself in the Underworld and battling to escape. That was<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/report-sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-at-bluepoint-bend-studio/"> cancelled in January 2025</a> along with the live service game that Sony Bend had been working on. Details of the Bend game have never been released.</p>
<p>Right now, you can play two of Sony live service games that managed to escape the axe, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=Marathon">Marathon </a>and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=Horizon+Hunters+Gathering">Horizon Hunters Gathering</a>.&nbsp; They also have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/jade-raymond-has-now-left-haven-studios-leaves-questions-over-playstation-live-service-fairgames/">Fairgame$</a> in development, an extraction shooter that sounds like it may compete with Marathon for players.</p>

There’s plenty to get your hands on, because let’s be real, we’re not just buying one. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Booster Packs</li><li>Booster Boxes (36 packs)</li><li>Elite Trainer Box</li><li>Pokémon Center Exclusive Elite Trainer Box</li><li>Booster Bundle (6 packs)</li><li>Triple-Pack Blisters (Meganium, Cinderace, Steelix, Clawitzer, Makuhita)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Perfect Order will introduce new mechanics, four Mega Evolution Pokémon ex; nine Pokémon ex; 11 illustration rare Pokémon; 18 ultra rare Pokémon and Trainer cards; and six special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards.Look out for Mega Zygarde ex, Mega Clefable ex, Mega Starmie ex, and the newly revealed Mega Skarmory ex!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seemingly confirmed via Japanese set lists (M3), which historically dictate about 90% of what we see in our English releases, it will also introduce <a href="https://limitlesstcg.com/cards/jp/M3/79?translate=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Telepath Psychic Energy</u></a>, which provides psychic energy as long as this card is attached to a Pokémon. Neat! </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Where to Preorder Pokémon TCG Perfect Order</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While preordering ensures you get what you want, there’s no saying what the market will do in the weeks following release. Here are the most reliable sources right now, but we’re still waiting for a few preorders to drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>TCGplayer </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer is a reliable third-party retailer that has <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ8gJq?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>all Perfect Order options</u></a> available for preorder. This is your best option for securing everything at the moment, but only if you're ultimately comfortable with paying over MSRP. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Albeit, compared to previous expansions, Perfect Order's market price isn't <em>that </em>far over standard pricing. For example, a <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ83Wp?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">booster box set is running for around $200 right now</a>, about $40 more than Best Buy is selling it for at MSRP. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a similar story for the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqJVo3?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elite Trainer Boxes, listed at around $100 market price</a>, which is $50 more than MSRP. But, that's already $20 less than the recently released Ascended Heroes, and far better than the average $150-$200 we see more regularly. Hopefully Perfect Order follows the same trend as Phantasmal Flames and drops below $100 soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Walmart</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walmart will likely have Perfect Order preorders between now and release day on March 27. To be in the best chance to securing anything at MSRP, you'll need to be a paid Walmart+ member to early access to the drops. No free trial option here, you'll need to be paying for your membership to be in the race.</p><div id="192311"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="192311" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Walmart+ Membership</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pokémon Center US</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The classic, and always the first to sell out.

Amazon US currently has no listing for Perfect Order. But, we usually see the online retailer begin to stock new sets after release, so keep an eye out through to March 27.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Predicted Chase Cards</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We can look at the SAR pull rates from the Japanese Nihil Zero expansion and secondary market prices in Japan to predict chase cards for the US market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unsurprisingly, the new Mega Ultra Rare <a href="https://pokeninjapan.store/products/117-080-mega-zygarde-ex-japanese-pokemon-single-card?" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mega Zygarde ex</u></a> (card #117/080 in the Japanese set) fetches a pretty penny on Japanese marketplace PokeninJapan thanks to its "Nullifying Zero" attack mechanic. <a href="https://pokeninjapan.store/products/115-080-rosas-encouragement-japanese-pokemon-single-card" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>{115/080} Rosa's Encouragement</u></a> is also trending high.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the March 27 2026 release draws ever-closer, we’re sure to see more pre-orders dropping.

            <p>
A few years ago, it's entirely possible that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> isn't the current talk of a town called Didn't Work. But now, when everyone wants a piece of the live service pie, it's not so easy to come in and claim some for yourself. We could spend an eternity figuring out what went wrong, but perhaps the words of former senior level designer on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> Alex Graner will provide a particular insight that the comment section of an annoying YouTuber won't.
</p>
<p>
Graner recently made an appearance on the Quad Damage podcast (ta, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/highguard/too-sweaty">PCGamesN</a>), where he explained that when he joined developed Wildlight, they were "trying to figure out this new, ambitious game, and this team is always pushing the boundaries. You don't strive to create something that doesn't work out, but it happens, unfortunately. Throughout development, we really leaned into the competitive side of it, and that was always one of my biggest fears as a player."
</p>

<p>
Graner specifically said he felt that the game "leaned too far into the competitive scene," particularly when development shifted the game towards a 3v3 format. "3v3 duos is always the sweatiest version of anything like battle royale, objective modes, wingman, you know it, you name it. It requires such a high intensity of communication with your team, and team play, that it doesn't leave much room for casualness. I think that was the biggest thing that turned a lot of players off Highguard."
</p><p>
He did, of course, point to that "spotlight" placed upon it at Geoff's Night of Statues and Trailers, adding a lot more pressure for it to do well. But, Graner notes, where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> came out at a time where battle royales were still fresh and new, Highguard instead arrived with some tough to learn rules and a high skill floor. "If you just have a few bad games or your teammates aren't sticking together, you're just going to get rolled, and it's very hard to 1v2 in our game… I think that was the biggest thing. People just kind of turned it off because they didn't have the team."
</p>
<p>
Quite honestly, I think Graner is at least partially correct here. I haven't bothered with Highguard myself, just not my vibe, but the little I've experimented with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> has me feeling similarly. I'm just not good at shooters and people are ruthless! In any case, the 3v3 mode certainly isn't the only problem, as based on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-went-wrong-with-highguard-the-hubris-of-its-developers-leadership-say-former-staff-in-a-new-report">recent report</a>, it sounds like leadership needs to shoulder a heavy load of the blame too.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-starter-pick-best-bulbasaur-charmander-squirtle-2000674795</link>
            <guid>1449676</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Pokémon FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> are finally on Switch, bringing a taste of the series’ retro roots to a modern platform for <em>Pokémon</em>‘s 30th anniversary. Millions of fans and newcomers are downloading the game to start a brand new adventure in the Kanto region. They’ll all be faced with the same timelessly perplexing choice: Which starter Pokémon is the best to pick?</p>

 <p>Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle—who should lead your team to catch ’em all and defeat the Elite Four? The answer is whichever one you personally like best. The point of playing <em>Pokémon FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> is to have fun, not to Excel-spreadsheet the hell out of decade-old Game Boy Advance games. But even so, there may be a little gnawing voice of doubt in the back of your head convincing you listen to something other than your heart. If that’s the case, here’s my advice for which starter to pick. Let’s quickly go through the three choices.</p> <h2>Bulbasaur</h2> <p>The poison grass-type is tough as nails and not easily downed. Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur at level 16 and Venusaur at level 32. That’s four levels earlier than the other starters for the final transformation. Bulbasaur is also great against the first two gym leaders, Brock and Misty, both of whom field teams weak to grass-types. What Ivysaur and Venusaur lack in speed and raw attack power, they make up for with high HP and tons of status ailment attacks that can win almost any war of attrition.</p> <p>Sleep Powder is boring but effective in a wide array of match-ups, especially when combined with Leech Seed and Solar Beam. Paired with Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb, it’s a great choice for the master tactician.</p>

 <h2>Charmander</h2> <p>The fire-type has always been a favorite due to the fact that it’s the most badass. Charmander evolves into Charmeleon at level 16 and Charizard at level 36, the last of which&nbsp; is also a flying-type. That extra versatility also brings with it some added vulnerability, but Charizard is great in the late game for quickly sweeping most opponents from the field. Charmander, on the other hand, struggles in the early game, especially against the first couple of Gyms. It does have Metal Claw, however, which can get it past Brock’s rock-types.</p>

 <p>Flame Thrower and Slash are great meat-and-potatoes attacks. Later on you can teach it Earthquake to add another devastating move to its arsenal. Fire Spin and Toxic also pair nicely for cutting off oxygen, even against opponents with a match-up edge.</p> <h2>Squirtle</h2> <p>The water-type is the cutest and has a lot of versatility early on and in the later stages of the game. Squirtle evolves into Wartortle at level 16 and Blastoise at level 36. It’s decently easy to train and has no problem against Brock. Plus Squirtle has the best defense throughout the game, though it struggles around Gyms three and four. It can learn Bubble Beam from Misty though which gives it an early go to special attack for the first half of the game.</p>

 <p>Hydro Pump and Skull Bash are powerful late-game attacks, and Blastoise also benefits from being able to learn moves like Ice Beam and Blizzard to make short work of dragon-types. It’s a nice compromise between the glass cannon offense of Charizard and the slow, situational effectiveness of Venusaur.</p> <h2 id="which-starter-should-i-pick-in-pok-eacute-mon-firered-and-leafgreen">Okay but for real: Which starter should I choose in <em>Pokémon FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em>?</h2> <p>My final answer is: Bulbasaur. It has great survivability and provides lots of options to go with any team you want to build. The early game, up through Surge, is super easy and you have plenty of time to train up the rest of your squad by the time you get to a grass-type showdown in Celadon City. Another thing Bulbasaur has going for it is that there’s really not any other great grass types. Starmie is a great water-type substitute for Blastoise, and Arcanine is a great fire-type substitute for Charizard. Plus, Sleep Powder is a big boon when it comes to capturing other Pokémon on your journey.</p>

              <p><span>In the early hours of February 28th, the U.S. and Israeli military began an unprovoked air strike against Iran after weeks of tense posturing. Sources indicate these plans had been in development for months, despite occurring in the middle of nuclear deal negotiations to replace the one Donald Trump tore up in 2017. Civilian death tolls continue to rise and the scope of this grotesquery has yet to reveal itself. But if you put your chips on the right Polymarket page, you’re in the money.&nbsp;</span></p>

The gambling platform, which lets you bet anonymously on anything from basketball games to bombing campaigns, has been an unending source of controversy. Justifying letting the world wager on mass death, Polymarket claims they also act as a public service, an “unbiased forecast” for people to rely on.</span></p> <p><span>At the top of the betting pages regarding Iran, Polymarket has posted an editorial note:&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“The promise of prediction markets is to harness the wisdom of the crowd to create accurate, unbiased forecasts for the most important events to society,” says Polymarket. “That ability is particularly invaluable in gut-wrenching times like today. After discussing with those directly affected by the attacks, who had dozens of questions, we realized that prediction markets could give them the answers they needed in ways TV news and 𝕏 could not.”</span></p>   <p><span>It goes without saying that the people who are eagerly wagering on human suffering are, in fact, very biased. The site naturally attracts a certain set of online person, whose sway or skin in the game do not reflect reality. Even if </span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/canada-election-odds-mark-carney-pierre-poilievre-2064930"><i><span>Newsweek </span></i><span>believes the gambler’s instinct</span></a><span> on matters like the 2025 Canadian federal election, the Pierre Poilievre–sympathetic crowd did not prevent him from not only failing to become the prime minister, but even from failing to hold on to his own seat in parliament. To spell things out even&nbsp; more clearly, Polymarket betters were in revolt after wagers on whether </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-says-hell-yea-to-to-helping-government-with-fully-autonomous-weapons-as-trump-bombs-more-countries-2000674755"><span>Sam Altman</span></a><span> or Elon Musk would be crowned </span><i><span>TIME</span></i><span>’s Person of the Year award </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/time-person-of-the-year-ai-musk-altman-kalshi-bet-lost-millions-angry-2000652622"><span>lost on a technicality</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>While know-nothings are unreliable sources, the other obvious issue with platforms like Polymarket are gamblers who know </span><span>too</span><span> much. Since the trend emerged, professional sports leagues are struggling to keep up with online betting scandals, </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/29/nx-s1-5517979/unpacking-the-scandal-around-baseball-player-shohei-ohtani-and-his-interpreter"><span>such as Shohei Ohtani wagering on, uh, himself</span></a><span>. Only a few days ago MrBeast video editor Artem Kaptur was fined by the gambling platform Kalshi </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-editor-insider-trading-kalshi-artem-kaptur-2000674023"><span>for a winning streak based around his own workplace</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you think there would be stricter security around matters of immense global importance, you just lost another bet. Last June, when Israel previously fired missiles towards Iran, several high-stakes bets from first-time users were placed around the bombing campaign. </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2026/jan/30/polymarket-prediction-markets-betting"><span><em>The Guardian</em> believes these bets were made by people in the know</span></a><span>, capable of predicting these horrors with insider information.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The proliferation of betting is bad enough, but the potential for anonymous betting on sites like Polymarket raises insidious stakes. Bets placed on the attacks against Iran have already swelled up on the site’s front page, pushing the evergreen “Will the US confirm that aliens exist?” thread to the fifth row. The existing financial incentives to unleash war on the Middle East, from weapons manufacturing in the U.K. to resource grabbing in the region, are a revolting reality. Giving anonymous high rollers even more windfall is insane. The only thing predictable hereon is suffering.</span></p>

            <p>
Last year, Owlcat announced they were working on another CRPG set within the world of Warhammer 40,000 called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy">Dark Heresy</a>. This would have potentially led to an assumption that they were done with their previous game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>, but nope! They're still going, and a brief teaser for that CRPG's next bit of DLC was shared (and when I say brief, I do mean it), and to wet your appetite, some gameplay for Dark Heresy is there to have a look at too.
</p>
<p>
The DLC is titled The Infinite Museion (how often do you think that's going to get autocorrected to Museum, wasting the time of Warhammerers everywhere), and it's all about investigating the secret vault of one Trazyn the Infinite. Now, I know diddly squat about Warhammer lore, but a name like that certainly has a foreboding atmosphere about it.

"Discover Trazyn’s obsession with the Von Valancius dynasty, and choose whether to disrupt or fulfill his plans," reads the DLC's description on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4226770/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader__The_Infinite_Museion/">Steam</a>. "Explore a glimpse of his fabled collection, claim priceless relics, and face off against guardians that defy understanding. A new companion joins your retinue with a distinct combat style that reshapes battlefield tactics. This expansion brings a new questline, a new mechanic - implants - that can be used strategically in battle, and a deeper dive into Necron conflicts."

<p>
There's no release date attached to this one, however, not even for this year, so you'll have to hold out for now. However, the gameplay for Dark Heresy has a bit more meat on its bones, though only a bit. Mostly it shows off the middle of a battle between your party of characters and some nasty baddies, offering a glimpse of the kind of actions and strategies you can take. Hard to glean how fun it is from such a brief look, and it's only alpha gameplay, but it's better than nowt! No release date here either, so, wishlist it right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710600/Warhammer_40000_Dark_Heresy/">here</a> I suppose?

            <link>https://kotaku.com/markiplier-iron-lung-hollywood-youtube-horror-2000674769</link>
            <guid>1449631</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Mark Fischbach, better known as Markiplier, is one of the most successful, long-running YouTubers in the field. His turn behind the camera has yielded similar success, as he directed and starred in the feature film adaptation of the horror game </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span>. The film has netted $50 million on a roughly $4 million budget, competing with studio offerings on a legitimately grassroots distribution campaign. Fischbach now warns Hollywood to ignore fellow YouTubers at its peril.</span></p>

 <p><span>“At least a lot of Hollywood was willfully ignoring the potential of YouTubers here,” Fischbach told the Lemonade Stand podcast (via </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/markiplier-says-hollywood-was-willfully-ignoring-the-potential-of-youtubers-before-his-film-iron-lung-made-usd50-million-at-the-box-office/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span>). “There is that level of respect that I just haven’t met yet.”</span></p> <p><span>Fischbach has been posting videos since 2012. Best known for let’s plays of horror games like </span><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Amnesia</span></i><span>, he has not </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-mrbeast-networth-pewdiepie-net-worth-subscriber-1849784966"><span>faltered in popularity</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pewdiepie-rescinds-50-000-pledge-to-jewish-charity-aft-1838070628"><span>spiraled out</span></a><span> like many of his contemporaries. In 2023, he stated his intention to write, direct, star and distribute a film based on David Szymanski’s game </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span>, in which the player pilots a claustrophobic, windowless submarine in a deep ocean of blood. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>“They said it shouldn’t be done. Not that it couldn’t be done,” </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/markiplier-iron-lung-theatrical-release-date-1236599072/"><span>Fischbach told </span><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span>. “People have made movies before, just that it would be ‘woefully unwise’ to tackle writing, directing, acting and editing a movie myself.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Unassuming, independent films have stunned the box office in the past. With a leaner budget and a mighty return, </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span> joins the ranks of hits like 2002’s </span><i><span>My Big Fat Greek Wedding</span></i><span>, the independent Canadian comedy that twisted a $5 million budget into a nearly $400 million box office haul. One of the films </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span> competed against was </span><i><span>Send Help</span></i><span>, the latest gross-out thriller from Sam Raimi, who stormed Hollywood with his own shoestring 1981 horror classic </span><i><span>The Evil Dead</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>But what seems to stick in the paw of YouTubers like Fischbach isn’t commercial success. In all likelihood, content creators at his level make more money than most working Hollywood directors. It’s the more elusive prestige factor that haunts them. </span></p>

 <p><span>The umbrage is reminiscent of that expressed by Kevin Perjurer (aka Defunctland), who dovetails his </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_rjBWmc1iQ"><span>very good video about unaccredited TV jingle composers</span></a><span> with a grievance about online documentaries not holding the same space as conventionally produced ones. Given that the documentary space largely filters towards Netflix true-crime specials, I wonder if these creators are agonizing for a status that rarely exists for anyone, even within the current system.</span></p>

 <p><span>Additionally, it may have been the case in 2023, but Hollywood studios do not seem to be ignoring YouTubers anymore. In 2025, NEON released </span><i><span>Shelby Oaks</span></i><span>, a horror film from YouTuber Chris Stuckmann, though the film’s impression on critics and the box office was far more modest. </span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere, A24 recently unveiled the trailer for </span><i><span>The Backrooms</span></i><span>, a big-screen adaptation of the liminal YouTube phenomenon, helmed by 20-year old Kane Parsons, who’s responsible for the viral videos. I have also been told in private conversations that online hitmakers are optioned by Hollywood pretty frequently for their creations, but that they often die on the vine before reaching the public.</span></p>

 <p><span>For his film, Fischbach says he’d hesitate adapting another video game, preferring not to pigeonhole himself like </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> helm and ultimate wife guy </span><a href="https://postgame.substack.com/p/the-resident-evil-auteur-in-his-own"><span>Paul W.S. Anderson</span></a><span>. Less surprisingly, Fischbach added that studio reception to him has changed since </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span>’s success, saying he’s already met with executives, though they largely just want to know how he pulled it off. “They’re all asking me the same thing,” says Fischbach. “’How’d you do it? How’d you do it?’”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>February 27th marked <em>Pokémon</em>’s 30th birthday, and The Pokémon Company revealed a bunch of new merch to mark the occasion, including a black and white, original </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-30-anniversary-merchandise-pikachu-plush-charms-2000674009"><span>Game Boy-inspired Pikachu plush</span></a><span>. The rush to grab one of these limited-time exclusive plushies hit one particular Poké Center in Japan particularly hard, though, with one onlooker describing the chaos as “total war.”</span></p>

 <p><span>User aeroflotlove shared a video of the commotion at the Tokyo Bay Poké Center on </span><a href="https://x.com/aeroflotlove/status/2027568670860578884?s=20"><span>X</span></a><span>, along with their account of the ensuing panicked attempts to snag the limited-edition stuffed Pikachu (machine translated from Japanese). “There were no tickets or lines, so I turned around at 10 a.m., and there was a lot of people rushing into the store from all the entrances, pushing each other, fighting, screaming, children crying because they were being hit by other customers, it was total war.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">ポケセントーキョーベイ、整理券も整列もないとこだったので10時によーいどん、あちこちの入口から大量の人がダッシュで店内にすごい勢いで入ってきて押し合いやら喧嘩やら叫び声聞こえる、子供が他の客にたたかれて泣いてるなど戦争だった💦… <a href="https://t.co/Br7rM9tIZN">pic.twitter.com/Br7rM9tIZN</a></p> <p>— まゆ@⚡️o'ᆺ'o⚡️2026今年も宜しく (@aeroflotlove) <a href="https://twitter.com/aeroflotlove/status/2027568670860578884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Chris Explorer, a content creator living in Japan, captured </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DVSNjzGiWlk/"><span>a different angle</span></a><span> of the bedlam from outside the Tokyo Bay store. The worker shouting at shoppers through a megaphone really adds an extra layer of pandemonium to the whole affair. It seems the Tokyo Bay Poké Center wasn’t the only location hit by swarms of Pikachu-crazed fans, though, as users on X have stated that both the </span><a href="https://x.com/carduus06/status/2027656219771736295?s=20"><span>Yokohama</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/Mypoke_501/status/2027670710769119549?s=20"><span>Osaka</span></a><span> Poké Centers had a rough go of things as well.</span></p>   <p><span>Several posts online have blamed the ongoing <em>Pokémon</em> scalping epidemic for the desperate scenes. However, if that is true, fans can take solace in the fact that, less than 24 hours later, </span><a href="https://x.com/pokemoncenterPR/status/2027584536473739336?s=20"><span>The Pokémon Company announced</span></a><span> that the monochrome Pikachu plushie will be available to order through their website in the near future.</span></p>

 <p><span>In fact, several <em>Pokémon</em> card shops in Japan have reported going out of business due to lower-than-normal demand in the past year, leading to speculation that the scalping-fueled ‘Mon bubble </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-cards-are-finally-becoming-accessible-to-kids-again-as-japans-speculative-bubble-collapses/"><span>is set to pop</span></a><span>. Hopefully that’s still the case, and the 30th anniversary chaos is just an outlier caused by the celebrations, because I’d like to be able to order <em>Pokémon</em> cards without having to rely on a Discord stock alert server in the near future.</span></p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>This week has been jam-packed with game anniversaries: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-marriage-candidates-new-update-1-7-qi-2000674093"><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>turned 10</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-30-anniversary-go-anime-cosplay-stream-2000672824"><span>Pokémon turned 30</span></a><span>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> turned 40 — though nobody would blame you if you missed that last one. Zelda’s anniversary earlier this week was met with little fanfare; no new games or remakes were announced, nor any news on the upcoming live-action movie. All we got were some </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-mostly-ignored-the-legend-of-zeldas-40th-anniversary-but-heres-some-toy-versions-of-classic-weapons"><span>miniature weapon replicas</span></a><span>, and even those are only available in select stores in Japan.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Since Nintendo is apparently too busy </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-30-anniversary-stream-recap-winds-waves-2000674383"><span>celebrating Pokémon</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-zelda-turns-40-voice-actress-patricia-summersett-reveals-hopes-for-the-future-and-clarifies-her-thoughts-on-link-and-zeldas-gorgeous-relationship"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> has taken up the mantle of honoring the legendary Zelda franchise through an interview with Zelda’s voice actress, Patricia Summersett.</span></p> <p><span>Summersett is a lifelong fan of the Zelda series and has been the voice of Princess Zelda for a decade. She starred in both </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></i><span>, plus the spinoffs </span><i><span>Age of Calamity</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Age of Imprisonment</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>Inside the Casting for Princess Zelda</h2> <p><span>When asked about the auditioning process, Summersett says that she had no idea she was going for the role of Princess Zelda: “The best way to describe it was as a bleached script, which is when you have a certain amount of information about what the archetypes of the character are, the general world — for example, that it looks like an RPG fantasy — but you have no idea what the actual roles are going to be or what the game is. And there would’ve been no way of predicting that it was Zelda because she didn’t have a voice before. I just would never have assumed that was the game that I was auditioning for.”</span></p> <p><span>Summersett also explains that Zelda’s British accent wasn’t a note from Nintendo, but a choice inspired by Summersett’s schooling in London and Zelda’s royalty status. “It’s a little more comfortable to say this is a Hylian accent versus just a particular version of a UK accent,” she says.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>Thoughts on the Live-Action Movie</h2> <p><span>About the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-live-action-movie-link-bragason-ainsworth-leak-2000644816"><span>live-action Zelda adaptation</span></a><span>, Summersett says, “Obviously Bo Bragason is going to kill it, she’s going to be amazing. I’m happy to have contributed in any way, without knowing where it’s all headed, other than the fact that it’s now been 10 years. I’m just floored by the fact I’ve been involved in this franchise for a quarter of it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Obviously [the movie] is going to be a large collaboration between people who are new to the series and those deeply schooled in the series. [I think] you’re going to see a strong Zelda. I’m sure you’re going to see a powerful lead character in Zelda. And Link I have no idea, is he going to speak? They certainly haven’t alluded to the fact that he does, yet.”</span></p> <h2>So, Are Link and Zelda Officially Dating? (No)</h2> <p><span>Previously, Summersett shared her personal thoughts on the nature of Link and Zelda’s relationship, which were then </span><a href="https://x.com/Summersett_/status/1660658772824530944"><span>misconstrued</span></a><span> in a popular article. “I have all sorts of personal theories about what [their relationship] might be, but I think there’s something beautiful in the way that it’s left ambiguous, it’s left in a kind of — if there are romantic undertones, it’s left in an unrequited state. There’s obviously a deep friendship and a protectorship between the two of them. It’s a gorgeous relationship and it continues to evolve and be left open in so many iterations of this.</span></p>

 <p><span>“And what that means for me, as somebody who represents the character at things like conventions, is that anybody can come up to me with their version of what they think Link and Zelda are. And a lot of it comes in the form of coupleship — people proposing to each other and getting engaged with Zelda as a theme, or they feel like it’s something that they want to just celebrate with family or friends. It can mean kind of anything, and I love that it lives in that space.”</span></p> <h2>Summersett is a Bigger <em>Legend of Zelda</em> Fan than You</h2> <p><span>When asked about her favorite Zelda games, she says, “I am partial to </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, but </span><i><span>Ocarina of Time</span></i><span> is really the ground zero of what the series means for me. And then maybe I’d say the original, though I was a child watching other people play that. And then I really liked </span><i><span>Twilight Princess</span></i><span> as well, just the art style of that one. So those are probably the top three.”</span></p> <p><span>“I see a lot of cosplay from</span><i><span> Twilight Princess</span></i><span> at conventions, and I also write in </span><i><span>Twilight Princess</span></i><span> Hylian, so I feel a little more connected to that game when I’m writing that in notes to people.”</span></p>

 <p><span>You read that right — Summersett can write in </span><i><span>Twilight Princess</span></i><span> Hylian! “It’s something I did early on when I was recording [</span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>] and I was just starting to look through [series companion book] </span><i><span>Hyrule Historia</span></i><span> at the different versions of the languages from all the previous games. Obviously, </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> wasn’t out yet, so I didn’t know what would be in that game. But I saw </span><i><span>Twilight Princess</span></i><span> Hylian and it’s so beautiful. I thought I could probably learn those characters, which is essentially just the alphabet, and started practicing that over coffee. So now I can kind of write fluently and use it all the time.”</span></p>

            <p>A level designer laid off from Highguard developer Wildlight believes the free-to-play shooter's difficulties stem from having "leaned too far into the competitive scene".</p>
<p>Acknowledging that the "really big spotlight" placed on the game following its reveal at The Game Awards additionally added pressure, senior level designer Alex Graner talked candidly on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3wuWRHLZeY">Quad Damage podcast</a> about the "constantly evolv[ing]" game, suggesting that his "biggest fear [came] when [the studio] decided to go full-in on 3v3".</p>

<p>"I can only speak to my side of it as a level designer, but when I joined [Wildlight], it was trying to figure out this new, ambitious game, and this team is always pushing the boundaries," he said, as transcribed by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/highguard/too-sweaty">PCGN</a>. "You don't strive to create something that doesn't work out, but it happens, unfortunately. Throughout development, we really leaned into the competitive side of it, and that was always one of my biggest fears as a player.</p><p>"3v3 duos is always the sweatiest version of anything like battle royale, objective modes, wingman, you know it, you name it," he added. "It requires such a high intensity of communication with your team, and team play, that it doesn't leave much room for casualness. I think that was the biggest thing that turned a lot of players off Highguard."</p>
<p>Graner said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> came just as battle royales were a "kind of an up-and-coming mode" and was "really easy to understand after you played one game", which is why it was so successful. Conversely, Highguard was a little more complex.</p>
<p>"Highguard has all these different rules and stages, it's like, 'Oh, you want to loot, now we've got to chase this objective, now we have to plant this objective, now it's overtime… It has all these rules, which I think works at a really high level, but when players are first coming in it's a lot to grasp," he admitted.</p>
<p>"On top of all that, because it was 3v3, that kind of game just requires high-skill movement and shooting, which is already a pretty high [bar to] entry as well. So if you just have a few bad games or your teammates aren't sticking together, you're just going to get rolled, and it's very hard to 1v2 in our game.</p>
<p>"It's all designed to be a team-based shooter. I think that was the biggest thing. People just kind of turned it off because they didn't have the team."</p>
<p>Just yesterday (27th February), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-pulled-highguards-funding-two-weeks-after-launch">a new report alleged that Tencent pulled funding from developer Wildlight just two weeks after the game's launch</a>. Staff were called to an all-hands meeting, and then told that there would be layoffs as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> had pulled funding as Highguard had seemingly failed to meet whatever metrics Tencent had for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">Wildlight publicly confirmed layoffs a day later</a> but wouldn't specify numbers, and it insisted "a core group of developers" remained to work on the game. It's thought fewer than 20 people remain at Wildlight today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-reportedly-funded-by-tencent">Tencent's role in Highguard's development</a> was, curiously, kept quiet. It wasn't until several days after the layoffs that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-reportedly-funded-by-tencent">Game File confirmed Tencent's involvement</a>. The reason for the secrecy around the company's involvement is unclear.</p>

<h3 id="h-1-get-level-1-id-wristband">1. Get Level 1 ID Wristband</h3>



<ol>
<li>If you’ve found the corpse, it means you’re far enough into the game to be able to start this quest.</li>



<li>You need to go up the stairs (just South of the <strong>Nurse’s Station</strong>) and deal with the two zombies at the top of the stairs.</li>



<li>Collect the <strong>Level 1 ID Wristband</strong> from the floor.</li>



<li>Run away and escape from the giant baby AKA Chunk Zombie.</li>
</ol>







<h3 id="h-2-get-the-corrosive-substance">2. Get The Corrosive Substance</h3>



<ol>
<li>Once you’re free, head to the <strong>Conference Room</strong>.</li>



<li>Be warned, there are three regular Zombies and a shrieking Zombie.</li>



<li>It’s advised you deal with all of them—especially the shrieking Zombie, as it’s tied to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-trophies-achievement-list/" id="177773" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophy</a>.</li>



<li>In the room with the shrieking Zombie, you will find the <strong>Corrosive </strong>sitting on a surface under a light.</li>



<li>Pick it up to add to your inventory.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-3-get-the-notebook-amp-sun-quartz">3. Get The Notebook &amp; Sun Quartz</h3>



<ol>
<li>Head straight to the <strong>Lead Researcher’s Office</strong>.</li>



<li>Use the <strong>Corrosive</strong> on the blue lock attached to the puzzle box in the back office.</li>



<li>The room has pictures of the researchers, which piece the solution together if you want to solve it yourself.</li>



<li><strong>Spoiler: </strong>The answer will be the next step.</li>



<li>Enter Star, Sun, Moon, and Sun.</li>



<li>Take the Sun Quartz and <strong>Notebook</strong>.</li>

<ol>
<li>Head to the <strong>West Wing</strong>.</li>



<li>Go past the <strong>Parlor </strong>and deal with the Zombie in this corridor—this Zombie can become mutated, so it might be wise to use a Hemolytic Injector on it!</li>



<li>Use the Level 1 ID Wristband on the door at the end of the corridor.</li>



<li>Go into the <strong>Custodian’s Office</strong>.</li>



<li>Grab the <strong>Wrench</strong>.</li>



<li>Head into the <strong>Garage</strong>.</li>

<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Cold Storage</strong> room.</li>

<li>Use the <strong>Wrench </strong>in its place to open the door.</li>



<li>Grab the <strong>Artificial Heart</strong> from the hook in the middle of the room.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-6-renaimate-the-organless-corpse">6. Renaimate The Organless Corpse</h3>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nivalis">Nivalis</a> is a game that whenever I see it I just think "oh, that can't be right, games like this don't actually exist do they?" Arguable, until it's actually out, its existence is neither here nor there. But at the very least for the month of February, instead of talking at us lot in their monthly devlogs, developer Ion Lands opted to show off a little snippet of the game's opening moments to tide us over until release.
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, the game starts as many often (perhaps too often) do, with you waking up not quite entirely sure of what's going on, though you quickly learn from a voice in your head called Ava that there's a serial killer on the loose. Not particularly life <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simy</a>! But quite cyberpunk, so, it balances it out.

There's a little look at the kind of finagling you'll be doing as you set up your restaurant, too, mostly just setting up some tables and chairs. I like the look of the approach to doing so - there's no grid to place the tables on, so they might not look exactly perfect, but anyone that's worked in such an environment will know that your tables can never be perfectly placed. To compensate though, chairs do snap to specific spots, so some amount of order is possible to establish.
</p><p>
Mostly I like the tiny glimpses of the weirdo cast of characters the game features. A guy called Thaddeus who just talks at you about making choices, a robot called "Salt Pete" as opposed to "Salty Pete," an obnoxious IRL Twitch streamer, an android sailor that clearly wants me to ask him about his boat. These are all people I want to talk to (maybe less so the Twitch streamer), and maybe even get to know from just a sliver of dialogue, so that bodes well.
</p>
<p>
Ion Lands <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1488490/view/515236085341618869">do note</a> that "the footage should not be considered final," which doesn't make it any clearer how far away the thing is from being finished (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nivalis-catches-yet-another-delay-this-time-into-2026-but-it-sounds-like-its-for-fair-reasons">it received a second delay last year</a>), but in the meantime you can wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1488490/Nivalis/">here</a>.

            <guid>1449562</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In 2025, London Police raided the home of Darius Khan. The junk dealer claims he was about to sell a set of Sega dev kits, cartridges and prototypes to the Video Game Preservation Museum. After the items were confiscated and an eight-hour interrogation, Khan says he was not formally charged but was threatened with everything from theft to money laundering. When </span><i><span>Gamers Nexus</span></i><span>’ Steve Burke began to pick at the matter, a contractor hired to dispose of Sega’s hardware mistakenly sent the wrong email, suggesting that it was corporate negligence, not criminal intent, that led to the misplaced bounty.</span></p>

 <p><span>Burke and his investigative team visited Khan in London to get a clearer sequence of events. Khan flips trash for cash, visiting scrapyards in search of material he can sell elsewhere. The waste is there to be processed before being hauled off to Africa. Most of Khan’s finds net modest sums, but one day he seemed to hit the jackpot with a cache of hardware seemingly pulled from a Sega office. He made a deal with an on-site manager and put the e-waste up for auction. To his surprise, it was a hot-ticket item. The London-based non-profit </span><a href="https://www.vgpm.org/"><span>Video Game Preservation Museum</span></a><span> raised over £60,000 to secure the winning bid when Khan put the lot on eBay.</span></p> <p><span>This is where things get a little cloak and dagger. According to the </span><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15588369/collector-rare-games-consoles-sonic-hedgehog-sega.html"><i><span>Daily Mail</span></i></a><span>, Khan was soon reached out to by someone named “Paul” over Facebook Marketplace. Posing as the father of an autistic video game enthusiast, the man was in reality a private investigator, working for the firm FUSION 85, Nintendo’s go-to on matters of IP infringement and ROM sites. Not long after, at least ten police raided Khan’s home at 7 a.m., arresting him and two associates involved with the deal.</span></p> <p><span>“They were like worker bees,” Khan tells Burke, “taking this, this and they start putting it into evidence bags.”</span></p>

  <p><span>The Video Game Preservation Museum, having already put in a down-payment, were concerned by the radio silence before Khan had to break the weird, bad news. Dramatic enough as it was, things took another strange turn after </span><i><span>Gamers Nexus</span></i><span> reached out to Waste to Wonder. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Waste to Wonder is an office-clearing contractor hired by Sega to dispose of sensitive hardware during an office relocation. When reached for comment, the company accidentally sent </span><i><span>Gamers Nexus</span></i><span> private correspondence between themselves and Sega implicating a sub-contractor, despite Khan taking all the heat.</span></p>

 <h2>From corporate gaming e-waste to private preservation auctions</h2> <p><span>When businesses, tech or otherwise, are cleared, it is common to hire contractors to dispose of all the junk that could prove compromising in the wrong hands. Papers are shredded or incinerated. Hard drives are properly destroyed. With dev kits and prototypes, this could mean something as crude as having holes drilled into them or bashing them with a hammer before taking them to another facility. Effective but sloppy work could mean holes or hammer strikes to the wrong part of the hardware, leaving enough of the internal memory intact for a collector or trader to restore. Prototypes and dev kits can be holy grails to collectors and preservationists, with auction pages getting a lot of intrigue. Perhaps the most infamous </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-play-station-sells-at-auction-for-360-000-1842154345"><span>remains the “Nintendo PlayStation,”</span></a><span> which sold to an anonymous buyer for $369,000.</span></p> <p><span>According to the emails accidentally sent to </span><i><span>Gamers Nexus</span></i><span>, Sega instructed Waste to Wonder to clear mountains of e-waste left in its office (and from the looks of photos secured by </span><i><span>Gamers Nexus</span></i><span>, Sonic the Hedgehog’s head and shoes). Waste to Wonder then passed along the job to a subcontractor, who were instructed to take everything to a disposal site. In reality Sega had assigned another firm, ITR Secure, to handle the more sensitive items, though it never did so.</span></p>

 <p><span>The items in question largely date from the mid-to-late 2000s, including dev kits and prototypes for the Nintendo Wii and DS. In </span><i><span>Gamers Nexus</span></i><span>’ video, a prototype of BioWare’s </span><i><span>Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood</span></i><span>&nbsp;can be seen. Khan is under investigation, but if the email sent to </span><i><span>Gamers Nexus</span></i><span> is accurate, he’s not guilty of any crime. He purchased the hardware in good faith and did not breach any IP by reproducing them. The Video Game Preservation Museum sought the hardware for private copies, which is also legal. What occurred is a clear case of corporate negligence, but the deployment of a private investigator, coordinating with police officials, suggests an attempt to obfuscate these mistakes.</span></p> <p><span>“If that is not an example of state power of intrusion being delegated to two private companies I don’t know what is,” Khan tells Burke.</span></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiems-rhodes-hill-is-the-ultimate-rpd-remake</link>
            <guid>1449556</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This article includes mild </em><em><strong>spoilers </strong></em><em>for the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center section of Resident Evil Requiem. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Resident Evil turning 30 this year, it’s no surprise that Requiem leans into nostalgia. Leon S. Kennedy is back in a starring role, and the game’s trailers feature ominous shots of a crumbling Raccoon City police station – the labyrinthine haunted house that our floppy-haired hero had to fight through back in 1998. But while this latest edition of Resident Evil features its fair share of direct nods to the past, it’s Requiem’s new ideas that actually feel the most nostalgic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story’s early sections, in which you play fresh-faced protagonist Grace Ashcroft, are where Requiem most successfully evokes the earliest days of Resident Evil. Despite using the series’ modern first-person perspective by default, it’s classic ‘90s survival horror in the truest sense, right down to the ink ribbons, should you wish. The building that Grace explores, the brand new Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center, is a next-generation echo of Resident Evil 2’s Raccoon City Police Department, complete with a puzzle-locked exit and deadly stalker prowling the halls. As much as it relies on the triumphs of the past, though, this RPD tribute demonstrates the timeless qualities of Resident Evil, and how the old hits can be made to feel like modern breakthroughs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Within just a few steps, it’s clear that Rhodes Hill takes all of its foundational cues from the RPD. The first locked door you encounter yields only to an ornate key. Around the corner, a metal shutter prevents access to the wider facility, the nearby empty fusebox signalling that you’ll need to find a replacement component to progress. Beyond awaits a reception desk flanked by sweeping stairs, the very model of Raccoon City’s extravagant main precinct. And, like Resident Evil 2’s classic location, Rhodes Hill is split into two halves, the west and east wings, through which you need to scour eerie chambers – many of which must first be unlocked using a steadily mounting collection of keycards – in search of a means of escape. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/rer-rhodes-hill-1772202572663.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The enterance hall of the Rhodes Hill Center echoes the design of the RPD. | Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Requiem, if it’s not clear by now, is less reverential to Resident Evil 2, more indebted to it. That’s thankfully not too much of a problem when developer Capcom owns the original bank of ideas, but it does walk the knife-edge between remake and reimagining just a little too dangerously at times. For instance, the center’s final exit is unlocked using a trio of quartz cubes, each dispensed by ornate machines upon solving a three-symbol puzzle. Yes, it’s the RPD medallion puzzle in an ill-fitting mask.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet this approach never feels like creative bankruptcy, nor does it feel like cynical nostalgia. That’s partly due to Capcom’s original survival horror formula having endured the test of time – Resident Evil 2’s fundamentals felt as fresh in the 2019 remake as they did two decades prior – but mostly because Rhodes Hill is arguably the strongest version of this environment format that the series has offered up since we visited the RPD. More expansive than both the Baker Estate and Castle Dimitrescu, and possessing a myriad of interesting loop routes and shortcuts, navigating its corridors is a fully engaging experience, regardless of whether you recognise the rough outline of Raccoon City’s police station or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The facility’s layout and the way you engage with it are undoubtedly classic Resident Evil, but Capcom isn’t afraid to bring some subtle modernity to the proceedings. Requiem pulls a trick I’ve never seen in a Resident Evil before: many of the center’s zombies are genuine characters, rather than generic enemy fodder. There’s the broad, burly chef whose methodical chores have you second-guessing your route through the kitchen. Out in the adjoining corridor, there’s the man I know as “Flick”, who obsessively turns the lights on and off. Elsewhere, a rotting maid continues to scrub the floors, moving from room to room to clean up all the blood I’ve spilt. And above the dining room, a would-be opera star warbles from the balcony – a shrill sound that sends one of the centre’s noise-sensitive patients into a murderous frenzy.             </p><p>This is classic Resident Evil at its most nostalgic, but rendered with the full knowledge that the past isn’t quite enough to create actual magic.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Such distinct personalities are made possible thanks to Requiem’s emphasis on old-school survival horror. Despite the Resident Evil 2 homages, playing as Grace feels more akin to exploring the Spencer Mansion in Capcom’s bold 1996 original. This is a brutal environment where avoiding confrontation is the much smarter play (especially since, in a nod to the 2002 remake, defeated zombies can return to life as much more aggressive “Blister Heads”). But where the comparatively simple original Resident Evil often saw you fleeing threats and running past zombies, the more advanced enemy AI systems of today mean Requiem adopts a more stealthy approach, encouraging you to cautiously tiptoe around foes – something horror games in general have adopted over the past decade or so. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By shifting the engagement style away from careful shooting gallery to tense stealth, the environment requires far fewer enemies, thus allowing the development team the time and resources to make each zombie feel unique. And, since your tasks have you looping and backtracking through the building, you repeatedly sneak by the same zombies, contributing to the sense that you share the space with very real (albeit also very dead) people, rather than a bus load of replicated video game assets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This approach lends Rhodes Hill a very different atmosphere from any other Resident Evil location, including those that await in the second half of Requiem. While there is admittedly a comedic element to these creatures retaining elements of their living personalities, it’s also unnerving, and the idea of contending with a <em>person</em> rather than a faceless enemy is inherently more frightening – that’s part of what makes the series’ stalker characters, like Jack Baker and Mr. X, so scary. He may wear that funny little hat, but you’d never dare to stop and laugh at it. Requiem’s retooling of the atmosphere here is proof that honing that iconic survival gameplay is as much in the immaterial as it is in the physical things you do.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/rer-cleaner-1772202692289.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Rhodes Hill's cleaner is just one of several eerie characters you'll encounter. | Image credit: Capcom </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Capcom knows that characterful enemies are no replacement for terrifying stalkers, and so Rhodes Hill has a couple of its own. First up is “The Girl”, a towering, gangly, bug-eyed hag that ensures your first impression of the Chronic Care Center is suitably horrifying. Later, you’ll have to contend with the east wing’s guardian, “Chunk” – a colossal, baby-faced, hallway-filling mound of flesh that moves faster than his weight should logically allow. Both operate in the classic stalker fashion of prowling the corridors and dynamically impeding your progress. There are interesting alterations to the formula, with The Girl using Alien: Isolation-style hidden pathways to take you by surprise in a manner Mr. X could only dream of, but these enemies are undeniably adhering to the horror playbook originally written for 1999’s Resident Evil 3 and its relentless Nemesis. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Nemesis and his more modern relatives, though, one of Requiem’s stalkers isn’t an invincible obstacle. Against all odds, the gargantuan Chunk can be killed, removing this terrifying chess piece from the board. Such a feat is a tall challenge… well, for Grace at least. Leon is much better equipped to take down not just Chunk, but all of Rhodes Hill’s zombies, and his arrival on the scene following Grace’s lengthy expedition makes for a fascinating spin on one of Resident Evil’s most beloved classic features: the dual playthrough.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The series’ early games put a lot of emphasis on playing through the story twice, seeing the same environment from two different perspectives. Exploring the first game’s Spencer Mansion is a notably different experience depending on whether you play as Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield. Capcom would remix this approach for Resident Evil 2, using the “A/B” playthrough system to ensure Leon and Claire’s runs through the RPD had interesting differences. While Requiem doesn’t adopt this idea wholesale, you can see the shape of it when Leon arrives on the scene. After tiptoeing around Rhodes Hill as Grace, carefully picking your battles and conserving ammunition, you get to explore the area again as the practically superheroic Leon. With a new move set seemingly modelled after John Wick, Agent Kennedy can blast, kick, and hack his way through all the zombies that previously saw you fleeing for the safety of the well-lit safe room. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">This switch is undeniably cathartic. Because the location remains in situ, all the problems you encountered as Grace can now be tackled head-on by Leon. Those Blister Heads that were clogging up the lounge and forcing you to take the long route? A shotgun blast to the lumpy face will make you feel better about all the trouble they caused you. Leon’s deadly arsenal can make short work of that burly chef, turn Chunk into a puddle of mush, and break open locked cupboards that were inaccessible to Grace. In short, Requiem is able to use the same location to offer a completely different, complementary experience by shifting the perspective and toolset. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If it weren’t for the fact that Leon’s time at Rhodes Hill was so brief, I’d say this was the ultimate version of Resident Evil’s dual playthrough idea. As it stands, it’s simply the best idea of it – which still means his swift, bloody crusade through what minutes earlier felt like the most frightening place on Earth is one of Requiem’s high points. A peak rooted in a classic idea, but elevated by a modern twist. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s that philosophy that makes the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center work so well: this is classic Resident Evil at its most nostalgic, but rendered with the full knowledge that the past isn’t quite enough to create actual magic. The injection of subtle modern ideas, from Leon’s action-fuelled retread of the halls to the characterful zombies and increased emphasis on stealth, elevates the series’ greatest hits, making it feel like experiencing them for the first time all over again. Rhodes Hill may deliberately evoke your cherished memories of the RPD, but by galvanizing the old with the modern, Capcom has made the ultimate tribute to the past: something new. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiems-rhodes-hill-is-the-ultimate-rpd-remake]]></content:encoded>

It’s not that well known, but before Resident Evil went to the PlayStation, I was working on it for the Super NES.”</p><p>Resident Evil originally began development as a spiritual sequel to the NES horror game Sweet Home, which many consider to be the original survival horror game. However, when Sony’s PlayStation released in late 1994, it became a quick success, and Capcom’s management deiced to take advantage of the new console’s power.</p><p>“This was back before the name Resident Evil had even been assigned to it,” says Oda. “The codename for this was literally just ‘horror game.’ On the SNES, we were working with limited hard drive space, so it’s not like we could dump a movie in there. If we had actually completed it on the SNES, I’m sure it would have been considerably different. For example, it was originally set in a place that had nothing to do with reality – more of a hellish place.”</p><p>For more on the history of Resident Evil, read our <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/10/31/place-of-residing-evil-looking-back-at-capcoms-original-survival-horror.aspx" target="_blank">retrospective on the development of Sweet Home</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2017/12/04/resident-evil-was-originally-in-development-for-the-snes.aspx]]></content:encoded>

<p>"It's massive. It's so big," he said (thanks,<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/doom-the-dark-ages-dlc-is-freaking-huge-says-director-its-basically-like-a-sequel/"> GR+</a>). "I know it's been a while since we've shipped the main game and you're waiting for the DLC, but just know that it's freaking huge. It's basically a sequel. That's what it feels like. It's just ginormous. I love that."</p>
<p>As for what's coming in that update? Well, Martin was a little more coy about that, but we did learn that the DLC is "nothing like" the main game, and could boast a spear-like weapon.</p>
<p>"The DLC is nothing like this," Martin said as he played the main game on the stream. "I can't say too much, I'm just going to say that what I've been playing… I haven't been playing like this."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-biggest-launch-in-id-software-history">Doom: The Dark Ages was the "biggest launch" in id Software's history</a>, with three million players making their way into the fiery pits of hell since the game's release.

            <title><![CDATA[BLAST Revamps Counter-Strike Calendar with $10 Million Investment]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blast-counter-strike-calendar-investment/</link>
            <guid>1449538</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>BLAST has set the stage for one of the biggest structural overhauls in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/counter-strike/" id="482">Counter-Strike’s</a> history, unveiling a massive redesign of the BLAST Premier circuit that will kick off in 2027. This update marks a decisive pivot towards a full LAN-focused model, deeper integration with Valve’s Regional Standings, and a significant financial boost aimed at stabilizing the competitive scene.</p>



<p>At the heart of the overhaul sits a whopping $10 million investment directly into teams and the wider ecosystem, which is a leap up from the $8.5 million commitment in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-blast-bags-bigger-financial-commitment">BLAST Bags Bigger Financial Commitment</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/blast/" id="3530">BLAST</a> has promised that the $10 million investment for 2027 will be spent across four critical pillars:</p>



<ul>
<li>Prize Money</li>



<li>Team Payments</li>



<li>Acceptance Fees</li>



<li>Player Experience Investment</li>
</ul>



<p>The lion’s share of the $10 million goes to team payments, with $4.5 million being attributed to ‘performance-based compensation retained by organizations.’</p>



<p>Behind that, there will be $3 million prize money, and $1.8 million reserved as rewards for teams attending events. The player experience portion of that investment concerns upgrades to travel, accommodation, and on-site conditions.</p>



<p>This is all part of BLAST’s drive to produce a more LAN-centric competitive structure. The endeavour means that some major changes have taken place:</p>



<ul>
<li>BLAST Bounty is reduced from 32 to 16 teams and will now focus 100% on LAN play</li>



<li>More regional open qualifiers will be hosted across all territories</li>



<li>An extra week of competition has been added to the overall season</li>
</ul>



<p>BLAST Bounty, Open, and Rivals have all been brought back with key refinements, but it’s Bounty that faces the biggest changes.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://blast.tv/cs/news/premier-2027-new-formats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a>, Anne Banschbach, the Programme Director for BLAST Premier, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are evolving BLAST Premier to better serve the entire Counter-Strike ecosystem.</p>



<p>Increasing our investment to $10 million is not just about bigger prize pools, it is about revamping our formats to deliver a more sustainable and premium experience for teams, players and fans.</p>



<p>With a fully LAN-focused structure, stronger VRS impact and the removal of main event online matches, the biggest moments will play out on the biggest stages.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>BLAST Rivals remains the ‘crowning jewel’ of the ecosystem in 2027, and will retain the same eight-team format. <strong>But</strong>, in 2027, the prize pool will be increased to the maximum possible – $1.25 million.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/openai-says-hell-yea-to-to-helping-government-with-fully-autonomous-weapons-as-trump-bombs-more-countries-2000674755</link>
            <guid>1449529</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last Thursday, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthropic-claude-ai-department-of-war-military-murder-2000674386"><span>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei made a surprise statement</span></a><span> regarding the company’s decision to bail on negotiations with the Department of War. While the Pentagon had already made extensive use of their generative AI model, they began requesting that Anthropic ease restrictions on their terms of use. In a first for the tech industry, the major AI company took an unexpectedly pro-human-existence stance, with Amodei citing mass surveillance and “fully autonomous weapons” as lines he wouldn’t cross. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, however, is a-okay with these terms, with Altman recently taking to social media to boast about its new venture in arms dealing with the U.S. government.&nbsp;</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><span>“In all of our interactions, the DoW displayed a deep respect for safety and a desire to partner to achieve the best possible outcome,” </span><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/2027578580159631610"><span>Altman posted Friday night</span></a><span>. “We remain committed to serve all of humanity as best we can. The world is a complicated, messy, and sometimes dangerous place.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ok, what kind of American Ai company are you? <a href="https://t.co/7IJFMnpdrb">pic.twitter.com/7IJFMnpdrb</a></p> <p>— Skely (@123skely) <a href="https://twitter.com/123skely/status/2027588056686203228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Though light on the details, Altman also said OpenAI had principles regarding surveillance and the training of killing machines, but said that their terms match the Department of War’s enough to shake on it. “We are asking the DoW to offer these same terms to all AI companies,” wrote Altman, “which in our opinion we think everyone should be willing to accept. We have expressed our strong desire to see things de-escalate away from legal and governmental actions and towards reasonable agreements.”</span></p> <p><span>Altman’s commitment to existence on Earth doesn’t breed a lot of confidence. The week prior, </span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2026/02/21/sam-altman-would-like-remind-you-that-humans-use-a-lot-of-energy-too/"><span>Altman made a very bizarre defense of AI’s infamous energy usage</span></a><span>, saying that as gnarly as OpenAI’s water consumption is, training a human to reach the same stage of development requires “20 years of life and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>On the other end, whatever spooked Anthropic in the Pentagon was enough to rankle the rest of the administration. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth threatened to label Anthropic </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn48jj3y8ezo"><span>a security risk or to enforce new laws in retaliation</span></a><span>. It even </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn48jj3y8ezo"><span>riled up President Donald Trump’s usual brand of ire</span></a><span>.</span></p>   <p><span>The people Altman just handed over the OpenAI keys to are the same ones currently waging illegal wars from Latin America to the Middle East. Mere hours after Altman celebrated his new deal with the Department of War, the U.S. military initiated an unprovoked bombing campaign against Iran in partnership with Israel.

            <p>Just days after Sony decided to close remake masters Bluepoint Games, a new report claims that wasn't PlayStation itself that stonewalled the idea of a Bloodborne remake by Bluepoint, but developer FromSoftware.</p>
<p>Despite calling Bluepoint Games "an incredibly talented team" full of "technical expertise" which has "delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-closes-acclaimed-demons-souls-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-despite-acknowledging-it-had-delivered-exceptional-experiences-for-the-playstation-community">Sony shut down the studio last week</a>, impacting around 70 employees. At the time, a spokesperson said the decision was made "following a recent business review".</p>

<p>Sony - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-demons-souls-remake-developer-bluepoint-games">which acquired Bluepoint in 2021</a> - put the studio to work on a live-service God of War game, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">project it ultimately cancelled last year</a>, after Bluepoint released Demon's Souls as a launch exclusive for the PS5 in 2020. It was always hoped that Bluepoint would, at some point, be instructed to do the same for Bloodborne.</p><p>Now, a new report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure">Bloomberg</a> claims that Bluepoint did, in fact, approach FromSoft in early 2025, pitching a remake of the 2015 game. It's said that "the studio was told that the numbers made sense, but FromSoftware didn't want it to happen".</p>
<p>Interestingly, former president of Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hasnt-playstation-done-anything-new-with-bloodborne-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-theory">Shuhei Yoshida posited the same this time last year</a>, saying: "Bloodborne is one of the most popular asks on my Twitter/X. And the people wonder why we haven't really done anything... it should be easy, right?</p>
<p>"Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created. So I think he is interested but he's so successful and he's so busy, so he cannot do it himself, and he doesn't want anyone else to touch it."</p>
<p>After this rejection, Bluepoint allegedly pitched an updated version of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> remake to Sony, as well as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> spin-off, but these ideas were also turned down, with Bloomberg suggesting that other studios were "concerned about dedicating significant resources to another team's project".</p><p>Bloodborne has long been considered one of the greatest games ever made. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloodborne-review">We gave it an Essential, writing</a>: " it will be a painfully long time until I play anything else that matches up to Bloodborne's breadth of vision, generosity of content, and - yes - genius".</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Is Reportedly Pulling Back From PC When It Comes To Single-Player Blockbusters Like Wolverine]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/wolverine-pc-steam-ps5-exclusivity-sony-2000674746</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There was a moment back in 2024 when it seemed like a switch had flipped on console exclusivity. Microsoft was bringing some of its biggest games to Switch and PS5 and Sony was <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122">supporting PC ports more than ever</a>. A fully multiplatform future felt almost inevitable. But things have shifted since then and Sony is reportedly pulling back from platforms like Steam to double down on the PlayStation 5 ecosystem, at least when it comes to single-player games like<em> Wolverine</em>.</p>

 <p>We reported on rumors of this upcoming shift <a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-gpu-prices-eurogamer-layoffs-wolfenstein-3-casting-2000674011">earlier this week</a>. “I get the feeling that under the current leadership, that PC has become less important.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnZsurPI5EY&amp;t=1413s"><em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s John Linneman</a> said on a recent podcast. <em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Jason Schreier coincidently shared a <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-phil-spencer-retired-and-whats-next-for-xbox/id1507834679?i=1000751690666">similar inkling on <em>Triple Click</em></a>, adding that he wouldn’t be surprised if <em>Wolverine</em> just never came to PC at all.</p> <p>To make clear that this wasn’t just idle speculation, Schreier followed up on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-schreier-the-sense-i%E2%80%99m-getting-is-that-sony-is-backing-away-from-putting-their-exclusive-console-traditional-single-player-stuff-on-pc.1447141/page-6#post-151851202">gaming forum ResetEra</a> to clarify. “It’s not speculation, but sometimes topics come up on the show before I’m quite ready to publish a story about them,” he wrote. “More to come soon I’m sure.”</p> <p>Since then, insider NateTheHate has come out with an even more clear-cut pronouncement. “They are shifting their PC release strategy,” he tweeted <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2027438633997734231">on February 27</a>. “You’ll be seeing fewer single player games arrive on PC. The decision to shift away from supporting PC was made last year. Naturally, some may still release (pending how far along the ports were) but it no longer appears to be a priority for Sony moving forward.”</p>

 <p>That’s an awful lot of smoke for no fire, and in fact the flames have been building for a few months now. &nbsp;“It does seem like the games that PlayStation released on PC didn’t move the needle for them at all,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/EZkatWINAYE?t=10034s"><em>WindowsCentral</em>‘s Jez Cordon</a> said on a podcast last November based on what he’d heard from a source. “Partially because they were launched so late, but maybe they’ve used that as evidence that they shouldn’t go any further, and that they should remain more Nintendo in their approach and keep things more exclusive.”</p> <h2>PC ports made sense for Sony</h2> <div data-testid="cellInnerDiv"> <article tabindex="0" role="article" aria-labelledby="id__tfgnkwds43 id__3etdtbapts id__gkxm2zlkei5 id__yqgonprm9do id__95brirup5o5 id__rdsbu47lxs id__hpo3dl7sdw9 id__2xq9ja27s33 id__fh019t7ap2s id__u92w1vn3toc id__3xqb51w38fy id__9i7o8q9wt2c id__y8nxgtzxrol id__fape6cbjv87 id__hsg9hgs038p id__vz3me5ss3gk id__k8roej4k9p id__54j0po2ixwj id__90gwquh60vk id__oqfqs22kv1" data-testid="tweet"> <div id="id__oqfqs22kv1" role="group" aria-label="9 replies, 11 reposts, 224 likes, 10 bookmarks, 10301 views"> <p>Sony pulling back on PC outside of live-service games like <em>Marathon</em> and <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em> would fly in the face of recent conventional wisdom, which states that as development budgets balloon, publishers need to sell their games wherever they can in order to claw back as much sales revenue as possible. While ditching exclusives altogether might be lethal to a very lucrative PS5 console business, a hybrid approach like delayed ports coming to PC seemed like a smart way for the company to have its cake and eat it too.</p> <p>Has the strategy been successful though? Sony’s latest <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/110045/sony-has-made-at-least-dollars2-3-billion-selling-first-party-games-on-pc-and-xbox/index.html">earnings report</a> pointed to $2.37 billion in sales revenue from games on PC and Xbox. While that number is dominated by the success of live-service franchises like <em>Helldivers 2</em> and <em>MLB The Show</em>, it also includes over a million unit sales across recent ports like<em> Spider-Man 2</em> and <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. How much added revenue is enough to offset the costs of porting the games and any potential PS5 momentum that gets sacrificed from PC players who just wait instead of buying a console (and don’t forget Valve’s 30 percent cut of Steam sales)?</p> <p>Here’s what PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst told investors last year. “It’s important to realize that we’re really thoughtful about bringing our franchises off console to reach new audiences and that we’re taking a very measured, very deliberate approach in doing that,” he said. “Particularly on the single-player side, our tentpole titles, they’re such a point of differentiation for the PlayStation console.”</p> <h2>The case for not bringing<em> Wolverine</em> to Steam</h2> <p>Perhaps the last few years of data suggests the trade-off isn’t as worth it as Sony once hoped it would be. It could also be that the cinematic, story-driven blockbusters PlayStation Studios have become synonymous with just aren’t the types of games may PC players are very interested in, especially a year after launch hype has died down and with very little marketing.</p> <p>The genres that routinely blow up on Steam, from roguelikes with complex systems to hardcore soulslikes with unforgiving mechanics, are not the ones Sony is known for. Maybe that explains why <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/blog/stellar_blade/"><em>Stellar Blade</em> sold a million copies</a> on Steam in just three days where games like<em> God of War Ragnarök</em> have struggled (the occasional <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-steam-framerate-network-login-1851654888">busted port doesn’t help either</a>).</p> <p>Better to get those PC players who actually want to play Naughty Dog’s <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> to just go out and buy a PS5 (or a PS6) instead. If the current console generation has proven anything for Sony, it’s that it’s easier to make money off of existing diehard fans than try to rope in new ones.</p> </div> </article> </div>
