            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bungie">Bungie</a> aren't having a very good week are they? First there were those accusations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> using assets without permission from the artist 4ant1r34l (Antireal), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">which Bungie admitted to taking place</a>. Then yesterday there was a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2460495264">livestream</a> featuring game director Joe Ziegler and art director Joseph Cross which was filled with chat messages about said asset usage for practically the entire stream. Ziegler and Cross did at least address those messages, but with the response to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> already being quite mixed thus far, it doesn't amount to much right now.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Things also don't sound great internally at Bungie right now either. Several current and former employees reportedly spoke with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/17/new-marathon-info-bungie-morale-launch-worries-and-changing-plans/">Forbes</a> about where Bungie and Marathon are at right now, with morale apparently in "free-fall" across all departments. One source supposedly said "the vibes have never been worse", and staff are concerned about what happens if Marathon flops, something the studio can't afford. There's been nothing said about a potential delay from the current September release date, and it's unclear at a lower level if those discussions are being had by higher-ups.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to the art theft in particular, the explanation that's been provided publicly - that these assets were from a texture sheet made by a former Bungie artist - is the internal explanation as well.
</p>
<p>
Bungie's marketing plans sound like they're out the window too. A new trailer was meant to be coming in June, as well as the start of pre-orders, but this is apparently being reworked. A public beta meant to be held in August could now be turned into a "roadmap of public playtests" as well.
</p>
<p>
Those that spoke with Forbes also said that Marathon was pitched by higher-up "good old boy" Bungie leadership, and as long as five years ago team members were trying to explain what would and wouldn't work. They were frequently ignored. Apparently many devs even noted there should be some kind of PvE element to the game, a frequent complaint you will likely have seen about the game by now.
</p>
<p>
Bungie are in a very precarious position right now. They have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-bungies-plan-to-save-destiny-2-is-literal-star-wars-and-two-expansions-a-year">lots of Destiny 2 updates and expansions on the way</a>, but there's no guarantees that'll bring people back the way it needs to. Who knows if there's even time to fix these big issues Marathon is facing. We'll just have to wait and see for now.

Perhaps this was because many companies are gearing up for Summer Game Fest next month and this show got bitten in the ass by its move from March to May, or it’s just an extension of the tailspin the video game industry is dealing with right now. Whatever the reason, the result is the same: PAX East was a weird show for heavy hitters, but for those interested in seeing indie teams with small games and big ideas, being there felt like running around in a candy shop.

Despite everyone you know using it for hours on end, the video-sharing app is currently facing legislation that would force its ban in the U.S pending a potential sale, and prospective buyers are lining up.

Despite tensions ramping up some time ago, leading many to believe that the app would be banned in the U.S., matters had seemingly cooled until a bill was pushed through the House Energy and Commerce Committee last week, ratcheting up the pressure on ByteDance. The bill is expected to be reviewed and approved by the House of Representatives this week before being sent to the Senate, and President Joe Biden has already claimed he would sign off on a ban if the bill made it through legislation.</p><p>The bill requires that ByteDance “divest itself” of TikTok or see the app banned in the U.S., which has led to renewed interest from potential buyers, including Kotick. Kotick, according to WSJ’s sources, has floated the idea of a buy to ByteDance’s co-founder and is reportedly looking for partners, which could include Sam Altman of OpenAI. According to the Wall Street Journal, “OpenAI could use TikTok to help train its AI models if a partner such as Kotick could raise the capital for such an acquisition.” TikTok’s sale has been estimated to be in the range of “hundreds of billions of dollars.”</p><p>Kotick departed from Activision Blizzard late last year after completing the publisher’s $68 billion sale to Microsoft. Kotick’s tenure at Activision Blizzard spanned decades and came under fire in 2021, when the state of California filed a now-dismissed lawsuit following an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination. Ultimately, California’s Civil Rights Department withdrew all allegations and claims relating to harassment and settled with Activision Blizzard in December 2023 for $54 million to resolve unsubstantiated pay and promotions claims.</p><p>The court-approved settlement included a statement that provided that: </p><p>“[N]o court or any independent investigation has substantiated any allegations that there has been systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard; that Activision Blizzard senior executives ignored, condoned, or tolerated a culture of systemic harassment, retaliation, or discrimination; or that Activision Blizzard’s Board of Directors including its Chief Executive Officer, Robert Kotick, acted improperly with regard to the handling of any instances of workplace misconduct.”</p><p>In addition, the settlement noted that a former chair of the EEOC had conducted a review of the company’s policies, practices and certain complaint data and reported that there was no widespread harassment at the company. The company itself publicly released its Transparency Report, which further asserted that there was never been widespread or systemic harassment or gender pay inequity at Activision Blizzard. </p><p> Kotick departed with a golden parachute estimated to be worth around $15 million.</p><p><strong>Updated: 04/01/2024, 2:00 p.m. ET: </strong>This article has been updated to include details of the CRD settlement, that Activision Blizzard denied any wrongdoing, and the settlement confirms CRD could not substantiate those claims. </p><p><strong>Updated: 05/17/2025, 12:10 p.m. ET:</strong> This article has been updated to include additional language from the CRD settlement, and to include that as part of the settlement, the CRD withdrew the claims related to harassment from its complaint.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-star-wars-barbenheimer-of-games-vs-movies-mandalorian-and-grogu<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-mandalorian-grogu"><u>The Mandalorian and Grogu</u></a> is released next year on May 22, 2026 – the first new Star Wars movie to hit theaters in six and a half years – and then Grand Theft Auto VI hits four days later on May 26, 2026 – the first new GTA game in 12 and a half years – which one do you think is going to be the bigger deal? And which is going to be same old/same old?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On paper at least, these should be two of the biggest pop culture events of the year – the Barbenheimer of 2026. A new Star Wars movie? A new GTA title!? Grand Theft Watto!!? And while we can guarantee that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>GTA 6</u></a> will be huge – it’s <em>already</em> huge – The Mandalorian and his little friend are actually far less of a sure thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It reminds me of when I was a kid and I told my Noni that I would eat pizza every day if I could. And I meant it! She was like, no, you’d get sick of it eventually. But man, pizza every day sounds amazing! You know what though? Noni was 100% right. Pizza every day is actually really freaking gross, and it’s bad for you, and it’s bad for the people selling the pizza in the long run because eventually I’m just going to not want to even think about pizza again for a long, long time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And this is where we’re at with Star Wars right now: It’s pizza every day, over and over again. But GTA… the anticipation for a new GTA game has been building for years. And in some ways, that very anticipation is a big part of the allure of the franchise as well. It’s something Lucasfilm and Disney would do well to take note of.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not that GTA has a bigger cultural footprint than Star Wars. On the contrary, everyone knows who Darth Vader is (even my Noni did, I expect; at the very least she got me a TIE Fighter toy for my third-grade graduation). But the GTAs of the world are still aimed at a tighter demographic. The reason something like GTA can make as much money as it does (more on that in a sec) is because folks spend a lot more playing a game like that than they do going to see a movie. Its success is not because more people are playing it than are watching Star Wars. But one must also consider the lasting impact of a game of this nature, the amount of time that it takes to complete, the replayability, and the interactivity versus the, frankly, old-fashioned act of watching a movie or show and then moving on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">2015’s The Force Awakens, which kicked off the era of modern (i.e., Disney) Star Wars, brought in <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2488496/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>$2.071 billion</u></a> at the box office worldwide. But Lucasfilm’s hyperdrive motivator was already starting to lose some steam by the time the Sequel Trilogy closed out: The last new Star Wars movie to be released, 2019’s The Rise of Skywalker, made <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2527338/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>$1.077 billion</u></a>, almost half what The Force Awakens did. Star Wars was already feeling pretty commonplace after just four short years of its return to the big screen, and the numbers bear that out.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Star Wars was already feeling pretty commonplace after just four years back on the big screen, and the numbers bear that out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Force Awakens actually serves as a better comparison than Rise of Skywalker to the last Grand Theft Auto game, GTA 5, since the game came out in 2013. That just lets us compare the amount of money the two properties brought in a little more cleanly since it’s just a two-year gap between releases. And even though Rey, Finn and Poe’s first adventure (remember them?) is also the fifth-highest grossing film of all time worldwide (not adjusted for inflation), its numbers still pale in comparison to those of GTA 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So about that: Released in September 2013, GTA 5 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2014/05/13/grand-theft-auto-5-has-sold-nearly-2-billion-at-retail/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>made a billion dollars in three days</u></a>. By May of 2014, the game had sold 33 million copies, which would come to approximately $1.98 billion in sales (based on a price of $60 per unit, which is an estimate and doesn’t take into account sale prices, for example). I know – you’re thinking, ‘That’s still below The Force Awakens’ $2.017 billion and it took nine months to get there.’ But whereas The Force Awakens made all that theatrical dough in just a couple of months before leaving theaters, GTA 5 just kept on grabbing the loot year after year after year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/grand-theft-auto-built-for-the-long-haul-68eff4de" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Barron’s</u></a> reported that GTA 5 had grossed over $8.5 billion since its release in 2013. And last year, publisher <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-5-surpasses-200-million-units-sold"><u>Take-Two revealed</u></a> in an earnings report that the game had, at that time, continued to sell approximately five million units every three months. This is of course in part due to the fact that GTA 5 has been released on three generations of consoles over the years, and the revenue from GTA Online must be considered as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">By comparison, the combined box office total of all the Disney-era Star Wars movies – The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker, Rogue One, and Solo – is $5.934 billion. That’s, well, a few <em>billion </em>dollars less than what is essentially a single game in GTA 5. But the other money that the Star Wars franchise brings in is a little harder to track – Blu-rays, digital downloads, streaming, merchandising, theme parks, and, of course, its licensed video games as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things get a bit opaque here because while having, for example, all the Star Wars movies (and TV shows) available on Disney+ exclusively is certainly a draw for potential subscribers, it’s also difficult to attach a dollar value to that scenario. Ditto the theme parks. Yes, you too can rub elbows with an ersatz Rey while at Galaxy’s Edge, and you can also pay $200-plus for a custom lightsaber to shut up your kid’s whining, but how much does that add to the overall take-home of quote/unquote Star Wars itself? (Star Wars games, meanwhile, can be hit or miss; for every Jedi Fallen Order success there’s an Outlaws that has a rough go of it.) Does all the Star Wars stuff in the world that people can and do buy make up that extra three billion dollars to put the series at the same gross revenue point as GTA 5? Maybe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s only one Grand Theft Auto game as compared to the entirety of the modern Star Wars line. Of course, GTA’s online multiplayer mode, with its new cars and interactive events, keeps players coming back over and over again – easily spending beyond the price of the game itself thanks to its in-game currency. (And by the way, why doesn’t GTA have a more extensive line of merchandise IRL? Where are my GTA toys? Why can’t I go to a GTA theme park in California, or even better, <em>Florida</em>, where I can get in an awesome car and run over people to my heart’s desire before buying a custom uzi!?)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well actually, maybe that’s where the real difference between these two franchises – in the here and now of the year 2025 – can best be articulated, and why people rolled their eyes when, for example, the Ryan Gosling/Shawn Levy Star Wars movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-starfighter-is-a-new-film-starring-ryan-gosling-thats-arriving-in-theaters-in-may-2027-star-wars-celebration"><u>Starfighter was officially announced</u></a> recently compared to the incredible excitement that can be felt around any and all <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-fans-go-deep-on-trailer-2-to-work-out-which-bits-are-gameplay-after-rockstar-clarification"><u>GTA 6 news</u></a>. As noted, it’s going on 13 years since a new GTA game was released. Compare that to the constant watering down of Star Wars through streaming shows, announced movies that never happen, bad movies (and, sure, some good ones!), and the aforementioned ever-present merchandising that we’ve been inundated with since at least 2014, when the marketing build-up to The Force Awakens kicked in. There’s just <em>so much Star Wars now</em>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When a new GTA title finally is released, there's a huge demand, but also the amount of time and resources that have been put into it are clear. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And that brings me back Noni and my pizza dreams – dreams that were dashed (Dash Rendar’d?) when I realized she was right about too much of a good thing. Sure, sometimes the toppings are different, and some days it tastes better than others, but Star Wars is just always <em>there </em>now. There’s nothing special about it anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But GTA… GTA brings me to a different Noni memory. Rockstar only serves new editions of the beloved franchise on the most special of occasions. It’s sort of like lasagna on Christmas! We didn’t get lasagna all the time growing up, so when we found out Noni was making sauce and lasagna was in the offing, it was awesome. The meatballs and sausage sliced up, the oozing ricotta, the basil leaves on top, the toasted Italian bread to go with it – just the best. And it wasn’t just the actual lasagna, but even the <em>anticipation </em>of it. Knowing that it was coming was almost as good as actually sitting down and eating it. It was a rare and special thing, like a new GTA game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar also has a history of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history"><u>delaying new installments</u></a> of the series – they will serve no wine before its time. The result of this philosophy is that when a new GTA title finally is released, there is a huge demand, but also the amount of time and resources that have been put into the game are clear in the finished version. With all due respect to the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy, there was obviously no plan in terms of the <em>trilogy </em>part of it all. (One day Rian Johnson will say how he really feels about the 180-degree turn The Rise of Skywalker took after his film.) Audiences aren’t dumb; they can tell the difference between something that is rushed to make a date versus a work of art that is given its due time to develop and evolve as it should.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Jason Duval Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Is the GTA series an outlier in the world of games? Certainly. And yet, as of 2023, Minecraft had sold over 300 million copies (including sales across the many platforms it's released on) and Tetris had sold over 520 million copies. (GTA 5 is at 200 million+ and the Grand Theft Auto franchise overall has 430 million units sold.) And that’s just the top of the pile of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-selling-video-games-of-all-time-grand-theft-auto-minecraft-tetris"><u>best-selling games</u></a>. People like video games! Who knew?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s crazy to think now that there was a 16-year gap between Return of the Jedi and The Phantom Menace. It was a relatively fallow period for Star Wars (even if the expanded universe and merchandising continued), and when George Lucas finally did return to theaters in 1999 with young Ani and Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, there were lines around the block everywhere. That was excitement. There was huge anticipation for a thing we all loved that we hadn’t gotten a new installment of in a long, long time. The same happened 10 years after Revenge of the Sith, which we had all thought was the end of the Star Wars movies forever, when The Force Awakens rekindled the Star Wars flame. Audiences were truly amped to return to that galaxy far, far away again.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Upcoming Star Wars Movie and TV Show</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that gap between Return of the Jedi and The Phantom Menace, that 16 years, that’s not far off from the 13 years that will have passed between GTA 5 and GTA 6. The expectations, the hopes, the theorizing, the <em>fun </em>of knowing a new game in the series is coming. It’s almost as important as the game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in the case of the next Star Wars movie… which is the continuation of a TV show… which has had three seasons already… and at least a couple of spin-offs… well, it’s gonna be kind of hard for audiences to get too excited for that, I think. Sure, it may prove to be a good or even a great movie – I hope it does.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But you have to wonder. How many people are gonna say to themselves, “Eh, I’ll wait for when it hits streaming.”</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Developer Shift Up said it was "closely discussing the region lock issue" with Sony after it became apparent yesterday, Friday 16th May, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-release-blocked-on-steam-in-over-120-countries-surprising-even-its-developer">Stellar Blade Steam's release on 11th June has been blocked in over 120 countries</a> without explanation.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/stellarblade/status/1923430874391118044">brief statement</a> posted to social media, the developer stressed it was doing its "BEST" to resolve "most of" the issue as soon as possible and would come back to players "as soon as [it] has more to share".</p>

<p>After players also discovered that Denuvo has been incorporated in the PC version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>, much to the annoyance of some, the studio also took the opportunity to provide a chart to demonstrate DRM had been "hard-tuned to maintain the same average frame rate, with even higher minimum frames in some cases".</p>
<p>"Mods are fully supported without any restrictions. PSN connecting entirely optional and NEVER required. Both the PC and PS5 versions offer the same content. We will make sure that early buyers are never at a disadvantage through future updates," the studio stressed.</p> <div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was review-bombed last year following a PSN requirement, which led to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">game being pulled from sale in 177 countries</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">company quickly u-turned its decision</a> following the backlash.

<p>We gave Stellar Blade four stars out of five in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Eurogamer's Stellar Blade review</a>, writing: "Stellar Blade has a fair bit of weirdness, but its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/667900/doom-the-dark-ages-clair-obscur-expedition-33-parry-season<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you like games with parrying, there are two great new ways to get your fix: <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. These very different games — one is a fast-paced first-person shooter, the other a turn-based fantasy RPG — approach the mechanic in very different ways.</p><p>Let’s start with <em>Doom</em>. One of the big new additions to the game is a giant shield for the Doom Slayer, and you can use it to block projectiles or enemy attacks. The game helpfully signals anything that you can parry in a bright neon green that’s easy to see as you’re rushing around and destroying hordes of demons.</p><p>When a green projectile gets within range or an enemy does a green attack, you can press the parry button at the right time to deflect the danger with a huge reverberation of your shield and an action-movie-like moment of slow motion. Like most of modern <em>Doom</em>’s action, it all looks, feels, and sounds very satisfying. But parries are also critical for fights, as they can open up an opportunity to hit the enemy with a punch or a few shots from whatever monstrous gun you’re wielding.</p><div><p>Stay keen for something green</p></div><p>In intense battles, I’m always hunting for green glints to find things to parry to potentially gain an advantage. When an enemy shoots a spread of bullets with some green interspersed, I’ll even run <em>toward</em> the danger to get in a good deflection. Some weapon upgrades have perks tied to parries, too, giving you many incentives to stay keen for something green.</p><p><em>Doom</em>, very helpfully, has a setting that lets you change the timing for the parry window whenever you want. I have no shame in admitting that I’ve occasionally made the parry window as wide as the game allows; yes, it lowers the difficulty, but I like parrying every chance I can.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kepler Interactive</cite></p></div><p><em>Expedition 33</em>’s parrying system is just as thrilling and impactful, but shifts from fast-paced action to turn-based battles. When it’s an enemy’s turn in a battle, they’ll often wind up their giant swords, axes, or fists for flashy, multistep attack combos, and you can parry each hit if you time things right.</p><p>Every successful parry regains one AP, which you’ll spend during your turn to use skills. More powerful skills typically have higher AP costs, so the more blows you parry, the better equipped you’ll be on your next turn. Parry all of an enemy’s attacks on their turn and you’ll do a counter (which also has an action-movie-like slow-motion effect) that can be a very helpful way to chip away at a health bar.</p><p>That’s not easy, though: <em>Expedition 33</em>’s gives you a <em>very</em> tight window to press the parry button in time to block a hit, and if you miss the window, you’ll take some damage. Missing multiple parries on a single turn might drain your health bar from full to empty, and given how tricky the game’s enemies can get with staggering their hits or faking you out, that will probably happen often.</p><p>The game lets you dodge enemy attacks, which has a much wider timing window, but you don’t gain AP and you won’t get a chance to counter. I found myself leaning toward parries far more than dodges: despite the risks, landing a successful series of parries, especially in a high-stakes battle, was usually worth the trial and error because of how cool it looked and how much it helped in a fight.</p><p>I do wish <em>Expedition 33</em> had a setting to adjust the parrying windows just slightly (and if you’re on PC, there’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/28">a mod that can help with that</a>). But I also get why the timing is so tough: the rewards are high, but so are the costs.</p><p>Parrying can be a divisive mechanic, especially when it’s challenging. That’s why people bounce off of games like <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em> and <em>Nine Sols</em>. But <em>Doom</em> and <em>Expedition 33</em> both offer new and interesting takes on the idea that show just how rewarding a good parry can be.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>My Ars colleagues were kicking back at the Orbital HQ water cooler the other day, and—as gracefully aging gamers are wont to do—they began to reminisce about classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment">Sierra On-Line adventure games</a>. I was a huge fan of these games in my youth, so I settled in for some hot buttered nostalgia.</p>
<p>Would we remember the limited-palette joys of early King's Quest, Space Quest, or Quest for Glory titles? Would we branch out beyond games with "Quest" in their titles, seeking rarer fare like<em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddy_Pharkas:_Frontier_Pharmacist">Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist</a></em>? What about the gothic stylings of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colonel%27s_Bequest">The Colonel's Bequest</a></em> or the voodoo-curious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Knight:_Sins_of_the_Fathers"><em>Gabriel Knight</em></a>?</p>
<p>Nope. The talk was of acorns. [Bleeping] acorns, in fact.</p>
<p>The scene in question came from <em>King's Quest III</em>, where our hero Gwydion must acquire some exceptionally desiccated acorns to advance the plot. It sounds simple enough. As one <a href="http://www.sierraplanet.net/kqgames/kings-quest-iii/kq3-walkthrough/">walkthrough</a> puts it, "Go east one screen and north one screen to the acorn tree. Try picking up acorns until you get some dry ones. Try various spots underneath the tree." Easy! And clear!</p>
<p>Except it wasn't either one because the game rather notoriously won't always give you the acorns, even when you enter the right command. This led many gamers to believe they were in the wrong spot, when in reality, <em>they just had to keep entering the "get acorns" command</em> while moving pixel by pixel around the tree until the game finally supplied them. One of our staffers admitted to having purchased the <em>King's Quest III</em> hint book solely because of this "puzzle." (The hint book, which is now online, says that players should "move around" the particular oak tree in question because "you can only find the right kind of acorns in one spot.")</p>
<p>This wasn't quite the "fun" I had remembered from these games, but as I cast my mind back, I dimly recalled similar situations. <em>Space Quest II: Vohaul's Revenge</em> had been my first Sierra title. After my brother and I spent weeks on the game only to die repeatedly in some pitch-dark tunnels, we implored my dad to call Sierra's 1-900 pay hint line. He thought about it. I could see it pained him because he had never before (and never since!) called a 1-900 number. In this case, the call cost a piratical 75 cents for the first minute and 50 cents for each additional minute. After listening to us whine for several days straight, my dad decided that his sanity was worth the fee, and he called.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Like the acorn example above, we had known what to do—we had just not done it to the game's rather exacting standards. The key was to use a glowing gem as a light source, which my brother and I had long understood. The problem was the text parser, which demanded that we "put gem in mouth" to use the gem's light in the tunnels. There was no other place to put the gem, no other way to hold or attach it. (We tried them all.) No other attempt to use the light of this shining crystal, no matter how clear, well-intentioned, or succinctly expressed, would work. You put the gem in your mouth, or you died in the darkness.</p>
<p>Returning from my reveries to the conversation at hand, I caught Ars Senior Editor Lee Hutchinson's cynical remark that these kinds of puzzles were "the only way to make 2–3 hours of 'game' last for months." This seemed rather shocking, almost offensive. How could one say such a thing about the games that colored my memories of childhood?</p>
<p>So I decided to replay <em>Space Quest II</em> for the first time in 35 years in an attempt to defend my own past.</p>
<p>Big mistake.</p>

<h2>Play it again, Sam</h2>
<p>In my memory, the Space Quest series was filled with sharply written humor, clever puzzles, and enchanting art. But when I fired up the original version of the game, I found that only one of these was true. The art, despite its blockiness and limited colors, remained charming.</p>
<p>As for the gameplay, the puzzles were not so much "clever" as "infuriating," "obvious," or (more often) "rather obscure."</p>
<p>Finding the glowing gem discussed above requires you to swim into one small spot of a multi-screen river, with no indication in advance that anything of importance is in that exact location. Trying to "call" a hunter who has captured you does nothing… until you do it a second time. And the less said about trying to throw a puzzle at a Labian Terror Beast, typing out various word permutations while death bears down upon you, the better.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The whole game was also filled with far more no-warning insta-deaths than I had remembered. On the opening screen, for instance, after your janitorial space-broom floats off into the cosmic ether, you can walk your character right off the edge of the orbital space station he is cleaning. The game doesn't stop you; indeed, it kills you and then mocks you for "an obvious lack of common sense." It then calls you a "wing nut" with an "inability to sustain life." Game over.</p>
<p>The game's third screen, which features nothing more to do than simply walking around, will also kill you in at least two different ways. Walk into the room still wearing your spacesuit and your boss will come over and chew you out. Game over.</p>
<p>If you manage to avoid that fate by changing into your indoor uniform first, it's comically easy to tap the wrong arrow key and fall off the room's completely guardrail-free elevator platform. Game over.</p>
<figure>

      Do NOT touch any part of this root monster.

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Get used to it because the game will kill you in so, so many ways: touching any single pixel of a root monster whose branches form a difficult maze; walking into a giant mushroom; stepping over an invisible pit in the ground; getting shot by a guard who zips in on a hovercraft; drowning in an underwater tunnel; getting swiped at by some kind of giant ape; not putting the glowing gem in your mouth; falling into acid; and many more.</p>
<p>I used the word "insta-death" above, but the game is not even content with this. At one key point late in the game, a giant <em>Aliens</em>-style alien stalks the hallways, and if she finds you, she "kisses" you. But then she leaves! You are safe after all! Of course, if you have seen the films, you will recognize that you are <em>not</em> safe, but the game lets you go on for a bit before the alien's baby inevitably bursts from your chest, killing you. Game over.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>This is why the <a href="https://www.spacequest.net/sq2/hintbook/">official hint book</a> suggests that you "save your game a lot, especially when it seems that you're entering a dangerous area. That way, if you die, you don't have to retrace your steps much." Presumably, this was once considered entertaining.</p>
<p>When it comes to the humor, most of it is broad. (When you are told to "say the word," you have to say "the word.") Sometimes it is condescending. ("You quickly glance around the room to see if anyone saw you blow it.") Or it might just be potty jokes. (Plungers, jock straps, toilet paper, alien bathrooms, and fouling one's trousers all make appearances.)</p>
<p>My total gameplay time: a few hours.</p>
<p>"By <a href="https://frakipedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grabthar%27s_Hammer">Grabthar's hammer</a>!" I thought. "Lee was right!"</p>

<p>When I admitted this to him, Lee told me that he had actually spent time learning to speedrun the Space Quest games during the pandemic. "According to my notes, a clean run of SQ2 in 'fast' mode—assuming good typing skills—takes about 20 minutes straight-up," he said. Yikes.</p>

      What a fiendish plot!

  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<h2>And yet</h2>
<p>The past was a different time. Computer memory was small, graphics capabilities were low, and computer games had emerged from the "let them live just long enough to encourage spending another quarter" arcade model. Mouse adoption took a while; text parsers made sense even though they created plenty of frustration. So yes—some of these games were a few hours of gameplay stretched out with insta-death, obscure puzzles, and the sheer amount of time it took just to walk across the game's various screens. (Seriously, "walking around" took a ridiculous amount of the game's playtime, especially when a puzzle made you backtrack three screens, type some command, and then return.)</p>

<p>Judged by current standards, the Sierra games are no longer what I would play for fun.</p>
<p>All the same, I loved them. They introduced me to the joy of exploring virtual worlds and to the power of evocative artwork. I went into space, into fairy tales, and into the past, and I did so while finding the games' humor humorous and their plotlines compelling. ("An army of life insurance salesmen?" I thought at the time. "Hilarious and brilliant!")</p>
<p>If the games can feel a bit arbitrary or vexing today, my child-self's love of repetition was able to treat them as engaging challenges rather than "unfair" design.</p>
<p>Replaying <em>Space Quest II</em>, encountering the half-remembered jokes and visual designs, brought back these memories. The novelist Thomas Wolfe knew that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can't_Go_Home_Again">you can't go home again</a>, and it was probably inevitable that the game would feel dated to me now. But playing it again did take me back to that time before the Internet, when not even hint lines, insta-death, and EGA graphics could dampen the wonder of the new worlds computers were capable of showing us.</p>

            <p>Just a year after release, Activision is "streamlining" and ending support for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, ceasing all seasonal content.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1923470814357385447">statement</a>, the developer said while it understood "this news may be disappointing", the mobile shooter had "not met [its] expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences."</p>

<p>"We deeply appreciate your dedication and passion for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile. Going forward, we will be streamlining the scope of the game. This decision was made after careful consideration of various factors and while we're proud of the accomplishment in bringing Call of Duty: Warzone to mobile in an authentic way, it unfortunately has not met our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences," the statement began.</p>
<p>"As a result, we will no longer be delivering new seasonal content and gameplay updates to the mobile version. Effective immediately, players will no longer be able to purchase Call of Duty Points or Black Cell using real currency in Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile. Sunday, May 18, 2025 will be the last day the game can be downloaded from the Google Play and Apple’s App Store and social features across both mobile platforms will be retired."</p>
<p>Players who install the game before next Monday, 19th May, will still be able to play, complete with cross-progression and shared inventories. They'll also be able to use unspent COD Points. After Monday, however, the game will no longer be downloadable from mobile stores, nor will players be able to spend any further real currency on COD Points or Battle Passes.</p>
<p>It's not clear how long the game will stay online, but Activision <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes">stressed</a>, "refunds are not available for previously purchased in-game content on unused COD Points".</p>
<p>"We know that this news may be disappointing, and we truly appreciate the support, passion, feedback, and dedication from our community," the statement added. "We have special incentives for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile players in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-mobile">Call of Duty: Mobile</a> and encourage our players to try it for free."</p>
<p>Activision's sibling Call of Duty mobile game, which is different from Warzone, is seemingly faring much better. In May 2022, the publisher revealed<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-mobile-reaches-650m-downloads"> the mobile title had reached an impressive 650 million downloads</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/PlayCODMobile/status/1853527640516293059">a billion by November 2024</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo-tv-series-show-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have been watching <em>The Last Of Us'</em> second season for five weeks now, and I think I've had quite enough.</p><p>Without wanting to re-enter the Thunderdome of <em>TLOU2 </em>criticism, I will just say that I thought the <em>game</em>, while having some good video game bits,<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/6/12/21288535/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-naughty-dog-ellie-joel-violence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> is also</a> a<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-not-so-hidden-israeli-politics-of-the-last-of-us-part-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> wider disaster</a> and leave it at that. It was a <em>bit much</em>. The TV adaptation had a chance to change things though, so I went into this season--having not really dug the first--willing to give it a chance.</p><p>Mostly out of curiosity, because the stuff I hadn't liked about the first season--that it was just tracing over the lines of the first game, and I'd played that game already!--simply weren't going to work here. <em>TLOU2's </em>setting and storyline, split over two characters and dwelling in one location as long as it does, was going to need a different approach than the first's "post apocalyptic road trip" premise.</p><p>Maybe those changes would make a deeply unpalatable video game more palatable! Maybe the time and distance we've all put between the game's release in 2020 and now will have given the show’s creators a chance to survey <em>TLOU2's</em> messaging, read the room as it stands in 2025 and make a tweak here or there.</p><p>Nope! This show is bad television.</p><p>We are five episodes into this mess and I don't know if there's a single thing I like, whether that be changes they've made to the game or just the way this is working as a TV show. If I wasn't professionally invested in seeing where this all ends up I don't think I would have made it even this far without pulling the plug.</p><p>As an adaptation, I think it's bad. The casting, which was not great in S1 (I don't think either Joel <em>or </em>Ellie was the right choice!), has not improved, the lowlight being Kaitlyn Dever's Abby, who is playing an almost entirely different character (though I'll say here that a rare win was Catherine O'Hara's brief turn as the town therapist). Some of the changes made to<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2s-changes-to-abby-weaken-its-most-shocking-moment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the way certain events go down have done little but rob them of their impact</a>. And the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/may/14/i-didnt-sign-up-for-a-musical-are-the-guitar-sing-alongs-killing-the-last-of-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> musical numbers, key to the game, have already outstayed their welcome</a> in successive weeks on the show.</p><p>Worst of all is the fact, given room to breathe by splitting <em>TLOU2's</em> story across two seasons and to finally add something of its own to events, the show has been filling the space with empty calories. "To pretend that <em>The Last of Us</em> completely transcends its original medium would be to ignore the hole at the center of the show where insight and complexity and rich supporting characters should be", Judy Berman<a href="https://time.com/7273394/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-hbo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> wrote</a> for Time in her review of the season. "What fill out the episodes instead are extended zombie-battle scenes and long, silent sequences where people explore gorgeously decaying spaces. At those moments, you might as well be watching someone play a video game."</p><p>But just as a <em>show</em>, for those watching without any experience of the games, it's also bad. This is a prestige HBO series; why is the production so lavish in some areas (rotting record stores) yet so cheap in so many others? Why are so many people's clothes clean and pristine, why is their skin fresh, their hair always looking freshly-brushed? This is the apocalypse! Why is everything, even in this hellhole, lit like a daytime soap?</p><p>This show has looked at a big, spectacular but also deeply troubled video game and taken all the wrong stuff away from it. One of the few things <em>TLOU2 </em>did really well was make Seattle a <em>place</em>, a dark, psychotic wasteland; this show has turned it into a theme park. And the worst thing the game did was go needlessly overboard with its human misery, so of course the show has tried lifting that wholesale, and botched that too.</p><p>Key moments of extreme violence--the events that dominate the storyline of <em>TLOU2</em>--are still here in the TV series, but thanks to its casting, writing and production choices they don't feel like the culmination of a brooding revenge tale. They feel tacked on, gratuitous acts making cameos from the game while much of their context and impetus has been left behind, like a cordyceps-infested Kool-Aid man crashing through the wall for no reason whatsoever.</p><p>Like Kenneth said<a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in his review at Kotaku</a>, it's "a show that wants no part of the intentional disconnect between player and protagonist that Naughty Dog built into the game". We're just all along for the ride here, and the ride sucks.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/giant-bomb-fandom-sale-independent-media"><h3>How Giant Bomb Went Un-Corporate</h3></a><p>"The reality is, we don’t know how to make something like Giant Bomb work inside a corporation"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-giant-bomb-went-un-corporate.1191765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/giant-bomb-fandom-sale-independent-media<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just a couple weeks ago, it seemed like Fandom was <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-giant-bomb-polygon-layoffs-valnet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the verge of blowing up Giant Bomb</a>, a website known for its personality-driven persistence in the face of multiple ill-suited corporate overlords. But then, at PAX East, the GB crew took the stage to announce that they’d pulled off the impossible in the year 2025: <a href="https://aftermath.site/giant-bomb-sold-new-owners-jeff-fandom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a happy ending to a tale of digital-media-related woe</a>. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we ask newly minted Giant Bomb co-owner Jeff Grubb how Giant Bomb gained its freedom.</p><p>We discuss how Jeff and the rest of the Giant Bomb crew managed to buy their freedom and what the future holds now that the shackles are off. Jeff says to expect a lot more, as he puts it, “bullshit” that a corporation wouldn’t view as profitable or brand safe. We also dig into questions to which there are not necessarily concrete answers yet. What would it look like for this version of Giant Bomb to bring on more people? More pressingly, how does the site put together one of its beloved “Couch” events for Summer Game Fest in a few weeks, sans Fandom’s resources?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to recent Switch 2 news and talk about very specific games we’ve been playing (<em>RoadCraft</em>, a truck sicko sandbox, and <em>The Hundred Line</em>, aka <em>Fire Emblem</em> for freaks). Finally, we reach into the depths of the mailbag and pull out the Scrappy Doo of video games, as well as an extended digression about <a href="https://aftermath.site/hag-capisco-office-chair-ergonomic-review-sit-weird" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris’ wild yet undeniably alluring Norwegian chair</a>.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can begin staging our own rival Couch events, leading to cross-site pro wrestling showdowns that will easily steal the spotlight from Geoff Keighley (he can also wrestle, if he wants).&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What was happening at Giant Bomb that made things feel, to viewers at least, like they were off – that made you guys feel constrained in a way that independence now allows you to be free of?</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Let me think about how I can talk about this: Mostly, it is the wider issue of making a games media business make sense in a corporation in the first place. I think we’ve seen that run into a wall across the board. Everyone’s kind of looking for answers, and a lot of people have ideas about what that can look like, and a bunch of stuff gets tried. Sometimes multiple things get tried at the same time, and they sort of clash.&nbsp;</p><p>But the reality is, we don’t know how to make something like Giant Bomb work inside a corporation, and I think other people on that [corporate] side also trying to figure that out was always going to be a challenge. If it wasn’t this moment [that we reached an impasse], it would have been something else. We were heading here no matter what.&nbsp;</p><p>But in terms of things going down, it was just a matter of, we were trying this livestreaming thing where we were gonna be live for most of the day, and that just had so many other issues with the two brands – Giant Bomb and GameSpot – coming together and mixing those things. What should the tone be? We just missed a couple times. We were aware of that and trying to figure that out, and then some new leadership came in and were like “Let’s pause some stuff,” and that caused things to spiral out in the public. Reality was, we were figuring some things out, but it just kept getting worse, in some ways. That is when separating became a really good idea – right there in that moment when it was time to pause the streaming. We could start talking about that.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>What was the sequence of events? How did it go from you being out of a job to announcing at PAX that you partially owned the thing? Seems like it was a rollercoaster.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>I can only talk vaguely about this stuff, but in general it seemed like this was an idea that Fandom was actually working on for quite some time before they presented it to us. The idea was ready to go.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> So they came to you with the idea, as opposed to you coming to them?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Yes, I think this doesn’t work unless they think it’s their idea and they’re doing the right thing, and I agree. There was never a moment where I was questionable about them offering it, but [I wasn’t sure] that was something we could make sense of – like, that we could pull off. So that was vaguely in that same time as I was leaving. There was a day or two where I just didn’t believe [buying the site from Fandom] was gonna be possible; it’s just something the company says to make things cool in the moment.&nbsp;</p><p>But then as I looked back on it, I was like “What if we did just try?” Then we went full bore on it, and I realized I had some options. I had my personal Patreon, and I could sort of fall back on that if none of this worked. Or maybe we could’ve started something new. But in this moment, if we could – and that’s the way I was looking at it – save Giant Bomb, we should definitely take that on as a responsibility. So it was kind of this weird black hole of me wondering what was going on and getting this offer at the same time, as I was leaving the company.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I recall now that when people were still wondering what was going on at Giant Bomb, fans noticed that you all followed the same Instagram account. Was that a possible next project if things with Giant Bomb didn’t work out?</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Yeah, basically. Not much more to say about that, but yeah, we were definitely talking about a bunch of ideas. That stuff was very nascent – putting some placeholders there in case the worst happened or we had to make a quick exit. We talked about a bunch of things, but that was definitely one of them.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a show we do called “Blight Club” where we just play bad games; we play them to completion, we take turns. We really like doing that show. It’s been a lot of fun for us. Right now Mike [Minotti] is playing <em>Rascal </em>for PS1, which as a character designed by Jim Henson’s workshop. We make the person playing dress up as a character from the game as well. And so in my mind it was like, “We’re gonna do Blight Club no matter what.” Maybe we’d do it off on our own, and then we could sort of build stuff up around that.&nbsp;</p><p>And so the fact that we can just keep that going, and it’s still being built up around Giant Bomb, is awesome. Now we can reinvest in all these things and get back to changing the incentive of how we view what we should be making. For a while it was like “This should probably serve GameSpot’s algorithm on YouTube. We should be worried about that. We want to help out. We want to be part of the team.” But now it’s like, I installed the FlippyDrive on the Gamecube. If I want to do a whole stream just messing around with that thing, I can do it and sort of justify it as “The community wants the bullshit. Let’s get into the bullshit.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo-tv-series-show-impressions"><h3>The Last Of Us Season 2 Is Bad Television</h3></a><p>It's not great, whether you've played the game or not</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For one day only on May 16, from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. ET, shoppers can earn 10 percent back in store credit on everything across the site. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes singles, sealed product, preorders, and supplies. Subscribers get an even better return with 12 percent back, plus any loyalty bonuses they've built up. With the Pokémon singles market currently going through a major correction, this is the ideal time to scoop up chase cards that have become far more affordable.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: TCG Player Mayhem Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy fans diving into Magic: The Gathering have even more reason to celebrate during TCGplayer’s Mayhem Sale. Preorders for the upcoming Final Fantasy crossover set are live now, and they’re all included in the 10 percent store credit promotion. That means if you're looking to lock in iconic characters like Tifa, Sephiroth, Cloud, or Y’shtola in premium foil treatments, you're not only getting ahead of release day scarcity but also stacking credit toward your next order. With singles like Tifa, Martial Artist (Borderless Surge Foil) at $450 or Cloud, Midgar Mercenary (Mythic Extended Art) at $125, the cashback can add up fast, earning you as much as $45 store credit from just one card.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">MTG Final Fantasy Single Cards</h3><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>For collectors chasing the Neon Ink variants, the value gets even better. Cards like Traveling Chocobo (Mythic Borderless Neon Ink Blue) and Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER (Extended Art) are already priced at a premium due to limited availability and collector demand. Getting 10 percent back on these high-end preorders is essentially a rebate on the kind of grail-tier singles that rarely see discounts. And because these cards won’t be widely available again once the initial wave sells out, now is the perfect time to secure them.</p><p>Even for buyers with more modest budgets, the Mayhem Sale applies to lower-cost preorders too. Whether it’s grabbing a Rare Cloud’s Limit Break for under $20 or a standard Sephiroth, Planet's Heir for less than $10, you’ll still get cashback toward future pickups. This makes it easier to build a full collection over time without blowing your budget all at once. And since TCGplayer supports hobby shops and small sellers, it’s a good way to invest in your collection while supporting the broader Magic community.</p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Destined Rivals Preorders</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG collectors have a lot to be excited about. Prices are dipping across the board, and the Mayhem Sale stacks real value on top. Cards like Greninja ex and Magikarp have seen huge drops, making them far more attainable. Journey Together is full of alternate rares and stamped promos that are now priced under ten dollars, and even premium pulls like Lillie’s Clefairy ex are well below the $150 mark.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Glory of Team Rocket</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Prismatic Evolutions is another standout, with high-end cards like Umbreon ex finally within reach. Getting $110 in store credit back on a single Umbreon purchase is the kind of value that doesn’t come around often.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Journey Together</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">With major price corrections in the Pokémon market and competitive cashback across the board, TCGplayer’s Mayhem Sale stands out as the best daily deal in the trading card space. It’s a rare chance to buy when prices are low and still earn credit toward your next round of pickups. If your collection has been on hold or your decks need tuning, this is the time to make it happen.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Prismatic Evolutions</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Surging Sparks</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Stellar Crown</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Shrouded Fable</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Twilight Masquerade</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Temporal Forces</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Paldean Fates</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Paradox Rift</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">151</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Obsidian Flames</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Scarlet and Violet</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Silver Tempest</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Lost Origin</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Fusion Strike</h3><p id="magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy">MTG Final Fantasy Starter Kit</h2></p><div catalogid="cfdff7da-51da-4bf2-8b73-9ca328f77d30" id="220727"><div id="220727" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy Starter Kit</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Preorder, releases June 13</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Arguably one of the most popular boxes, the FFVII-focused starter kit features Cloud and Sephiroth decks and it's just under $20.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-happens-when-a-game-developer-makes-a-walking-dead-game-in-fortnite-a-new-path-forward-for-game-studios<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Between layoffs, studio closures, and funding drying up, it’s fair to say that the games industry has been having a rough time. Enrique Fuentes, CEO and co-founder of Teravision games, experienced that turbulence much too closely for comfort when he and his team released Killer Klowns From Outer Space, an asymmetrical horror game based on the 80s movie of the same name. The game was well received (IGN gave it a 7, calling it “as silly and entertaining as the movie that spawned it.”) and trailers for the title racked up hundreds of thousands of views online. But the team found itself in a difficult spot after launch, the same difficult spot that many in the games industry found themselves in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As you know, 2024 was a pretty tough year for the whole industry. So it was a little bit slow for us to close our next project,” Fuentes says. Despite working with companies like Disney, Nickelodeon, and Xbox, Teravision was having difficulty finding a follow-up project to Killer Klowns. With time running out, the studio and its veteran developers with 20 years of experience in the industry looked towards something novel: making a game within Fortnite. In less than a year, Teravision has released three Unreal Engine for Fortnite (UEFN) games.  Its fourth game, launching today, takes advantage of the official The Walking Dead content pack released in UEFN.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/16/ck-twdu-screenshot-aereal-courtyard-1747427029518.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Made in partnership with Skybound, the company co-founded by The Walking Dead’s creator Robert Kirkman, Teravision’s newest UEFN game is a King of the Hill style multiplayer PvPvE project called Courtyard King, where players fight each other as well as NPC zombies for control of territory in The Walking Dead’s infamous prison location.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything The Walking Dead related in Courtyard King is made using official assets released for UEFN, including character models based on Rick Grimes, Negan, and Daryl Dixon. But the project goes further than just assets; Teravision worked with the writers at Skybound to craft the game’s story and dialogue. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Instead of a multi-year project like Killer Clowns From Outer Space, these are projects that we could put together in weeks or months.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have worked with big brands in the past… and UEFN was something that we were experimenting with… but we never imagined that was going to be the root where we’re going to be engaging with a company like Skybound,” Fuentes says. “But I mean, UGC, it’s one of the biggest things in gaming right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">UGC, or user-generated content, is driving one of the biggest trends in gaming right now thanks to platforms like Fortnite. This kind of playground style game making has found massive audiences in services like Roblox already, but the ‘U’ in UGC typically refers to the end user, AKA players at home. UGC developed by professional studios is a newer concept, and Fortnite’s Unreal Engine 5-based tools were perfect for experienced devs like Teravision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It made sense because we come from an engineering background and it was a platform where we could experiment in and assume some of the risk,” explains Fuentes. “Because instead of a multi-year project like Killer Clowns From Outer Space, these are projects that we could put together in weeks or months.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teravision’s experiments resulted in the launch of Havoc Hotel, a roguelike shooter where you fight through levels in a hotel, with each cleared floor earning you currency to purchase more powerful weapons. The first Havoc Hotel was a modest hit, enough to keep working on the series. Eventually we got to Havoc Hotel 3, which is now consistently one of Fortnite’s most popular games.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/16/ck-twdu-screenshot-coop-bat-1747427029518.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Teravision’s game designer, Martin Rodriguez, says given the studio previously made Killer Klowns in Unreal Engine, the jump to UEFN — a modified version of Unreal Engine 5 — was not only convenient, but gave the experienced devs a leg up when creating their games in UEFN. The systems are streamlined, and processes are a bit more “drag and drop,” as Rodriguez says. “For us, it just removes some of the work that we would’ve done otherwise and allows us to focus on just making better games and explore different new creative ideas."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"They’re weird situations and interactions that don’t necessarily translate into a very clear competition, but they still work.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the engineering side had no trouble adapting to UEFN’s Unreal-based tools, the game design team was presented with a unique challenge. Games like Havoc Hotel began as experiments as opposed to fully-fledged games, but quickly grew to become their own thing. And Teravision’s creative director, LD Zambrano, quickly learned that UEFN games were different from traditional games in many ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A traditional experience we have had designing other [non-UEFN] games is where players relate through objectives that entice cooperation and competition, right?” Zambrano says. “In [UEFN’s] case, we have found that even though those objectives are still relevant and we still can use that game design sensibility and bring them there, I found that there are a lot of experiences that are very popular within the Fortnite ecosystem that are kind of just context. They’re weird situations and interactions that don’t necessarily translate into a very clear competition, but they still work.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zambrano compares UEFN games to  the school yard. “I have found that there is this way of approaching each other that brings me back to recess, which is you meet somebody and make up some sort of game that might not make sense, but still you’re engaging and creating friendships. That’s what I mean about some of these games becoming a ‘context.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that way, one unique thing I learned about Courtyard King from Teravision is that it is an infinite game, meaning there is no final winner at the end of a round. Instead, matches continue forever with players jumping in and out, switching teams. And while there will always be a team that is winning, there will never be a final round where a true winner is crowned. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/16/ck-twdu-screenshot-red-hallway-1747427029518.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“Players can drop in and drop out whenever they want. They can even change teams whenever they like, which generates situations for betrayals. Maybe you enter a party with your friend, but then in the middle of the match you don’t tell him and change teams. Which is very Walking Dead-like.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"This is now a viable model where you can actually support an 80 person studio like we do, and we can assume the risk” </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this a future for game developers? On the one hand, it puts them in the sandbox of other, bigger players like Epic Games or Roblox. But for studios looking to experiment without burning through their entire funds, while having access to a large player base and big IP assets like The Walking Dead, Enrique Fuentes says there’s a lot of upside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can actually assume the risk as an indie developer in [UEFN]. Because last year, we couldn’t even think about starting a three-year project. We could do something in a few weeks with a smaller team and that completely changes the paradigm for a new developer. This is now a viable model where you can actually support an 80 person studio like we do, and we can assume the risk,” Fuentes says. “It’s something that if you have the right ideas, the right creativity around it, if you understand the market well enough and you have the right thinking, execution becomes possible and it doesn’t take years, it actually takes weeks, maybe months. I think this is a dream come true for indie developers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While most franchise fans are primarily interested in the gameplay of Battlefield 6 for the various multiplayer modes, the game is also going to feature a full-fledged campaign, unlike Battlefield 2042. Earlier this week, Inverse <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/next-battlefield-game-campaign-alex-garland-civil-war-inspired" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managed to interview</a> some of the lead developers from Motive Studios, the team in charge of the single player story mode, who shared some of the inspirations and themes players will see in the game.</p>
<p>Creative Director Roman Campos-Oriola said:</p>
<p><em>I’m a big fan of Lioness.</em></p>
<p>Executive Producer Philippe Ducharme:</p>
<p><em>I really enjoyed Civil War. Some of the things that we’re pushing [in the Battlefield 6 campaign], the film is actually a good reference.</em></p>
<p>They're referring to Lioness, the American spy action thriller TV show released on Paramount+ with Zoe Saldaña as the main character, and Civil War, Alex Garland's dystopic action thriller movie where a despotic federal government and secessionist movements fight a bloody war within the United States. Both are great examples of action thriller plots, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Campos-Oriola then had this to say about the themes that will be explored in the Battlefield 6 story:</p>
<p><em>The elements we’re really interested in is the concept of talented but ordinary people put in extraordinary situations. That creates a very interesting dynamic in terms of relationships with other people. These are elements we’re looking to capture in the single player.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, the two discussed how their previous work on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Space remake</a> helped them prepare for the Battlefield 6 campaign project.</p>
<p><em><strong>Campos-Oriola:</strong> Dead Space allowed us to know the quirks and strengths that we all have, and how we complement each other as a team.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Ducharme:</strong> On Dead Space, we talked a lot about the curve of tension. How to go from beat to beat, having the highs and the lows to keep players hooked, and even play with their expectations a little bit. It’s obviously very different in a game like Battlefield. But we still brought that mentality over.</em></p>
<p>Of course, that was a remake, but this time, Motive (which is also helping DICE produce multiplayer maps) had to do everything from scratch.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;this Summer for a launch window scheduled before April 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, the United States adjusted US trade tariffs with China. After a long stretch of uncertainty and financial harm to various industries, Chinese import tariffs have gone from 145% to 30%. While substantially less extreme, the tariffs still pose a major problem for the tabletop industry.</p>

<h2>The Adjusted Trade Tariffs and Their Effects</h2>

<p>After a recent series of negotiations between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/us-and-china-agree-to-slash-tariffs-for-90-days.html" rel="nofollow">90-day pause</a> has been placed on the trade war; a trade war instigated by President Trump. As a result, adjusted trade tariffs have been cut back from 125% to 10%. Including the 20% on products related to fentanyl, this means total tariffs on Chinese goods currently stand at 30%.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cosmere-rpg-book-artwork.jpg?itok=xukMoDE- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cosmere-rpg-book-artwork.jpg?itok=_Ftamu0K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As we have covered before, the initial trade war with China has been disastrous for the board game industry. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a> had to close up shop. Board game publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CMON</a> had to suspend active board game development. The implementation of the tariffs were so disruptive Stonemaier Games is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stonemaier-games-suing-us-president-over-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">currently suing</a> the US government over them.</p>

<p>So with the 90-day pause and the 30%, the board game industry can adjust, right? Not exactly. In a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/05/13/board-game-publishers-brace-for-shipping-price-hike-delays-as-us-drops-tariffs-on-china-to-30-in-90-day-truce/" rel="nofollow">BoardGameWire</a>, several tabletop publishers voiced their concerns.</p>

<p>Renegade Game Studios' CEO Scott Gaeta remarked that a 30% tariff on goods was problematic but manageable, whereas Hatchette Boardgames USA commented on the logistics of container space, shipping rates, and import scheduling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’re anticipating this will be like after COVID lockdowns ended and we kept getting our containers bumped off ships by companies that were willing to pay more. We actually had a container that we shipped from China pulled off in South Korea in 2022, for three months, because another company outbid us, apparently, even after we had the freight booked and onboard.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arguably the biggest case of sour grapes by the adjusted trade tariffs is Brotherwise Games. Courtesy of <a href="https://www.rascal.news/latest-90-day-tariff-reduction-is-a-stay-of-execution-for-some-tabletop-rpg-publishers/" rel="nofollow">Rascal News</a>, Brotherwise Games stated that the 30% trade tariffs have hampered the success of the highly anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cosmere RPG</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of the Kickstarter, the studio has produced a large amount of books, cards, miniatures, dice, and GM screens to match the various pledges. Now all of that product needs to be shipped from China overseas. That means all of that import will be subject to these 30% tariffs, assuming the product wasn't just the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">physical RPG books</a> by themselves.</p>

<p>Regardless of any future negotiations in the US China trade war, its instigation has had a disastrous effect on the board game industry. An effect that will only become prominent over time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-speed-freeks-launches-out-of-early-access-next-week-major-changes-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warhammer 40K: Speed Freeks is officially exiting early access and will have its 1.0 launch next week on <strong>May 22, 2025,</strong> developer Caged Element and publisher Wired Productions have announced.</p>
<p>It's launching as a structurally very different game than what it was. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-available-in-warhammer-40000-speed-freeks-and-more/">first knew</a> Warhammer 40K: Speed Freeks as a free-to-play combat racing game where you play as Orks in the Warhammer universe who want nothing more than to smash each other to bits, going at crazy speeds and racing cars with guns on them.</p>
<p>Now, it's still a combat racing game with the Orks and the aforementioned craziness, but it's no longer free-to-play. It'll also be published by Wired Productions, and not Plaion, as was previously the case.</p>
<p>If you jumped into the free-to-play early access version, you won't need to buy the game now that it'll be a premium release. A press release for Speed Freeks' launch has confirmed that players who were among the 250K people already playing Speed Freeks will be upgraded to the premium version for free.</p>
<p>All the microtransactions that were in the free-to-play version of the game will also be removed, and if you did purchase or earn any of the premium currency that existed in the free-to-play version, then you'll still be able to spend that for the next 12 months. For everyone else who didn't jump into the early access version, it'll launch at $15.99 USD.</p>

<p>The move to a premium game also means that the 1.0 version of the game will support player-hosted matches, private games, and have a free roam mode for players to explore the maps and create their own custom races.</p>
<p>"<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"><em>We set out to make the Orkiest of Warhammer 40,000 games, and through our early access period we've had thousands of people help us achieve that goal,</em>" game director on Warhamemr 40K: Speed Freeks, Chris Mallinson said in a press release.</span></p>
<p><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"<em>Along with our previous publisher PLAION. Now with Wired Productions picking up the torch, we're launching out of early access and into version 1.0 with a different approach that we think players will really appreciate and enjoy. We thank both partners for their dedication to the game, along with Games Workshop</em>" </span></p>

Unlike normal NPC allies, however, this one can respond to voice chat with AI-generated responses in a digital clone of deceased actor James Earl Jones’ voice. Despite Epic Games quickly patching out expletives from Vader’s vocabulary, players have found other ways to slowly degrade the AI chatbot’s defenses and get it to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/LordBalvin/status/1923456414976008589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/LordBalvin/status/1923456414976008589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">say actual slurs</a></span>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Wensoing/status/1923310140872139152&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Wensoing/status/1923310140872139152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fortnite</em> leaker Wenso</a></span> has been datamining some of the code used to control AI Darth Vader, which is otherwise powered by Google’s Gemini model. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Wensoing/status/1923308018160001423&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Wensoing/status/1923308018160001423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to his findings</a></span>, Darth Vader isn’t allowed to engage in romantic banter, talk about gambling, or comment on V-Bucks. Epic also said it has guardrails in place to prevent AI Darth Vader from encouraging real-world violence, including self-harm. But that hasn’t stopped players from getting it to say all sorts of other wild things. </p><p>Disney may have thrown brand safety caution to the wind with AI Darth Vader, but it’s extra disconcerting hearing meme slop regurgitated by a renowned performer simply because he sold the rights to his voice to Lucasfilm. Here’s just some of the new canonical <em>Star Wars</em> quotes that decision has led to:</p><h2 id="h216652"><a id=""></a>“Your performance thus far suggests you are adopted.”</h2><h2 id="h216653"><a id=""></a>“The force is strong with you or is this the work of a resurrected King Von.” </h2><h2 id="h216654"><a id=""></a>“You desire a mere echo Poe Dameron?
