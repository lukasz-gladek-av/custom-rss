<p>Is Crash finally back?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="56093ff1da2ad"><a title="Crash Team Racing" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56093ff1da2ad/crash-team-racing.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure><p>Crash Bandicoot hasn't been sighted for a while now, but Crash fans think they might have spotted something that could be tied to a new game project or at least a return in some way or form.</p>
<p>This development comes from the <a href="https://x.com/BeenoxTeam">official Beenox social media account</a>. Beenox, in case you need a refresher, is the same team that worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_team_racing_nitro-fueled">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a> and has also helped out with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_4_its_about_time">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crashbandicoot/comments/1op4zhp/beenox_changed_his_banner_and_crash_appears_twice/">uploaded a banner featuring Crash in a kart</a> and then removed it shortly after. What's interesting about this is it appears to be based on Crash's character model from the fourth outing - a title that was released well after the most recent racing game.</p>

<p>So, that's it for now, but if there are any other significant updates or developments here, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this happens to follow a rumour in October about Crash Bandicoot <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/rumour-sonic-prime-studio-reportedly-working-on-crash-bandicoot-animation-for-netflix">potentially getting his own animation on Netflix</a>. If you missed it, it's claimed WildBrain Studios - the same team behind Sonic Prime (and also helping out with the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> animated series on Netflix) is behind it. 2026 will also mark Crash's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>For now, the current stories circulating about Crash Bandicoot are just rumours - so nothing has been officially confirmed or announced, and there's no guarantee this discovery will necessarily lead to a new project, reveal or update.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-slashes-this-1500w-power-station-to-peanuts-7-outlets-save-you-during-winter-blackouts-2000642286</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-slashes-this-1500w-power-station-to-peanuts-7-outlets-save-you-during-winter-blackouts.1347964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter storms have a way of knocking out power at the worst possible times but the <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000 (1500W) portable power station</strong> offers a solid solution to keep your essentials running when the grid goes dark. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5401/">Amazon has slashed the price from $899 to $449</a>, which makes this one of the best times to grab reliable backup power without emptying your wallet. You’ll also get a <strong>free 3-port 103W fast charger as a bonus</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5401/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Delivers Power When You Need It Most</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 houses a 1<strong>,070Wh LiFePO4 battery within its compact frame, weighing only 23.8 pounds</strong>. This capacity translates to real-world performance that matters during an outage: running a full-size refrigerator for roughly 10 hours to preserve your groceries, powering a space heater for about 1.5 hours to stay warm, or keeping your internet router and laptop running for an entire day to work from home. Most household appliances are handled easily with its<strong> continuous output of 1,500W, while the 3,000W surge capacity</strong> is there when devices like refrigerators need that initial power boost to start.</p>
<p>The LFP battery chemistry separates this model from the more affordable options: Typical lithium-ion batteries do not last long, but this LiFePO4 arrangement retains <strong>upwards of 70 percent of its original capacity after 4,000 charge cycles</strong>. That kind of longevity equates to well over a decade of service, making that $449 price tag seem much more reasonable if you calculate it on a cost-per-year-of-ownership basis. This battery technology is also less susceptible to temperature extremes than a standard lithium-ion cell.</p>



<p>Getting from empty to full in just one hour through the emergency charging mode via the Jackery app changes how you can use this power station. If you hear about an incoming storm, you can top it off quickly instead of waiting overnight. The default 1.7-hour charging mode balances speed with battery health for everyday use, which helps explain that 10-year lifespan claim. <strong>ChargeShield 2.0 technology automatically regulates voltage and temperature</strong>, and safeguards both the power station and whatever devices you plug into it.</p>



<p>Port selection matters when you try to keep multiple devices alive during an outage: The <strong>Explorer 1000 has three AC outlets for standard plugs, two USB-C that provide up to 100W for fast charging laptops and tablets, one USB-A for older devices, and a DC car port for 12V equipment</strong>. This means not having to choose between charging your phone and powering your CPAP machine.</p>
<p>The <strong>foldable handle and relatively light weight</strong> make this truly portable despite its capacity. You can take it down to your basement during bad weather, toss it in the back of your truck for that weekend camping trip, or bring it to an outdoor concert where your band requires power for amps and mixers. Lighting from built-in LED lights helps navigate through darkened homes during nighttime power outages, with no fumbling for flashlights in the dark.</p>
<p>At $449, you’re getting backup power that costs less than a typical emergency generator while offering more flexibility and cleaner energy. Gas generators require fuel storage, regular maintenance, and produce fumes that make indoor use impossible. The deal is a massive 50% discount from the regular $899 price (and you get a free fast charger as well) which makes this an all-time low worth grabbing before winter weather arrives in full force.</p>

            <p>
MiHoYo appear to be eternally busy. After printing copious amounts of money with games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a>, they are continuing to do so with future releases like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genshin-impact-devs-next-game-looks-so-much-like-animal-crossing-im-almost-not-sure-why-it-exists">Petit Planet</a> (or Not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>) and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-new-honkai-game-on-the-way-with-characters-from-star-rail-and-impact-3rd-and-it-sure-does-look-like-a-pokemon-clone">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a> (Not Pokemon). Now, it turns out, they're also working on an MMO, seemingly codenamed Genesis, that seemingly in some capacity incorporates AI, it's just unclear what kind.
</p>
<p>
As spotted over on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mihoyo-is-working-on-new-open-world-game-mmo-pvp-ue5-ai.1346665/">ResetEra</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hoyoverse-releases-first-tease-for-new-unreal-engine-5-fantasy-mmo-and-yes-it-uses-ai">Eurogamer</a>), miHoYo shared a very short kind of teaser video acting as a sort of recruitment post for said MMO that's described as a "fantasy realism open world game." Details are quite slim, unsurprisingly, but here are the ones of note. It'll be made in Unreal Engine 5, it'll have PvP, "Intellectual NPC," and the two potentially controversial bits, an "Artificial Intelligence Stimulated Eco System," and "All-Terrain Battle AI."

<p>
A few points worth mentioning here. Something could have been lost in translation here, so it might not be talking about the bad kind of AI you and I hate. AI as a term has obviously been used to describe NPC behaviours for a long time too, so it could just be that. But miHoYo are no strangers to AI usage, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-studio-uses-ai-technology-to-smoothen-development-process">they've even done so in Zenless Zone Zero</a>, and I'm not sure what an AI stimulated eco system could mean other than the bad kind. So, take all of this cautiously and skeptically until there's more details.
</p><p>
Judging from the very short teaser that exists, whatever Genesis ends up being like, it'll probably be a lot less anime (as vague a descriptor as that is) than games like Genshin Impact. A potential divergence for the company that relies on people getting much too invested in jiggly, overly cute women. Well, and the occasional man these days too. Diversity win!

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-falconeer">The Falconeer</a> turns five years old next week, and ahead of that its developer Tom Sala has put in the work for a pretty big update. Update undersells it a touch I think, because it's being billed as a full-on remaster, complete with a touched up look, and plenty of mechanical changes. So, let's detail those details!
</p>
<p>
For one, landing sounds like it should be a lot easier, as you can land just by flying close to a perch without having to press a button. Speaking of buttons, the dash and acrobatics have been changed to have separate buttons and controls. Collision accuracy has been improved now too, with tighter movement to boot.

<p>
It's not just mechanics that have been updated, your warbird itself is looking fresher with individual feathers and more detail. Its head stays leveled when turning "(as birds of prey do)," and there are now wing flexing and steering animations. Landing and diving animations have been improved too, and player bird collision avoidance should be less annoying. I'm always striving to be less annoying! There's a long list of quality of life improvements, control tweaks, visual changes, bug fixes, and even just outright new stuff that you can check out in this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1135260/view/591787131954790437?l=english">Steam post</a>.
</p><p>
Talking in more depth in an earlier <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1135260/view/506217467911078264?l=english">Steam post</a> about the remaster - which is out now and completely free for those that own the game, and is included if you haven't bought it yet - Sala was quite open about the base game's launch. "Every release is horror, but this one was pretty bad by every account," Sala wrote. 
</p>
<p>
"And let's be honest the PC launch suffered in many ways, some my own mistakes biting me, some consequences of releasing an indie console launch title in a week where both Xbox and Playstation were launching their next gen." Sala went on to explain how this is his chance at "doing it better," and better reflecting a game that's deeply personal to him, spending his free time working on this remaster whenever he could. As always, making games is hard! Nice work.
</p>
<p>
If you don't own The Falconeer, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135260/The_Falconeer_Revolution_Remaster/">try out it and its new remaster on Steam right now</a> completely for free until November 10th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 may be coming to Xbox Game Pass. While not confirmed, a fan found an official advertisement showing the game off.</p>



<p>There’s a lot to be excited about if you’re a Call of Duty fan right now. The biggest, of course, is the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-release-date-remains-unchanged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>, the next big game in the franchise. With constant updates to Black Ops 6 and Warzone, it’s a good time to be a fan. Fortunately, many titles in the series are available on Game Pass, both Xbox and PC. Well, a new Xbox advertisement may have spoiled one of the next entries to come to the service.</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-game-pass-possibly-getting-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-soon">Xbox Game Pass Possibly Getting Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Soon</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The rumor comes from Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1ory64g/mw2_coming_to_game_pass/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TypicalNarr</a>, who discovered a simple Xbox Game Pass Premium ad on their console. In it, it shows many of the games on the service like Sea of Thieves and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-adds-over-90-new-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. However, one game caught the user’s eye that isn’t on there: the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 from 2009.&nbsp;As of writing, the game has never been on Game Pass, so the usage of the game’s cover art is a bit suspicious.</p>



<p>While it does appear official, take it with a grain of salt. One user on Reddit mentioned that 2022’s Modern Warfare 2, part of the reboot trilogy, is on the service, so perhaps it was a mix-up. Still, fans have been hoping for classic Call of Duty titles to come to Game Pass. It’s long been rumored that titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-world-at-war-and-infinite-warfare-appear-with-included-with-game-pass-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World at War</a> would drop on the subscription service with Activision’s purchase by Xbox. Hopefully, if true, more games like Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3 can come out for newer fans to try out.</p>



<p>What do you think of Modern Warfare 2 going to Game Pass? Which older Call of Duty games do you want to see on the service? World at War? Black Ops? More Modern Warfare?

Slightly serious one here folks! The studio behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a>, one of this year's best received games, is asking for some help for one of their lead playtesters, Matthew "Iggy" Kowalski. As shared on Bluesky, Iggy has polycystic kidney disease, leaving him with only a few months to find a living kidney donor.
</p>
<p>
Developer Dogubomb wrote on Bluesky that "Iggy was an invaluable tester and contributed so much to the project. He was absolutely brilliant in the game and came up with so many original strategies we had never considered. Please help us spread the word and as we help find him a living kidney donor."
</p>

</span></p><p>
Iggy lays his situation out very plainly on his <a href="https://www.iggyland.org/">personal website</a>: "I have a disease that requires a living kidney donor. There are no other viable options for me. I have only a few months before I will need to have this surgery before getting extremely sick and dying." He explains that his disease causes his kidneys to "have cysts grow all over them and make them massive in size. As they do so, the kidneys grow less and less in function. Think like the chest buster in Alien, except it’s not an alien baby and we don’t anticipate it coming to theatres this fall."
</p><p>
I share this with you because quite frankly, if you have a kidney you don't need, it would be nice if you could help out a dev in need! Iggy even clarifies that you don't need to be a perfect match, as some collaboration can be done with other donors to find the best-fit. There's more details on Iggy's website, so tell a friend even if you can't do it yourself!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-mass-effect-game-to-feature-krogan-civil-war.1347880/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday was N7 Day, the yearly franchise appreciation day that Mass Effect developer BioWare has held every November 7 since 2012. In the game, N7 is a vocational code in the Systems Alliance military, where the N designates special forces and the 7 refers to the highest level of proficiency, thus referring to the main character, Shepard, and his strike team.</p>



<p>N7 Day 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-mass-effect-continues-to-be-in-development-amidst-new-features-to-build-and-romances-to-figure-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delivered confirmation that the studio, despite the layoffs, is still working on the next Mass Effect game</a>. In the blog post, long-time Executive Producer Mike Gamble inserted a secret message that the fans eventually decoded, revealing a new artwork from the upcoming game. The art depicts Krogan characters and features the subtitle 'Civil War'. This hints at one of the themes we may discover in the game: a major division within the Krogan race between at least two factions. </p>



<p>Those who have played previous Mass Effect games are certainly familiar with the Krogan, a species of large, reptilian bipeds native to the planet Tuchanka. They famously survived despite the harsh environment of their home world, only to destroy it themselves in a nuclear war. The survivors split into tribes that were constantly at war with one another. Indeed, they are considered a warrior race, but some of them do not necessarily wish to perpetuate the seemingly endless cycle of fighting that has characterized the Krogans. This may be the primary source of the disagreement, though it's only speculation at this point, of course.</p>



<p>The next Mass Effect is at least three to four years away, and fans may have to make do with just art teasers in the near future. There is, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Amazon TV series in development</a>, and BioWare confirmed that it will be an original story (written by Daniel Casey and directed by Doug Jung) set after the original Mass Effect trilogy. We'll keep you updated once there are casting news on the show.</p>

While there is a notable enough sentiment that old games are worse because they are old, so should therefore be either let to rot or to be remade so that they are "better," I think this argument goes out the window when you look at something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xi">Final Fantasy 11</a>. That thing came out in 2022! And it launched on PS2 first! Yet here it is more than two decades later, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-23-years-on-final-fantasy-11-is-still-getting-updates-with-one-coming-thatll-let-you-change-how-your-character-looks">still getting updates</a>, and now, potentially, an entire new zone.
</p>
<p>
This week saw a new Freshly Picked Vana'diel, a semi-regularly held livestream from the Final Fantasy 11 team similar in nature to Final Fantasy 14's Letter from the Producer streams that details upcoming additions or changes, that sort of thing. It was held in Japanese, which I don't speak, but luckily some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxi/comments/1oqvpee/freshly_picked_future_plans/">Redditors</a> who do explained that the team is seemingly preparing for the ability to make new areas.

<p>
As mentioned, this was originally a PS2 game, the PC release came a short while after, and that fact also appears to be a problem for the FF11 team. Everything is still made using the original PS2 dev kits, which obviously will be massively outdated by this point. Judging from some of the comments, on-stream the team discussed that they're working on plans in the event that these dev kits don't work anymore so that they can make new equipment still, and in particular start making new areas again.
</p><p>
I may not have spent any time with Final Fantasy 11 myself, but it really can't be understated how valuable it is that this 23 year old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> is still going, let alone the fact it's still getting new content. These spaces become second homes (or even a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/second-life">Second Life</a>) for some people, and sure, we should strive to not be too beholden to our computers, but they are still realms of virtual existence that deserve to be maintained. A new area would be pretty significant as there hasn't been a big new one since its 2015 expansion Seekers of Adoulin. Fingers crossed for those of you still playing!

            <p>Just days after a new rating on the American Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) hinted that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/esrb-rating-confirms-silent-hill-2-remake-is-finally-on-the-way-to-xbox-consoles">Silent Hill 2 Remake was finally on its way to Xbox</a>, a page that briefly popped up on the Microsoft Store has all but confirmed it.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/silent-hill-2-xbox">True Achievements</a>, the page - which has since been removed - didn't list a release date, but after rummaging around in the backend, the site believes the remake will launch on 21st November.</p>

<p>Much like the PC and PS5 versions, players upgrading to the deluxe edition can secure a digital artbook, digital soundtrack, and the Pyramid Head pizza box skin, along with a mysterious "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> bundle".</p>
<p>The game is described as optimised for Xbox Series X/S, but the page does not suggest it'll be playable as a Play Anywhere title.</p>

<p>As for the additional DLC chapter, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-actor-confirms-weve-not-recorded-anything-for-born-from-a-wish-dlc">Born From a Wish</a>, which was briefly an Xbox-exclusive when it released for the original game?

The voice actor behind Remake's Maria <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-actor-confirms-weve-not-recorded-anything-for-born-from-a-wish-dlc">recently confirmed she hasn't been contacted by Bloober to record extra content, either</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">I had a thrilling time with Silent Hill 2 Remake, awarding it 5/5, writing</a>: "Against the odds, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> has delivered a remake that both expands <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves." It's sold about 2.5 million copies, taking sales for the 20+ year old franchise to 10 million.</p>

            <p>
I know, I know, change is difficult isn't it? It upset me just the other day that YouTube has changed videos so that they have rounded corners instead of being perfectly rectangular. It's sacrilegious! A feeling I will continue to have until I ultimately forget about it because life moves on to the next grievance. Still, subtle changes like that can often set some kind of internal alarm bells off, something you might have been experiencing with store pages on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam">Steam</a> looking a bit… wider.
</p>
<p>
That is because they are, in fact, wider! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/valve">Valve</a> have said as such somewhere along the line, and the update arrived in the digital storefront yesterday, with a nifty little <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/506217467911081528">blog post</a> explaining and showing what the changes actually are. Essentially, store pages for games and the few bits that aren't games have been widened from 940 pixels to 1200 pixels. Doesn't sound like much, but seeing it side by side, there's a surprising amount of space that's been added.
</p>
<p>
That's not the only difference, though. Images that show up in the carousel now have a higher resolution, and there's a couple new viewing modes to go along with that too; theater mode plasters images and videos across most of the screen, and full-screen mode is exactly what it sounds like. Devs will also have more control over the about sections of their games, again with bigger and higher-quality images, and more flexible formatting. You might also notice that store pages' background images pop a bit more too, as more colour and texture will come through.
</p>
<p>
This widening of Steam applies to other aspects of the store too, like search results and recommendation pages, with some general size adjustments for individual tags, charts, and the news hub. Apparently the homepage will be subject to a widening in the "near future too." Also, you shouldn't need to worry about pages being too wide if you're using a narrow browser or client, because Valve even tested it on some old iPod a team member "had laying around." Classic Valve.

            <p>Fans believe they've uncovered a possible timeframe for when we may finally learn about Half-Life 3.</p>
<p>We already had strong evidence - if, admittedly, no specific confirmation - that Valve is working on a major new Half-Life project of some kind. After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">a trustworthy report last summer detailed datamined assets</a>, backing up a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">leak from an actor</a> likely involved, we were then told the new Half-Life project, codenamed HLX, was not just in development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-is-not-just-in-development-its-now-playable-end-to-end-leaker-suggests">but was now "playable, end-to-end"</a>.</p>

<p>And now, Redditor sameseksure believes they've worked out when an announcement may be coming simply by analysing the Steam store's top banner.</p>
<p>"Valve uses the top banner on the front page of the Steam Store whenever they want to promote a Steam Sale, Steam Event, or new products like games or hardware," the user reasoned. "Whatever's on the front page of Steam gets a HUGE amount of exposure. They put <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> on the front page banner <a href="https://youtu.be/yLr2z1dTlec?si=oME1NNk_aBrT35Em&amp;t=30">immediately after the announcement back in 2019</a>, as well as the Valve Index when it was announced. When there's a Steam Sale or Event, it takes up the top banner <strong>for the whole duration of those events</strong> (Summer Sale, Next Fest, etc.).</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1oqn6x4/18_november/">18 November</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sameseksure/">u/sameseksure</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/">HalfLife</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>"<strong>Therefore, they will not announce anything at the same time as major Steam Events are happening</strong>, as they would be cannibalising their own sales," they added (emphasis theirs). "They'd rather reschedule stuff to ensure they're not cannibalising themselves."</p>
<p>They then <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fsys18qwgj5zf1.png">linked to a list of scheduled Steam events</a> for the rest of the year, pointing out an unusually large gap between 18th November and 8th December.</p>
<p>"This could mean that Valve plans to announce Half-Life 3 (or Deckard, or both) on 18 November, and made sure no other Steam Events were happening at that time," they added.</p>
<p>A stretch? Maybe. But it's one of the most plausible explanations yet, not least because Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/507340830949770004">moved its Autumn Sale ahead by two months to September, even though it usually happens in November</a>, and in the Autumn Sale announcement, Steam teased: "'Is Steam crazy? They’re two months ahead of schedule!' Yes, we are crazy, and yes we are earlier than usual, <strong>but also that’s intentional'</strong>" (again, poster's own emphasis).</p>
<p>"So if it's happening in November, it'll be 18/19/20 November," the Redditor concluded (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/half-life-3-trailer-november-18-theory/">TheGamer</a>). "Or never."</p>
<p>All this also reinforces Valve insider Tyler McVicker's claim that the eagerly anticipated sequel could release before the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The rationale has convinced even the most sceptical of Half-Life fans, generating thousands of upvotes from fans impressed by the caculation, and desperating hoping they're right. Time will tell.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-cancelled-a-lot-of-games-over-the-last-10-years-including-half-life-3-and-left-4-dead-3">What we <em>do</em> know for sure is Half-Life 3 was in development 2013/2014</a>, and was set to be a procedurally-generated, replayable game that fused <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>-inspired gameplay with scripted story moments. It was cancelled because it was built on the unfinished Source 2 engine.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/optic-comes-under-fire-for-roobet-gambling-streams.1347820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent weeks, OpTic’s most prolific creators, alongside the likes of Nadeshot, have come under intense scrutiny after jumping on board with Roobet, a crypto-based online casino. In streams featuring Scump and H3CZ, followers have been subjected to the OpTic team playing slots and games on Roobet, also taking their gambling activities to Kick.com.</p>



<p>It was just days ago that H3CZ and Scump revealed they’d secured a bag in an all-new Roobert partnership that predicated them setting up and hosting gambling livestream events, but fans are <strong>not happy</strong> and are venting on social media.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-scump-gambling-on-stream">Why is Scump Gambling on Stream?</h2>



<p>It wouldn’t be <strong>as bad</strong> for some, but many viewers have commented on how Scump, in particular, doesn’t appear to be genuine during his gambling streams and is not playing his part properly. He and H3CZ have started streaming certain slots on Roobet, hosting broadcasts that many assume are worth tens of thousands of dollars.</p>



<p>Roobet has previously partnered with other celebrities, so this isn’t new, but many are on the side of this being irresponsible by Scump, whose audience is mostly impressionable youngsters.</p>



<p>Nadeshot has also spent a few weeks dabbling in the gambling game, flying out to Mexico to circumvent laws in the United States that prohibit some gambling activity and broadcasting from there instead. He faced backlash after jetting out to Mexico to host gambling streams while 100 Thieves, the organization he founded, held layoffs.</p>



<p>It has been argued that OpTic’s endorsement of a gambling platform like Roobet sends a troubling message to reviews, especially considering the brand’s legacy and influence in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-amazon-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> esports space. It’s a well-known fact that <strong>betting </strong>makes up a huge portion of esports revenue, but slots are a different thing entirely.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Birdman was quick to address a spot of irony, suggesting that Pred was once removed from OpTic’s roster for having a prolific gambling problem:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">why did optic kick pred off the team just for them to get sponsored by roobet they tarnished that guys pr for nothing 😭😭😭</p>— Anthony (@omgitsbirdman) <a href="https://twitter.com/omgitsbirdman/status/1986972390522286156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a clip uploaded to Reddit, Scump and H3CZ were seen standing before a virtual slot machine and ‘feigning excitement’, running around the room, and screaming as the slot machine hit multipliers and bonuses.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The comments under the video were representative of the community sentiment around this situation. One wrote, ‘I don’t know how anyone can look at these two the same again. This is beyond cringe.’ Another said, ‘Been a fan for over a decade. I’m truly disappointed.’</p>



<p>Bag or no bag, this is an alienation step that doesn’t look good and will not be forgotten quickly by fans.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s an issue with Scump and H3CZ hosting gambling streams? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="9c0289c7c8b27"><a title="GUN Anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9c0289c7c8b27/gun-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ever feel like getting your video game cowboy on, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/red_dead_redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> and its kinda bloated sequel, as good as they are, just take way too long to bed into?</p>
<p>You know what I mean. Rockstar's epics are the obvious go-to choices in this scenario. However, sometimes I just want to shoot stuff in the cowboy style, almost immediately if possible, and I don't want to waste time with hugely intricate plots and overwhelming world aspects that drag a playthrough out to a triple-digit hour count. Who has time for that in this economy? (Me, but that's probably best kept for another article on a different website.)</p>
<p>There are a few options for a faster six-shooter fix. Indeed, Rockstar's <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox/red_dead_revolver">Red Dead Revolver</a> is much more in line with what I'm thinking. But you've more than likely played that, either at launch or once you'd made your way through Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/gun">GUN</a> <em>*kicks swinging saloon doors open*</em>, Neversoft's 2005 Western action effort, which is 20 years old today! Here's an oft-overlooked gem of a game that still has the capacity to serve you up exactly what you're after. Heck, it even still looks real purdy.</p>
<p>Now, we didn't review GUN back in the day, which is a shame <em>[<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/site-news-nintendo-life-turns-20-today">The website <strong>was</strong> only a day old!</a> - Ed.]</em>, but it reviewed well across the board, and I have nothing but good things to say about it. With the passing of time, you could actually consider one of the biggest criticisms at release — a very empty and smallish open world — as one of its stronger points nowadays. Especially if, like me, you never want to see another sprawling, icon-laden world map in your life. Well, not for a few weeks anyway.</p>

<p>Let's start with my favourite bit of this one: the cast.</p>
<p>We've got Thomas Jane, Lance Henriksen, Ron Perlman, Brad Dourif, and none other than Kris "sort of a god" Kristofferson showing up in this Western tale, and they've not <em>just</em> shown up, either. They're not phoning it in and hightailing it out of there with their bag of swag. No. There's some solid acting going on, and as a result, the whole thing is given a completely unnecessary level of gravitas. The story here, written by Randall Jahnsen (of <strong>The Doors</strong> movie fame), is no match for Red Dead's hugely serious tale, make no mistake, but it isn't aiming for that. It's going for old-school tension, shocks, and twists that are more immediate in nature.</p>
<p>Jahnsen opted for a tale of revenge that plays it cold and ruthless in the classic <strong>Unforgiven</strong> vein. It revolves around Colton White (Jane) and his dad (Kristofferson) as they head off in search of Colton's dear Jenny (<strong>Rugrats</strong> alumni, Kath Souchie) who's been kidnapped by the murderous Reverend Reed (Dourif). Across the campaign, we're treated to violent shootouts, horseback action sequences and sweet on-rails sections that still play great today. I'm not just saying that either, I'm playing it right now, and it looks and feels very nice, thanks.</p>
<p>In fact, it plays much better than I remember, and the GameCube version is no slouch, running at a super smooth clip and looking every bit as nice as other ports. As I mentioned, the open world here is slight in its size and activities, a criticism in 2005, but now it means it's a much more straightforward and time-respectful sort of thing. There's no need to spend 100 hours picking flowers here, and you get to shoot stuff in the first couple of minutes. A win for common sense!</p>

<p>The shooting, which incorporates a de rigueur slo-mo six-shooter mechanic (here called QuickDraw), also comes off much better these days, I reckon. It was criticised — outside of those focused slo-mo parts — for being a little too tough to aim. However, I'm of the opinion that it's more authentic than tightly auto-aimed nonsense. You need to concentrate a bit and place your shots, and that works for me.</p>
<p>There's also a cracking lineup of era-authentic guns to collect from dead bosses and such along the way. Winchesters, Colts, Schofield rifles that blow heads into bloody pulp when aimed just so. You even get to do a little bit of archery, firing great big cannons. Have I mentioned that it's very bloody? Good.</p>
<p>So, the third-person pew-pew action, and the flow of the world, come off pretty great to this day, and it's a world that, despite its small scale, provides plenty of suitably epic vistas, alongside some impressive urban areas, whilst still managing to look fine in 2025. This is one of those 'early-noughties beige' numbers. You know, dusty and rusted in an attempt to seem adult, and as a result, it's got it where it counts in terms of atmosphere. It's very jaggy round the edges, for sure, but there's a level of detail and some proper cinematography going on, so it gets away with it.</p>

<p>Once the story kicks into gear, once Colton is on his way to Empire City to meet the likes of Mayor Hoodoo Brown (Perlman), and once all hell subsequently breaks loose, we're then treated to a lovely mix of shootouts, proper no-messing hard cowboy dialogue, and levels, such as a fantastic stagecoach one, that don't outstay their welcome. You also gotta turn up just to hear some classic gruff cowboy lines delivered with the swagger of this all-star cast, too.</p>
<p>GUN also benefits from a very edgy and 'of its time' attitude in some respects. It's a little subversive here and there (I won't spoil), and it even draws in some story influences from places you might not expect. It gets a bit...supernatural. So it's got a whole off-kilter thing going on, backed up by the weird awesomeness of that cast.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> an attempt to make the world feel bigger through the ability to track down a few wanted criminals, hunting animals, or doing a spot of ranching, but these are the parts where GUN falls down. No, it's in the crazy assembly of amazingly talented actors, in that uniquely rust-tinged noughties atmosphere, and in some incredibly violent and pleasing shootouts that GUN excels.</p>

<p>At 20 years of age, plenty of video game cowboys have long since hung up their holsters. GUN, though, if you're willing to give it a shot, still has it all where it counts. If you're hankerin' for some straightforward cowboy roleplaying, with no need for 100 hours to spare, or a therapist to get you through Arthur Morgan's trauma, you'll have a fairly tough time finding many games that fill the role better than Neversoft's crack at America's Wild West.</p>
<p>Who'd have thought that the Tony Hawks dev team would serve so hard in this particular genre?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-prediction-grand-final-t1-vs-kt-rolster/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/t1-vs-kt-rolster-league-of-legends-worlds-2025-grand-final-preview-prediction.1347808/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Once again, it all comes down to this. The 2025 League of Legends World Championship tournament is about to culminate in a dream final: T1 vs. KT Rolster, two titans of the LCK. It’s a battle between the ultimate underdog and the reigning champions, and it’ll be a fight to determine <strong>a first Worlds win </strong>or <strong>another trophy in the expansive cabinet.</strong></p>



<p>We’re here to look at the match being dubbed a ‘Telecom War’ in Chengdu, the Grand Final of the League of Legends World Championship 2025. Read on to learn about the gravity of this match, what it means for League esports, and most importantly, which team is predicted to win.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-will-win-lol-worlds-2025">Who Will Win LoL Worlds 2025?</h2>



<p>T1 enters the battle on November 9 (depending on where you are) as the defending champion, chasing <strong>a third consecutive </strong>League Worlds championship and a record sixth win overall. Led by the iconic Faker, the team has weathered a pretty turbulent journey through the earlier stages, managing to peak when desperately required.</p>



<p>KT Rolster, meanwhile, is the hungry challenger and has made history just getting to the Grand Final. It’s the first time the organization has made it this far in League of Legends, and along the way, it required the squad to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kt-rolster-shatter-worlds-2025-finals-first-time/">take down one of the frontrunners</a> in Gen.G.</p>



<p>Will KT Rolster make history?</p>



<p>Faker (T1) vs Bdd (KT) presents an opportunity for a generational clash to take place. It’s experience versus aggression, and it’s a coin flip to decide which way it’ll go.</p>



<p>There’s a huge prize pool on the line, and the winning team will grab a $1 million portion of the pot. This series is more about legacy than it is about the financials, though.</p>



<p>While T1 certainly holds the edge in experience and championship pedigree, it’s KT that has the momentum and hunger that could carry a roster all the way. They’re dangerous, and that might put T1 on the defensive going into the match best-of-five.</p>



<p>I’m ultimately predicting that this will be a relatively close series, with T1 closing it out 3-2 and walking away with yet another LoL Worlds trophy, pushing Faker even deeper into the history books.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> which team you think will win LoL Worlds.</p>

<p>If you have bot backfill disabled, you'll need a lobby of 20 real-life players to kick off, and eight if it's enabled. Killing bots results in reduced XP, "while player XP remains at 100% (similar values to Multiplayer modes)".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>The Sims 4</em> community is in turmoil. Its biggest stars are distancing themselves from the game with the support of their millions of subscribers. Then there are creators in the middle: those big enough to be known, but not big enough to be insulated. And they are struggling with a difficult choice of whether or not to keep playing the game they love and, in some cases, depend on.</p><p>Last month, <em>The Sims</em>’ publisher EA <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787112/electronic-arts-55-billion-privacte-acquisition-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners">announced that it would be acquired for $55 billion dollars</a> by a combination of investors including the Saudi Arabia Private Investment Fund, and Affinity Partners, an investment firm founded by President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p>The news sent shockwaves throughout <em>The Sims’ </em>community. Players expressed concern that the company’s new owners would use their position to influence future content. <em>The Sims</em> and its community has long been celebrated for its inclusivity. It is a queer game <a href="https://gaymingmag.com/2025/10/ive-lost-my-safe-space-lgbtqia-the-sims-players-boycott-game-over-potential-conservative-acquisition/">played and loved by queer people</a>. That it could soon be owned in part by an <a href="https://www.humandignitytrust.org/country-profile/saudi-arabia/">ultra-conservative, anti-LGBTQ government</a> prompted the game’s most popular creators to act.</p><div><p>“Under this new ownership I feel I cannot maintain a direct association to the company.”</p></div><p>One of the biggest to respond was Kayla “LilSimsie” Sims who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxPVv5K6a9ZXkFzbLrta3DlHckpC8A9OF6">announced that she would be leaving the EA Creator program</a> to her 2 million subscribers on YouTube. Members of the network get special perks like early and free access to content packs to show them off to their followers, along with affiliate codes that can potentially net them a cut of sales. In January, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/you-make-the-sims-with-lilsimsie">she even collaborated with EA</a> to release her own content pack, allowing players to buy items she created to use in their own game. But now, she said she will be slowly shifting her content to other games. “Under this new ownership I feel I cannot maintain a direct association to the company,” she said in her announcement.</p><p>She wasn’t alone. Seemingly all at once, the life simulation game’s biggest content creators — including James Turner and Jesse “Plumbella” McNamara — <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-creators-quit-ea-partnerships-amid-buyout-concerns">all announced that they would be leaving EA’s creator program</a> and distancing themselves from the game that made them famous.</p><p>A creator’s choice to abandon a beloved game is never simple, especially when money and their career’s future viability are at stake. But the game’s biggest creators have acknowledged that their choice to step away is easier for them than most. “I think taking this stand is the right choice for me,” McNamara wrote in her statement. “I’m in a privileged position to be able to say I’m leaving so easily.”</p><p>For others, it’s much harder, as making the choice to step away means potentially damaging a content creation career that’s just getting started. “[<em>The Sims</em>] has taken me places I didn’t think it would,” said one creator who requested anonymity as their current affiliation with the EA Creator program doesn’t permit them to speak negatively about the company. “I have quite a diverse community, lots of BIPOC people, LGBTQ people in my community,” they said.</p><p>It was concern for those members that ultimately led them to make the decision to leave the network and slowly transition away from <em>The</em> <em>Sims</em>. “[The Sims] is a game where a lot of marginalized people have the freedom of representation,” they said. They spoke of how the conservative, anti-LGBTQ values and policies of EA’s buyers were at odds with the spirit of the game. “I just haven’t felt comfortable outwardly promoting content from a game that is potentially going to be owned by those entities.” While the creator doesn’t fully support themselves with their streaming career, they acknowledged that the choice to step away could damage their upward trajectory. “Most of my viewership comes to my platform to watch me play <em>The Sims</em>,” they said. “I imagine that I may lose some of that viewership.”</p><p>On Twitch and elsewhere, viewership is the key to growth and success. Creators with larger audiences are better insulated from viewer attrition. But for mid-tier creators, any disruption, whether it be a change in streaming schedule or content, can massively impact how many people show up to watch. It’s for that reason, a lot of <em>Sims</em> creators — even those who have issues with the buyout — are coming up with creative ways to express their discontent without potentially imperiling their channel.</p><p>Some creators aren’t leaving the program, but have decided to abstain from its benefits. “They’re not promoting any content from EA for the foreseeable future. They won’t be reviewing any packs or having any early access. They won’t be hosting giveaways,” said the Twitch streamer leaving the program.</p><p>Renee is a <em>Sims</em> content creator who’s been playing the game for over 20 years and has been a part-time creator on TikTok and YouTube for the last five. “<em>The Sims</em> has just always kind of been my happy place,” she said. When news of the buyout hit, she said she was concerned, and was pleased to see the bigger creators make their decision to leave. “These are the biggest names in <em>The Sims</em> community, and these are the people that have the biggest leverage when it comes to the actual game,” she said.</p><p>But she’s not personally ready to take that kind of stand, choosing to stay with the creator program and adopt a wait and see approach. “My thought process was, ‘This deal has not gone through yet,’” Renee said. She’s holding out hope that external pressure from the <em>Sims</em> community and two US Senators who have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxe7pZtIiCBZpCErpuc1fqI3k41pAsna53">requested an investigation into the deal</a>, might get it to fall through. “If I do leave the EA creator network, and this does not go through [...] I am not at the point in my <em>Sims</em> career to be able to regain access to something like this,” Renee said. “I know that there are a lot of people that are going to disagree with that, and that’s fine. I completely understand that point of view.”</p><p>But if the deal does go through, she says she’s out.</p><div><p><figcaption>In 2022, The Sims 4 released a wedding pack that feature queer couples.</figcaption></p></div><p>Streamers choosing to leave or stay with the EA Creator program has fractured the <em>Sims </em>community. After the exodus of high-profile creators, EA has since put out two statements in an attempt to calm fears and speculation. “Our mission, values, and commitment remain the same,” EA <a href="https://x.com/TheSims/status/1981787265811853776">said in a post on X</a> made immediately after the exodus. “<em>The Sims</em> will always be a space where you can express your authentic self.” It also updated an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125039888/ef20057994_defa14a.htm">employee FAQ</a> where it said, “EA will maintain creative control and our track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact.”</p><p>These reassurances are of little comfort to some, and all the creators I spoke to expressed a deep pain for what’s happening and fear for the future of the game they love. The streamer in the process of leaving the EA creator network knows that once the separation is complete, they’ll likely never be let back in. They’ve made their peace with that.</p><p>“I always want to do my best to uphold my integrity and my morals, and I feel that this buyout and what could potentially come for not just the game, but for the company as a whole goes against that,” they said. “And that outweighs any opportunities that I could potentially miss out on.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/816750/the-sims-ea-buyout-content-creator-program-departures-lilsimsie]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell keeps this massive 71% discount completely off its official website because the company probably doesn’t want to advertise such aggressive pricing on premium hardware. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5400/">Dell Inspiron 15.6-inch model with 1TB SSD storage and 32GB RAM normally lists for $2,549, but Amazon just quietly dropped it to just $749</a> for an early Black Friday clearance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5400/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor features 10 cores split between two performance cores and eight efficiency cores: This hybrid architecture handles demanding applications on the performance cores while routing background tasks to the efficiency cores and maximizes both speed and battery life. The processor boosts up to 4.6GHz on performance cores when you need extra power for intensive tasks like photo editing or running multiple browser tabs with streaming video.</p>



<h2>Perfect for Daily Tasks</h2>
<p>The 32GB of DDR4 memory crushes the performance bottlenecks that plague laptops with 8GB or 16GB configurations. You can have dozens of browser tabs open, as well as multiple Office applications, video conferencing software and background programs running, all without slowdowns or the dreaded spinning cursor. Indeed, this much memory proves essential for professionals who are constantly switching between email, documents and web research during their workday.</p>



<p>The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD affords a ton of space for documents and applications without necessitating constant file deleting. Most budget laptops stint with either 256GB or 512GB drives that fill up within months of normal use. This drive capacity fits in years of accumulated files comfortably, not giving you anxiety over running out of space in the middle of your project. The PCIe NVMe interface provides blazing-fast read speeds of over 3,000 MB/s and translates to near-instant file transfers and lightning-fast application launches.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch touchscreen FHD display offers 1920 x 1080 resolution with anti-glare coating and narrow bezels. Touch brings in great convenience while scrolling through documents, zooming in on photos, or navigating Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface. Video playback is smoothly handled by the Intel Iris Xe graphics, which also support up to dual external monitors via the included HDMI and USB-C ports.</p>
<p>The selection of ports includes all the essential connectivity options: <strong>three USB Type-A ports, one USB Type-C port for modern peripherals, HDMI output for external displays, a headset jack for private listening, and an SD card reader</strong> for transferring photos from cameras. This variety ensures you don’t have to deal with dongles and adapters that clutter your workspace.</p>
<p>This $749 price is an exceptional value when comparable laptops with these specs typically cost $1,200 or more. You’re saving $1,800 off Dell’s list price while getting a machine that handles professional workloads easily.</p>

<p>Use these Invincible Showdown monthly redeem codes for November 2025&nbsp; to get plenty of free cash and other items, allowing you to buy more powerful characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Invincible Showdown is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-heads-please-codes/">Roblox</a> fighting game inspired by the popular animated superhero TV series, Invincible. The game features all of the characters from the show, offering an added level of immersion to fans of both the show and Roblox. With realistic-looking abilities and deadly finishers involved, the combat gameplay of the game is one of the main reasons why it’s so highly rated. Players can also acquire and upgrade new abilities and skills in the game, which means that making cash as quickly as possible is of utmost importance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s exactly where these Invincible Showdown codes will be of aid. These can be used by anyone, irrespective of how far into the game they are, so players are urged to make use of all of them immediately, before they eventually expire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike many popular Roblox games today, redeeming codes in Invincible Showdown requires players to complete an additional step by following Invincibly Group and liking the game on Roblox. Once that’s done, though, it’s as simple as navigating through the menus of the game and inputting one of the active codes into the text box that pops up. For players who may be new to the Roblox environment, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to redeem Invincible Showdown codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Follow Invincibly Group on Roblox and like the game</li>



<li>Launch Roblox and open up Invincible Showdown</li>



<li>Click the ‘Rewards’ button on the right side</li>



<li>Click the ‘Codes’ button</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Redeem Code’ button to receive your rewards</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-invincible-showdown-codes">How To Get More Invincible Showdown Codes</h2>



<p>New Invincible Showdown codes are usually released during updates or special events, mostly through the game’s official Discord server or Roblox game page. However, tracking these multiple times a month can be a hassle. Instead, we recommend that all users keep this page bookmarked, as we update it with new information as soon as any codes are dropped by the developers, making it the most efficient way for players to get the latest codes.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hagrid%E2%80%99s-hut-falls-to-pocket-change-lego-cuts-4-9-rated-harry-potter-set-to-fresh-record-low.1347745/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Harry Potter LEGO sets usually cost a fortune because the Wizarding World license commands premium pricing on everything it touches. Most detailed Harry Potter builds run well over $100 and puts them out of reach for casual fans who just want a cool display piece.<strong> Hagrid’s Hut</strong> finally brings an iconic location from the films into an affordable price range that makes sense for gift-giving or treating yourself: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4867/">Amazon just dropped this 891-piece set from its usual $74 price down to just $47 for an early Black Friday deal</a>. That’s an all-time low that makes one of LEGO’s highest-rated Harry Potter sets cheaper than a video game.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4867/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The set includes seven minifigures that recreate the memorable scene when Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit Hagrid’s hut for the first time. You’ll get Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, and Rubeus Hagrid as buildable characters, plus LEGO figures of Norbert the baby dragon and Fang the boarhound. These minifigures feature detailed printing on their torsos and legs that catches each character’s signature clothing from the first film. The dragon element adds a nice touch since Norbert’s hatching represents one of the most memorable moments from that early Hogwarts chapter.</p>



<h2>Removable Roof and Opening Walls</h2>
<p>LEGO designed Hagrid’s hut with a <strong>removable roof and hinged walls that open for complete access to interior details</strong>. You won’t have to fiddle with fitting minifigures in some cramped spot, as you do with some sealed building sets. Detailed inside features include Hagrid’s oversized fold-out chair, which befits his half-giant stature, an umbrella stand with his pink umbrella hiding his broken wand, and the dragon egg element so essential to the story.</p>



<p>It contains<strong> two gold-colored portrait elements of various characters and paintings</strong> from around the castle, randomly selected from 14 different kinds of Hogwarts portraits. It encourages fans to purchase more than a single set to fill up their collection. In this set, you could arrange these portraits inside the hut or use them to customize other Harry Potter LEGO builds</p>
<p>The included doghouse features a detached building in which Fang, Hagrid’s loyal companion, can reside. This smaller build complements the main hut and adds play value by giving younger builders an additional construction project. The doghouse features appropriate details to match the rustic and cobbled-together aesthetic of Hagrid’s main dwelling.</p>
<p>The price-to-piece ratio at $47 delivers excellent value compared to other licensed LEGO sets within this size range.</p>

              <p>Apple never discounts MacBooks on its own website so when the 2025 MacBook Air hit $799 during October’s Prime Day, people rushed to grab it. That felt like the deal of the year until Amazon dropped an even deeper – early – Black Friday discount this week: The latest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">M4 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB SSD storage now sells for just $749, down from its usual $999 price tag</a>. Basically, you’re getting Apple’s newest silicon and premium build quality for less than plastic Dell and HP alternatives.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The M4 chip crushes Intel and AMD processors found in comparative Windows laptops while producing almost no heat. You can edit 4K video, run multiple browser tabs filled with streaming content, and do photo editing all at the same time without hearing any fan noise or feeling warmth through the keyboard. <strong>Apple built the M4 on a 3-nanometer process</strong> that fits more transistors in less space and boosts performance and energy efficiency.</p>
<h2>Best Laptop in 2025</h2>
<p>Apple has bumped the <strong>base configuration to 16GB of unified memory</strong>, up from a standard 8GB in the previous generation. This memory architecture allows the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine to access the same pool of memory without copying data between discrete components. You’ll jump between dozens of open applications without slowdowns or the spinning beach ball that plagued older Macs with too little RAM.</p>



<p>The<strong> display comes fitted with a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display</strong> that outputs at 500 nits of brightness and supports a billion colors. Text appears quite razor-sharp at native resolution, making extended reading sessions comfortable without eye strain. The screen covers the P3 wide color gamut that photographers and video editors rely on for accurate color representation.</p>
<p>The <strong>256GB SSD storage provides enough room for an operating system</strong>, essential applications, and a reasonable amount of documents and photos. For large video libraries, you’ll likely want to consider external storage or cloud services, although for most users, <strong>256GB is enough to handle their general computing tasks</strong>. The SSD reads and writes data at speeds that make file transfers and application loading just about instantaneous.</p>



<p>The<strong> battery life extends up to 18 hours for video playback</strong> or web browsing on a single charge. You can work a full day without carrying the charging adapter, then still have power left for evening entertainment. The efficient M4 chip sips power during light tasks, only ramping up performance when you actually need it.</p>
<p><strong>And at just 2.7 pounds</strong>, you barely notice the MacBook in your bag during commutes or travel.</p>
<p>At $749, this MacBook Air is a better price than a comparably specced Dell, HP, or Lenovo Windows laptop. You’ll save $250 off Apple’s regular price, all while still getting their latest and greatest tech. <strong>With an impressive 4.8-star rating from over 3,600 reviews</strong>, this laptop exceeds expectations in both build quality and performance.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-6-foot-usb-c-to-usb-c-cable-falls-to-4-now-selling-for-8x-cheaper-than-apples-option-2000642267</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-6-foot-usb-c-to-usb-c-cable-falls-to-4-now-selling-for-8x-cheaper-than-apple%E2%80%99s-option.1347730/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>USB-C cables break or disappear at the worst possible moment and then you’re in a scramble to find backups. Apple sells a single 6-foot USB-C cable on its website for $20-30 which seems outrageous for what’s essentially a wire with some connectors.</p>
<p>Anker builds cables to the same reliability standards that got the brand shelf space in Apple Stores worldwide. And the good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5399/">Amazon just dropped a 2-pack of Anker’s 6-foot USB-C to USB-C cables from $15 down to just $8</a>, hitting an all-time low price. You <strong>get two premium charging cables for less than a quarter of what Apple charges for one</strong>, and it costs roughly $4 for each cable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5399/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>Each of these <strong>cables supports 100W power delivery</strong> when connected with a compatible charger which means these handle the fastest charging speeds your devices can accept. Your MacBook Pro will charge at full speed without throttling down like cheaper cables that max out at 60W or less. The iPhone 17 series charges rapidly through these when connected to a 20W or higher USB-C power adapter.</p>



<h2>Built to Survive 5,000 Bends Without Failing</h2>
<p>The <strong>braided nylon exterior resists fraying and splitting</strong> at the connector joints where most cables fail first. Anker rated these cables for 5,000 bend cycles, which represents years of daily plugging and unplugging in real-world use. Reinforced strain relief at both ends prevents internal wires from breaking when you wrap cables for storage or accidentally yank them.</p>



<p>The length of <strong>6 feet</strong> gives you flexibility to charge devices while actually using them comfortably. Shorter 3-foot cables, on the other hand, just make you sit right next to wall outlets or power banks, which proves awkward when you want to use your phone in bed or on a couch. This length reaches from floor outlets to desk height with ease or reaches from a nightstand charger onto your bed without stretching tight.</p>
<p>Anker supports all these<strong> cables with a lifetime warranty</strong> that covers defects in manufacturing and normal wear failures. They actually honor this warranty hassle-free, often shipping replacement cables without having to ship back failed units first. <strong>Over 23,000 customer reviews averaging 4.7 stars</strong> confirm these deliver reliable performance across different devices and charging scenarios.</p>



<p>The <strong>cables charge at USB 2.0 speeds</strong> while transferring data to enable syncing of files between devices or your phone to a computer. The included hook and loop cable ties keep both cables organized in your bag or drawer rather than tangling into impossible knots.</p>
<p>The price of $8 for two cables is less than a single lunch and solves your charging needs across multiple locations. Keep one cable at your desk and another in your living room, or split the pack with a family member. This all-time low pricing makes stocking up easy and deals this aggressive on genuine Anker products rarely last more than a few days before inventory runs out.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> is now the fourth-biggest-selling game of all time, having sold 79 million copies since it debuted in 2018.</p>
<p>That's according to publisher Take-Two, although you'd be forgiven for missing the news given the milestone was announced at the same time we learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">GTA 6 had been delayed to 26th November, 2026</a>.</p>

<p>Squirrelled away within its <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/2b782ec8-e583-4f7b-a213-86f2d1dbce40">investor's report</a>, Take-Two revealed that the sequel's success take sales for the whole franchise to 106 million.</p>
<p>That means Red Dead Redemption 2 has sold more copies than <em>any</em> other game released in the last seven years - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare - and surpassed the sales of blockbuster games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, The Sims, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> (although admittedly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-relaunches-in-free-to-play-form">the latter eventually went free-to-play in 2022</a>).</p><p> It also eclipsed the previous holder of the fourth-biggest game in the world title, Mario Kart 8.</p>
<p>In fact, only Minecraft, GTA 5, and Wii Sports have sold more, with sales of 350 million, 220 million, and 82.9 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Back in July, quite out of the blue, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-releases-surprise-red-dead-online-update-despite-previously-ending-major-support">Rockstar released an update for Red Dead Online, boasting four new adventures</a>, Strange Tales of The Plague, Strange Tales of Modern Science, Strange Tales of The Bayou and Strange Tales of The Wilderness. It came as a surprise as back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-confirms-end-of-major-red-dead-online-support">Rockstar told fans not to expect any further major updates for Red Dead Online</a>.</p>
<p>We thought Red Dead Redemption 2 was great, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-review-9">awarding it a Recommended badge</a>, calling it "an astounding open world unlikely to be rivalled until well into the next gen, saddled by a throughline from the last."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civilization VII</a> has received multiple updates since it launched earlier this year and alongside Update 1.3.0, Firaxis Games has now released the <strong>Tides of Power Collection</strong>.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-tides-of-power-collection-70070000031661-switch/">"free to claim" on the Switch and Switch 2 eShop</a> until <strong>5th January 2026</strong> and is "yours to keep permanently at no cost". After this date, you'll be required to purchase it.</p>
<p>Here's a quick rundown about what you can expect, along with an official graphic, and below this are the full details about the DLC (via the game's website patch notes):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Tides of Power Update:</strong> This is now fully claimable on Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch...Starting today, add Edward Teach, Republic of Pirates, and Tonga content packs to your game, and then receive the Sayyida al Hurra, Ottomans, and Iceland content packs in-game when they're released in December 2025. If you successfully claim this content by January 5, 2026 at 6:59AM PT, it's yours to keep; otherwise it will be available for individual purchase starting January 5, 2026."</p>

<h2 id="civilization-vii-tides-of-power-collection-4th-november-2025">Civilization VII: Tides of Power Collection (4th November 2025)</h2>
<h2 id="leaders">Leaders</h2>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added new leader Edward Teach.</strong></p>
<p>Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, was an English pirate whose name sparked dread in the captains of the Caribbean. In 1716, he joined the crew of Benjamin Hornigold, a leader of the Flying Gang, and quickly gained his own ships. With his impressive height, his long beard (decorated with, at times, lit fuses), and reputation for violence, he stalked the sea-lanes of the Caribbean and the nightmares of sailors. He outlived the Flying Gang and moved his operation to the Outer Banks of present-day North Carolina, where a pirate hunter, Robert Maynard, finally caught up with him.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Militaristic, Economic</li>
<li><strong>Unique Ability – Blackbeard</strong>: All Naval Units gain the Pirate Ability, allowing them to cross borders of other civilizations, Plunder Trade Routes from non-Allied civilizations, and attack Naval Units of non-Allied civilizations without declaring war. Defeating any Naval Units with your own Naval Units provides Gold equal to a set percentage of its Combat Strength and captures that Unit. Increased Gold maintenance costs for all Naval Units.</li>
<li><strong>Agenda – Queen Anne’s Revenge</strong>: Increase Relationship by a Small Amount with Leaders that build Naval Units. Decrease Relationship by a Small Amount with Leaders that neglect to build Naval Units.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="civilizations">Civilizations</h2>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added a new Exploration Age civilization Republic of Pirates.</strong></p>
<p>Where there is wealth, there is greed. The scramble for new world riches in the early 18th century brought English, Spanish, French, and Dutch fleets – but the prospect of quick riches also brought pirates. These were rarely organized, but in 1706, one band, the Flying Gang, took over the island of New Providence in the Bahamas and set up a short-lived republic for all who sought fortune... and came with few scruples.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Economic, Militaristic</li>
<li><strong>Unique Ability – Flying Gang</strong>: Increased Yields from Pillaging and Coastal Raiding with Naval Units. Settler Units cannot be trained or purchased, but you can capture other civilizations' Settlers. Naval Units, Treasure Convoys, and Buccaneer Units can move into other civilizations' borders without being at war or having Open Borders.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Civilian Unit – Buccaneer</strong>: Unique Commander Unit. Gains a set number of charges to use the 'Raiding Party' Action every set number of Promotions.
<ul>
<li><strong>Action - Raiding Party</strong>: Targets an adjacent Treasure Resource. This Settlement instantly spawns a Treasure Convoy under your control equal to the number of Treasure Resources; this does not reset until another Treasure Convoy is available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unique Military Unit – Sloop</strong>: Unique Naval Unit (replaces Privateer). Can cross other civilizations' borders, Pillage Trade Routes between non-Allied civilizations, and attack Units of non-Allied civilizations without going to war. Can move after attacking and has a set amount of Movement.</li>
<li><strong>Associated Wonder – Havana Harbor</strong>: Gold Base. This Settlement generates Treasure Convoys worth a set amount of Treasure Fleet points in the Exploration Age (effect scales based on game speed). Increased Economic Attribute. Must be built in Distant Lands on Coastal Tiles adjacent to non-Lake tiles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added a new Antiquity Age civilization Tonga.</strong></p>
<p>Into the endless blue, in search of new lands on scattered islands, the Polynesians sailed, settling the island of Tonga nearly three thousand years ago. Around 1000 CE, though, came another expansion, the Tu’i Tonga Empire – a struggle for dominance, tribute, and fealty over the Pacific. The Tongan kings maintained this system of hierarchical lordship over the islands until it, too, splintered.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Expansionist, Diplomatic</li>
<li><strong>Unique Ability – Lords of the South</strong>: Increased Influence on City Halls and the Palace if adjacent to Coast tiles. Cannot incorporate City-States.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Civilian Unit – Tehina</strong>: Unique Scout Unit. Can enter Ocean tiles (without taking damage) and embark at the start of the Age. Cannot disembark in Distant Lands, but can use Coastal Raid on adjacent Discoveries.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Military Unit – Kalia</strong>: Increased Combat Strength against Districts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wonders">Wonders</h2>
<p><strong>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added four new Wonders:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Great Lighthouse – Antiquity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gold Base. Grants a free Merchant when built. +15 Water Trade Route Range in all Settlements. +1 Sight to all Naval Units. Must be built on a Coast tile adjacent to Land.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Nan Madol – Exploration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Provides +3 Culture, +3 Production, and +3 Happiness on the Palace and City Hall on Islands (a landmass with a maximum of 15 tiles). Must be built in an Island City on Coast adjacent to Land</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Great Blue Hole – Natural Wonder</strong>
<ul>
<li>+2 Science and +4 Happiness. Adjacent sea rural tiles receive +2 Culture. Placed on the Coast adjacent to 6 coast tiles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mapu'a Vaea Blowholes – Natural Wonder</strong>
<ul>
<li>+2 Production and +4 Happiness. +2 Culture to all Coastal land tiles in this Settlement. Impassable.</li>
<li>Placed on the Coast adjacent to Cliffs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<hr>
<p>Firaxis has also included some platform-specific updates tied to the Switch and Switch 2 in Update 1.3.0. This includes the following:</p>
<p><strong>Switch / Switch 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR options now appear when undocking Switch.</li>
<li>Addressed a reported issue where the last character entered with the virtual keyboard would appear incorrectly.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out more about Update 1.3.0 and what else it includes in the update notes on the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">official Civilization website</a>.</p>

                <p>The time of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo: Infinite</a> is coming to a close. Microsoft and Halo Studios have revealed that the game's next major update, Operation: Infinite, will be its last. The announcement came on Friday during Halo Studios' Halo: Infinite livestream.</p><p data-embed-type="html"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yT_lkR3V4-0?si=8JYCsywDbhhGSiTp" height="315" width="560"></iframe></p><p>In a message posted to <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Halo site</a>, Halo Studios thanked fans for supporting Infinite. The team also indicated that this decision was made to allow the devs to focus on "multiple Halo titles in development." This part is nothing new or surprising, given that Microsoft has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">saying for over a year now</a> that there are multiple new Halo games in development.</p><p>"With multiple Halo titles in development, we'll need our whole team's combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us," reads the statement. "While we remain committed to supporting Halo Infinite on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned."</p><p>The only Halo game confirmed to be in development at the moment is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-700149">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, a remake of the original Halo that will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696">bring the franchise to PlayStation 5</a> for the first time. Separately, there have been rumors about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/" data-ref-id="1100-6535547">a live-service Halo game</a>, which remain unconfirmed for now. If those reports are accurate, that game could be the spiritual successor of Halo Infinite.</p><p>Earlier this month, Sandy Peterson shed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-mmo-was-killed-to-protect-execs-stock-bonus-developer-claims/1100-6535871/" data-ref-id="1100-6535871">some light on the Halo MMO</a> from Age of Empires developer Ensemble Studios that was canceled in 2008. According to Peterson, that project never saw the light of day because then head of Xbox Don Mattrick canceled it to protect his stock bonus.</p><p>Master Chief creator Marcus Lehto recently said that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">Halo remake "warms my heart,"</a> while another former <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">Halo dev slammed some of the remake's changes</a>.</p>
