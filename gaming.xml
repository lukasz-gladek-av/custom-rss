            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-revealed-ahead-of-thursdays-trailer.1349911/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>release date has been leaked ahead of a new trailer that's set to arrive for the cozy&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>life sim on Thursday.</p>

<p>As spotted by&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>news platform <a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1988245459807113647" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Serebii</a>, what looks like a Japanese-language thumbnail for the upcoming trailer apparently reveals the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>release date to be March 5th next year.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the front <a href="https://www.serebii.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">page</a> of Serebii's official website also confirms that the game's physical version will be a Game Key Card and will require 10GB of memory to install, so if you're planning on picking up&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia</em>, make sure you've got at least that much space.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-leak-charmander.jpg?itok=H60ZkLFA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-leak-charmander.jpg?itok=fxLNqQB5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>release date may have been leaked.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the Japanese release date for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>may not be the same as its Western launch date, but simultaneous worldwide releases have been the norm for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>for a while now, so it's likely the game will launch around the world on the same day.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>is, it's an upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-themed&nbsp;life sim. Revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-september-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">September's Nintendo Direct</a>, the game casts you as "a Ditto transformed into a human". It's up to you to "shape an empty land into a beautiful home for Pokemon".</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>looks to resemble games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-free-update" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, and HoYoverse's upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/petit-planet-preview-hoyoverses-foray-into-life-sims" rel="nofollow"><em>Petit Planet</em></a>. It'll feature Pokemon like Squirtle, Charmander, and Bulbasaur, and you'll be able to use their abilities to shape the world around you.</p>

<p>The game will serve as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, so if you want to check it out, you'll have to make the leap to Nintendo's new machine. Hey, at least you'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" rel="nofollow">far from alone in doing so</a>!</p>




<p><em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on March 5th next year, assuming this Serebii leak is correct, of course. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Arc Raiders Sales Reach 4m in Less Than Two Weeks]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-sales-reach-4m-in-less-than-two-weeks.1349905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Embark Studios has announced that its post-apocalyptic extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>has passed a major sales milestone in less than two weeks.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000421.000014847.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> (which is entirely in Japanese, so we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>sales have shot past four million, and the game seemingly continues to grow in popularity, too, having reached a record 700,000 concurrent users across all platforms this week.</p>

<p><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>is still the <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/globaltopsellers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">best-selling</a> piece of software on Steam at time of writing, too. The game is beating popular rivals like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-1m-10-days" rel="nofollow">Telltale-style adventure&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-1m-10-days" rel="nofollow">Dispatch</a>&nbsp;</em>and FPS&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-sales-7m" rel="nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>&nbsp;</em>to the (second from) top spot, something about which Embark is no doubt thrilled.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arc-raiders-sales-4m-hiding.jpg?itok=m-kr2njn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arc-raiders-sales-4m-hiding.jpg?itok=_0K8qbnf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>is really making a name for itself.</figcaption></figure><p>It's an impressive feat for a game that has had a somewhat lengthy and complex development history. Originally revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">back in 2021</a>, Embark's game was originally intended to be a co-op third-person shooter set for release in 2022, but it was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-delay-pushes-release-date-to-2023" rel="nofollow">delayed into 2023</a>.</p>

<p>Following that delay, Embark revealed that the game's scope had been changed, and that it would now be a PvPvE extraction shooter along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>or Bungie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>.</p>

<p>The game was released on October 30th to a positive reception, although it garnered some criticism for its use of generative AI to create some voice lines (and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/examining-generative-ais-usage-in-steam-next-fest-2025" rel="nofollow">far from the only game</a> on Steam to use that technology).</p>

<p><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>sees players descending into a post-apocalyptic landscape in order to do battle with both lethal ARC machines and roving squads of other players, gathering loot and attempting to survive until extraction.</p>




<p>If you're interested in giving&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>a go, you can pick it up right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/arc-raiders/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/arc-raiders/9ndf1f263rz4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> (and it sounds like now really is the time to do so, judging by the size of the player base). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Sales Up but Income Down as Bungie and Destiny 2 Disappoint]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-q2-2025-26-destiny-2-bungie</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-sales-up-but-income-down-as-bungie-and-destiny-2-disappoint.1349902/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released its financial statement for the second quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and it looks like Bungie and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>aren't doing the business the Japanese tech giant had hoped for on acquisition.</p>

<p>As revealed in Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_sonypre.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">latest financial presentation</a>, sales in the company's gaming sector increased by 4% when compared to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-q1-2025" rel="nofollow">previous quarter</a>, but operating income fell by 13% across the same period, and Sony puts this down largely to "impairment losses" relating to&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>and Bungie.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_sonyspeech.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">document</a>, Sony says that&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s "sales and user engagement" haven't reached "the expectations [Sony] had at the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-is-acquiring-destiny-2-developer-bungie" rel="nofollow">time of the acquisition of Bungie</a>". The publisher therefore "downwardly revised" its "business projection" as a result of this underperformance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-sony-financials-q2-2025.jpg?itok=kxbQ7xl6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-sony-financials-q2-2025.jpg?itok=XSw5znDZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>hasn't proven the golden goose Sony apparently hoped it would be.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony contrasts&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s disappointing performance with that of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, which it says is performing "extremely well", with sales of the game "significantly increas[ing]" due both to its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">release on Xbox Series X|S</a> and "increased engagement from existing users on PS5 and PC".</p>

<p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, which was released in October, has apparently already surpassed the three-million sales mark as well, which makes it "a major hit like its predecessor", according to Sony.</p>

<p>Exactly why&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;Bungie have disappointed Sony isn't clear from this presentation, but the game's player numbers have <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1085660/charts/#6m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">plummeted</a> in recent months (although it is worth noting that the game hasn't received a major expansion since July).</p>

<p>This will almost certainly be making Sony anxious about&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, Bungie's next major project, which still doesn't have a release date after being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed indefinitely back in June</a>.</p>




<p>That decision was made following the revelation that some of the artwork in&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">had been stolen</a> from an online artist, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" rel="nofollow">firing of the game's director</a> last spring after he was hit with misconduct allegations.</p>

<p>Despite Sony's disappointment in Bungie and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, the company says that over 40% of its revenue this quarter came from live-service games, so this isn't likely to mark a return to single-player shooters on Bungie's part. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/shokz-bone-conduction-headphones-going-for-pennies-as-amazon-dumps-stock-before-black-friday-2000642918</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shokz-bone-conduction-headphones-going-for-pennies-as-amazon-dumps-stock-before-black-friday.1349896/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon just cut the price on what runners everywhere call their favorite workout companion: The<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/"> Shokz OpenRun Pro bone conduction headphones have dropped to $124, down from their usual $179 price tag</a>. These aren’t your standard issue earbuds that block out the world around you: they use bone conduction technology to deliver audio through your cheekbones while keeping your ears completely open. It’s a design that makes them a go-to for runners who need to stay aware of traffic, fellow joggers, and their surroundings without sacrificing their workout playlist.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Why Choose Bone Conduction Over Traditional Earbuds</h2>
<p>The OpenRun Pro takes a fundamentally different tack with workout audio: traditional earbuds create a seal in your ear canal which might be OK on the gym floor but becomes a serious safety hazard when you take your runs outdoors. These <strong>headphones perch on your cheekbones and transmit sound through bone conduction</strong> and leave your ear canals wide open. You hear your music, podcasts, or calls clearly while simultaneously hearing cars approaching, cyclists calling out, or someone trying to get your attention on the trail.</p>
<p>The 9th generation represents years of refinement in bone conduction technology: They’re the first Shokz headphones built to take advantage of <em>TurboPitch</em> technology, a design that confronts the main critique of bone conduction models of the past. The <strong>bass response feels full and rich rather</strong> than tinny or weak. You get clear vocals across your favorite tracks, powerful volume when you need to bear down during tough intervals, and surprisingly deep low-end frequencies that other bone conduction models struggled to deliver.</p>



<p>The physical design solves problems that plague conventional workout headphones: <strong>A wraparound titanium frame weighs almost nothing</strong> but provides serious durability. This lightweight, titanium construction flexes to fit different head sizes without creating pressure points. The frame keeps the headphones locked in position through sprints, burpees, or mountain climbs during intense training sessions</p>
<p>Battery performance matches the requirements of the most serious athletes: The <strong>ten hours of continuous playback</strong> will handle everything from marathon training runs to full days of back-to-back activities. You charge them once and don’t worry about battery anxiety for days of normal use. The Quick Charge feature proves super-practical when you forget to plug them in overnight. <strong>Just five minutes charging gives you 1.5 hours of battery life</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>sweat-resistant construction</strong> handles whatever your workout throws at it. These headphones resist humid summer runs, aggressive HIIT sessions, and rainy morning jogs without degradation in performance.</p>
<p>At $124, these headphones cost less than most premium traditional sports earbuds and offer better situational awareness.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-has-dropped-down-to-just-650-2000642541</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-clears-out-amd-ryzen-5-gaming-laptop-at-62-off-from-premium-to-practically-budget.1349893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With us rushing right through to the end of the year, we find ourselves only a couple short weeks before one of the biggest savings events of the year — Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This will be a great time to save on a new TV, some kitchenware, or perhaps a new laptop. Even though we’re not quite there yet, you can already find some pretty lucrative deals and discounts ahead of schedule. Take a look at this IdeaPad Slim 3 laptop from Lenovo. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5451/">Amazon has it listed at $1,700, but current 62% discount ends up taking over a thousand dollars off the top. You only have to pay $650 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>Ok so wait a minute. How can this possibly be $1,050 off. That seems too good to be true. Well, if we take a look at the price history, we can see that this laptop has only been listed by this seller since the beginning of this month. After a few days of being full price, it got this massive cut, bringing it to the level it is now. And if we look at Lenovo’s own website, we can find a similarly-specced IdeaPad Slim 3 going for just $660.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5451/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>So what gives? Well, lots of independent sellers like to artificially inflate the base price of their products so they can give them a huge markdown, giving the illusion of a great deal. And that’s a shame because this laptop is already a great value at this price.</p>
<h2>Diving Into the Specs</h2>
<p>What you get is an ultra-slim, lightweight laptop with a 15.3-inch screen powered by an AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor with an integrated graphics card. The Amazon listing does call it out as a gaming laptop, but the IdeaPad Slim 3 is better suited as a general-use laptop for everyday users. It still might be able to handle some lighter games that aren’t so graphically intensive. The laptop includes a full keypad, featuring a number pad which is a welcomed addition for anyone crunching numbers all day long.</p>



<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5451/">The laptop is working with 24GB of memory and a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD for storage. It’s got support for Wi-Fi 6 for fast and stable internet speeds.</a> The ports along the side include two USB-A slots, a USB-C slot, an HDMI so you can connect to a second display, an SD card reader (great for photographers to have handy), and a classic 3.5mm headphone and microphone combination jack.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been almost four years since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps5-destiny-2-bungie-playstation-microsoft-xbox-ex-1848453326"><span>Sony acquired Bungie</span></a><span>, the developers of </span><i><span>Destiny 2 </span></i><span>and the creators of Microsoft’s flagship franchise </span><i><span>Halo, </span></i><span>for a whopping $3.6 billion. Now, as we approach the fourth anniversary of that transaction, it looks like Sony isn’t satisfied with the monetary return, as the company’s CFO and Corporate Executive Officer, Lin Tao, revealed that </span><i><span>Destiny 2 </span></i><span>has not met the PlayStation maker’s expectations.</span></p>

 <p><span>In Sony’s Q2 Fiscal Year 2025 earnings call (thanks, </span><a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/destiny-2-hasnt-reached-sonys-expectations-for-bungie-acquisition-says-cfo/"><i><span>This Week in Video Games</span></i></a><span>), Tao spoke about </span><i><span>Destiny 2</span></i><span> and said that its sales and player engagement have “not reached the expectations [Sony] had at the time of the acquisition of Bungie.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“While we will continue to make improvements, we downwardly revised the business projection for the time being, and recorded an impairment loss against a portion of the assets at Bungie,” Tao said through an English translator.</span></p> <p><i><span>Destiny 2</span></i><span> is one side of Bungie’s business right now, while the other is the upcoming extraction shooter </span><i><span>Marathon</span></i><span>, which has faced some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775"><span>middling reception during its testing phase</span></a><span>. For now, Sony seems intent on releasing the game within this fiscal year, meaning sometime before March 2026. </span><i><span>Marathon</span></i><span> was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674"><span>indefinitely delayed earlier this year to address feedback</span></a><span>, so it has no set launch date at this time. Bungie recently concluded another testing phase in October, and </span><a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/sony-cfo-on-bungies-marathon-as-needed-we-will-make-corrections/"><span>Tao says</span></a><span> the company is in the “process of analyzing the performance against [its internal] KPIs.”</span></p>

            <p>Sony's bold entrance into the console market back in the '90s heralded the use of CD-ROMs instead of cartridges, which convinced several companies to jump on board the PlayStation train. It turns out FromSoftware was one of those companies lured in by the appeal of discs.</p>
<p><a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console?utm_source=Social+Media&amp;utm_medium=Social+Post&amp;utm_campaign=MPC+Acast+Page">Speaking to Simon Parkin on the Your Perfect Console podcast</a>, former president of Sony Interactive Entertainment Shuhei Yoshida stated it was the decision to embrace CD-ROMs which led FromSoftware to join the video game industry, kicking of a chain of events leading us to games like Bloodborne, Armored Core 6, and the wider Souls series.</p>
<p>Yoshida explained how it went down: "A few companies like Atlas saw the opportunity in [CD- ROMs], because it was so much cheaper to create and quicker to manufacture. They didn't have to wait two-to-three months to restock their games if they were successful, CD ROMS could be delivered in three-to-four days."</p>

<figcaption>Ten years ago, Eurogamer spoke with Shuhei Yoshida live on stage! What a blast from the past.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcvhiWw8-e0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>"One of these companies was FromSoftware" Yoshida continued. "FromSoftware was a business software company, but when they saw PlayStation was a CD ROM game system, they thought 'oh, we can become a video game publisher'! That's how they entered into the video game industry."</p><p>When asked how Yoshida convinced companies to take a chance on Sony, a company that at this point in time had no video game console experience, Yoshida said: "It was not easy. Industry people were saying between PlayStation and Sega Saturn, the Sega Saturn would probably be more popular due to Sega's experience. However, it was a combination of the 3D graphics capability of the PlayStation, as well as the CD-ROMs as a new business opportunity. Of course, the Sega Saturn provided the same opportunity with CD-ROMs"</p>
<p>"However, Bandai Namco provided a really good library of 3D games like with Bit Racer, Capcom brought Resident Evil, and eventually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/squaresoft">Squaresoft</a> released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>. That was the more critical title."</p>
<p>So, in case you needed reminding, the decision to use CD-ROMs was a big deal for Sony and the future of the video game industry as a whole. The whole interview is filled with many similar tidbits of information about Sony's past, and is well worth a listen.</p>
<p>Shuhei Yoshida left PlayStation back in January and since then has proven especially opinionated on the video game industry. You can read his thoughts on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-ps6-sony-cannot-do-the-same-thing-they-have-been-doing-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">the PlayStation 6, and how Sony "cannot do the same thing they have been doing"</a>, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-losing-their-identity-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida-shares-damning-switch-2-verdict">how Nintendo is losing its identity</a>. Alternatively, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-playstation-boss-shuhei-yoshida-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-a-job-overseeing-indie-games">he's also spoken about how he "had no choice" but to take a job overseeing indie games</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>Breaking Bad</em> and <em>Better Call Saul</em> creator Vince Gilligan’s new show <em>Pluribus</em> premiered last week on Apple TV. The first two episodes gave me some tonal whiplash, but together are doing something I’m not sure I’m sold on yet, but definitely want to see more of.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Pluribus</em> follows Carol Sturka (played by <em>Better Call Saul'</em>s Rhea Seehorn), a wildly popular romance author who seems to hate being a wildly popular romance author. She’s returned home to Albuquerque after a book tour just as a global disaster hits that turns everyone into zombies. Sort of: As the result of scientists decoding an alien message, almost all of the people on Earth now share a consciousness. Carol is one of a handful of holdouts, and the rest of humanity wants to bring her into the fold in the nicest way possible.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a6lzvWby9UE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Pluribus — Official Trailer | Apple TV"></iframe></figure><p>It’s an interesting twist on the zombie formula. The first of the two episodes that premiered Friday is your classic stuff: Carol and her publicist/secret partner Helen are at a bar when everyone goes rigid. There are beautifully-composed shots of Carol coolly driving through town with chaos in her back window, as we slowly notice that all her revived neighbors are acting strangely calm and helpful. There’s a great moment I won’t spoil where Carol figures out what’s going on via watching TV. As someone who avoids suspense and horror because I hate watching people just be upset, I found the first episode very stressful, but the subtle way the show threads in hints that this isn’t the standard disaster stuff helped me push through it.</p><p>In the second episode it becomes clear what’s going on: Basically all of humanity’s main goal now is to help Carol and the others who haven’t been “Joined” to get in on it, though they don’t quite know how. In the meantime, the entire world just wants to make life great for those folks. Because they all share the same brain, any one individual knows everything everyone else in the world knows; any random neighbor can operate heavy machinery, fly a plane, or know where Carol keeps her spare key. The episode becomes a twist on the “last survivor of the apocalypse” drama; instead of forging a new life all alone in the ruins of the world, the whole world is here to help Carol live her best life.&nbsp;</p><p>But Carol doesn’t want the life the hivemind can give her. In the second episode we meet some of the other remaining survivors, who deal with the situation in different ways. Some want to join the hivemind, or seem in denial about the severity of the situation because they can’t deal with the idea that their families aren’t the people they know anymore. One, Koumba, is taking full advantage of the deal by commandeering Air Force One and gathering an entourage of beautiful hivemind women who are happy to wear matching leopard print and fly to Vegas with him. I wasn’t totally sold on all of the survivors’ conflicts, with some of them feeling to me less like authentic character development and more like the kinds of thoughts a viewer might have that the show just wanted to get out of the way. I’m curious to see how else these survivors figure in as the series progresses and what else the show does with them.</p><p>But there’s also a lot of interesting stuff to explore among them: Is <em>who someone is</em> inherently tied to their individuality? (I studied Buddhism, so that’s a big question.) Is this very kind apocalypse worth it if it leads to world peace? What really <em>is</em> kindness? What motivates it, and how do those motivations figure into how we respond to it? How do we learn to accept love and care from others?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The last question is very much one Carol’s character explores. Before the world goes to shit, she seems to hate her fans for loving her, and she pushes away people who are nice to her. That has consequences for her relationship with the hivemind, and raises bigger questions about how our attitudes and responses affect those around us. The show touches lightly on one possible reason why she’s like this, but I’m hoping it digs into all this more to keep Carol from becoming just a one-note curmudgeon. <em>Better Call Saul</em> and <em>Breaking Bad</em> were both excellent at complex characters, so I have hopes the show and its characters will grow from these early episodes.</p><p>Even if I’m not totally sold on <em>Pluribus</em> yet, I’m definitely in to see where it’s going to go. I keep meaning to cancel Apple TV because I barely watch it, but just as I’m about to it releases some new show I’m curious about that keeps me sending it my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/763486/apple-tv-plus-streaming-price-increase?ref=aftermath.site"><u>ever-increasing</u></a> dollars. The show will have nine episodes, releasing on Fridays. </p>

<p>More to come?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ldQYMwzWrY">a new trailer</a> to provide an overview on how Switch 2 cartridges and Game-Key Cards work (just in case the last six or seven months' worth of discourse hasn't already clued you in).</p>
<p>In it, one of the examples showcased to demonstrate the Game-Key Card is none other than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, which has just been confirmed to launch on <strong>5th March, 2026</strong>. The title is being published by The Pokémon Company in Japan and Nintendo in the West, which makes this the company's first Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>Of course, the renders shown in the trailer clearly have a 'sample' watermark included, so there's a chance – however small – that the game may have just been plucked from thin air to demonstrate Nintendo's practices, but we think not. We reckon Pokopia is a full-blown Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean? Is this the start of something more? We can't be sure yet. Nintendo has previously gone on record to state that it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-has-no-plans-to-use-game-key-cards-for-first-party-developed-titles">wouldn't use the medium for "Nintendo-developed titles"</a>, but that's the thing... This isn't a Nintendo-developed title – it's Omega Force (Koei Tecmo). But then if that's the case, then why didn't <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> also receive a Game-Key Card release?</p>
<p>Lots of questions for now, and we'll be sure to push for answers going forward. But if you're someone who's dead set against Game-Key Cards, then you might want to strike Pokémon Pokopia off your wish list.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>Back in July this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-z-a-unite-champions-netflix-1851786687">Nintendo held a <em>spectactularly</em> bad&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>Presents</a>, during which close to nothing was announced but for a shambolic reveal that there was going to be a new Pokémon theme park opening in 2026 called PokéPark Kanto. The announcement treated us to images of cheap, plastic Pokémon toys balanced on a table. Someone used the words “where Pokémon truly exist” to describe the supposed wonders of this place, while we saw fiberglass Pokémon put near some trees. It was amazing. Anyway, jump forward four months and an official opening date has been announced, along with a video showing…animated people visiting an animated park?</p>

 <p>I am very here for this ongoing weirdness. Part of me wishes it could all turn out to be some <a href="https://kotaku.com/willy-wonka-experience-fyre-fest-glasgow-1851292959">Willy Wonka Experience-type fiasco</a>, eventually opening on February 5 to reveal a bleak, near-empty warehouse with a few 3D-printed Pokémon toys and a lady wearing a yellow tracksuit and face paint telling crying children that she’s Pikachu. I realize, given this is The Pokémon Company (and therefore Nintendo), that’s not enormously likely. But it sure is being marketed like it should be! The park itself will be a part of an enormous theme park in Tokyo called Yomiuriland, and is described as “the first ever permanent Pokémon outdoor facility.”</p>

 <p>But first, that Direct footage is still making me laugh months later:</p> <figure><figcaption>The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>And now we can add to it a superbly made animated trailer for the park that—because it’s an animated trailer that leans into the fantasy of the place—tells us literally nothing concrete or useful whatsoever. I’m going to go out on a limb and argue that The Pokémon Company has not successfully conducted some sort of gruesome genetic modification program and successfully bred real-world Pokémon to populate their park, so I suspect that we can at the very least reject the bit where there are Eevee and Pikachu scampering down the paths, or terrifying stampedes of Rhydon and Onyx as Pidgeo fly overheard. I am, however, willing to suspend my disbelief enough to accept that something a lot like Rattata might be present.</p>

  <p>OK, so let’s be fair; the website for the park <em>does</em> show some proof of existence, albeit very sparse. Among a&nbsp;lot of cartoon images we have what look like real-life photographs of a Pokémon Center, a Poké Mart and a Gym. And then, bizarrely, <a href="https://www.pokepark-kanto.co.jp/ppark/img/about/forest-poke-02.png">the same photographs</a> of fiberglass Eevee that we saw back in July.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642910" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642910"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642910">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000642912" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642912"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642912">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000642913" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642913"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642913">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>So don’t get me wrong. I would hop from foot to foot in gleeful excitement if I were able to go into a real, actual, full-size Pokémon Center, where I assume I would meet Nurse Joy herself. But again, I’m getting abandoned park vibes before this place even opens.</p>

 <p>There are to be three sections: Sedge Town, Pokémon Forest, and PokéPark Entrance Plaza, which will feature a Research Lab where you start your adventure. It remains opaque exactly how the whole thing will work, but you seem to be given a choice between a Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle (“No Timothy, Pikachu wasn’t one of the original starters! Stop that crying!”), and then you’re off to explore the various areas. The Pokémon Center will apparently feature Chansey and allow you to heal your Pokémon (which itself implies a lot), while the Mart seems to be primarily a refreshment area. Beyond that, there’s an Eevee-themed carousel and something called Pika Pika Paradise powered by 30 Pikachu. These both require separate ticket purchases! Meanwhile, the Gym will be used for live performances. Which seems a shame, given the chance to offer a bunch of challenges for kids to complete, right? And some of these live shows require their own separate tickets too!</p> <p>Let’s hope it’s completely brilliant, and given that it’s being added to such an established and popular park, and created by The Pokémon Company itself, it really should be. But please can we have more of this super-weird marketing before any of that happens?</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="680">If you’re creating content for TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts, there’s one simple upgrade that can dramatically improve the quality of your videos: invest in a good microphone. It might sound minor, but clear, professional audio can make the difference between a clip that feels polished and one that viewers scroll past. Many creators focus heavily on lighting, cameras, and editing but overlook how crucial sound is. Even if your audience doesn’t consciously notice poor audio, they’ll feel that something’s off—and it can make your content seem less professional overall. The truth is, nine times out of ten, the issue isn’t your camera or setup; it’s your sound.</p>
<p data-start="682" data-end="909"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5450/">Fortunately, fixing that doesn’t require a big budget. Right now, the DJI Mic Mini two-person vlog bundle is 41% off, bringing the price down from $169 to just $99.</a> That’s a $70 savings for a serious boost in quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5450/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2 data-start="682" data-end="909">Always Reliable Audio</h2>
<p data-start="911" data-end="1276">These compact wireless microphones are designed for creators who want great sound without bulky gear. Each mic weighs just 10 grams, making them ultra-light and discreet on camera. They clip on easily, look clean in your shots, and are comfortable to wear even during long recording sessions. Despite their small size, they deliver impressively rich, clear sound.</p>
<p data-start="1278" data-end="1621">One of the standout features is their maximum transmission range of 400 meters. That’s nearly a quarter mile. You can move freely while recording without worrying about losing signal or sound quality. Whether you’re filming casual vlogs, outdoor interviews, or travel content, this kind of range means flexibility and freedom of movement.</p>


<p data-start="1623" data-end="2138">The DJI Mic Mini system is built to handle noisy environments. Each mic includes pro-level noise cancellation with two adjustable intensity modes. The “Basic” setting is perfect for quiet indoor recordings, while “Strong” mode helps cut through background chatter or city noise when filming outside. Plus, an automatic volume limiter prevents distortion if the audio input spikes too high. That feature alone can save you a lot of frustration during post-production. No more clipped or unusable takes.</p>
<p data-start="2140" data-end="2416">Another great perk is compatibility. The DJI Mic Minis integrate smoothly with the DJI Osmo Audio ecosystem, pairing seamlessly with devices like the Osmo Action 5 Pro without needing a separate receiver. It’s plug-and-play simplicity, designed with creators in mind.</p>
<p data-start="2418" data-end="2646">Battery life is pretty great. Each transmitter and receiver can operate for up to 10 hours on a single charge, so you can record interviews, live streams, or full-day shoots without worrying about running out of juice. Combined with the included charging case, you can expect to have a total of 48 hours of life on a single charge.</p>

            <p>Pokémon Pokopia, the Animal Crossing meets Minecraft game with an anthropomorphised Ditto, now has a release date.</p>
<p>As revealed by Nintendo, the game is heading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> on 5th March next year. "Build a Pokémon paradise in Pokémon Pokopia," reads a post on social media. No further details have been provided.</p>
<p>However, it looks like the game will be released on a Game-Key Card, Nintendo's controversial physical media that still requires a download.</p>

<p>The company has released a new<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ldQYMwzWrY"> video explaining how to use Game-Key Cards</a>, which features Pokémon Pokopia as an example. The images do have "sample" over them, but from the inclusion of the game all over this video we can presume it's correct.</p>

<p>To recap, Game-Key Cards are physical cards for the Switch 2 that do not contain game data. Instead, they're used as a key to download the full game, meaning an internet connection is required and the game will take up more of the console's storage space. It's something game preservationists are rallying against, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-dev-comes-out-with-first-actually-good-reason-for-using-switch-2s-controversial-game-key-cards">some developers explaining why they're required</a> - performance, essentially.</p> <div>

<p>The spin-off was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ever-wanted-to-play-a-pokemon-animal-crossing-meets-minecraft-pokemon-pokopia-might-be-just-that-game">revealed back in September during a Nintendo Direct</a>, and is being developed by Koei Tecmo Games - previously responsible for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-quest-builders-2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a>.</p>
<p>Players will create their own Pokémon paradise, taking on the role of a Ditto who's morphed into a human-like appearance.</p>
<p>You'll collect materials, build furniture, grow vegetables, and create homes for Pokémon. You'll then be able to invite other players to visit your creation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Tetris has Tetrominos. Lumines has blocks. Tetris tasks you with forming lines. Lumines tasks you with forming larger blocks. They’re two sides of the same block-dropping coin, and while Tetris is instantly recognisable as one of the most iconic, generation-defining games of all time, Lumines can stake a claim to its own equally important place in history. In some ways, Lumines: Arise is the culmination of both these series.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lumines Arise - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwuqiVNs058?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developer Enhance, led by game design guru – and original Lumines creator – Tetsuya Mizuguchi, revolutionised the look and feel of playing Tetris in 2018’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/09/tetris-effect-review/">Tetris Effect</a>. The result of this fusion of Tetris’s classic block-based puzzle action with Mizuguchi’s penchant for wild, psychedelic visuals and thumping, visceral music was an unequivocal triumph, a bona fide masterpiece.</p>


<p>Lumines Arise takes the lessons learned from Tetris Effect and folds them back into Lumines’ framework, expanding on the series’ formula, bringing new life and energy with it, and in the process, crafting another genre-defining puzzle game.</p>
<p>Lumines is all about building up your score by repeatedly forming blocks of matching colour. These can start with a simple 2×2 square, expanding out for higher scores and bigger chain combos. You’re racing against the screen-wiping Time Line though, passing at different rates across the playfield depending on the level and the music. It lends Lumines, and in turn Lumines Arise, a frantic, heady pace, but one that you can zone in and out of, easing back at times before snatching once more at the high score leaderboard.</p>


<p>That alternating pace is changed up by each level, and it’s here that Lumines Arise has felt Tetris Effect’s influence most keenly. Visually, and aurally, Lumines Arise is one of the most incredible experiences in gaming. It’s an assault, a barrage, a blanket, a seabed, a keening wind, an astral vacuum, a tolling bell, a thumping nightclub, or a chopping board. It’s an experience that shifts and moves level by level, changing up the formation of the blocks themselves, while the visuals writhe and twist around you. It’s only heightened by the closed-circuit isolation of VR, and it’s one of the few games that will warrant dusting off your PSVR 2 for.</p>
<p>It’s hard to understand how the changing aspects of the blocks makes them feel different, but Enhance combine visuals, audio and haptic vibration with alarming precision to bring a different sensation to you through the game’s extensive Journey mode. Blocks may pulse, or move, or release tiny astronauts into your field of view when you combine them. They might be hard and delicate as glass, or as difficult to grasp as sound itself, but no matter what form they take, they are captivating.</p>
<p>On your first play through each of these levels, I’d recommend forgetting about your high score. That initial experience is, for one, too good to ignore, but it’s also a distraction at times, drawing you away from the core task you’re set on. Tetris Effect was much the same, catching you up in its synesthetic web, overwhelming your senses with beauty and musical drama, but in Lumines Arise that sensation feels stronger.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s because the block dropping here is broader and more organic than its brethren, or perhaps it’s because I’m happier to be led by Enhance’s psychedelic pipe. Lumines remains one of the most impactful puzzle games of my life – I still own my PSP, and both Lumines and Lumines II – and Lumines Arise takes everything that was special about the originals, and refines it down into something that feels like Mizuguchi’s opus. He was riffing with Tetris Effect, playing with someone else’s toys, but here he’s taking the next step with his own creation. Because of that, there’s a more personal touch, a deep-seated love and care that permeates the entire game.</p>
<p>Journey is the central mode, drawing together all of the levels into a form that feels like a concept album. The levels and tracks have been put together in such a way that you can feel the ebb and flow of intent, sweeping you along just as Enhance intend, and while you’re ranked and scored at the end of each section, it’s almost unnecessary, craving the next section simply to continue the journey. Chameleons rave, hands pull puppet strings attached to your blocks, and fresh fruit cascades across the screen as you chop it up. It feels nonsensical, but it’s also utterly human, utterly natural, delighting in the world around us, and making it feel fresh and new.</p>
<p>One of the key additions to the formula is Burst mode. Once charged and then unleashed, this gives you the chance to create one giant block while extraneous blocks flying off beyond the screen, and giving you the same rush of adrenaline that Tetris Effect’s Zone did. It’s good for both high score chasers, and those who need a list-ditch attempt to save their run, often clearing a good portion of the screen if you’re quick enough.</p>

<p>Once you’re done with Journey, there’s plenty to keep you coming back to Lumines Arise, from being able to form Playlists of your favourite levels and tracks to the Mission mode, which brings in a handy tutorial as well as a series of Challenges. These mix up the Lumines gameplay by messing with the rules, so the blocks might grow or change shape, the playfield might shrink, or you might have to dig or unleash some hidden secret by building blocks around the outside of the shape. It’s a fun aside, and hopefully one that Enhance will add to throughout the game’s life.</p>
<p>There’s also a suite of multiplayer modes, with both local and online options. From here you can attempt to move yourself up the online leaderboards, or go head-to-head to see just how good you are at making blocks. These come in both Ranked and Custom flavours, with Ranked mode awarding you with a steadily increasing battle rank if you win, and knocking you back down when you come across someone who’s infuriatingly better than you are, while Custom won’t have any consequences other than the enjoyment of knocking your best friend into next week. With blocks, obviously.</p>
<p>The only negative, if you can call it that, is that Lumines Arise isn’t quite as groundbreaking as Tetris Effect was. That feels unfair, when Tetris Effect essentially borrowed Lumines’ own schtick, but there is some familiarity that simply can’t be escaped. That doesn’t diminish its impact, nor its aspirations, but there is a level of euphoria that Lumines Arise doesn’t quite match because of it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/texas-attorney-general-sues-roblox-claims-it-put-%E2%80%9Cpixel-pedophiles-and-profits-over-the-safety-of-texas-children%E2%80%9D.1349818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Less than three months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/">state of Louisiana announced it would be filing a lawsuit</a> against Roblox, which claimed that the company "<em></em><em>permitted and perpetuated an online environment in which child predators thrive, directly contributing to the widespread victimization of minor children in Louisiana</em>," the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, has <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/Petition_0.pdf">filed his own lawsuit</a> against Roblox with similar allegations and similarly intense language, as Paxton alleges the company put "<em>pixel pedophiles and profits over</em> <em>the safety of Texas children</em>."</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-sues-roblox-putting-pixel-pedophiles-and-profits-over-safety-texas">press release</a> regarding the lawsuit, Paxton says, "<em>We cannot allow platforms like Roblox to continue operating as digital playgrounds for predators where the well-being of our kids is sacrificed on the altar of corporate greed. Roblox must do more to protect kids from sick and twisted freaks hiding behind a screen. Any corporation that enables child abuse will face the full and unrelenting force of the law</em>."</p>



<p>It's intense language, to say the least, and while Roblox Corporation would disagree with it and, in a statement to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roblox-must-do-more-to-protect-kids-from-sick-and-twisted-freaks-texas-attorney-general-says-as-he-sues-roblox-for-putting-pixel-pedophiles-and-profits-ahead-of-kids/">PC Gamer</a>, said Paxton's claims and lawsuit were "<em>based on misrepresentations and sensationalized claims</em>," there is no denying that Roblox has garnered a reputation for being a platform riddled with safety concerns for children.</p>



<p>We've seen <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">multiple reports</a> in recent years that have deeply investigated Roblox for its lack of child safety protocols. In 2024, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">Bloomberg reported</a> that in 2023, there were 13,000 incidents of child exploitation on the platform, with Roblox employees quoted in the report saying the company was "<em>on its back foot</em>" in the fight against child predators on the platform.  </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Investigation: How Roblox Is Exploiting Young Game Developers" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gXlauRB1EQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>People Make Games published two in-depth videos that explored issues of child predators on the platform and the issues of Roblox's dependence on user-created content and how little those creators actually see compared to the profits that Roblox Corporation rakes in.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Roblox Pressured Us to Delete Our Video. So We Dug Deeper." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTMF6xEiAaY?start=1030&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's worth noting that Roblox has <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/tech-talks-update-on-roblox-safety-initiatives">made several changes since both the above videos were published</a>, but there is a case to be made that those <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-adds-new-child-safety-measures-to-protect-pre-teens/">changes were implemented too late</a>, and it's also worth asking if the changes are actually doing enough to make it a safe platform for children.</p>



<p>It should also be noted that Louisiana and Texas aren't the only states in the US going after Roblox. <a href="https://www.ag.ky.gov/Press%20Release%20Attachments/2025.10.06%20-%20%5bFINAL%5d%20KY%20Roblox%20Complaint.pdf">Kentucky has a similar lawsuit filed</a> against the company, and <a href="https://x.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1980272803992809937">Florida has launched a criminal investigation</a> into Roblox.</p>



<p>Roblox, for its part, as stated earlier, calls the Texas attorney general's claims "<em>sensationalized</em>," and goes further to say that it is "<em>deeply committed to child safety</em>." </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lumines-arise-is-an-almost-perfect-zen-puzzle-game.1349815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18076140/tetris-effect-review-ps4-vr"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a>, designer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18047826/tetris-effect-tetsuya-mizuguchi-interview-ps4-vr">Tetsuya Mizuguchi</a> and his team at Enhance, Inc. managed to make something old feel new. There are few things as well defined in video games as the falling blocks of <em>Tetris</em>, and yet with the studio’s trademark immersive sound and visual design, the game was transformed into something else, with every element pushing you toward getting into the proverbial zone. Now the team has done the same thing with <em>Lumines</em>. And while the result isn’t quite as crisp as <em>Tetris Effect</em>, <em>Lumines Arise</em> is still one of the most absorbing puzzle games I’ve ever played.</p><p>If you haven’t played before, <em>Lumines</em> is sort of like a version of <em>Tetris</em> built around music. (In fact, it began life when Mizuguchi wanted to make a music-themed <em>Tetris</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/15/17465364/tetris-effect-preview-enhance-games-e3/">but was initially stymied by rights issues</a>.) 2x2 blocks fall from the top, each made up of a combination of two different colors, and the goal is to place these blocks so as to create solid-colored 2x2 blocks on the playing field, which will then be cleared from the screen. The twist is that the screen doesn’t clear automatically; instead, you wait for a “time line” to wipe across the playing field in sync with the music, which gives you a chance to build up combos of blocks to all be erased at once.</p><p><em>Lumines Arise</em> doesn’t change any of this core functionality, though it does add a new mechanic called “burst,” which lets you hold off on clearing the screen for longer, resulting in absurdly satisfying combos. Mainly it layers in visuals and sounds that are designed to create that zen-like state inherent to the best puzzle games. The main portion of the game is a mode called “journey” — there’s also multiplayer and some challenge stages — where you play through a series of themed levels, which jump around in style and tone.</p><p>If you’ve played a <em>Lumines</em> game before, you won’t be surprised to learn there is some great electronic music here, with levels filled with thumping beats augmented by lots of bright, flashy visuals. This stuff is great, though it’s not that far off from past <em>Lumines</em> titles. Where <em>Arise</em> gets interesting is when it becomes weird and surprising. In many instances, the blocks become other things, and they grow as you create matches. In one early stage, instead of blocks, you’re matching vegetables, so as you create bigger combos, giant tomatoes start to fill the screen. It’s playful and strange and just one of the many flavors in <em>Arise</em>. There’s an R&amp;B level set to the backdrop of a rainy Tokyo at night, a stage where you match jellyfish, and another where connecting spider eggs results in little hatchlings running over the screen. For <em>Tetris Effect</em> fans, there’s also a spiritual sequel to that game’s incredible jazz level.</p><p>For the most part, all of these audiovisual elements enhance what<em> Lumines</em> already is. Particularly if you’re playing with headphones on, which I heartily recommend, the effects can create an almost trance-like state as you focus on the mechanics of matching up blocks while the sounds and visuals wash over you. This led to me playing some of the best <em>Lumines</em> of my life. (I’m still terrible, though.) Often the effects in <em>Arise</em> are more dramatic and ambitious compared to <em>Tetris Effect</em>, which creates some really memorable moments, like when a giant holographic snake is nodding along to EDM beats while you fiddle with blocks.</p><p>Sometimes, though, these effects go just a touch too far and interfere with, instead of augment, the gameplay. In some of the levels the visuals become hard to parse, with colors or symbols that are a little too close to each other, making it easy to mix them up, particularly when you’re stressed out with a screen full of blocks. There are only a handful of stages like this, and it’s possible they’ll be adjusted in a future update, but right now they run counter to the mood<em> Arise</em> tries so hard to create. They take you out of the game instead of immersing you further in it.</p><p>Even with that issue, though, this remains the best version of <em>Lumines</em>. The core of the game is as good as ever and is infused with just the right amount of style to turn it into something that’s constantly shifting, all while helping you stay in the right headspace for high score chasing. <em>Lumines</em> might not be as iconic as <em>Tetris</em>, but <em>Arise</em> shows just how similar they can be.</p><p><sub>Lumines Arise <em>launches November 11th on the PS5 and PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/817997/lumines-arise-review-ps5-steam]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Made for Everyday Use</h2>
<p>It’s a tower computer, but without the bulk and noise of traditional options. It runs on an Intel Core Ultra 5-225 processor that is great for everyday tasks like browsing, streaming, work projects, plus some light creative work. There’s 16GB of DDR5 memory to keep everything running smoothly, even when you’re trying to be productive with a whole bunch of apps opened at the same time. It’s basically built for small workspaces, and Windows 11 support means better overall efficiency.</p>
<p>You’re also getting a 512GB M.2 SSD that takes care of both the boot times and storage.

              <p>Nintendo is airing a <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-spring-2026-2000625274"><em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></a> Direct this week. It will include the upcoming sequel’s first full trailer. I’m on the edge of my seat wondering how it will deal with Yoshi.</p> <p>The livestream will be available Wednesday, November 12, at 9:00 a.m. ET for the special Nintendo Direct. “Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation,” the company cautioned. Still, that gives us the rest of the day to wrap our minds around whichever new stars have been cast to bring the latest trip back to the Mushroom Kingdom to life.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, the trailer will likely reveal what Illumination and Nintendo have decided to do with Yoshi’s voice. The green dinosaur was teased at the end of the first <em>Mario Bros. Movie</em> with an egg breaking open in the sewers beneath Brooklyn, and has since been all but confirmed via promotional imagery <a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-yoshi-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-comes-from-a-box-of-cookie-dough-2000642406">for cookie dough</a>.</p>

 <p>But Yoshi is not like most <em>Mario Bros</em>. characters. He’s not humanoid and doesn’t talk in the games. He just shouts “Yoshi!” in an adorable buttercream voice that just melts your heart. That seems like the most obvious approach for the<em> Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, which will seemingly have something to do with the titular plumber and pals exploring new worlds in the stars.</p>

 <p>The alternative is that Yoshi talks and sounds human. Despite the horror, that seems like a non-zero possibility. I’m imagining something like Idris Elba’s version of Knuckles in the Sonic movies: a completely earnest delivery in a vaguely cockney accent that is at once both completely bizarre and yet somehow fitting. I would love for Nintendo and Illumination to really go for something wild here.</p> <p>Give us Nicholas Cage in the role of a lifetime. Even if it’s just him screaming “Yoshi!” every five minutes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Epic Games has denied that gambling mechanics are being added to Fortnite in user-created experiences, despite their own explanation confirming their addition.</p>



<p>Leaks first emerged to state that “gambling” was coming to UEFN, which was confirmed in the latest patch notes, but there appears to be some confusion about the clarification of “gambling” in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-epic-games-denies-gambling-added-to-fortnite">Epic Games Denies ‘Gambling’ Added to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New addition. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Epic Games approached Insider Gaming to request a correction to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-adding-gambling-in-future-update-leaks-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our article about the addition of “gambling” in Fortnite</a>, stating that gambling is against the Fortnite Developer Rules.</p>



<p>Section 1.11 of the Developer Rules states that developers cannot “implement gambling content, raffles, or casino-style games,” which are “prohibited whether or not they involve real money or virtual currency.”</p>



<p>Additionally, section 1.15.5 states that “teach or prominently feature images or activities that are typically associated with real-world gambling, casino-style games, or games of chance that offer a prize, even if they are not directly simulating a gambling experience, are not permitted in any form.”</p>



<p>Epic Games explained that, instead, the addition is for “paid random items” and that developers must “disclose the actual numerical odds of what the player may receive before the player makes a purchase.” However, Epic Games denies that gambling and paid random items are the same.</p>



<p>Despite Epic Games’ arguments, the above still constitutes gambling. Any paid-for item with a chance of a specific reward is still gambling, just as loot boxes in other titles qualify as gambling.</p>



<p>This is confirmed by legal action in countries like Belgium, where the Belgium Gaming Commission <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43906306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned loot boxes in 2018</a> and declared the content to be “in violation of gambling legislation.”</p>



<p>This article will be updated if Epic Games provides any further details on the addition.</p>

Though they look quite alike and both deal with some heavy themes, the specifics of Rue Valley help it stand apart.</p><p>The game tells the story of a man trapped in a timeloop where each reset changes who he will become and what he can do. Since players can bring their memories and knowledge with them across loops, you'll unlock new dialogue options and other interactions as the story unfolds.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9en2Xglvxr4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9en2Xglvxr4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>With each loop, the player-character can be quite unlike his past or future self, said the creative team, with him acting like a "cold-hearted loner in one loop and a melodramatic loudmouth in the next." But all the while, a central mystery and the personal lives of other characters become focal points, with the team exploring some of its more serious themes through these characters.</p><p>Rue Valley's way of grappling with mental health issues led the team at Emotion Spark Studio to collaborate with <a href="https://us.movember.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Movember</a>, a leading men's health charity, in hopes of promoting positive change in the lives of players and others.</p><p>“It was really important for us to craft an engaging yet poignant story highlighting the struggles many of us face every day” said Marko Smiljanić, creative director of Emotion Spark Studio. “We’re confident that it will resonate with people in a way that conveys that they’re heard, they’re seen, and they matter.”</p><p>Rue Valley is available now.</p>

The aim, he said, is for Digiphile to become the "best place for publishers," which he feels will ultimately allow it to "deliver the best content for our community."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Everything starts with curation. Each Digiphile collection is a limited-time event, made in collaboration with respected voices in each genre to create meaningful showcases that celebrate what’s worth playing right now," said Hill.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-says-destiny-2-has-underperformed-since-it-acquired-bungie" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony says Destiny 2 has underperformed since it acquired Bungie</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our partner-friendly rev share, reseller protections, and post-promotion community support provide a safer, smarter way to engage a new cohort of players well before they would have organically encountered these games, at a time when momentum matters most.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We’ve also built systems that fix long-standing issues in the bundle space, most notably The Digiphile Exchange, which ensures games reach real players instead of sitting unused. Players can trade in keys for games they already own and receive credit toward other titles featured in our collections. This keeps engagement high and key waste low, a necessity for publishers looking to secure more keys for future promotions."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Digiphile founders understand that 'growth doesn't always equal success'">Digiphile founders understand that 'growth doesn't always equal success'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That partner-friendly revenue share model will see publishers receive a fixed 75 percent cut of every sale—with an additional 5 percent set aside for charity. Hill said partners will receive 100 percent of revenue (minus processing fees) from sales of add-on content such as DLC.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Digiphile doesn’t have a persistent storefront, so each collection is, by design, a limited-time event, maximizing attention and impact while preserving the value of each title," he added.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The long-term goal is to remain independent while expanding the platform with a focus on nurturing communities. "Think Letterboxd meets Humble Bundle," says Hill. "We want to be a place where fans can meet up to share, discuss, and celebrate the things they care about."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/halo-infinite-to-receive-final-major-update-after-four-years" target="_self" data-discover="true">Halo Infinite to receive final major update after four years</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Crucially, Hill said the team won't chase "short term gains" and understands that success isn't purely about delivering growth hand over fist. "A smaller, more intentional approach builds trust with both players and partners. We don't mind doing fewer things if it means doing them well," he continued.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Digiphile's inaugural game collection, Return of the Immersive Sim, has been launched today in support of the Arbor Day Foundation.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Tomas Sala is a solo developer known for aerial combat game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-falconeer">The Falconeer</a> and sea-town building game Bulwark - projects that are large and ambitious undertakings for one person. Using AI to offload some of that creative load could be an attractive proposition for someone like him. But of all the people I've spoken to about AI, Sala has some of the strongest remarks to make against it.</p>
<p>That's not to say he's never used it. He has, as a tool for learning things - in his case asking questions about programming. He especially likes being able to talk to it in his native language Dutch. "It can be very beneficial," Sala tells me in a video call. "But as a creation tool," he adds, "it sucks balls."</p>
<p>Creating pictures with AI is like playing a slot machine, he says, by which I presume he means you're never sure what's going to come out. Mostly, Sala says, "AI looks like shit now or reads like shit." He knows it'll get better - that much seems inevitable - and that's the point in time that particularly worries him. "I'm not so much worried for me," he says. "I've already found my direction.<strong> </strong>I am mostly afraid - I have kids - for how we as a society deal with creativity; how we value creative people and creative creators, in the broad sense of the word. Makers."</p>

<p>Consider a Reddit post he came across last week written by a gaming enthusiast who's a fan of AI. This person wrote, according to Sala: "I can't wait till these filthy game development companies that take all our money and treat us like shit get replaced by AI, where we can just ask and have the game I want tailor-made for me as I play it." Or words to that effect. "That's the fantasy," Sala says - it's the belief AI can create anything we want.</p><p>"As a creator it is frightful that people would have such limited fantasies," Sala says in response. "It's a future where 'I just want to feel great - bump it into my brain'," he says. He likens it to recreational drug use which, he quips, "is probably cheaper than a ChatGTP subscription is going to be in a couple of years".</p>
<p>And the cost-warning is a good point: we are in the attachment phase now where big tech companies are trying to attach us to their AI services. Onboarding prices are attractive in the attempt to lure us in. But once we're there and we begin to rely on the AI services, prices will inevitably rise, and we'll probably pay because we won't want to do without it. Tangentially, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">see Microsoft's recent Xbox Game Pass price-hike</a> - it's a broadly similar thing.</p>

<p>"Hey kid," says Sala, voicing another issue he has with the Redditor's post, "do you really think the people that are fucking up gaming are not going to find a way to make money off your back and your AI, or whatever you're going to enjoy? Whatever is going to bring enjoyment, there will be people trying to make a buck and reducing it to the lowest common denominator." The App Store is a good example, he says. "That is ultimate monetisation without boundaries. Whatever this stuff is bringing," he goes on, "it's opening up so much darkness at the same time."</p><p>Sala tells me another story about worrying AI use, this time about a friend with a tech startup, who was approached by someone with one clear and unscrupulous idea: "I want to make the algorithm that makes the ultimate addictive online gambling experience," Sala's friend was told, as per Sala's recollection. "I want to do that with AI: learn from all the gamblers and then make it even more... Supercharge it."</p>
<p>"And that's the world we live in," Sala says. "That's what we're using AI for. We're not curing cancer. We're figuring out how to reduce people to emasculated puppets that get in line to get their shot. It's Soma - it's fucking Soma!" he says, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soma-review">referencing the superb horror game</a> from 2015. "That's what it is. It's sedation. That is my base fear."</p>
<p>I was speaking to Sala in light of him remastering his debut, breakout hit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-falconeer-review-i-love-that-we-live-in-a-world-where-theres-a-launch-title-like-this">The Falconeer, which I really liked when it launched alongside Xbox Series S/X</a>, and it sounds as though it's now significantly improved (and it's heavily discounted by way of a remaster promotion; note, original owners should get the update for free). And it's this approach with The Falconeer of considerable post-release development that has come to characterise <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-viral-hits-like-escape-from-duckov-and-megabonk-change-the-industry-falconeer-developer-tomas-sala-has-found-another-way-to-survive">Sala's approach to game-making in 2025</a>. Doubling-down on nurturing and growing communities around his work is his way of surviving in an increasingly viral-hit-driven market. He seems happier, his audience is happier because it's playing better, constantly evolving games, and Sala has a more reliable safety net around him, from their support, because of it.</p>
<p>Incidentally, he's also soon to begin work on a third game in the Ursee trilogy called Ancient Waves - a shipping-focused take on that same stormy archipelago world.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">plagiarism scandal</a> and an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">indefinite delay</a> earlier this year, Bungie's corporate overlords Sony have reiterated again that extraction shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> is still aiming to release by March next year. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s struggles have seen the parent corp flatly admit that game's not doing as well as Sony imagined when they bought Bungie.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>During an <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20251111/SzQTgsRB/202603_2q_02_en/index.html">earnings call</a> as part of the company's latest financial results, Sony CFO Lin Tao responded to a question about Marathon by declaring that they are "fully dedicated to launching the title as scheduled". That schedule being by the end of this financial year, which concludes at the end of March 2026. Tao's words aren't that surprising, given they've been the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-confident-marathon-will-release-by-march-2026-and-that-their-live-service-transition-is-paying-off">company line</a> throughout this year.
</p>
<p>However, back in August, Tao did mention that Bungie hoped to be able to stick a fresh release date on the game at some point this autumn. We're by no means out of that window yet and things could change any day now, but as of writing no new date's been forthcoming and winter beckons. To be fair, Tao revealed that Bungie are still "in the process of analysing Marathon's performance in terms of gameplay and retention during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-shows-signs-of-life-with-a-closed-network-test-scheduled-for-later-this-month">October's technical test</a>, with tweaks to be made "as needed".</p>
<p>Things being pretty quiet on the Marathon front <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-seek-to-reassure-everyone-that-marathon-is-still-alive-by-saying-almost-nothing-about-it">isn't unusual at this point</a>, but questions'll only intensify if it keeps inching closer to March without that new date.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, these financial results revealed that Sony's accountants have had to record an impairment charge which indicates that Bungie's current value is about 31.5 billion yen (about £155 million/$204 million) less than the number the corp would like it to be. That underperformance relative to what was envisioned by Sony when they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sonys-purchase-of-bungie-is-now-complete">bought the studio</a> is being dumped firmly at Destiny 2's door, with Tao saying that "partially due to the changes in the competitive environment, the level of sales and user engagement have not reached the expectations we had". As a result, profits have been cut into and corporate frowny faces abound, though Tao did declare that the companies "will continue to make improvements". Hopefully that doesn't just mean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">more layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>Here's also hoping Marathon can avoid a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">Concord-esque fate</a> whenever it fully breaks cover.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-airpods-4-suddenly-drop-to-almost-free-early-black-friday-strategy-or-just-a-clearance-move.1349758/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re still a couple weeks shy of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. While you can expect to find lots of deals over that late-November weekend across consumer tech and pretty every every other category of products, that doesn’t mean you can’t find any lucrative deals right now. The Apple AirPods 4 are just over a year old and are now seeing a pretty significant discount. It’s a great time to pick up a pair if you’ve been holding out. The base model of Apple’s versatile earbuds released at the price of $129. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/">Right now, Amazon has them for 34% off, brining the price to just $85. You’ll end up saving yourself a good $44</a>. If you want to upgrade to the model with support for active noise cancellation, you can expect a 16% discount. That pair normally goes for $179, but the deal ends up shaving off $30 so you only have to pay $149 for a limited time.</p>
<p>AirPods have been around for a while now with Apple adding in some incremental improvements with each generation. The latest version in the Apple AirPods 4 feature a refined contour with a shorter stem and quick-press controls for music. Apple put a lot of focus on all-day comfort this time around.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Isolate Sound</h2>
<p>You can expect better sound quality when it comes to calls all thanks to the new H2 chipset Apple designed. The new chip enables voice isolation to remove background noises. Folks on the other end of the call will be hearing you and only you, even if you’re in a crowded, noisy environment. The AirPods are able to eliminate sounds coming from around you so you come across perfectly clear.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can expect to better audio quality on your end because of the H2 chip. the new acoustic architecture is designed for crystal clear highs and deep bass.</p>



<p>A nice little addition to the AirPods feature set is how the buds interact with Apple’s voice assistant. Sire can now interpret basic gestures such as nodding yes or shaking your head no as a response to question. Not sure which seems weirder though for someone sitting across from you on the subway. You doing that, or you just blankly saying “Yes” or “No” allowed to no one in particular.</p>
<p>Something you can see different between the AirPods 4 and the previous model right away in a side-by-side is Apple has finally done away with the proprietary Lightning port. The case for the AirPods now charge using the now standard USB-C which is a welcome change indeed.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-is-%E2%80%98only-in-the-middle-of-the-journey%E2%80%99-says-sony.1349755/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao has said that Sony believes the PlayStation 5 is only at the midpoint of its journey.</p>



<div><p>The quote came from Sony’s latest quarterly earnings call, where Sony CFO Line Tao revealed that the PlayStation 5 is currently only in the middle of its lifecycle. Tao said,</p><p>“Our view is that compared to conventional console lifecycles. Looking at the PS4 lifecycle, it seems to be getting longer and longer. Especially the PS4, which was launched in 2013, and it’s been over a decade since then, but there are many active users enjoying the console… So from that perspective, we believe that the PS5 is only in the middle of the journey, and we are really planning to expand it even further.”</p></div>







<h2 id="h-so-when-will-the-ps6-release">So, When Will The PS6 Release?</h2>



<p>Well, Tao’s comments are not actually suggesting that the PlayStation 6 is another five years away, instead, she’s suggesting that the console generation of the PlayStation 5 will bleed through during the PS5. Just like with the current generation with the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, we’re now only just seeing developers move away from the PS4 with its games.</p>



<p>So, in theory at least, the PlayStation 6 is scheduled to release likely in 2027 – 2028, with the PlayStation 5 continuing to be supported to around 2031 – 2032.</p>



<p>The support for the ‘past generation’ is simply because of economics, allowing developers to release on a much bigger market than they would if they just developed games for the latest generation. For instance, on PlayStation 6’s launch, which could sell 10-15 million units in its first year, it’s not an ideal market to solely release a game on. Instead, it’s much better to release on the PlayStation 6 (10-15 million units), plus the PlayStation 5 (likely 100 million units+ by 2027).</p>



<p>It’s why popular games such as Call of Duty still remain on past-generation consoles, simply because the platform still has a large number of players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is bringing a host of new adventures into the fray, but the mysterious Worlds Collide mode has raised questions among the community.</p>



<p>First emerging as a query following the start of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-preload-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preloads for Black Ops 7 becoming</a> available, a download option for Worlds Collide was confusing, as it wasn’t abundantly clear what the download was for—unlike the options for Zombies and multiplayer, which are self-explanatory.</p>



<p>Fear not, though, as the answer is out there, and we’ve got all the details you need for Worlds Collide in Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-worlds-collide-in-black-ops-7">What is Worlds Collide in Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New adventure. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Worlds Collide is the name for the Campaign in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and specifically refers to the endgame mode available once the campaign is completed.</strong></p>



<p>Black Ops 7 features co-op with up to four players throughout the campaign, with a huge focus on replayability in the post-game when the main story is completed.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-endgame-multiplayer-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed by Activision</a>, the endgame mode is a new and shared experience “where the narrative continues to unfold.” It takes place on the Avalon map, with POIs from across Black Ops history, featuring discoverable intel, expansive skill tracks, and more.</p>



<p>Detailed in the Call of Duty blog, the endgame mode takes place after the conclusion of the 11 co-op campaign missions that make up the game’s story, and tasks players with exploring Avalon to find The Guild’s remaining Command Centers, while battling with exposure zones that are leaking a mysterious toxin into the city.</p>



<p>The area is expected to be the best place to grind for the exclusive campaign camos that are available for weapons in Black Ops 7, for the first time, which adds to the camos available in multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-worlds-collide-pvp-or-pve">Is Worlds Collide PvP or PvE?</h2>



<p><strong>Unlike Warzone, the Worlds Collide endgame mode is an entirely PvE operation, and there is no combat against other players.</strong></p>



<p>The mode is designed for one-to-32 players in squads of up to four, where players can choose to tackle smaller objectives individually in their squad, or combine with other squads to take down more difficult objectives.</p>



<p>Different areas of Avalon have different recommended Combat Ratings, providing varying degrees of challenge for players, but there are no PvP offerings available.</p>
