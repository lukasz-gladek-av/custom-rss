            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sega and developer Sports Interactive have announced&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26</em>, the next iteration in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>series of management sims.</p>

<p>The game was revealed earlier today via a new trailer titled "Guess Who's Back", in which we get to see some footage of the Premier League trophy, as well as several players who will presumably be included in the game.</p>

<p>The trailer is pretty short, so we don't get to learn much about&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26</em>&nbsp;by its conclusion, but the game's very existence will likely be enough to get&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>fans excited, albeit tentatively given the franchise's recent history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-26-announced-premier-league.jpg?itok=D0iJeLqz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-26-announced-premier-league.jpg?itok=tSJ1whnr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Football Manager 26&nbsp;</em>is officially going ahead.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Football Manager 26&nbsp;</em>exists largely thanks to the fact that&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>doesn't, at least in its current form.</p>

<p>Back in June last year,&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-dev-update" rel="nofollow">was unveiled</a>, but it was met with immediate consternation from fans regarding some of the features Sega would remove, which included the Create-a-Club system, as well as Touchline Shouts and other more minor systems.</p>

<p>Initially, <i>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</i>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-release-date" rel="nofollow">set to launch in November</a> last year, but it was subsequently delayed following what Sports Interactive referred to as a "difficult development cycle". This drew further fan ire, since the delay would potentially mean that the game would miss the league window, which would make newer rosters and transfers irrelevant.</p>

<p>Following that, and the news that&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 24&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-24-data-update-2024-25" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be getting a data update</a> ahead of the&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>release, Sega eventually made the call to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled" rel="nofollow">cancel&nbsp;<em>FM25&nbsp;</em>altogether</a>, instead choosing to focus on its successor.</p>




<p>We'll likely learn more about&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26&nbsp;</em>in the coming weeks, including a first look at its gameplay and (hopefully!) a timely release date as well. For now, you can keep your eyes glued to the game's <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a> for further updates.</p>

              <p>The second-best thing about being a <i>Mario </i>fan is that bad <i>Mario </i>games are exceedingly rare. But the first best thing about being a <i>Mario </i>fan is that <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> exists. Whew, what a damn game. It’s a franchise entry that manages to be both wondrously inventive and comfortably familiar, setting the bar almost insurmountably high for any platformer that dares to follow it over the next few decades.</p> <p>As of right now, <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> remains my favorite platformer of all time—and if you’ve played it, there’s a reasonably high chance you already agree. If not, however, you may be looking to see what our favorite plumber’s most ambitious game is all about. And with that comes curiosity about how long it may take to see things through. Well, I’ve got some good news for you: It’s beefy! Let’s take a look at just <i>how</i> beefy. But first, let’s talk about whether or not you can expect a better experience on the newer Switch 2.</p>  <p>We have great news for you if you’re hoping to enjoy <i>Odyssey </i>on the Switch 2. Via a free update for the Switch 2, <i>Odyssey</i> has never looked better. In its original presentation on the first Switch, handheld mode perhaps suffered the worst, with an incredibly low resolution that made for a rough image at times. The stronger hardware of the Switch 2 combined with the new update makes for a dramatically better experience. The framerate is also more reliable in the game’s busier, open-world city environments. Take a look at the game in motion here:</p>

You won’t need to collect all 999 Power Moons or every purple coin in each world to complete <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i>, but it’s all there for you to chase down if you want to. <b>For a basic run-through, though, you’ll only need around 12-14 hours</b>.</p> <p>If you’re like me and need to earn every costume in the game (they’re all awesome) and see that Power Moon counter hit one number below a thousand, you’ve got a whole lot more game to see. <b>Fully completing </b><b><i>Super Mario Odyssey</i></b><b> can take upwards of 40 hours</b>—perhaps even longer for those who take things at a leisurely pace or struggle with some of its more challenging sequences.</p> <p>Whether you just want to check it out casually or take things all the way to 100%, you need to check out <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> right away. I give it my highest recommendation. And you can trust me. My dad works at Nintendo.</p> <hr> <p><i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> is available now on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

              <p>Oh, thank goodness! <em>Alien: Earth</em>, Disney’s megabucks TV series set just before the events of the original&nbsp;<em>Alien</em> movie, is just brilliant. Showrunner, writer, and director Noah Hawley has created something truly special: a show that feels utterly built from the DNA of Ridley Scott’s earliest vision, but with the non-stop thrills of James Cameron’s <em>Aliens</em> sequel. And crucially, unlike every other film in the franchise since the first two, it remembers that this is a story about the hearts of the characters, rather than just the events happening to them. Here are my thoughts on the first two episodes.</p> <p><em>Alien: Earth</em> makes a very interesting opening decision. You might think, given how the&nbsp;<em>Alien&nbsp;</em>sequels have all flailed under comparisons to the first two films, that Hawley would want to immediately put his own stamp on the show. The creator of the extraordinary TV series <em>Fargo</em> and <em>Legion</em> has a distinct approach, so surely the smart move is to hit that hard as we begin? But no, a far braver choice is made. The opening few minutes of&nbsp;<em>Alien: Earth</em> are an astonishing recreation of Scott’s style, complete with a cynical and tired crew bantering around a table, sniping, mocking, talking over one another. Tensions and relationships are instantly established for the beleaguered crew you already know are about to die as their research vessel containing multiple alien specimens crash-lands onto Earth. It all looks and breathes like a perfect piece of 1970s science fiction. And in achieving this, the show immediately feels <em>right</em>. This is the&nbsp;<em>Alien</em> we love, not the weirdly incongruous blandness of <i>Covenant</i> or the dreadful misfires of <em>Alien 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alien Resurrection</em>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617445"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617445">© FX / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is then put into stark contrast by the events on Earth. While the crashing ship, the Maginot, is owned and operated by the Weyland-Yutani corporation, it crashes into a towering city owned by another company called Prodigy. Because, as we learn in the show’s opening banter on board the ship, the Earth in 2120 is controlled by four corporations, and it’s soon to be five. We learn that Weyland-Yutani owns North and South America, but we’re yet to be told about the rest–although we’re quickly introduced to the new force to be reckoned with, Prodigy. Created by the youngest-ever trillionaire, Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin), Prodigy owns at least a large city in New Siam and vast research island, and is about to make a major breakthrough regarding synthetics–the androids with the gooey white blood from those first films. Kavalier has developed a way to transfer the consciousness from pre-teen children into the bodies of synths, and as we join the facility on Neverland Island, Kavalier is preparing to try it for the first time, moving the mind of terminal cancer patient Marcy Hermit (Florence Bensberg) into an adult synth body, where she renames herself Wendy (Sydney Chandler).</p>

 <p>And yes, let’s pause to address all this Peter Pan business. Eeehhh, this TV show is about as close to perfect as you could hope for, but if I had to pick at something, it’d be this. It’s wildly heavy-handed (indeed, all the names are pretty painfully on-the-nose–“Kavalier” for our move-fast-break-things trillionaire, “Hermit” for our girl about to be moved into a new shell…), to the point where clips of the Disney cartoon are repeatedly shown and we even get Kavalier reading out loud from the book. She’s Wendy, it’s Neverland… good grief, we get it. They’re children who get to live forever, I guess? Except, of course, the point of the book is they stay children, but here they’re intended to mature into adults. It feels deeply cumbersome. But honestly, that’s my only complaint.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617447" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617447"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617447">© FX / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Prodigy rapidly moves ahead with transferring a bunch of dying kids into adult bodies, all now living under the mentorship of more traditional synthetic Kirsh (Timothy Olyphant), moments before the Maginot crashes into the base of two skyscrapers in Prodigy City. A search and rescue team of Prodigy employees is instantly dispatched, including a medic who happens to be Joe Hermit (Alex Lawther), brother to Wendy. And, of course, the alien specimens got out.</p> <p>What follows is a lot of extremely good, proper&nbsp;<em>Alien</em> business, or terrified humans with guns moving through dimly lit corridors that very probably contain monsters. It’s especially enjoyable here because so much is completely unknown. We know the Maginot was carrying Xenomorphs at many phases, from egg to Facehugger to full-grown Xenomorph XX121s, but we’re also aware there’s some fucking eyeball-with-tentacles thing in there, along with various other alien species we’ve never seen before. And while we’re left in no doubt that the Xeno is still the worst of the bunch, none of them seems vaguely friendly.</p>

 <p>But this is elevated by the show’s central, most abhorrent and chilling aspect: some super-rich 20-something just put a bunch of 10 to 12-year-olds’ minds into super-powered adult bodies, and then sent them into danger.</p>  <p>The body-swap between child and adult is a beloved formula, and almost always played for laughs. From&nbsp;<em>Big</em> to&nbsp;<em>Freaky Friday</em>, the notion is wrung for humor (even if you do get something as deeply troubling as <em>Big</em>‘s 13-year-old boy losing his virginity to an adult woman). So when you first see Marcy become Wendy, there’s that jovial sense to it. Firstly, she’s not going to die as a just-turned-12-year-old any more, and that’s wonderful, but also you’ve got an adult actor acting like a kid. At one point she grabs her boobs and declares how <em>weird</em> they are, how they move around while she’s running. The program is very clearly playing with those body-swap tropes, telling us how jolly this all is. After a bunch of the kids have been put into the adult synth bodies, there’s a wonderful scene in which they’re all sitting around chatting in a common area, a room of adult actors moving and talking like children. Jonathan Ajayi especially shines at this, his leg movements incredibly familiar for anyone with a kid with ADHD, but it’s all delivered without pantomime. It feels wrong, because body-swaps always feel wrong, but we’re being told how right it is throughout.</p>

 <p>But it’s so wrong! This isn’t being done with families around them, or friends from their previous lives, and they certainly don’t have appropriate adult supervision or counselling. They’re experiments, their former terminal diagnoses and separation from their families clearly designed to make them disposable should something go wrong. Wendy’s compulsion to find her older brother once more seems to test the adults, unsure whether to prevent it for the project’s secrecy, but ultimately driven to let it play out purely for the test results. It’s grotesquely mercenary, and the second episode switches to endlessly reminding us of this, as we see these adult shells acting like utterly terrified kids in the face of alien danger.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617448"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617448">© FX / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Almost everything is shot perfectly. In fact, <em>Alien: Earth</em> feels like the final obliteration of any difference between film and television, its massive-budget movie quality and ultra-widescreen format giving it the sense of being cinematic at all times. The only sop to traditional television at any point is a peculiar flashback to Marcy’s childhood, which sticks out like a sore thumb among the rest of the format. It would be incredible to be able to go watch these weekly episodes on the big screen, and god knows, movie theaters could use the custom.</p>

 <p>What’s also so exciting is to think where this program could be going next. The claustrophobic events in the ruined ship and destroyed apartments make up most of the second episode, but clearly this is soon to head outside. There’s surely no chance of containing this incident, and it’s going to be extraordinary to see how the corporations address the outbreak. The other aspect to think about is the words from the first episode’s opening text.</p> <p>In the future, the race for immortality will come in 3 guises:</p> <blockquote><p>Cybernetically enhanced humans:&nbsp;<em>Cyborgs</em></p> <p>Artificially intelligent beings:&nbsp;<em>Synths</em></p> <p>and</p> <p>Synthetic beings downloaded with human consciousness:&nbsp;<em>Hybrids</em></p></blockquote> <p>While the program has already featured all three, and we see the terrifying capabilities of Weyland-Yutani cyborg Morrow (Babou Ceesay), there’s yet to be any sense of how the various corporations are looking to ensure their creations become the dominant force. It’s surely to come.</p> <p>In&nbsp;<em>Alien: Earth</em>, Hawley et al have done something that seemed so impossible for the last 40 years–combine the terror of <em>Alien</em> and the thrill of&nbsp;<em>Aliens</em>, while keeping humans as the focus of the story. Not even Ridley Scott could come close in his two glum prequels. But in FX’s TV show, it’s all there, with an amazing eight more hours of it to come.</p>

<p>The start date and times for the Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Beta are vital if you want more action. The first beta destroyed all expectations, literally, on its debut, so let’s check out the Week 2 Beta and all-new content included.</p>



<p>Well, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-impressions-battlefield-is-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 beta</a> has been worth the wait. EA and Battlefield Studios have put their blood, sweat, and explosions into BF6. The first week of the beta blew up in more ways than one by bringing in over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 players</a>—destroying CoD’s all-time Steam peak.</p>



<p>We’re not done yet, though. The Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Beta is back and bigger and better than before. This hub has everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-week-2-beta-start-amp-end-dates">Battlefield 6 Week 2 Beta Start &amp; End Dates</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We are so back, again. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 beta starts on August 14 and wraps up on August 17.</strong></p>



<p>You get nearly 100 hours of pure bombastic Battlefield 6 action if you want it. The open beta might be the final chance you get to play <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> before launch.</p>



<p>Battlefield Labs can be considered the game’s alpha period. This makes August a definitive beta test. With only a couple of months to go until the official Battlefield 6 release, I’d advise you to make the most of the Week 2 Beta.</p>



<p>See you on the Battlefield—revive me if you see me! </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-week-2-beta-start-times">Battlefield 6 Week 2 Beta Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>It’s confirmed that the Weekend Two Battlefield 6 Beta starts at 08:00 UTC—the same as Week One.</strong></p>



<p>I’ve already extensively covered the nature of Battlefield 6’s Week Two beta and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when you can play it again in a separate guide</a>. It includes more specific regions and time zones to help you out.</p>



<p>But yes, it’s the same start and end times as the first BF6 open beta. This should make your life a lot easier.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-battlefield-6-weekend-2-beta">How to Play Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Beta</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More maps to break. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You need to have played Battlefield Labs, be an EA Play Pro member, or use the Battlefield 6 website to gain access to the Week 2 Beta.</strong></p>



<p>One of the most commonly asked questions about the BF6 beta is about how you can take part. Many mistakenly believe you need to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-have-to-pre-order-battlefield-6-to-play-the-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order Battlefield 6 to play the open beta</a>. This is simply not the case.</p>



<p>The easiest of these solutions is using the BF6 site. Let me walk you through the instructions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6 website.</a></li>



<li>Click on ‘Download Now’ on the starting screen.</li>



<li>Press ‘Select Platform’</li>



<li>Choose the platform you want to play the beta on.</li>



<li>It will take you to the format’s storefront.</li>



<li>Purchase the free beta.</li>



<li>Download the Battlefield 6 open beta on your console or computer.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-6-weekend-2-new-content">All Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 New Content</h2>



<p><strong>Week 2 introduces the new Empire State map and new game modes, including Rush.</strong></p>



<p>The first thing to note is that all content from Week 1 is back! Siege of Cairo, Liberation Peak, Breakthrough, etc, are all here for you to enjoy. The second week could have left it there, but Battlefield Studios has thrown more toys in the playbox.</p>



<p>Check out each <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-gets-new-map-and-modes-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new map and mode</a> in Week 2.</p>

<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl was one of my favorite games of 2024. It was plagued by a pretty rocky launch, disrupted by bugs and performance issues, but I was one of those able to look beyond and see the utter gem of a game underneath. In the (almost) year that has followed the launch of STALKER 2, developer GSC Game World has worked tirelessly to improve it.</p>



<p>Recently, the team at GSC posted a new STALKER 2 2025 roadmap, uncovering everything coming to the irradiated open-world title in the coming months.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525350789598676383?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GSC Game World revealed</a> that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl will get an engine update soon, porting the game to Unreal Engine 5.5.4 to further improve optimization. This will go hand-in-hand with launching ‘phase two’ of the Zone Kit, allowing for better modding with enhanced audio and narrative tools.</p>



<p>Beyond that, <strong>stacks </strong>of changes are coming to STALKER 2 with the 2025 roadmap:</p>



<ul>
<li>New anomalies</li>



<li><strong>New missions ‘from old and new friends’</strong></li>



<li>New weather scenario</li>



<li><strong>Master difficulty preset</strong></li>



<li>Extended day/night cycle</li>



<li><strong>Stashes loot rework</strong></li>



<li>Stamina and energy drinks rework</li>



<li><strong>Immersive display mode</strong></li>



<li>Player equipment UI update</li>



<li><strong>Local save backup restoration</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Not only that, but a special ‘Discord Holiday Event’ has been teased by the team.</p>







<h2 id="h-stalker-2-ps5-launch-coming-soon">STALKER 2 PS5 Launch Coming Soon</h2>



<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is set to be released on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro this year. The latter launch will bring further upgrades and enhancements to the game, leaning on the computing power of Sony’s enthusiast console.</p>



<p>For now, the game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-announced-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to PlayStation 5</a> in Q4 2025, which is in the coming months. It’ll likely receive a solid release date at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony, given that the game is playable on PlayStation 5 Pro during the event.</p>



<p>GSC capped off the STALKER 2 2025 roadmap by stating: ‘Mission targets may be moved from 2025 to later dates in case of Zone instability.’</p>

Now, Battlefield Studios has explained the reasoning behind only offering smaller-size maps so far in the beta test and promising that, yes, bigger maps exist and are coming.</p><p>"Speed is a factor of map size. We picked these maps to make sure we hit the full-octane version of Battlefield on the head--and made everyone see we can handle that too," <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1954994293934055475" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">producer David Sirland said</a>. "Large maps exist, and the tempo scales accordingly--you'll be able to see soon enough!"</p>

<p>Battlefield 2042, meanwhile, was criticized by some for having maps that were too big.</p><p>Battlefield 6 will have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-maps/2900-6834/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6834">nine maps at launch</a>, including a <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Operation_Firestorm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remake of the beloved Operation Firestorm map from Battlefield 3.</a> The game will be supported after launch with even more maps as part of its live-service approach.</p><p>For Battlefield 6's second weekend of open beta, Battlefield Studios is adding a new map, Empire State, and the Rush and Squad Deathmatch modes, among other new things. The open beta is free and available to everyone on all platforms.</p><p>Battlefield Studios has said part of the reason why it's holding a beta test in the first place is to gather feedback to help make the game better at launch. In addition to feedback around map sizes, the developer is aware of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-are-looking-into-unexpectedly-fast-time-to-kill-reports-from-open-beta/1100-6533890/" data-ref-id="1100-6533890">"unexpectedly fast" time-to-kill reports</a> and imperfect <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-are-adjusting-helicopter-controls-after-first-beta/1100-6533888/" data-ref-id="1100-6533888">helicopter controls.</a></p><p>Battlefield 6 will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on October 10.</p>

Xbox VP of marketing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1mosnir/aaron_greenberg_grounded_2_already_has_over_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Aaron Greenberg said on Twitter</a> that it already has 3 million players, just two weeks after its July 29 release.</p><p>Grounded 2 is Obsidian's follow-up to the original Grounded, which launched in 2022. Like the original, you play as one of four plucky teens who find themselves shrunk down and left to fend for themselves in the vast wilderness of ordinary suburbia. Ordinary bugs like mites, ants, and spiders become larger-than-life threats.</p><p>While the first game took place in a back yard, a la Honey I Shrunk The Kids, the sequel takes place in a public park. Alongside a host of quality-of-life features and an original story, the sequel's biggest new addition is rideable mounts. If you've ever wanted to treat a fire ant like your royal steed, here you go.</p><p>We had a good early sense that Grounded 2 was destined to be a hit, since it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grounded-2-tops-original-games-steam-peak-concurrent-players-record-within-an-hour/1100-6533532/" data-ref-id="1100-6533532">beat the original game's concurrent Steam player count</a> within the first hour of release. And since that's Steam, it doesn't even count Xbox players, which surely makes up a significant chunk of the player count since it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-8-more-games-soon-including-multiple-day-one-new-releases/2900-6766/#9" data-ref-id="2900-6766">included with Game Pass</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"Because of its stronger starting point, Grounded 2 should wind up the bigger, better, buggier-in-a-good-way survival game," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grounded-2-review-little-big-planet/1900-6418390/" data-ref-id="1900-6418390">Grounded 2 review-in-progress</a>. "Its best new toys make survival gameplay much smoother and more enjoyable; the adolescent spirit that truly makes Grounded stand out in a sea of survival games is still on full display here, too. It will take some time for Creative mode to catch up and eventually surpass what the first game did for those who like to play this game more like an interior decorator than a hunter-gatherer. All of that means Grounded 2 is a good early-access game that improves on its previous version in some big ways, while still earning the label of being an in-progress experience."</p>

"Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at ensuring success on a meaningful scale. The release date has been internally confirmed for Q1 2026.

		<p>The latest addition to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> library of retro games has arrived, with 2005/6 GameCube game Chibi-Robo! available to subscribers from 21st August, but playable exclusively on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chibi-Robo! - GameCube – Nintendo Classics" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BjP6uQflzMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Chibi-Robo’s just this little metal chap who wants to make people happy. At just 10cm tall, Chibi-Robo arrives at the Sanderson house and looks to help them find happiness, helping out however he can. That could be clearning up or finding lost items. You’ll run around completing tasks, but Chibi-Robo has a power cord for a tail, which is thankfully compatible with the local electrical sockets and power grid to charge up!</p>
<p>The Switch Online GameCube library now includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</li>
<li>SoulCalibur 2</li>
<li>F-Zero GX</li>
<li>Super Mario Strikers</li>
<li>Chibi-Robo! (from 21st August)</li>
</ul>
<p>With previously teased titles including for future updates including</p>
<ul>
<li>Super Mario Sunshine</li>
<li>Fire Emblem Path of Radiance</li>
<li>Pokémon XD Gale of Darkness</li>
<li>Luigi’s Mansion</li>
<li>Pokémon Colosseum</li>
</ul>
<p>Following Chibi-Robo’s GameCube debut, the little robot that could had a handful of sequels and spin-offs on handheld, culminating in the 3DS game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/10/12/chibi-robo-zip-lash-review/">Chibi-Robo Zip Lash</a> in 2015, developed with Skip in collaboration with Vanpool. Sadly, Skip went defunct in 2020, so while we might see Chibi-Robo return in another adventure in future, it won’t be with the original studio. That said, a number of former devs started Tiny Wonder Studio in 2024, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFlQ2QdZxA">announcing their first project, koROBO</a> in July of last year, which certainly looks like a spiritual successor to this GameCube original.</p>

			<p>Strauss Zelnick, chief executive officer of Take-Two Interactive, is once again doing his best to project confidence that Grand Theft Auto VI will not be delayed from its current release date.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC5BVh0IaOg&amp;t=269s">CNBC</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-boss-talks-possibility-of-another-delay-and-teases-multiple-other-rockstar-games/1100-6533875/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">GameSpot</a>), on the subject of Grand Theft Auto VI hitting its currently stated release date, Zelnick said, "<em>My level of conviction is very, very high, obviously.</em> <em>Rockstar does have a lot of other things going on, but this is of course the primary focus</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Take-Two Interactive CEO on Q2 earnings, gamer growth and GTA 6" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XC5BVh0IaOg?start=269&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Prior to Grand Theft Auto VI getting delayed out of 2025 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Rockstar announcing its May 26, 2026 release date</a>, Zelnick did his best on multiple occasions to publicly express confidence in Rockstar hitting its <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-march-2025/">2025 release window for Grand Theft Auto VI</a>. To be fair, there was no specific release date at the time, just a month and a year, meaning that Rockstar could be a little more loose with when exactly GTA VI would arrive. And this game is such a major release that you'd think Rockstar and Take-Two wouldn't call their shot so specifically if they weren't confident they would make it.</p>



<p>But the number of times Zelnick seemed to have a "<em>very high"</em> level of conviction that GTA VI wouldn't miss its 2025 window does make comments like this that much more difficult to believe. </p>



<p>Sure, it's been over a decade since Grand Theft Auto V came out, and while it was being worked on in some capacity in that time, Rockstar has been focusing on <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-development-on-grand-theft-auto-vi-only-began-in-earnest-in-2020/">GTA VI's development "<em>in earnest</em>" since 2020</a>. Zelnick also <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-to-2026-was-important-for-allowing-rockstar-to-seek-perfection-says-take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick/">previously called the delay to 2026 "<em>important</em>" </a>to ensure that Rockstar had the chance to "<em>seek perfection</em>" with this release.</p>



<p>But even Zelnick cushioned his comments to CNBC to say that he and Take-Two are trying not to "<em>pump expectations</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We try not to pump expectations. Rockstar's whole stock and trade is to have these extraordinary expectations and still beat them. I know that's their goal. I know it's going to be an amazing game</em>," said Zelnick.</p>



<p>We'll see how things look in six to seven months from now, when we're on the doorstep to its current May 26, 2026, release date. Hopefully by that time we'll have a clear idea if Zelnick was right to express confidence here. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the next GameCube game to join its Switch Online library, and it's none other than much-loved mid-2000s 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!</em>.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer, Skip Ltd and Nintendo's game will be added to Switch Online next week. It'll be the second major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">GameCube game</a> to join the service after the Switch 2's launch, following on from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-strikers-switch-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Mario Strikers</em></a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!</em>, it was released in Japan in 2005, but it didn't get a Western release until the following year (as was fairly common for Japanese releases back then). You play as the titular Chibi-Robo, an adorable robot performing household tasks and aiming to become the best Chibi-Robo in the world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chibi-robo-nintendo-switch-online-platforming.jpg?itok=2hAUs9Cp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chibi-robo-nintendo-switch-online-platforming.jpg?itok=HMk9-5_- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chibi-Robo!&nbsp;</em>will be joining the Nintendo Switch Online library next week.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay consists of exploring the Sanderson house, finding collectibles, and cleaning up messes as you go. You'll also need to keep an eye on your battery levels, which are essentially your health bar; failing to charge yourself up on a regular basis will result in the loss of half of your accumulated currency.</p>

<p>Since the release of the original game,&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!&nbsp;</em>has spawned several sequels, with the latest being 2015's 3DS exclusive&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash</em>. Incidentally, that game, along with its predecessor&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo! Photo Finder</em>, is currently unavailable on any modern system.</p>

<p>It's one of several GameCube games to be available as part of a Switch Online membership on Switch 2, joining the likes of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>,&nbsp;<em>Soulcalibur II</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, among others. You'll need an Expansion Pack addon if you want to play it, though.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch Online 2 right here.</p>




<p><em>Chibi-Robo!&nbsp;</em>will be available on Nintendo Switch Online for Switch 2 players (but not original Switch players) on August 21st, so keep an eye out for it if you're a member.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hidden-door-is-an-ai-storytelling-game-that-actually-makes-sense.1269051/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Years before ChatGPT jump-started the generative AI wave, OpenAI technology powered a game called <em>AI Dungeon 2</em> that essentially let you improvise an open-ended, anything-goes story with an AI narrator. Hidden Door, a new platform that’s now in early access, also lets you cowrite a choose-your-own-adventure-style story with AI. But this narrator won’t let you do whatever you want — in fact, that’s a lot of the appeal.</p><p>Hidden Door is designed to let you play in worlds that include the public domain settings of the <em>Wizard of Oz</em> and <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> as well as <em>The Crow</em>, which Hidden Door has licensed. You create a character, fill in a few details about their backstory, and write in notable traits. The system gives you an opening scenario, and you respond, similar to a tabletop player with a game master. For some decisions, a behind-the-scenes dice roll will decide whether you succeed or fail; either way, the story proceeds from there.</p><p>I was given access ahead of Wednesday’s announcement, and for one story, I chose a variation of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> called “Courtship and Crimson,” which means there are vampires. I told Hidden Door that I was a vampire hunter that’s driven by “an uncompromising sense of duty and a thirst for vengeance,” and the game threw me into a social event where I immediately spotted what I thought was a vampire. There were some prepopulated options, but I wrote my own — to immediately attack the potential enemy with a weapon — and the game let me do so. (It turns out the “vampire” was an illusion!)</p><p>While playing, you’ll collect cards with things like characters and locations that you can look back on as a refresher for key parts of your story. The narrator also has a deck of cards with plot points you can occasionally pick from to guide where you want the story to go.</p><p>Where Hidden Door differs from a general-purpose chatbot is that it will create in-universe limits on what you write. With ChatGPT, for example, I asked it to create its own version of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> and vampires. Then, I wrote that I had a magical, unbeatable bow with silver arrows. ChatGPT let me generate it without any hesitation and let me use it to quickly defeat every vampire on Earth and eventually the galaxy. It’s not precisely “unrealistic” (since vampires aren’t real), but it short-circuited any kind of challenge or satisfying narrative. With Hidden Door, when I tried to pull a similar trick, the game stopped me and gently encouraged me to try and strike up a conversation to gather information instead.</p><p>Sometimes it felt like Hidden Door was simply limiting my options, though. In a <em>Wizard of Oz</em> instance, I tried to make the “daring,” “danger addict” reporter that I was playing get in an apparently hypnotized porter’s face, sending repeated instructions to throw a punch or grab them. The game gave me a “you failed” message. It might have been pure (and unusual) bad luck on dice rolls. But even when things go well, I feel like I can sense the strings pulling the stories in a specific direction instead of letting me spend too long with random characters.</p><p>It would be one thing if this resulted in a genuinely great narrative, but the storytelling can feel disjointed. So far in my testing, each story feels like a series of sometimes entertaining beats guided firmly by the AI narrator behind the scenes. In one scene in my vampire story, an orchestra conductor continued feeding me information to set up a mysterious plot thread — even as I had my character pay basically no attention to him and instead focus on stabbing and killing a vampire version Lady Catherine. In a live tabletop game, there’s also the added camaraderie of bullshitting with your friends; going back and forth with an AI just isn’t the same.</p><p>The game has some rough edges. The narrator’s thinking can take a long time, often many seconds, and while waiting for something to happen, I would often get distracted and click away from the tab. A few times in my vampire story, the game also seemingly copied and pasted an extensive description of my sibling into the text, including an errant misplaced period.</p><p>Still, a focus on familiar narrative worlds could make Hidden Door a compelling way for some people to interact with an AI storyteller. Unlike rolling your own story with a chatbot from a big AI company, Hidden Door doesn’t let you just break all the rules to instantly win, so you have to work within the logic of each story as you’re playing (even if that logic involves vampires or the magical world of Oz).

            <p>To me, the best part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> is getting really into the idea of pretending you're living in 1900s Sicily and drinking in the gorgeous vistas that the game's world offers up like sips of wine. You can imagine, then, how keen I was to give its new first-person driving mod a go.</p>
<p>Having already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mafia-the-old-country-review">knife-fought my way through the main story</a>, I thought this sounded like a pleasant change of perspective to take in when motoring around the Valle Dorata, hoovering up the last of those Explore Mode collectibles. I wasn't wrong either, the mod's great. Well, when it's not accidentally showing you the back of Enzo's teeth and eye sockets.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You see, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mafiatheoldcountry/mods/24?tab=description">First Person Driving Camera</a> by Norskpl is wonderful when you're just merrily trundling along in the likes of the Bolt Model 1 or Dufort Camionette. However, if you switch to the likes of the Ekhart Speciale or one of the Carozella variants, you'll start to see a bit of Enzo's face clipping into view when you brake hard or hit a bump. It's not too bad in those, if obviously something that shatters your illusion of living in old school Italy when it does happen.</p>
<p>Then, I hopped into the Delizia Type 86, and was permanently treated to two floating gristle orbs that I'm sure look like eyes from the other direction. That's in addition to the view your dentist might get if they checked your teeth by climbing inside your mouth, slipping their body down your throat, then turning around to gaze up your gullet (is it just me they do this to?). I even had extra wrinkles in the form of floating facial hair from the beard I'd equipped, and the brim of my hat dipping into view. You can get rid of those last two by switching back to being clean shaven and hatless, but the first two issues persist.</p>

</figure>
<p>Norskpl is aware of this stuff, and sadly it seems they may well be powerless to prevent it, unless they're able to draft in help from another modding whiz with a handy solution. "That’s the reason why game devs deleted this feature," they wrote in the mod's comments section. "Game characters use animations during driving which are causing this sort of thing. I don’t know if there’s any way to fix it."</p><p>That's a shame, but as I say, if your aim is just to use this mod to go cruising around, I reckon you should still give it a try. That's especially true if you're happy with one of the slower cars, like the ones I tried first, as you'll have ample opportunity to take in the sights - and the cars' interiors. The latter are surprisingly detailed and nice to look at up close, given this angle didn't make it into the base game. Hopping in something faster (like the Carozella) comes with a higher clipping risk, but it's worth trying at least once, just to experience the wonderful sensation of raw speed you get trying to thread The Old Country's vintage racers through narrow city streets or country tracks at top speed.</p>
<p>The mod is also about as easy to install as you'll get. All you need to do is extract some files, and stick them where the description says to in your game files. As far as manual installation goes, there's precious little with as this minimal room for stuff to go wrong, unless you go out of your way to muck something up.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-secret-to-grounded-2%E2%80%98s-development-is-a-great-sign-for-xbox-fans.1269036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>Grounded 2</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-xboxs-big-summer-2025-showcase-1851784007">arrived in Early Access</a> just three years after the first game hit 1.0. The surprise sequel caught many fans off-guard. Why make a new game instead of just updating the older one? <a href="https://kotaku.com/obsidian-grounded-avowed-outer-worlds-game-pass-xbox-1851760964">And how did Obsidian Entertainment</a> develop <em>Grounded</em> 2 so quickly, launching its Early Access version the same year it will have shipped two massive RPGs in <em>Avowed</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>? The answer has a lot to do with <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> maker Eidos Montreal.</p> <p>The veteran AAA studio isn’t just a co-developer on<em> Grounded 2</em>, it turns out. “The majority of the heavy lifting is done in Eidos Montreal,” Obsidian game director Chris Parker <a href="https://www.polygon.com/grounded-2-developer-interview-obsidian-entertainment-eidos-montreal/">recently told <em>Polygon</em></a>. “We have a core group of people here [at Obsidian], primarily the folks that worked on <em>Grounded</em>, of course. And then there’s folks like me, acting as game director, who are working day in and day out with Eidos. The artists and designers and engineers, the vast majority are at Eidos Montreal.”</p> <p>That’s not to say that both teams didn’t work closely together. There was constant cross collaboration according to Eidos creative director Justin Vazquez, including big build reviews every few months and alignment on the sequel’s emphasis on narrative and Early Access scope. “<em>Grounded</em> is Obsidian’s IP,” he told <em>Polygon</em>. “It’s their baby, and we are here to work with them to help grow the franchise together. The point isn’t for us to grab it and just run wild with it, so we collaborate on everything on the highest level of ideas and the lowest level. There isn’t anything that isn’t being touched by both studios to ensure that we are delivering the best experience for our players on&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2</em>.”</p>

 <p>As for why make <em>Grounded 2</em> in the first place, both developers pointed to technical limitations of the Xbox One and the desire to push the ambitiousness of the series following the success of <em>Grounded 1</em>. It’s also clear that, while currently much smaller than the previous game, which hit version 1.4 last year, <em>Grounded 2</em> is a lot more streamlined and approachable. The rough edges have really been sanded down without sacrificing much in the way of RPG crafting depth. It also just looks a lot more detailed and vibrant visually. <em>Grounded 2</em> has already <a href="https://x.com/aarongreenberg/status/1955458077597348194">hit 3 million players</a> across Xbox and PC (it’s available through Game Pass on both).</p> <p>All of that suggests that Microsoft’s gambit of having Obsidian essentially outsource much of the sequel to an outside studio has paid off. It helps that <em>Grounded</em> was made with Unreal Engine rather than a set of in-house proprietary tools. Does this mean that Microsoft can find partnerships to help speed up development of its other franchises as well. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-6-infinite-unreal-engine-ue5-ce-remake-343-1851666611">revealed last year</a> that <em>Halo</em> would also be moving to UE5, with more information on the future of that series <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-wc-october-remake-remaster-news-trailer-rumor-xbox-1851785384">coming in October</a>. With<a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/bethesda-is-allegedly-working-on-multiple-fallout-games-including-fallout-3-remastered-teases-report/"> rumors also circulating</a> of possibly multiple new <em>Fallout</em> games in development as well, what are the odds that Obsidian or Bethesda could work with an outside studio on one of them next? After Bethesda successfully <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-virtuos-layoffs-cyberpunk-patch-1851786435">partnered with Virtuos on the UE5 <em>Oblivion</em>&nbsp;remaster</a>, a similar eventual update to<em> Fallout 3</em> seems all but inevitable.</p> <p>These efforts don’t always bear fruit. Microsoft also <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">canceled <em>Perfect Dark</em> this year</a>, which was a collaboration between the smaller first-party team at the now defunct Initiative and Crystal Dynamics. But the pipeline that delivered <em>Grounded 2</em>, at least the Early Access version of it, seems like one that could potentially limit <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-releases-delays-2023-botw2-starfield-suicide-squad-1849840981">some of the ever-lengthening lead times</a> between new games in the increasing number of Microsoft exclusive-franchises that have resulted from industry consolidation.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-doubles-down-on-claim-that-former-subnautica-2-executives-%E2%80%9Cabandoned%E2%80%9D-the-game.1269030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Krafton isn’t backing down from its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-says-former-subnautica-2-leadership-abandoned-their-responsibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims that former executives</a> at Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds had “abandoned” the game before their dismissal from the studio.</p>



<p>In an official response to the lawsuit filed against it by the studio’s founders, Krafton said that Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire <strong>“abandoned their roles as studio-wide Game Director and Technical Director to focus on their personal passion projects and quit making games for Unknown Worlds entirely.”</strong> As far as former CEO Ted Gill, Krafton says that he was <strong>“focused on leveraging his operational control to maximize the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game.”</strong></p>



<p>Krafton’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-subnautica-2-leadership-suing-krafton-after-firing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response continues</a> to allege that in July 2023, staff at Unknown Worlds, specifically Subnautica 2’s development director, had suggested that both Cleveland and McGuire were “checked out” and that they were confused about it. With both studio heads not around, Krafton says that it led to the game’s multiplayer delays from it’s original Q1 2024 release date.</p>



<p>By Spring 2025, the publisher says, the development team received “extensive feedback” from the internal teams which believed that Subnautica 2 wasn’t ready for a release into Early Access. Even Krafton’s CEO reportedly warned the studio heads that a <strong>“premature Early Access release of a highly anticipated sequel like Subnautica could cause irreversible harm to the entire IP franchise—pointing to the sequel to Kerbal Space Program as a prime example.”</strong> </p>



<p>Despite that, they say, the executives attempted to push forward the Early Access release of the game in order <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-wanted-to-delay-subnautica-2-to-avoid-250m-payout-lawsuit-claims" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to hit the earnout</a>. That’s even with comments made that at the rate of current development, the game would <strong>“be in development for 30 years”</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>“Krafton, fearing how an underbaked EA Subnautica 2 would be received by both existing fans and the broader market, urged Cleveland and McGuire to return to their posts to generate a market-ready product that would not disappoint fans,” </strong>the document reads. <strong>“Cleveland and McGuire declined. In response to Krafton’s request for the Key Employees to return to lead the development of Subnautica 2, Gill stated that ‘[t]here’s no coming back to a job they didn’t have.'”</strong></p>



<p>It was also said that Cleveland and McGuire claimed they would self-publish Subnautica 2 without the support of the publisher, and began secretly downloading <strong>“massive amounts of confidential information from Unknown Worlds”.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“The Key Employees’ insistence on releasing the game immediately was singularly driven by self-interest in obtaining the earnout,” </strong>Krafton says. <strong>“At every turn during development, the Key Employees were laser focused on avoiding ‘a timeline that doesn’t tank the earnout opportunity’ and scheduling the release to maximize their payments.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Conversations throughout the post-acquisition period make clear the Key Employee’s [sic] focus was on their payday, and not on the game. As early as 2022, an employee who was due to receive a portion of the earnout stated that despite the significant delays in the game, he was confident ‘Ted [Gill] will&nbsp;concoct a scheme to get us that earnout.'”</strong></p>



<p>There’s plenty more in the response, which you can read for <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">yourself via Scribd</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Shadows Gives Players Two Unique Ways to Play.</p>
      </div>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows does have a Historical Codex that provides a wealth of content to read through, but it doesn't quite compare to how Discovery Tour allows you to explore the game's world and learn more about the history of that specific era. If you're unfamiliar with it, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-origins-discovery-tour-is-a-smart-/1100-6456747/">Discovery Tour was an optional mode introduced in Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, with Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Valhalla also receiving the mode as post-launch content.</p><p>The mode stripped out all combat from the Assassin's Creed games, giving you free rein to wander around at your leisure or engage in a guided tour. For example, Assassin's Creed Odyssey had dozens of guided tours covering themes like ancient Greek art and philosophy, while Assassin's Creed Valhalla's Viking Age mode had players assume the roles of various characters and take on quests that were designed to educate them about life in Norway and Anglo-Saxon England.</p><p>While Assassin's Creed Shadows won't be offering any post-launch history lessons, fans can look forward to its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-expansion-launches-in-september/1100-6533445/">new expansion when it arrives next month</a>. Ubisoft also spoke about how it is planning to dig deep into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-devs-say-that-the-assassin-templar-war-is-just-getting-started/1100-6533895/">secret war between Templars and Assassins</a>, and it looks like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-exec-teases-new-versions-amid-switch-2-rumors/1100-6533378/">live-action Netflix series adaptation</a> is starting to gather momentum.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has announced that Chibi-Robo will be the latest GameCube game to come to the Nintendo Switch 2's classic library as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.</p><p dir="ltr">The rare and expensive title will be added to Switch Online's GameCube library on Thursday, August 21, 2025, bringing the collection to five games.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjP6uQflzMU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BjP6uQflzMU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Originally released in 2006 in North America, Chibi-Robo is a platform-adventure game where you play as the titular diminutive hero tasked with helping out the Sanderson household. As you complete tasks, you gain "Happy Points" in your goal to become the top-ranked "Super Chibi-Robo" in the world.

In our original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/chibi-robo-review/1900-6143731/">review</a>, we said, "Despite the monotonous and occasionally tiresome gameplay, the great cast of characters and offbeat sense of humor manage to make Chibi-Robo a compelling and ultimately enjoyable experience."</p><p dir="ltr">It was the only home console release for the series, with subsequent instalments, such as Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol and Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash, developed for the Nintendo DS and 3DS respectively.

                <p>Battlefield 6 fans are sharing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-certainly-have-some-strong-opinions-after-the-first-open-beta/1100-6533851/" data-ref-id="1100-6533851">plenty of feedback</a>--both good and bad--following the game's first open-beta weekend, and one recurring theme has seen players requesting a BF6 server browser with persistent servers. Producer David Sirland has responded to fans on social media, explaining exactly why DICE <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-server-browser-but-there-is-a-catch/1100-6533674/" data-ref-id="1100-6533674">only has a server brower for Portal mode</a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1954285077946396736" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">response</a> to a player asking for a way to matchmake with larger groups of players, without having to rejoin after every game, Sirland said that the Portal server browser "is basically enabling that." While Portal's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-portal-mode-is-the-answer-to-people-not-wanting-a-game-they-can-complete/1100-6533700/" data-ref-id="1100-6533700">main selling points are user-created game modes</a> and custom experiences, Sirland says that the mode still fulfills the main function of a server browser, even if players may have to filter out the verified servers from the custom experiences.</p>

<p>"The combination of the pool of the persistent servers and the spun-up ones is not very useful," Sirland explains. "Matchmaking servers spin up in seconds (get filled with players), and spin down after game is over. That couple of seconds plus when servers lose a lot of players mid-game is the only time you can join, which makes it a tricky combination (and full of queuing to join issues)."</p><p>"We think the current setup gives us the best of both worlds, as you can choose to go spin up a server through regular matchmaking, or find an existing server that is already running, or create your own as well," Sirland says of the decision to limit the server browser to Portal mode. He adds that DICE will be testing the browser soon, allowing players to check out the new system for themselves.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1954655278453981222" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another reply</a>, Sirland explains the lack of persistent servers in standard matchmaking, explaining that the current system allows for a lot more flexibility between maps and game modes--which means shorter waits for matchmaking.</p><p>"That is to allow for playlists of varying size (max players) and modes," Sirland says. "For example, you can play the 'Yellow maps' playlist that contains Siege of Cairo and Iberian Offensive (any mode). Then let's say I picked the playlist called 'Domination Bonanza,' which includes all three open-beta maps. We can play together when our respective playlists overlap. As in when your "yellow map" plays Domination, for example. That way we pack servers much more effectively and can allow for more modes and max sizes to coexist in the same playlists.</p><p>"Stuff like Rush, that for some maps play 48 players, for others 32 players, and for some 64 players, we want to be able to put in playlists too," Sirland continues. "This is not possible in the old system of persistent servers as the max-players count is locked (or we'd have to kick players, for example)."</p><p>Sirland hasn't specified when players will be able to test the Portal browser for themselves, but the next round of the BF6 open beta is due to kick off very soon on August 14. To check out the second leg of the beta for yourself, our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta breakdown</a> has all the info you need to get started.</p>

<p>After the cancelation of Football Manager 25, developer Sports Interactive is back, teasing news for the upcoming Football Manager 26.</p>



<p>In a short video released on Wednesday, Sports Interactive gave players a glimpse at the “enhanced Match Day experience” from the game. They call it “just a taste of what you can expect” following the shift of the franchise to the Unity engine. At the end of the trailer, it says that a “Match Day First Look” is “coming soon”.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>“[Football Manager 26] promises to propel players on an adventure to shape their footballing destiny with our most immersive and visually rich Football Manager experience to date,”</strong> Sports Interactive said. <strong>“All the story-making potential is redefined as players get ever closer to the heart of the beautiful game.”</strong></p>



<p>Football Manager’s move to Unity has been a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-documented journey</a> that led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-to-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple delays</a> of Football Manager 25 only for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-cancelled-after-multiple-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game to be canceled</a> altogether.</p>

One of the issues in the crosshairs is the reported "super bullet" causing unexpectedly fast time-to-kill rates.</p><p>BF6's principal game designer Florian Le Bihan <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">took to X</a> following the end of the open beta to ask players for videos of "suspected super bullet/unexpectedly fast TTD" bugs. A number of players have reported having this issue in the Battlefield beta, with some streamers even experiencing the issue live on stream. The unusually quick TTD (time to death or time to down) bug causes some players to be downed in just a few shots, and sometimes even when behind cover.</p>

<p>Players were quick to provide examples of the suspected bug, with some speculating that the server was slow to apply damage that had already been received, causing the full amount of damage to be applied to the player all at once after a short delay. Players have also reported taking damage or failing to heal when they should be at full health, including immediately after respawning--though this bug appears to only impact the health-bar UI and not players' actual hit points.</p><p>While some player's TTD issues were put down to regular lag due to a poor internet connection, others have shared videos of the suspected bug in question. Le Bihan later updated to thank players for sharing their footage, saying he's now been sent "a bunch of good videos" to investigate the issue.</p><p>With the first open-beta weekend concluded, players have taken to social media to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-certainly-have-some-strong-opinions-after-the-first-open-beta/1100-6533851/" data-ref-id="1100-6533851">share their thoughts on the preview</a>, both good and bad. The beta reached a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-reportedly-reached-a-massive-player-count/1100-6533862/" data-ref-id="1100-6533862">huge number of people</a>, and the developers at DICE no doubt have a big job ahead of them combing through player feedback and bug reports ahead of the game's release on October 10.</p><p>Players will have a chance to check out more Battlefield 6 maps and different modes when the open beta returns for a second weekend on August 14.

Now, it may reach even further heights because Lady Gaga is coming to Dress to Impress for a special event this week.</p><p>Under the rules of Dress to Impress, players are invited to create outfits based on specific themes, and the top three winners are chosen by votes from other players. For this event, the theme is Mayhem, the most recent album from Lady Gaga.</p><p>Starting on August 16, players will be able to compete in Mayhem-themed challenges and earn Lady Gaga-related items and clothing. Style Showdown will also feature a challenge based on Lady Gaga's song Zombieboy. A lucky few may even get a chance to meet Lady Gaga in-game as she judges an outfit competition for herself.</p><p>Outside of the Lady Gaga event, there's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dress-to-impress-codes/1100-6533105/" data-ref-id="1100-6533105">an assortment of free outfits and accessories</a> that can be claimed by Dress to Impress players in August. Dress to Impress isn't the only Roblox game that's become a breakout success. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-roblox-mode-just-passed-fortnites-concurrent-player-record/1100-6532461/" data-ref-id="1100-6532461">Grow a Garden</a>'s popularity has only continued to rise and its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smash-hit-roblox-game-grow-a-garden-adds-cooking-in-new-update/1100-6533683/" data-ref-id="1100-6533683">most recent update added cooking to the game</a>.
