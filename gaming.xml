<p>The game was revealed via both a cinematic trailer introducing its world and an extended gameplay trailer that demonstrates how it'll play. It turns out the answer to that second conundrum is "quite a lot like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a>, by the looks of things".</p>
<p>This one's got a distinctly&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>-style urban fantasy setting as well, and it revolves around a group of characters investigating Anomalies in the land of Helthereau.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neverness-to-everness-gacha-rpg-city-exploration.jpg?itok=mnWJjxmw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neverness-to-everness-gacha-rpg-city-exploration.jpg?itok=LCDMwXyu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Neverness to Everness&nbsp;</em>has a distinctly&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>flavor to it.</figcaption></figure><p>In the extended 13-minute gameplay trailer introducing&nbsp;<em>Neverness to Everness&nbsp;</em>(which Hotta Studio would like you to call&nbsp;<em>NTE</em>), you can see characters exploring an urban environment and interacting with the locals, as well as a few of the trippy&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghostwire-tokyo"><em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em></a>-style Anomalies you'll be investigating.</p>
<p>You can also see some combat, which looks fairly similar to HoYoverse's style; you'll be switching quickly between characters to build combos, and it looks like each character will have special abilities to take advantage of as well.</p>
<p>Rather unusually for an anime-style gacha game, you can also see characters floating down to street level from rooftops,&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham Knight&nbsp;</em>style, before hopping into cars to explore the rain-soaked streets of the city at night.</p>
<p>Here's the cinematic announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Neverness to Everness</em>.</p>

<p>If that trailer has piqued your interest, then I'd suggest checking out this 13-minute gameplay trailer as well, which shows off a wide range of different activities in&nbsp;<em>NTE</em>.</p>

<p>Both trailers conclude with a teaser for something more in September, so it sounds like we might get a release window - or, at least, a beta window - then.

			<div>
								<p><span>Back</span>  in 2005, a small firm offered a tantalizing vision of the future of computer keyboards.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>What if your keyboard was filled with tiny screens that showed you exactly what any given press would do, each built into a crystal-clear key? The keys would morph and shift as you needed, transforming from letters and numbers to full-color icons and app shortcuts, depending on what you were doing.
</p>


								<p>Readers and tech bloggers adored the idea. “It’s about time someone shook up this stagnant keyboard market,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050729090327/http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000740050460/">declared <em>Engadget</em></a>. “The concept is fantastic,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050829024522/http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/peripherals/input/index.php">wrote <em>Gizmodo</em></a>. <em>Slashdot </em><a href="https://slashdot.org/story/05/07/14/1335215/optimus-keyboard-with-oled-display-keys">lit up</a>.
</p>


								<p>The keyboard was just a concept, dreamed up by Art Lebedev, a Russian design firm, and it was an ambitious idea at that: called the Optimus Maximus, it would require over 100 built-in screens using display technology that wasn’t readily available at the time. With all the excitement, the firm decided to make it real.
</p>

		</p>
</div>

		
			<div>
								<p>The journey to create the Optimus Maximus would take years and end in multiple commercial failures. But Art Lebedev’s vision and the technology created along the way would live on and ultimately find widespread success —&nbsp;a success that’s been hidden inside another popular product: Elgato’s Stream Deck, a small desktop accessory covered in morphing, full-color keys.
</p>


								<p>By the time Elgato came to release its first Stream Deck in 2017, Art Lebedev’s Optimus keyboards had faded into history. But there’s more linking the two devices than a core idea. In fact, the Stream Deck hardware came from precisely the same company that developed the Optimus Maximus’ keys. In a very real sense, Art Lebedev’s work laid the foundations for what Elgato would go on to create.
</p>


							

			</div>
			<div>
								<p><span>In</span>  2010, Elgato was in “crisis mode.”&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>For around a decade, the German video capture company had been selling its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeTV">TV tuners</a> to people who wanted to watch and record live television via a connected computer. But by 2010, it was clear that the market for such devices was disappearing fast. On one side, broadcast TV was becoming increasingly encrypted, limiting what Elgato’s devices could do. On the other, the streaming revolution, led by Netflix and YouTube, was cutting out the humble TV tuner entirely.
</p>


								<p>“You’re on a sinking ship, you’ve got to figure out what you’re going to do,” recalls Elgato’s Julian Fest, whose parents originally founded the company in 1999.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Elgato started to take a hard look at its business, and it noticed one number that didn’t quite make sense.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Elgato knew how many TV tuners it had sold, but people had been registering far more copies of the company’s EyeTV recording software than its own customers would need. When it emailed those customers, it found out they were using a <em>rival</em> piece of hardware, the Hauppauge HD-PVR — and not to record broadcast TV. They were recording gameplay from their PlayStations to put up on YouTube. Right under Elgato’s nose was a new market opportunity.
</p>


			</div>
				<p><span>The market for online gameplay videos was poised to explode</span>
</p>
			<div>
								<p>Armed with over a decade’s worth of video encoding knowledge from its TV tuner days, a direct connection to Hauppauge’s customers, and Hauppauge’s own quarterly earnings reports to know just how many HD-PVRs it sold, Elgato decided to release a rival capture product specifically tailored to gamers. The result was the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/21/3034372/elgato-game-capture-hd-xbox-360-ps3-recording-announced">Game Capture HD</a>, released in 2012.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Three years later, when Fest took over as Elgato’s general manager, it seemed clear that the market for online gameplay videos was poised to explode. With Amazon acquiring the live streaming service Twitch for almost $1 billion in 2014, Fest was on the lookout for ways Elgato could double down. Perhaps it could offer a way to not just capture gameplay footage but also to help Twitch streamers control their broadcasts in the moment.
</p>


								<p>“If you looked at the state of Twitch and live streaming at the end of 2015, it was intriguing, but it was also kind of boring,” Fest tells <em>The Verge</em>. “Everybody’s stream was like, ‘Here’s my gameplay, here’s my webcam,’ and that’s it.” He figured that simplicity was because of all the different jobs a streamer has to handle during broadcasts: between playing the game, reading the chat, and entertaining an audience, it’d be difficult to <em>also</em> run a dynamic broadcast filled with changing layouts and eye-catching transitions.
</p>


								<p>Unless, Fest thought, there was a way to offer advanced broadcast controls without distracting a streamer from other tasks. The company found its answer in a <a href="https://youtu.be/oFqiNWyBnAo">popular German TV show</a> where the host had a so-called “nipple board” of buttons in front of him, built into a giant desk. “Every time you pressed one of these buttons, it would play a funny clip that his team had found on TV,” Fest recalls. The team wondered if Elgato could use a similar array of buttons to control a livestream.
</p>


								<p>Elgato had its idea — now, it needed to find the right buttons to make it a reality.&nbsp;
</p>


							

			</div>
			<div>
								<p><span>Art</span>  Lebedev had never intended to make a massive splash in the keyboard business. Timur Burbaev, who served as the keyboard’s industrial designer, tells <em>The Verge</em> that the initial idea came about shortly after he joined in 2003. The keyboard was just meant to be a concept, similar to its <a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/lavatrix/">Lavatrix washing machine</a>, to show off the studio’s design chops and drum up more business in the free time between projects.
</p>


								<p>In July 2005, the company released a <a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/concept/">series of concept images</a> of what it called the “Optimus keyboard.” It had the same basic layout as a full-size computer keyboard but with a twist: “Every key of the Optimus keyboard is a stand-alone display showing exactly what it is controlling at this very moment,” the website still reads. 
</p>


			</div>
		<div>
			<div>
				
				<p><span>A decade before the Stream Deck, the Art Lebedev Optimus keyboard convincingly imagined screens beneath keys.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				
				<p><span>The vision was an entire keyboard that could visibly change each key’s function to match your chosen app.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				
				<p><span>The concept called for 123 individual OLED screens; the final Optimus Maximus shipped with 113.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				
				<p><span>Even today, these renders look surprisingly real thanks to the pixelated imperfections visible in each key.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		
			<div>
								<p>One image shows how the keys could change to show an array of Photoshop tools; another shows dedicated controls for <em>Quake.</em> (This was 2005, after all.) On the left edge of the keyboard are macro keys that can be programmed to open specific programs, illustrated with a series of delightfully 2005-era logos like Internet Explorer and QuickTime. Although the images are renders rather than real photographs, the close-ups make an effort to show individual pixels present on the screens of the keys, a small imperfection that provides a tantalizing hint of reality. Nearly two decades later, the imaginary device still looks fantastic.
</p>


								<p>It was hard to ignore the amount of interest the design was getting. The team called an emergency meeting to discuss. “Back then, we just realized that if you get such a positive response, then let’s risk it and just produce it,” Burbaev says. It was “a clear indication” that the team should try and make it for real. The long and difficult journey of producing what would become the Optimus Maximus had begun. “No one imagined how much time and energy and especially investment it would take,” Burbaev says.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>A big early decision was working out what kind of screen technology to use. The first iPod with a color display had only just been released, and the iPhone had yet to make its debut. Candybar-style phones like the Nokia 1110 and Motorola C139 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_mobile_phones">reigned supreme</a>. Art Lebedev thought LCD screens of the era were too dim and offered terrible black levels, while E Ink screens had terrible response times and no backlighting at all. OLED seemed like the best choice.
</p>


								<p>But this was long before OLED displays were routinely shipping in mainstream smartwatches, smartphones, and TVs. “The problem with OLED displays was that you could potentially find such a small OLED display in 2006 but a) it would cost you a fortune and b) it would have a massive resolution,” Burbaev says. They were meant for military users to show tactical information like maps on tiny screens, not <em>Quake</em> icons on a keyboard. 
</p>


			</div>
				<p><span>“Finally we realized there is no other option than to make our own matrix for the display.” - Timur Burbaev</span>
</p>
			<div>
								<p>Art Lebedev decided its “only option” was to dive headfirst into the OLED display business. Burbaev believes his was one of the first companies to ship a product with these kinds of small, low-cost, low-resolution OLED screens. Doing so involved placing what Burbaev describes as a “very strange” order with a Taiwanese manufacturer with some prior experience. He adds that two managers from Art Lebedev ended up living in Taiwan for half a year while they were being made.
</p>


								<p>Not only did Art Lebedev need to find screens small enough to fit under each of its keys but it also needed to find a way for them to coexist with keys that you could actually type on. The final keyboard ended up being a bit of a fudge: the screens didn’t actually move. Instead, the company built a moving plastic keycap that moved <em>around</em> each screen. But even this solution had its challenges, Burbaev says. This plastic keycap needed to not only be transparent enough to show the display but also tinted enough to not reveal the ugly inner mechanism of each screen and durable enough to withstand scratches.
</p>


								<p>All of this meant the development process for the Optimus Maximus was long and difficult, and <em>Wired </em>featured the keyboard not <a href="https://www.wired.com/2006/12/vaporware-06-return-of-the-king/">once</a> but <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/01/ye-vaporware/?slide=7&amp;slideView=2">twice</a> in its annual vaporware roundups. Art Lebedev was unusually open about the troubled development process, cataloging its progress making the keyboard <a href="https://optimus-project.livejournal.com/">on a LiveJournal blog</a>. We’re used to receiving such updates in an era of Kickstarter and crowdfunding, but the approach felt novel at the time — and it shows just how slowly development went. It took months just to arrive on a keycap design, <a href="https://optimus-project.livejournal.com/3161.html">studying various possibilities</a> along the way. The company’s first OLED manufacturer <a href="https://optimus-project.livejournal.com/25029.html">went bust</a> before managing to deliver its pricy $10 keys, forcing Art Lebedev to hunt down a new Taiwanese supplier.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Finally, after years of development, hundreds of preorders, and dozens upon dozens of blog posts and concept images hyping up every aspect of the idea, the Optimus Maximus began shipping <a href="https://optimus-project.livejournal.com/53878.html">in February 2008</a>.
</p>


			</div>
		<div>
	
	<p><span>A diagram shows how Art Lebedev’s keys compare to normal laptop and desktop keyboard keys. The Maximus key has a gem-faceted prism of a lens surrounding its screen, while the Popularis key is simply a lens.</span>
</p></div>

		
			<div>
								<p>What was this legendary keyboard actually like to use? In a word: “Terrible.”
</p>


								<p>“Let’s put it this way, we sit around and type all day long and this thing wore us out in about 30 seconds to a minute,” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-02-22-optimus-maximus-at-long-last-we-bring-one-home-to-test.html"><em>Engadget</em> wrote after its first few weeks of testing</a>. “The Optimus Maximus is terrible for touch-typing,” <a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/optimus-maximus-review/"><em>CNET</em> concurred in its July 2008 review</a>, noting that “the tightly packed keys make for lots of mistaken presses, and the mushy responsiveness slows down your words per minute.” In 2018, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj7GYU-wedo">retro keyboard YouTuber Chyrosran22</a> called the keys “fishy fuck nuggets with a capital F” that are “extremely terrible” to type on.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>These are issues that would be hard to forgive on <em>any</em> keyboard, but the Optimus Maximus also carried a $1,600 price tag in 2008 (north of $2,200 in today’s money). At that price, it had to be perfect, and the reality was far from it.
</p>


			</div>
			<div>
								<p>So Art Lebedev came up with another, cheaper way to make screen-filled keys work: one big screen. In 2012, it released the Optimus Popularis, a more compact keyboard that placed one large LCD display under all its transparent keys, with no need for any individual OLED screens or mechanical switches underneath. Instead, you’d type on <em>lenses</em> that would activate the keyboard’s single large screen, with each lens held floating in place by an aluminum frame. This basic idea is the key to every LCD keyboard we’ve seen since, from the Elgato Stream Deck to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/10/2697370/razers-touchscreen-star-wars-the-old-republic-keyboard-hands-on">Razer’s discontinued Switchblade UI</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23518440/finalmouse-centerpiece-mechanical-keyboard-screen-features-price">the Finalmouse Centerpiece</a>.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Yet fundamental problems remained. Not only was Art Lebedev’s new keyboard only slightly cheaper (it still <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/Optimus-Keyboard-LCD-Screens,14365.html">cost north of $1,000</a>) but also the Optimus Popularis was an absolute pig to type on. Art Lebedev was kind enough to send one to us for the purposes of this story, and we had ambitions to write this entire piece on the Popularis. But after half an hour, we gave up. It was a struggle getting the keyboard to register keypresses in the first place. Its space bar, in particular, is a nightmare that refuses to actuate unless you press it firmly enough in exactly the right spot, which is nearly impossible if you want to type at any sort of speed.
</p>


						
								<p>Even in 2024, in an era of phones that are not just smart but that can <em>literally fold in half</em>, we still find ourselves wishing Art Lebedev had been able to deliver on its 2005 concept images. It’s a really beautiful idea with huge amounts of promise. But even if Art Lebedev never truly delivered, it did a lot of the vital iteration to get there.
</p>


							

			</div>
			<p><span>Four</span>  years after the Optimus Popularis’ failure, a strikingly similar gadget appeared on Indiegogo. The “Infinitton” contained just 15 individually customizable LCD keys, much like another old Art Lebedev concept dubbed the <a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/aux/">Optimus Aux</a>. But this time, gadget lovers didn’t praise the idea to high heaven — the keypad missed its first crowdfunding goal of $30,000 and barely made that money a year later on Kickstarter.
</p>

</div>

		
			<div>
								<p>But for Taiwanese manufacturer iDisplay, the Infinitton was far from a disappointment — it was a decade-old idea finally paying off.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>That’s because iDisplay was <em>the company</em> that built those OLED and LCD keys for Art Lebedev all those years ago, the Russian design firm and Elgato both confirmed to <em>The Verge</em>. It never stopped working on them. “The success of Optimus Maximus kept me interested to continue the research and development of the built-in screen keys,” iDisplay cofounder Jen Wen Sun tells us via translated email. By 2017, he’d racked up over a dozen patents on the tech and says he sold the screens into broadcast equipment, airplanes, and cars along the way.
</p>


								<p>The company was originally formed in 1998 and worked on <a href="https://www.idisplay.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E5%8D%80%E5%9F%9F-79-%E8%A4%87%E6%9C%AC-5@3x.png">buttons for the gambling industry</a>, he tells us, surviving off small-scale R&amp;D projects while he kept trying to sell casinos on his push-button screens. Casino owner Bally’s was once interested, he says, but a deal never panned out.
</p>


								<p>Back in Germany, the Infinitton caught the attention of Elgato’s Julian Fest, who was researching how to turn his screen-equipped streaming controller idea into a reality. “As we’re thinking about this controller, this crowdfunding campaign comes out and we’re looking at this box and we’re like ‘Oh, this is perfect. We need to talk to these guys,’” Fest recalls.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>By the time Elgato started talking to iDisplay, the Taiwanese company had already solved many of the hardware challenges needed to turn a thousand dollar-plus keyboard into a relatively affordable $149 computer accessory. It could use small off-the-shelf screens similar to what you might find in a car’s infotainment system. And iDisplay had a simpler job on its hands crafting the Stream Deck’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23706779/stream-deck-pop-bubbles-bubbledeck">bubble wrap-esque button feel</a> because it didn’t have to worry about people needing to type at 50-plus words per minute. That feel had been crafted before Elgato ever touched it.
</p>

				<p><span>April 2017</span>
					<span>The Stream Deck arrives</span>
					<span></span>
					<span>Elgato took the Infinitton, turned it on its side, and built the software to make it a streamer’s delight.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		
			<div>
								<p>Elgato essentially turned the Infinitton into the Stream Deck. That first Stream Deck, Fest says, “was really just on a hardware level an iteration of what these guys did.” Look at the original Stream Deck next to the Infinitton, and the resemblance is clear; it’s the same three-by-five grid of buttons turned on its side and with a new housing. “We tried to keep it as simple as possible,” Fest says.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>The way Fest describes it, the main thing Elgato brought to the table when it started working with iDisplay was focus. In its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2086416348/infinitton-a-smart-touch-screen-keyboard/description">Kickstarter campaign for the Infinitton</a>, iDisplay pitched the accessory to anyone and everyone. It was for designers, traders, and musicians. It was for architects, engineers, and programmers. It was for video designers and photographers and business professionals.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>In contrast, Elgato knew exactly who it wanted its Stream Deck to be for: streamers. It held a six-month private beta to collect feedback from its intended users, and it poured a lot of effort into making sure the device integrated nicely with OBS, the industry-standard streaming software. “The big new component then was building software that was tailor made for live streamers,” Fest says. “What we did is we took something existing and just repositioned it for an audience that actually understood and appreciated what this thing could do.”
</p>


			</div>
				<p><span>Elgato turned a Kickstarter project into a streamer’s tool</span>
</p>
			<div>
								<p>That’s not to say Elgato didn’t have any challenges to overcome while developing the Stream Deck with iDisplay. Fest says a big one was ensuring that the Stream Deck could not only send information to a computer but also receive it back and show it to the user. Without being able to stay in sync like this, the Stream Deck risked being the glorified macro pad that critics claimed it was. “If you fire off a hotkey, you don’t know if that action succeeded,” Fest says. “What we wanted to ensure is that if you change a scene in OBS you can clearly see on your device [that] that scene is now active and the other one is not. Or if you mute yourself, you’re muted, and we can guarantee that you’re muted because we’re talking natively to OBS.”
</p>


								<p>The approach worked. iDisplay had sold just a few hundred units of its Infinitton via its crowdfunding campaigns, but the Stream Deck quickly became a staple of the Twitch streamer’s toolkit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/17/15327118/elgato-stream-deck-release-amazon">after its release in 2017</a>. A year later, <a href="https://www.corsair.com/newsroom/press-release/corsair-to-acquire-elgato-gaming">Corsair acquired Elgato</a> for an undisclosed sum — and in 2022, <a href="https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-acquires-majority-ownership-taiwan-based-electronics">it bought iDisplay</a>, locking down its LCD keys.
</p>


								<p>Other companies have taken notice. In 2022, Razer introduced the Stream Controller, and a year after that, competing PC accessory manufacturer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/18/23798716/logitech-loupedeck-acquisition-announcement">Logitech snatched up Loupedeck</a>, which had worked with Razer on the rival streaming accessory.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Much like when it morphed its TV tuner into a game recorder, Elgato developed an audience for a technology rather than the other way around. It had been the missing piece of the puzzle since the beginning. But ironically, the audience for the Stream Deck has since expanded almost as wide as the one iDisplay hoped would embrace the Infinitton.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Fest says he knows of Stream Decks being used in the hundreds by organizations ranging from call centers to police dispatcher services. The UK’s Virgin Atlantic airline <a href="https://www.elgato.com/eu/it/s/virgin-atlantic">uses dozens of Stream Decks</a> to simplify communications with pilots and air traffic controllers. Even SpaceX was an early customer, Fest says. (SpaceX did not respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.) The simple genius of the Stream Deck is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23703402/stream-deck-button-of-the-month">that it made LCD keys <em>peripheral</em></a>, useful for anything where you need a button that dynamically advertises what it’s doing.

			In this 3D animation, the original Optimus keyboard concept and the Stream Deck play a game of digital ping-pong across the entirety of their key-covered screens.
		</p>
</div>

		
			<div>
								<p><span>Art</span>  Lebedev was right about one thing: there was indeed a market of people prepared to pay top dollar for premium-quality keyboards. But in retrospect, the Russian design studio bet that the market would go in the opposite direction of the one it actually went in. Instead of a software-based future filled with screens, keyboards embraced <em>hardware</em>, rediscovering mechanical key switches that had been around since the ’80s. Users began fixating on typing feel, seeking out tactile switches and clacky keycaps. The many compromises of LCD keys might have been too much to ask.
</p>


								<p>But Elgato didn’t need to find a balance between typing feel and screen because its Stream Deck aimed to complement a traditional keyboard, rather than replace it. “Everybody has opinions on how Stream Deck’s keys feel. Some absolutely love it. Some say it’s way too mushy. But for everybody, it’s usable,” Fest says. You can forgive a key that feels mushy if you only need to press it to mute yourself while streaming.
</p>


								<p>Which is not to say there’s no space for the kind of screen-based design that Art Lebedev and iDisplay worked to create. The gaming accessories company Finalmouse appears to be banking on exactly that with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23518440/finalmouse-centerpiece-mechanical-keyboard-screen-features-price">forthcoming Centerpiece keyboard</a>, which draws on the single-screen approach of the Popularis but combines it with a set of actual mechanical switches — translucent ones — to retain the feel of a mechanical keyboard.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Like the Optimus Maximus, the Centerpiece has already blown past its first promised ship dates and is entering the vaporware realm. But if it does arrive, perhaps function and form will finally be aligned.
</p>


								<p>As for Art Lebedev, it doesn’t consider the Optimus keyboard a failure. “You could argue how successful the project was in terms of return on investment,” Burbaev says, telling us how much business it drummed up for the studio even a decade later. Sometimes a new client would admit that they, too, were fixated by those concept images back when they were a kid.

			<p>Today, Larian Studios <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4240783699885624491" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> the 28th Baldur's Gate 3 community update. It's largely focused on the upcoming Update 7, which is due in September. To start with, local co-op players will be excited to learn of the arrival of dynamic split-screen. This new feature allows the screen to merge when characters are near each other, removing the annoying split. You can glimpse an example below.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-might-be-about-to-get-honor-mode-difficulty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honor Mode</a> difficulty setting is getting more challenging, too. The bulette, Malus Thorm, and a few githyanki (Ch'r'ai Tska'an, Ch'r'ai Har'rak, and Ptaris) will receive additional Legendary Actions. Moreover, Dror Ragzlin will now also be able to use a new spell called Arachnid Compulsion to rally the spiders that reside in the nearby pit to fight you.</p>
<p>Patch 7's headline feature for Baldur's Gate 3 players who enjoy evil playthroughs might just be the addition of several cinematics for evil endings. But there are also plenty of fixes and improvements in general for all Origin characters:</p>
<p><em>This update will also see improvements made to some cinematics, endgame dialogues, and Origin characters - specifically things like clipping issues, a couple of broken triggers for quests, dialogues, and romances, the odd case of retrograde amnesia, and persistent exclamation marks.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, and the Blade of Frontiers will no longer absent-mindedly swing his sword mere inches from the aorta of shorter races who try to recruit him.</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, party banter will now work not only in single player but also when playing Baldur's Gate 3 in cooperative multiplayer mode. Of course, Patch 7 will also bring the public release of the modding tools ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-closed-alpha-starts-today-with-beta-in-july-and-release-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned September launch</a>. Anyone interested in checking out Patch 7's Closed Beta can sign up for the playtest directly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Steam page</a>. Players will be randomly selected ahead of the CBT's start, slated for July 22.</p>
<p>Larian saved the most surprising tidbit for last: Patch 7 won't be, despite what we had assumed, the last major update for Baldur's Gate 3. The studio is still working on major features like crossplay and a photo mode, not to mention further gameplay tweaks, quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and performance optimizations.</p>
<p>In other news, read how Baldur's Gate 3's countless awards won <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-won-so-many-awards-that-it-caused-larian-a-few-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly hampered Larian's workload.</a></p>

<p>Patch 7 will feature a dynamic split screen mode, “several new cinematics” for evil endings, a variety of fixes, and the anticipated modding toolkit.</p>



<p>Larian <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-will-add-modding-in-september-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a> that Patch 7 will release sometime in September 2024, with a Closed Beta coming this month. There is still no concrete launch date for Patch 7, but the Closed Beta did hit its release window. </p>



<p>Registration for the Closed Beta is now open, and randomly selected registrants will gain access to the playtest.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many fans believed that the addition of mod support would likely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-likely-the-games-last-major-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mark the final major patch</a> for Baldur’s Gate 3. </p>



<p>However, Larian Studios just confirmed that “Patch 7 won’t be the final update for Baldur’s Gate 3.” The devs added that “we still have a few things up our sleeve.” </p>



<p>Some of the features to follow Patch 7 will include “crossplay and a photo mode.” There will also be “gameplay tweaks and quality-of-life improvements to bug fixes and performance optimizations.”</p>



<p>However, Larian Studios has made it clear that it still plans to move on from Baldur’s Gate 3.

Obtain enough points and you can call in a scorestreak. More effective scorestreaks cost more points. For example, in Black Ops Cold War, the Combat Bow cost 500 points. The Chopper Gunner, however, costs 8,000 points.</p><p>In Black Ops Cold War, Treyarch’s last Black Ops game, score carries over even after you die. But in <a href="https://youtu.be/KMFDkQ_5m1U?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the inaugural episode of the COD POD</a>, Treyarch’s associate director of design Matt Scronce confirmed this system was ditched for Black Ops 6, which reverts to a more traditional scorestreak system in which score resets on death.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>But perhaps the more significant change for Black Ops 6 is that it does not feature what are called ‘looping streaks.’ Looping streaks means you can continue to earn your streaks over and over again within the same life, if you don’t die. So, once you’ve earned your three streaks, you don’t have to die to reset them. You can continue to loop through them if you don’t die within the same life.</p><p>Scronce confirmed that in Black Ops 6, scorestreaks do not loop. His explanation is that this change, in combination with score resetting on death, helps avoid the ‘scorestreak spam’ some players hate in Call of Duty.</p><p>“We’re going back to a traditional scorestreak system,” Scronce said. “Score will reset on death. Right now scorestreaks do not loop. That was something we talked about quite a bit. Really the goal there is we want to reward players in a single life fairly, with high-end rewards, or low-end depending on your selection.</p><p>“But we really want to avoid scorestreak spam. That’s something I personally just really don’t like. I know a lot of players don’t like it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This confirmation has sparked a debate within the Call of Duty community about the rights and wrongs of streak looping. Some players, particularly high-skill players, do enjoy it because it helps them dominate a match.</p><p>The argument goes that ditching streak looping for Black Ops 6 artificially holds back high-skill players players from dominating a match because without looping streaks, once high-skill players earn their top streak, they may as well kill themselves so they can work towards earning it again. (Unless they’re going for a nuke, but that’s extremely rare.)</p><p>The counter-argument is that, as Scronce says, such a change helps avoid scorestreak spam, which can be extremely annoying to face in a match. There are all sorts of sub-arguments within this debate that get to the very heart of Call of Duty multiplayer. Do fewer streaks in a match make for a better or more boring experience? Should high-skill players be rewarded for their high-skill play at the expense of others?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We really want to avoid scorestreak spam. That’s something I personally just really don’t like. I know a lot of players don’t like it.</p></div><p>Treyarch has made its position clear, although the wording of Scronce’s statement (“right now scorestreaks do not loop”) suggests there may be wiggle room, depending on feedback. Speaking of feedback, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-confirmed">we finally have the Call of Duty Black Ops 6 beta dates</a>, set to arrive ahead of the game’s launch in October.</p><p>Black Ops 6 is the first mainline Call of Duty to launch straight into Xbox Game Pass, following Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-a-hot-topic-as-microsoft-hikes-xbox-game-pass-prices">But the Game Pass tiers are getting more expensive and more complicated</a> — with Black Ops 6 at the heart of the changes.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>What is poised to be one of 2024's biggest releases, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523761/" data-ref-id="1100-6523761">EA Sports College Football 25</a>, is launching officially this week, and the developer is warning players the game will have some issues. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-college-football-25-early/1100-6524953/" data-ref-id="1100-6524953">arrived July 15 through early access</a>, and players quickly noticed a series of inaccuracies related to player likenesses and other parts of the game. Those problems will be fixed, EA has promised.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-launch-week-kickoff?utm_campaign=cf25_hd_ww_ic_soco_ig_cfb25launchch&amp;utm_source=instagram&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=80730&amp;ts=1721068407546" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, EA Sports said there would "inevitably" be "some slight inaccuracies at launch" in regards to player likenesses and other elements. That's in part because it was only just a few months ago in February that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-offering-college-athletes-600-to-appear-in-new-football-game/1100-6521289/" data-ref-id="1100-6521289">EA signed Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals with college athletes for the game</a>. In the time since, EA created "thousands of player likenesses" for the game, and also processed the "massive volume of reference materials" sent to the developer from the 134+ participating FBS schools.</p>

<p>"Certain schools like Stanford, Western Michigan, and Jacksonville State will show with outdated logos, and a small subset of players will have missing or incorrect likenesses initially," EA said, noting that it will attempt to addresses the issues as quickly as possible.</p><p>In total, College Football 25 features about 11,390 real players, along with 5,000 or so player models for coaches, fans, and created players, totalling more than 16,000 character models. EA said it was "never going to be a viable option" to create the characters manually by scanning them all into the game.</p><p>Instead, EA used a machine learning toolset to create the character models. EA inputted "hundreds" of head shapes, hairstyles, skin tones, complexions, beards, and brows into the model. Using this data, along with a single reference photo of the athlete or coach in question, EA said it was able to create the player likenesses in the game.</p><p>EA has also confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-team-builder-isnt-live-at-launch/1100-6524983/" data-ref-id="1100-6524983">the TeamBuilder mode won't be available at launch</a>, and will be released at some point later on. Like EA's other sports games, players can expect regular updates to the game that will deliver new features, as well as fixes and other improvements.</p><p>College Football 25 is available now through the $100 deluxe edition or via the 10-hour trial available to EA Play subscribers. The game launches for everyone else on July 19.</p><p>According to the in-game player-counter, College Football 25 had <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FGameOverGreggy%2Fstatus%2F1813066685320175793&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fcollege-football-25-will-have-inaccuracies-at-launch-ea-says%2F1100-6524998%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 619,000 concurrent players on July 15.</a> The game kicked off EA's annual sports-game release schedule, with Madden NFL 25 to follow in August, and then FC 25 in September, followed by the presumed release of NHL 25 in October.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-local-legends-review-legendary-bar-stories<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For many TTRPG groups, the campaign opens with the phrase, “you all meet at a tavern.” It's a quick and easy way to establish tone and group dynamics while introducing players to low-stakes challenges. It's a cliché that is at the heart of <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em>. A series of products all about helping bring personality and style to various fantasy watering holes.</p>
<h2>What is in <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em>?</h2>
<p><em>Epic Encounter: Local Legends</em> is a spin-off product of Steamforged Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/epic-encounters-preview" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Epic Encounters</em></a> boxes. It is made up of two different sets, which use the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> Fifth Edition</em> ruleset.&nbsp; The main set is the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Tavern Kit. It contains three books detailing ten different fantasy taverns, 60 unique NPCs that make up both staff and clientele, ten tavern maps, ten playmats, and a deck of cards printed with quick references. The second set is the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Encounter boxes. These contain miniatures, stat blocks, and battle maps for encounters hinted at in the Tavern Kit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-tavern-kit-contents.jpg?itok=8Ae1AsvH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-tavern-kit-contents.jpg?itok=isqUuQ0U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>GMs, the heavy lifting has been done for you.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Helpful is the GM material in the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Tavern Kit?</h2>
<p>When starting a fantasy TTRPG campaign, a tavern does a lot of atmospheric heavy lifting. It covers many important world-building details and can set the tone of an entire campaign. Are the patrons friendly or defensive? Is the atmosphere rustic, austere, luxurious, or seedy? What happens when patrons get rowdy?</p>
<p>For veteran players, these details can be taken for granted. After a while, cultural shorthand is developed and everyone at the table locks in. But for new players, making a compelling tavern experience can be bland and forgettable at best, or non-existent at worst.</p>
<p>The ten different establishments in the Tavern Kit do a fantastic job covering its bases. Warm, rural inns packed with ale, pipe smoke, and hearty stew. Shady suburban retreats where clients come to coordinate heists and fence stolen goods that also happen to serve excellent bread. Dens of vice packed with well-dressed temptations of flesh and chemical escapes. Bloodstained fight pits where patrons drink, fight, and place bets. The list goes on.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-tavern-descriptions.jpg?itok=5KsNsqAE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-tavern-descriptions.jpg?itok=twaYh3Vo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sensory info helps set a scene at a table. And each tavern sets the scene masterfully.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, people provide personality to a place. Every tavern has six NPCs with distinct personalities and attitudes.&nbsp; Each entry also has rewards and punishments for conversing with them alongside modifiers to the persuasion DC. These aren't background extras, but they don't completely overshadow the players' antics; a perfect balancing act for a TTRPG supporting cast.</p>
<p>My favorite inclusion in the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Tavern Kit are various games that can be played at each tavern. Generally, the games are light variations on parlor games – one is effectively <em>Blackjack </em>with dice rolls. They work great for establishing a theme and give players something to spend their gold on.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Tavern Kit's Inncounters Book gives GMs the tools to set up conflict at these establishments. They include dealing with drunken patrons up to getting into a bar brawl. The rules presented lean more into light cinematic presentation than tactical play, swinging on chandeliers, setting things on fire, a giant bruiser showing up, etc., which keeps things light and breezy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-golden-griffon-club-menu-screenshot.jpg?itok=3QGUSfgX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-golden-griffon-club-menu-screenshot.jpg?itok=GLR-GHbw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm already excited/terrified of how players will abuse these details.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Challenging are the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Encounters Boxes?</h2>
<p>Generally, the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Encounter boxes provide small, compact battles. Each encounter has about 4-5 miniatures and one battle map. In addition, the contained booklet includes adventure hooks and modifiers to keep things exciting.</p>
<p>On their own, these encounter boxes are packed with variety and delight. With the Tavern Kit, they become a wonderful jumping-off point for a new TTRPG campaign.</p>
<p>Because of this, expressing the quality of all eight boxes in the set in a single review is a major task. Thankfully fellow dice goblin,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/author/giaco-furino">Giaco Furino</a>, and I delved into that dungeon together as a team. Here are our thoughts.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-owlbear-miniatures.jpg?itok=rcrGcZ_p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-owlbear-miniatures.jpg?itok=vmH8wYLs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>An Owlbear Was Sighted... Setting Traps?</h2>
<p><em>From Tyler:</em> Those who watched the <em>D&amp;D</em> movie,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-adaptation-that-understands-its-roots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em></a>,&nbsp;know just how powerful Owlbears can be and according to whispers in the Nodding Dragon tavern, one is actively hunting and terrorizing local hunters.</p>
<p>This is curious since Owlbears generally aren't intelligent. But this one has dug traps, set up ambushes, and has been seen using magic.</p>
<p>This encounter is a great mix of boss battle and mystery story. What is going on with this Owlbear? How can the player stop it? Throw in a river hazard and some unexpected bursts of magic to the arena and you have a memorable forest brawl.</p>

<p><em>From Tyler</em>: For fans of spooky ghosts, the Wraith Encounter has you covered. Patrons at The Silver Purse gambling parlor have reported seeing a mysterious ghost-like entity. Those who see it report sickness and memory loss. These coincide with rumors that The Silver Purse was built on a forgotten temple.</p>
<p>The central gimmick is a ghostly encounter combined with a dungeon maze. Enemies use the Frightened condition to push adventurers into the maze's traps and keep them away from potentially helpful items.</p>
<p>The Wraith encounter is my favorite encounter box in the set. It delivers an atmospheric setpiece, puts a novel spin on a classic <em>D&amp;D</em> concept, and presents it all as an elaborate combat puzzle.</p>

<p><em>From Tyler:</em> For those who want a more nautical spin on a vengeful spirit, the Ghost Pirate Encounter is for you.</p>
<p>It is a familiar tale in the Salt &amp; Kraken tavern. A pirate captain seeks new crewmates. Except that captain has been dead for thirty years. Worse still, the people he recruits either show up years later barely alive at best, and dead at worst.</p>
<p>Generally, it is a solid swashbuckling encounter, if by the numbers. The arena is packed with environmental hazards and magical mist which can break caster's sightlines and keep martial classes on their toes. Not to mention the captain and his crew go after whoever has the most gold. Do with that what you will.</p>

<p><em>From Tyler:</em> The Night Hag encounter may be the most deceptively cosmic encounter in the set. It involves the titular hag setting up an elaborate ritual in the leyline-infused Adventurer's Rest tavern. If she is not stopped, she can tap into an infinite well of magic in its foundation and transcend to godhood.</p>
<p>This is an ambitious encounter against a CR 7 monster that low-level parties might not be prepared for. There is a clever environmental mechanic where characters can interrupt the ritual and buff casters, players can also take out the Hag's minions, permanently reducing her maximum HP.</p>
<p>It's an encounter that would be right at home in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/planescape-adventures-in-multiverse-review-player-options-still-disappoint" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Planescape</em></a> campaign and fits with the whimsical high-fantasy vibe of The Adventurer's Rest tavern. If you like your fantasy stories bold and bombastic, pick this up.</p>

<p><em>From Giaco</em>: Of the four Local Legends mini-encounters I received for review, this Green Dragon encounter might be one of my favorites (even if it is the “easiest” encounter of the group). Tied to the Huntsman’s Stag tavern as seen in the Tavern Kit, this adventure begins with food going missing from the inn’s larders, large footprints on the central table, and tales from exhausted hunters who can’t find “the green devil.”</p>
<p>That green devil is the titular Green Dragon of this encounter, a juvenile dragon who wants nothing more than to get a bite to eat and play innocent pranks on anyone who would hunt for it. As adventurers in this mini encounter, the goal is - first and foremost - to find the Green Dragon as it hides among Mangrove trees! And from there, it’ll swoosh and fly around the battle map, nipping at characters playfully and trying to knock them into the murky, cold, stagnant water of the Mangroves.</p>
<p>Fun and full of personality, this (potentially) combat light mini encounter delivers on the promise of these box sets - to surprise, delight, and inspire GM’s and players alike!</p>

<p><em>From Giaco</em>: For this Local Legends mini encounter, much like the Green Dragon encounter, this one’s not an out-and-out fight. Banjo the Hill Giant (great name) has made a nice little life for himself harassing the miners working in the pioneer town and frequenting the Draughty Rabbit tavern.</p>
<p>The fun twist on this mini encounter is how the Hill Giant uses the natural world around him. Once players track him down and find him standing at the top of his hill, he’ll continually roll giant boulders down the hill at them - inflicting some serious damage if they collide. It’s not until the adventurers schlep their way up the hill that the true fight begins, with Banjo trying to smash them with a giant bag filled with treasures.</p>
<p>Evocative and inventive, this is another Local Legends mini-encounter that feels much more memorable than a simple fight. It’s not really about squaring off against Banjo, it’s about avoiding his boulders and traps!</p>

<p><em>From Giaco:</em> This Local Legends mini encounter centers around the Shady Nook tavern and the local thieves guild that frequents the town. Drawn out by grief and suffering, this mini encounter features a fiend known as the Diaemus and the giant bats it calls down to attack the adventurers once they lure it out.</p>
<p>Of all the adventures I received, this one is - for me - the least compelling. Though there’s a bit of story to be pulled from the fact that this creature feeds on fear and despair, overall this isn’t much more than a rooftop battle. The miniature is nice, but other than that this one doesn’t truly break the mold like the others we’ve checked out.</p>

<p><em>From Giaco:</em> With a challenge rating of 11, the Efreet at the center of this Local Legends mini-encounter is by far the most challenging of the four I’ve checked out and it has one of the most interesting, closed-space encounters as well!</p>
<p>Taking place in the illicit but well-heeled Velvet Dreams tavern, the Efreet was summoned long ago and is stuck here. One of my favorite moments in any of these guidebooks is the suggestion that this Efreet was perhaps summoned by an intoxicated magic user who eventually sobered up and… forgot to banish the Efreet!</p>
<p>What a great concept, and now this terribly powerful and terribly angry genie is out for blood! With an incredible miniature and a truly difficult combat encounter within, this could easily have been expanded into a larger Epic Encounters box set -- but I really appreciate that it’s been kept contained within this easy-to-run, approachable box.</p>

            <p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 publisher Activision has made it clear that you cannot simply toggle off its upcoming game's much-hyped new "omnimovement" feature, which lets you sprint and dive in any direction.
</p>
<p>
Speaking via the <a href="https://youtu.be/KMFDkQ_5m1U">official Call of Duty podcast</a>, Activision confirmed omnimovement was a permanent mechanic in the game and a "global system" across all of its modes - campaign, multiplayer and zombies. And no, there's no option to switch it off. 
</p>
<p>
"Can you toggle omnimovement on and off?" Activision senior director of studio communications Stephanie Snowden said. "The answer is no. Omnimovement is a core foundational mechanic of the game, you cannot turn it off. But I think where people maybe got that impression was, we have another new feature, a part of movement, called Intelligent Movement."

<p>
Intelligent Movement is described as a "suite of player settings" that can be turned on or off designed to "reduce button presses", Treyarch associate director of design Matt Scronce said, for example to automatically sprint or automatically mantle, as well as add in slight delays to fit their personal preferences. 
</p>
<p>"Pulling off these manoeuvres, chaining them together, I think that's one really big piece about omnimovement that people should be really excited for," Snowden said. "It's not just sprinting 360 but how do you turn that into a slide, turn that into a dive, ADS while sliding..."</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forget-levolution-and-drivatars-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-now-has-omnimovement">Eurogamer got an extended look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> from Scronce and senior director of production Yale Miller last month, where our Chris Tapsell saw the game's Gulf War-set campaign mode and multiplayer for the first time. Sadly, we discovered, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-you-cant-play-as-margaret-thatcher-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">you can't play as Margaret Thatcher</a>.

            <p>My love of the chilly, lightless heavens is equalled only by my love of free things, and right now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> ticks both boxes. Cloud Imperium are offering free access to the long-in-the-making space game until July 19th, as part of <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/star-citizen/play-now">the latest Foundation Festival</a>. During that fleeting window of opportunity, you can try out 10 ships and enjoy such astral pastimes as stripping wrecks, busting asteroids, or getting blown up by other pilots. If you're an existing citizen of the stars, there are also festival-themed discounts of various kinds.</p><!--more-->
<p>I have nothing to add about the promotion itself, so instead I will reiterate that Star Citizen has been gestating for longer than most actual stars [citation needed]. It went into preproduction in 2010, was announced in 2012, and was once fondly slated for release in 2014. It has garnered hundreds of millions of dollars in crowd-funding over the years, with players recently invited to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-citizens-ridiculous-ship-prices-hit-a-new-high-with-46000-dlc-bundle">splurge an entire housing deposit's worth of pocket money on starships</a> which, the attentive reader will notice, are not physically existing vessels you can live in when you're old and penniless. There are a few of those ships on offer as part of this year's Foundation Festival. For example, a snackable £120 nets you the C1 Spirit, a "versatile cargo hauler". If you dislike the colour of your C1 Spirit, you can buy a pack of paintjobs for a scandalously cheap £24 or so - 30% off the usual asking price. </p>
<p>Alec Meer (RPS in peace) wrote a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-citizen-101-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-controversial">Star Citizen explainer in 2015</a> which now reads like a sparking terminal diary looted from one of the aforesaid derelicts. "No-one outside of [CI founder Chris Roberts] and his team know what's really going on, or whether Star Citizen can possibly live up to the expectations, the money, the dreams," he wrote. "And that is what Star Citizen is: the great unknown, even after almost three years." I dread to think what Alec, who has long since hyperspaced to sunnier pastures, would have made of this news article, had I managed to transmit it back through time. I can only hope that 10 years from now, somebody at RPS will have reviewed the 1.0 version.</p>
<p>I myself haven't yet played any version of Star Citizen, but I've heard the current build is actually quite full-featured - as of October 2023, its single-player component Squadron 42 was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-sim-squadron-42-is-feature-complete-and-gunning-for-starfields-lunch-with-massive-new-video">"feature-complete"</a>, and Graham <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-tech-underpinning-star-citizen-looks-mighty-impressive-in-new-trailer">thinks the sweat looked nice in the last round of footage</a>. I'll be giving it a go later. I'm less enthused about Cloud Imperium's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-citizen-devs-cloud-imperium-fined-for-discriminating-against-autistic-programmer-over-work-from-home-request">recent treatment of an autistic programmer over his work-from-home request</a>.</p>

            <p>
Larian has detailed what Baldur's Gate 3 players can expect from the seventh patch, due out in September.
</p>
<p>
As previously reported, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-adds-official-modding-toolkit-this-autumn">patch will include mod support</a> and, in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4240783699885624491">new post on Steam</a>, the studio has given a brief look at what some creators have achieved in the Closed Alpha.

</p>
<p>
But there are other additions coming too, including a much-needed tweak to split-screen play - dynamic split-screen mode - which allows players in multiplayer to split the screen and automatically merge it back into one when near each other.

<p>

Other improvements include a tweak to Honour Mode that provides more creatures with Legendary Actions, as well as the addition of new cinematics to evil playthroughs to offer a "grander finale".
</p>
<p>
Speaking of evil characters, a number of bug fixes will be implemented for Dark Urge players. Yet one thing looks set not to change - as the patch notes read:
</p>
<p>
"But will we be able to kiss Gortash?" we hear you plead. "We want to kiss Gortash!"
</p>
<p>
"Listen, he's a complicated guy who's busy contemplating the minutia of death cult office politics. Babygurl doesn't have time to kiss."
</p>
<p>
There are also various tweaks coming to specific characters, as well as party banter now supported for all players in multiplayer sessions.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, and despite previously dubbing this patch as a handover moment to the game's modding community, Larian has teased this patch won't in fact be the final update to Baldur's Gate 3.
</p>
<p>
"It's hard to believe it's almost been an entire year since we launched Baldur's Gate 3. But the journey isn't over yet," reads the patch notes.
</p>
<p>
"Patch 7 won't be the final update for Baldur's Gate 3. We still have a few things up our sleeve - including many community-requested features like crossplay and a photo mode to capture and share your unforgettable moments. And we're working on a host of other enhancements, from gameplay tweaks and quality-of-life improvements to bug fixes and performance optimisations."
</p>
<p>
Previously, Larian CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo">Swen Vincke stated that mod support would be a handover moment to players</a>, but it's great to hear support won't end entirely at this point.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-reveals-what-to-expect-from-the-huge-patch-7-and-teased-its-not-the-final-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> developer Larian has finally detailed what fans can expect from the long-awaited Patch 7, and teased that it is not the game’s final update.</p><p>In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4240783699885624491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Baldur’s Gate 3 Steam page</a>, Larian outlined everything coming up in Patch 7, due out in September. Highlights include split-screen updates, brand new cinematics for evil endings, plenty of bug fixes, and official modding tools.</p><p>In now trademark Larian fashion, it’s had fun with the patch notes, below. Here’s a snippet: “In the words of Michelangelo, no great work of art is ever finished, and so too is our approach to the art of snogging.”</p><p>Baldur's Gate 3 is Larian's enormously successful Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game that blew critics and players alike away upon its release in August 2023. Since then, Larian has issued a number of updates that have improved and added to the game. But do not expect a Baldur's Gate 4 from the studio, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-team-had-to-collect-so-many-different-awards-that-game-development-was-affected">which recently admitted that it won so many awards it began to affect development</a>. Larian has walked away from Baldur's Gate 3 DLC, a potential sequel, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons in general to work on brand new games of its own. Indeed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-boss-swen-vincke-reckons-hes-figured-out-act-1-of-his-post-baldurs-gate-3-game">Larian boss Swen Vincke has already started to tease one of them</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN 10 of 2023</h3></div></output><h2>Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 7 Patch Notes (Pre-Launch)</h2><p><strong>Split Screen Updates</strong></p><p>Dynamic split screen mode is incoming! With our next update, friends will no longer be eternally confined to their side of the screen - because the power of friendship transcends all obstacles, including screen partitions.</p><p>When playing in co-op, you’ll now have the option to have split screens merge into a single screen when you near one another. You can access this directly from the HUD and within the game settings, both in and out of combat.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/16/splitscreen-1721126459932.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><strong>Honour Mode Improvements</strong></p><p>We’re continuing to make improvements to combat in Honour Mode too. With Patch 7, even more creatures have been bestowed additional Legendary Actions, including the bulette, everyone’s favorite neighborhood surgeon, Malus Thorm, and githyanki Ch'r'ai Tska'an, Ch'r'ai Har'rak, and Ptaris.</p><p>Dror Ragzlin will now also be able to use a new spell called Arachnid Compulsion to rally the spiders that reside in the nearby pit to fight the real enemy - you.</p><p><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3 Modding Toolkit</strong></p><p>With this update also comes our official modding toolkit! Come September, you'll be able to load up your game with a range of new game mods, and even try your hand at making some yourself.</p><p>We recommend giving our Modding FAQ a look for more information on what modding support means for Baldur’s Gate 3.</p><p>We’re currently working with Baldur’s Gate 3 Mod Authors during our Closed Alpha, who have been busy testing out the toolkit. To find out what some of the Mod Authors have been working on during the Closed Alpha, keep reading!</p><p>The Toolkit itself will give you everything you need to edit or create entirely new content, including:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Items - Equipment like weapons and armours, consumables, and miscellaneous items.</li><li>Cosmetics - Including different hair, beards, and other textures.</li><li>Classes and Subclasses - Creating new variants or modifying existing ones to edit abilities, powers, and skills.</li><li>Races - These can be created and edited to determine overall appearance, as well as their individual powers and abilities.</li><li>Dice Skins - You’ll also have the ability to edit or redesign the appearance of your dice skins!</li><li>User Interface - Including extensions and restyling of the game UI.</li><li>Quality of Life Improvements - Such as mods that edit or improve gameplay that don’t rely on unsupported elements.</li></ul><p><strong>Evil Endings</strong></p><p>And, of course, Patch 7 will also be bringing several new cinematics that offer your more evil playthroughs a grander finale!</p><p>From avatar Origin characters, including the Dark Urge, to the multiple different pathways that you can take as your own player character, each new cinematic is yours to discover through nefarious means.</p><p>While we don’t want to give everything away just yet, you can feast your eyes on the teasers below - and be on the lookout for more heading your way soon!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/16/hopnor-mode-1721126503484.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/16/levitate-1721126544970.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><strong>Dark Urge Bug Fixes</strong></p><p>Along with the new evil ending cinematics coming this patch, we’ve introduced a number of improvements and bug fixes for our Dark Urge players - ironing out camera pops, missing inspiration, VFX, and a few other issues.</p><p>For instance, a bug has now been fixed where combat sometimes fails to trigger in the event that you decide to murder one of your companions as the Dark Urge and attack the party. This will now lead to combat with the rest of the gang. And Minthara will now respond accordingly if you’ve been stripped of Bhaal’s influence.</p><p>We may have also let a certain bard now join the party as a controllable character if there’s an empty slot, temporarily, of course.</p><p>“But will we be able to kiss Gortash?” we hear you plead. “We want to kiss Gortash!”</p><p>Listen, he’s a complicated guy who’s busy contemplating the minutia of death cult office politics. Babygurl doesn’t have time to kiss.</p><p><strong>Origin Character Bug Fixes</strong></p><p>This update will also see improvements made to some cinematics, endgame dialogues, and Origin characters - specifically things like clipping issues, a couple of broken triggers for quests, dialogues, and romances, the odd case of retrograde amnesia, and persistent exclamation marks.</p><p>Oh, and the Blade of Frontiers will no longer absent-mindedly swing his sword mere inches from the aorta of shorter races who try to recruit him.</p><p>Let’s look at some of the highlights!</p><p><strong>Wyll Highlights</strong></p><p>Patch 7 includes a heap of fixes for Wyll, ranging from improvements to his dialogue reactivity to fixes for romance scenes.</p><p>If you’ve experienced issues triggering the romance scene with Wyll, this update will fix that. Should your relationship be headed in that direction, the cutscene in question will now trigger when you speak to Wyll at camp before your Long Rest.</p><p>A bug that had been preventing his romance greeting from triggering has also been fixed, so players in Act III who have a stable, loving, and committed relationship with Wyll will now see his romance greeting triggering correctly.</p><p>We’ve fixed Wyll’s dialogue reactivity during the epilogue for partnered players who have either joined Karlach in the Hells or Lae'zel in the rebellion, and we also determined there simply weren’t enough opportunities to kiss Wyll during the epilogue. This update rectifies that with the option to ask for a kiss in more paths of Wyll’s epilogue dialogue.</p><p>And if you're in holographic form during the epilogue, he’ll no longer automatically assume he's talking to Lae'zel, which was weird.</p><p><strong>Astarion Highlights</strong></p><p>In Patch 7, we’ve made improvements to the facial animations of your character during some kissing cinematics, including with the ascended Astarion.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/16/astarion-1721126602101.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>We’ve also made tweaks to how Origin characters react within certain cutscenes, to enhance their emotional impact. For example, companions will show Astarion more empathy when he loses his ability to withstand sunlight.</p><p><strong>Lae’zel Highlights</strong></p><p>Lae’zel will now wait a little longer at her recruitment site if you tell her you’ll be returning. And once she’s set up at camp, she will also cycle through more varied idle animations.</p><p>This update will also put an end to an annoying issue where resurrecting Lae'zel on the beach in Act I would cause her to appear in the Party Line but not in the world, blocking you from leaving Act I.</p><p><strong>Karlach Highlights</strong></p><p>Along with some more general fixes for Karlach, she will now react to Dammon if she finds him dead after he has told her that he can help her.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/16/karlach-1721126652108.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>That sketchy fade-to-black that follows her final scene in Avernus, which also unintentionally gave you a very brief glimpse of the region in gameplay mode, was a visual bug that has also been fixed.</p><p>The dialogue block caused by choosing to stay with a different companion the morning after your second romance scene with Karlach is no more.</p><p>Also, she’ll no longer brush the shaved side of her head during her camp idle animation.</p><p>Wrong side, Karlach.</p><p><strong>Gale Highlights</strong></p><p>With a few tweaks to camera angles and fixes to animation pops, repeated dialogue, and missing VFX, we’ve polished up Gale and his scenes and further refined his donation UI.</p><p>That panel that opens when donating magical items to Gale? This will now show all items eligible for donation - including those on your person, your party’s inventories, and your Traveller’s Chest.</p><p>This is part of the work that began with Hotfix #16 to improve the donation UI and update a player’s ability to access certain quest-related items, which has now been completed. We’re reinstating the intended behaviour that was removed in Hotfix #17 as a temporary bug fix to missing UI functionality. So if you now deny Gale a magic item three times in a row with magical items either on your person, your party's inventories, or now from your Traveller’s Chest, he will leave your party.</p><p>Alternatively, selecting “I’m not giving you anything. Not now, not ever” will still cause Gale to leave your party forever.</p><p>We’ve also patched up a bug that was preventing the final dialogue between Gale and Mystra from triggering, as well as a scene in the endgame that would cut off before you could kiss.</p><p><strong>Shadowheart Highlights</strong></p><p>In addition to fixing a few of her animation bugs, this update fixes a number of quest issues for Shadowheart.</p><p>A bug that saw the Spear of Night either not being received, or being spoken about as if it hadn’t already been acquired, is no more. Another bout of amnesia has also been fixed, in which Shadowheart occasionally thought Viconia was still alive after killing her. The 'Daughter of Darkness' quest should also now close properly if you choose to surrender Shadowheart to Viconia.</p><p>And yes, we’ve tweaked a few kissing scenes for her too, fixing a broken romance cutscene that should have triggered after giving Shadowheart the Idol of Shar, and a kissing animation that will no longer kick in before the dialogue option is chosen. We’ve also polished up the appearance of neck kissing. In the words of Michelangelo, no great work of art is ever finished, and so too is our approach to the art of snogging.</p><p><strong>Party Banter Improvements</strong></p><p>Prior to this update, party banter between companion characters was limited to the characters controlled by a single player. In Patch 7, multiplayer parties will support banter between characters assigned to different players.</p><p>This patch also resolves issues that had been rendering some romance party banters inaccessible while adventuring.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>A closed beta for Patch 7 is set for July 22. “With all these bug fixes, updates to gameplay, and new features, we want to make sure we haven’t broken anything or introduced something that will make your computer explode,” Larian joked. Registration to test the patch is now open on Steam.</p><p>And finally, Larian teased there’s more to come from Baldur’s Gate 3, with Patch 7 now not the final update. Crossplay is still in the works, as is a photo mode.</p><p>“It’s hard to believe it’s almost been an entire year since we launched Baldur’s Gate 3. But the journey isn’t over yet,” Larian said.</p><p>“Patch 7 won’t be the final update for Baldur’s Gate 3. We still have a few things up our sleeve - including many community-requested features like crossplay and a photo mode to capture and share your unforgettable moments. And we’re working on a host of other enhancements, from gameplay tweaks and quality-of-life improvements to bug fixes and performance optimizations.</p><p>“We’ll keep you looped in on when those are likely to hit a little further down the line. In the meantime, stay in touch with us on our socials, stay tuned, and don’t forget to wear sunscreen.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-dev-asks-players-to-stop-afk-farming-please<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's not great experience.</h2></div><section><p>Ever since <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a> launched at the end of June it’s had an away from keyboard (AFK) problem. Now, developer Nexon has asked its player base to please stop going AFK and please refrain from AFK farming.</p><p>Nexon’s free-to-play co-op focused looter shooter has enjoyed enormous popularity, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-is-a-massive-hit-despite-its-various-controversies">with over 10 million players in just 10 days</a>. But out on the battlefield there’s an increasingly troublesome issue that’s driving some players up the wall: AFK farming.</p><p>AFK farming isn't a problem unique to The First Descendant, but in this game it’s particularly bad. The idea is players join a mission with others and simply twiddle their thumbs while everyone else does the hard work, then reap the rewards such as experience at the end.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The First Descendant Screenshots </h3></div></output><p>I’ve seen AFK farmers first-hand while playing The First Descendant — they’ll sometimes be spinning around in a circle, clearly in a bid to avoid any AFK detection Nexon may have in place. As players progress through the mission the AFK farmer will be forcibly teleported to catch-up, even to the boss fight, where they’ll continue to run around in circles.</p><p>Nexon <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1813092221216039047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a statement</a> in response on social media that covered AFK farming, as well as going AFK during co-op play generally. “If you need to step away, please do so in Albion only!” Nexon said, pointing to the game’s main town. But the statement also covers cheating, which is an increasing issue for The First Descendant.</p><p>Here’s the statement in full:</p><blockquote>Lately, there have been increasing reports of inappropriate behavior in our game. While the dev team is working on measures, we want to remind Descendants of the following guidelines:</blockquote><blockquote>1️⃣ The use, distribution, or creation of unauthorized programs is strictly prohibited. 🚫</blockquote><blockquote>2️⃣ Do not go AFK during co-op play. If you need to step away, please do so in Albion only! 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️</blockquote><blockquote>3️⃣ Please refrain from AFK farming during missions. 🤖🚫</blockquote><blockquote>We're always striving to create a fun and pleasant gaming environment for Descendants! 🎮✨</blockquote><blockquote>Please keep in mind these rules and help us build a greater community together! 🤝🌟</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This statement, which essentially amounts to a “play nice” warning, will only do so much, so players are calling on Nexon to add proper anti-cheat measures and anti-AFK farming mechanics. Some, however, are defending AFK farming because, they insist, they’re so sick of The First Descendant’s crushing grind that they’ve lost the will to play properly.</p><p>The First Descendant is a massive hit already, but Nexon will be mindful of growing its player count as the game evolves, and we've seen how difficult this has become for so many publishers and developers who have entered the ultra competitive live service market in recent years.</p><p>While The First Descendant is clearly a hit it is not without controversy, and sits on a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam. Players have heavily criticized <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-enjoys-big-player-numbers-on-steam-despite-microtransaction-hell"><u>The First Descendant's ultra aggressive monetization</u></a>, which includes $100 character bundles and premium customization items that expire after use. Nexon was also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-hit-with-destiny-icon-plagiarism-accusations-but-theres-seemingly-more-to-the-story"><u>accused of copying Destiny 2 icons</u></a> for the icons used in The First Descendant, something <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-dev-nexon-promises-to-change-controversial-icons-after-destiny-plagiarism-accusations"><u>the company has now said it will address in-game</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Anti-afk measures would be great. You already have it in Albion if you idle for too long you’re booted back to menu. </p><p>So far, that’s one of the very few things I don’t like about the game.</p></div>— James Getty (@DigitalHitmann) <a href="https://twitter.com/DigitalHitmann/status/1813105559593447493?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every game in god knows how long has auto kick, this game even has auto kick! I know because I've been kicked in Albion! This is kind of a toothless response to the problem, sadly</p>— NXN Gaming (@NXNStreams) <a href="https://twitter.com/NXNStreams/status/1813092773723316357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Generally speaking, The First Descendant is a mash-up of mechanics from various looter shooters already in the market. There’s more than a whiff of Destiny about The First Descendant’s design, systems, and mechanics, but then there’s also a lot of Warframe about it, too.</p><p>Last week, Nexon released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-patch-102-makes-some-big-changes-heres-what-it-does"><u>a significant update for The First Descendant</u></a> that makes some big changes to the game, but leaves some aspects that had become a topic of discussion within the community well alone.</p><p>IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-review"><u>The First Descendant review</u></a> returned a 5/10. We said: “The First Descendant has all the building blocks of a fantastic looter shooter, but they’re buried under a pile of monotonous quests, a terrible story, and an infuriating free-to-play model that has influenced its game design in the worst possible way.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It's a great deal if you can grab it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4332659-mclassic-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332659" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4332659-mclassic-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332659"></a><figcaption>mClassic Graphics Upscaler</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4332659-mclassic-2.jpg"></figure><p>This is a plug-and-play dongle that uses anti-aliasing to smooth jagged edges in games, sharpening and adjusting images to make them look better on your TV. This is particularly great for Nintendo Switch games, and to get the visual benefits, all you have to do is plug it into your console, plug in the supplied power cable, and then reconnect your HDMI cable from your TV into the mClassic dongle.</p><p>As mentioned above, it's great for Switch owners, but it also works just as well with even older consoles that have an HDMI port. Retro consoles that don't have that port--like the GameCube, N64, and Super Nintendo--can still make use of the mClassic Upscaler through an HDMI adapter. This is especially useful when you don't have a traditional CRT TV--or it has finally gone on to TV heaven. Of course, this isn't a foolproof solution, and results may vary depending on your TV or console.</p><p>While this mClassic deal is only around until 2 PM PT, it's also just one of the many deals happening today and tomorrow during Prime Day.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amber-isle-release-date-promises-dino-shop-shenanigans-in-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 and developer Ambertail Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle&nbsp;</em>release date, so get ready to open your prehistoric store and befriend a village of friendly dinos.</p>
<p><em>Amber Isle</em>'s official release date is October 10th on PC, and a Nintendo Switch version will follow "soon after", although the two studios haven't yet confirmed when we can expect that version to arrive.</p>
<p>The game sees you setting up shop on the titular Amber Isle, which a host of prehistoric animals call their home. You'll inherit a failing shop, and it's your job to turn it around and make it a profitable endeavor, all while getting to know the dinos around you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amber-isle-release-date-haggling.jpg?itok=ShHCLYWD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amber-isle-release-date-haggling.jpg?itok=9sDK-mEA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Amber Isle&nbsp;</em>sees you inheriting a failing shop in a dino-filled village.</figcaption></figure><p>First, you'll create what Ambertail and Team17 call a "Paleo-persona", and then you'll get stuck into stocking your shelves, haggling with customers, and looking for new things to craft and sell in your shop.</p>
<p>It's all being done with a view to convincing some of the folks who've left Amber Isle to come back again, bringing the island back from "the brink of fossilization". Luckily, this one doesn't have "extinction-level event" vibes.</p>
<p>You can check out the release date trailer, which also shows off some of&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle</em>'s lovely cartoony visuals and its cozy setting, right here.</p>

<p>You'll be able to name your shop whatever you like, and you'll also have control over what it looks like, so you can decorate it however you please.</p>
<p><em>Amber Isle&nbsp;</em>has 48 different "Paleofolk" (that's the dinos and other animals that make up the community) to meet, and they're not all dinosaurs, either; some are Ice Age mammals, while others might be invertebrates or marine life.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Recettear</em>, not to mention&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/paleo-pines"><em>Paleo Pines</em></a>, then you'll probably want to give this one a look.&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663040/Amber_Isle/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">for PC</a> on October 10th, with a Switch version to follow soon.</p>

It can be traded for cosmetic items like hats and scarves that will turn your bird-riding shepherd into a fashion icon. These are, as you can imagine, absolutely essential.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To collect wool, you'll need to find grazing spots where your hungry herd can munch the days away—and perhaps even reveal a few secrets. During a recent chat with creative director Ricky Haggett and programmer Mike Robinson, we learned that although sheep were always envisioned as part of the game, the mechanic morphed a lot during development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The pull of wool">The pull of wool</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially, sheep were pitched as weird creatures called "ongles, gongles, and bongles." They were strange pink oddities that could be sheared for different resources, but it was a pitch that immediately felt too complex. At that stage, different variants of those sheep-like creatures would produce unique resources such as feathers or wool. Players could use those to craft different items, but it felt a lot like busywork. "There was more breadth [at that stage]," says Haggett, who concedes there was also more "guff."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For a long time, players also had to keep track of their herds. There were no markers on the map, and the singing mechanic that lets players locate their bleating friends hadn't been added. It was a system that, in Haggett's own words, created a lot of "oh fuck" moments when players realized they had lost their livestock and had no way of finding them without scouring the entire map.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That complexity began to fall away when the Hollow Ponds team realized they had to create a "symbiosis" between exploring a huge sprawling world and finding a sense of purpose. It became clear that striking that balance didn't require a hugely complex crafting system or textile economy, but rather a mechanic that could anchor players without feeling overbearing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, at one point </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> featured a lost sheep system that would effectively punish players for misplacing their baa-rmy pals. "We got rid of it because it just felt [wrong]," says Haggett. "Over time we just streamlined the process of the sheep and became a lot more chill about it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the mechanic was fine-tuned, the team also acknowledged that obscuring the fact </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ongles and bongles were essentially sheep was somewhat ludicrous. "There was a point where we were just like 'these are sheep. Let's just make them sheep and have wool.' And wool is nice because you can knit things out of wool," says Haggett.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A final flourish of shear brilliance">A final flourish of shear brilliance</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The finishing touch eventually came in the form of meadows. These are designated spots where players can drop sheep so they can graze (generating wool in the process).&nbsp;You can't just plonk sheep anywhere, so pushing players to find meadows adds another layer to exploration. It also presented an opportunity for one last twist. "The other thing that massively changed with the meadow came quite late in development was the Burgling Bewl," explains Haggett.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the uninitiated, 'Burgling Bewls' are pesky creatures that hide in meadows and can only be yanked from their hidey hole once sheep have trimmed the grass. Apprehending Burgling Bewls unlocks new whistles, which teach songs that can be used to charm different species so they can be recruited to your flock.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was, for Haggett, a stroke of subtle genius that finally made the sheep make sense. "[Writer and narrative designer] Phillippa Warr was one of the people who spent ages trying to figure out how to better tie the sheep into the game," he says. "For a long time, the sheep were almost this separate thing—and a couple of times we were like 'should we just cut the sheep?' Because they were just this weird way of getting clothes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For a while, we had this convoluted system where you had to feed the sheep, get wool, then you could find song stones for different species, then you'd need to find a bird trainer to teach you songs, and you'd have to pay them in wool. It was this multi-tiered system where you needed the sheep so you could get wool, so you could pay the bird trainer to teach you the songs–but only after you'd found all the stones."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was an disjointed system that felt impossible to tutorialize, so hitting upon the idea of concealing Burgling Bewls into meadows was akin the striking gold. "Effectively what it is [now] is like finding a treasure chest in Zelda and getting a reward. [...] It's a bit of a skinner box where you wait for the bar to fill up and then get a prize," says Haggett. He admits to being concerned it might feel a bit "cheap," but says it solved so many design problems "so elegantly" that, ultimately, it stuck.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>
Modders have been hard at work since the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree, releasing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-most-popular-mods-make-shadow-of-the-erdtree-far-easier">plenty of mods to make it a little easier to complete</a>.

</p>
<p>
That's certainly true of this mod from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5264?tab=description">FlippantTunic22 over on Nexus Mods</a>, which replaces certain Spirit Ash summons with bosses from the DLC.
</p>
<p>
So far 11 bosses have been included. I won't list them all for spoiler reasons, but it does include the Divine Beast Dancing Lion and Messmer the Impaler you will have seen in the DLC's trailer - right up to the final boss.

<p>
As <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24197346/elden-ring-mod-summon-bosses-as-allies">Polygon</a> shared, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S_9Kuy8faU&amp;t=885s">YouTuber KanesGrace</a> has posted a video of the mod in action and it's very amusing to watch bosses battle against each other.
</p>
<p>
One of the summons even includes a Furnace Golem, which towers over the player but does come in handy against a certain... sunflower.
</p>
<p>
At the least, don't tell anyone it's cheating to summon Spirit Ashes - though maybe with these it is, actually.
</p>
<p>More bosses will be added too, with a separate mod on the way for bosses from the base game.</p>
<p>
It reminds me of YouTuber BjornTheBear who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-pacifist-turtle-pope-wins-modded-battle-royale">pitted all the bosses from the base game against one another</a> - and the pacifist turtle pope came out on top.

</p>
<p>
Still, if you're struggling with the final boss, you'd do a lot worse than to summon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-legend-let-me-solo-her-changes-name-again-for-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-final-boss">Let Me Solo Her who's changed their name to help players tackle the DLC's finale</a>.

            <p>The ouroboros is a snake eating its own tail: an infinite thing, a never ending cycle. While I do think this is a rather metal logo, there's an argument to be made that it's not current or trendy enough. With this in mind, I think the words "Call Of Duty" should represent the endless, unstoppable nature of existence. And with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> revealing its multiplayer open beta and early access dates, we must further consume and be consumed by the circular march of COD. Let's dolphin dive in, shall we.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Right, so. The dates according to COD's latest <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/07/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-mp-beta-dates-revealed">blog post</a>: if you pre-order the game or you're a Game Pass subscriber (you have an active subscription to Game Pass Ultimate or PC), you'll get access to the first beta weekend. This begins from Friday August 30th at 10am PT/ 13:00 ET/ 18:00 BST and ends on Wednesday September 4th at the same times.</p>
<p>The second weekend is the open beta, meaning anyone can get access. This begins on Friday September 6th at 10am PT/ 13:00 ET/ 18:00 BST and ends on Monday September 9th at the same times again. It's worth dropping in a reminder here that both of these beta periods are for the multiplayer mode only, so not zombies or the singleplayer. You'll get to build loadouts, shoot some guys, and scream at your monitor in frustration.</p>
<p>For those who've pre-ordered the super duper Vault Edition of the game, you'll get to play as four Operators (Park, Adler, Brutus or Klaus) during the betas. They are a variety of armoured lads, one of whom has a helmet that reminds me of the soldier from that old FPS Timeshift. And you'll also get to test out five weapons from the "Mastercraft" weapon collection, which look to be colourful and suitably powerful snipers and assault rifles and knives. I imagine they'll be powerful during the beta, and then like, fizzle into obscurity once people arrive at a meta on release.</p>
<p>As the resident Call Of Duty-liker (sorry), I'm mildly excited by the prospect of more FPSing. I'm particularly intrigued by the "omnimovement" they showed off during their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwYyRGGBzmU">Xbox Showcase segment</a>, which lets you sprint or dive in any direction for the first time. This means you can rotate 360 degrees while prone or shoot in the opposite direction to where you're moving, which suggests it could go one of two ways: 1) flexible fun for all the family; 2) sightlines are broadened and strategic positioning isn't as vital as it was before, meaning maps feel even more like a death blender. Let's hope it's the former, eh.</p>

            <p>
Former Speaker of the House John Bercow voices a character in the forthcoming Fallout: London mod.
</p>
<p>
Bercow was Speaker of the House in the UK Parliament, known for yelling "Order!" at rowdy MPs during his tenure. More recently, you may have spotted him in second season of The Traitors US.
</p>
<p>
Next he'll make an appearance in Fallout: London as, fittingly, a robot Speaker of the House. His inclusion means he will join the likes of Neil Newbon (Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3), Anna Demetriou (Sophia in A Plague Tale: Requiem), and two Doctor Who actors: Sylvester McCoy and Colin Baker.

<p>

The mod team made the announcement on its <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/1234891241184038973/1262112282825986058">Discord</a>. "Imagine being Fallout: London and feeling so lucky having all the talented voice actors on the team. But then boosting it further with the fact that we have two Doctor Who actors as VAs... then Neil Newbon messages us and also wants a role," wrote project manager Dean "Prilladog" Carter.
</p>
<p>
"But the cherry on the top? Who better to represent our mod's version of the Speaker of the House, than a Robot version voiced by John Bercow himself."
</p>
<p>
The announcement includes a short clip of Bercow in action, although it seems his robot is having a bit of trouble - the clip quickly distorts into repeating "order!".
</p>

<p>
And, as <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-claims-john-bercow-voice-acting">VG247</a> pointed out, while some comments suggested this is an AI rather than Bercow himself, Carter replied shortly: "We don't use AI voices".

</p>
<p>
Yesterday, the mod's distributor GOG confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-will-work-with-fallout-4-on-gog-and-steam-but-not-epic">Fallout: London won't work with versions of the game bought on the Epic Games Store</a> due to its lack of rollback features.

</p>
<p>
The mod is based on Fallout 4, but set in an alternate London with all-new locations, weapons, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-update-details-new-weapons-iconic-locales-and-a-james-bond-twist">a James Bond twist</a>.

<p>A new update on the Rockstar Games website suggests that GTA+ might be coming to the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>The update was first spotted by <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1812959219680768485?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TezFunz2</a> on X (formerly Twitter). It shows that Rockstar Games has updated its platform list for “Games Included with GTA+” to include Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>GTA+ is the premium membership option for players. The membership grants access to several different Rockstar Games titles and bonus content for GTA Online.</p>



<p>As pointed out by Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1812961670865821756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@videotechuk_</a>, GTA V doesn’t exist on the Nintendo Switch, so users will find it complicated or next to impossible to subscribe to the service on the platform. However, it could potentially be confusing for those wanting to subscribe.</p>



<p>As for when the potential change could come into effect, the change on the website suggests an announcement could be made soon.</p>



<p>GTA+ currently costs $7.99/£6.99 per month. This month’s rewards for GTA Online players included:</p>



<ul>
<li>Free Vehicle</li>



<li>Free Chameleon Paints</li>



<li>Free Clothes</li>

That last one is important, as it's quite likely we'll be getting a Switch successor / the next Nintendo console within the next year or so (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-may-have-just-accidentally-been-revealed-bygameshark">if rumors are to be believed</a>). Therefore, you're going to want to opt for the latest in SD card tech, which is a <strong>micro SDXC UHS-I U3 A2 V30 memory card</strong>. Here are the best deals this Prime Day that adhere to those specs.</p><div><div id="204032" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Amazon Basics Micro SDXC Memory Card 256GB</h3></p><div><p>512GB also down to $32.99.</p></div></div><div id="204033" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Lexar 1TB PLAY microSDXC Memory Card</h3></p></div><div id="204034" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>SanDisk 1.5TB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card</h3></p></div></div><h2>Preorder Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition Console</h2><p>It's not too late for Nintendo to release new Switch Lite editions. Best Buy is offering preorders of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/xPbmb?object_uuid=558013c6-4c90-4758-ab69-56eac42d873a&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch Lite: Hyrule Edition</a> handheld console for $209.99 with orders shipping out on September 26. That's $10 more than a stock Switch Lite, but that's more than justified by the fact that this edition includes a 12-month Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. </p><div id="203239" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Preorder the Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition</h3></p><div><p>Includes 12-month Switch Online membership + Expansion Pass</p></div></div><h2>Nintendo Switch Games on Sale - Prime Day 2024</h2><p>Alongside Nintendo Switch accessories, there are dozens of Nintendo Switch games on sale for Prime Day. Some of these titles are available at record prices, with discounts of up to 75% off. We've rounded up the best Switch games on sale for Prime Day here, with a few selections below that you do not want to miss.</p><h3><strong>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance for $39.99</strong></h3><div id="203275" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance Steelbook Launch Edition - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-review"><u>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</u></a> is now on sale for the first time since launch! During Prime Day, you can save $20 off this massive title, which was just released last month. SMT V: Vengeance is an enhanced version of the former Nintendo Switch exclusive SMT V, launched in 2019. The biggest feature available in this upgraded re-release is the all new Canon of Vengeance route, which is essentially 40 hours of new story content. At $39.99, this is a steal for what will likely end up being one of the most popular RPGs of the year.</p><h3>Octopath Traveler II for $29.99</h3><div id="203361" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Octopath Traveler II - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div>
<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/octopath-traveler-2-review">Octopath Traveler II</a> was one of the most overlooked RPGs of 2023, featuring an extremely unique narrative with the perspective of eight characters. Utilizing Square Enix's HD-2D technology, Team Asano heavily built on the foundation that was laid with the first Octopath Traveler in 2018. If you're interested in the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-is-as-faithful-as-you-could-ask">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, this is a great chance to experience an HD-2D title for the first time.<h3>Unicorn Overlord for $34.99</h3><div id="203279" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Unicorn Overlord - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div>

<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-rpg-review">Super Mario RPG</a> was initially released in 1996 for the SNES, and over two decades later, a remake has been released for Nintendo Switch. As one of the wackiest Mario titles, there are dozens of unique characters to discover who have never appeared outside of this title. It's also one of the rare occasions where Mario and Bowser work together - the King of the Koopas even joins your party! The legendary Yoko Shimomura even returned to compose the soundtrack, making for an unforgettable Mario experience.<h3><strong>Super Mario Bros.

            <p>I know as much about programming video game monsters as I do the exact flavour and consistency of the sands on Mars, but I've always thought the chief advantage of the Slime monster archetype is its economy. A slime, in most games, is a squashy smiley face. Why, I could grow myself one of those right this very instant, by doodling a circle in MS Paint and squinting very hard. Slimes <em>do</em> take more complex forms - chrome slimes, fire slimes, slimes with angry eyebrows, etc - but come now, it's not on the same level as rebooting Lara Croft's hair to billow in the blowback from grenades.</p>
<p>The simplicity of slime creation may soon become a distant memory, however, for Epic Games tech artist and current Duck Shake Games Asher Zhu is hell-bent on reinventing the homely Dragon Quest sludgeball as a technical tour de force on par with his previous contributions to Unreal Engine showcase Matrix Awakens. That's the impression I garner from the below video of Zhu's latest project, anyway, whose description also tantalises with talk of "Splatoon mechanics in dungeons".</p><!--more-->

<p>As detailed on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vuth/recent-activity/all/">Linkedin</a>, Zhu became director of Duck Shake Games - which has two employees at the time of writing - in April 2024, after around five and a half years at Epic, where he was a technical artist working across R&amp;D projects involving <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unreal-engine-5-now-available-in-full">the aforesaid Matrix demo</a>.</p>
<p>Fluid physics appears to have been a focus, and that expertise is certainly coming in handy with the slime game, which Zhu began fiddling around with during his time at the Unreal Engine manufacturer (I picture him prodding a drawerful of neon mucus between stints at the Fortnite coalface).</p>
<p>He's recently "restarted [the project] from scratch" with "a new fluid solver that enabled real(?) slime movement and slimeling spawning." Slimeling spawning! You can see it in the video: splash the slime against something and it bursts into multiple, adorable mini-slimes that hasten to rejoin the central mass - like chicks racing back to the mother hen, except that they are gelatinously absorbed on contact. From the looks of things, you can also forcefully jettison portions of slime tissue in order to double-jump. Unspeakable are the ways of slimes. Unspeakable, and marvellous.</p>
<p>The game surrounding the slime appears as fluid as the entity itself - I get the sense that Zhu is just having fun with a prototype at this stage. But older videos hint at a slice-of-life fantasy RPG in which you can manipulate the slime and other objects with a clawed hand cursor - showering it in a bathtub to restore its mass on summer days, firing it around like an elastic band, and "yeeting" it at elven mages using a frying pan. The agonising corrosive deaths of eleven mages aside, Zhu's WIP footage is awash with whimsical elements such as the slime carbonating itself by ingesting soda cans, and yep yep yep, more of this kind of thing, thanks.</p>

<p>Let me slop two concluding gobbets of contextual ooze atop the pert and glistening blob of unfiltered enthooziasm that is this nooze article. Firstly, real-life slime mould is all the rage among experimental artists, particularly those working across latter-day shades of posthumanism and eco-criticism with a stake in labour politics. Here's <a href="https://digicult.it/articles/modeling-communication-with-slime-mould-artistic-residency-with-sarah-grant/">a piece</a> on one particular artistic residency which looks at slime mould growth as a model for networked resilience within communities. Secondly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mushroom-11-review">Mushroom 11</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/earthtounge-vivarium-sim">Earthtongue</a> remain the slime sims to beat, IMO, though in a distressing lapse, neither of them lets you yeet anything from a frying pan. Do you have a favourite slime simulator, perhaps spawned by one of the many <a href="https://itch.io/jam/slime-studio-jam/entries">slime game jams</a>? I must hear about it, I must. </p>

<p>The thing is, this all got a bit too much to handle for Larian. Speaking in an interview with EDGE magazine (<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Faaa-fallout-crpg-was-larians-alternative-pick-if-they-didnt-get-the-baldurs-gate-license-from-wizards-of-the-coast%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.magazinesdirect.com%2Faz-magazines%2F6936449%2Fedge-magazine-subscription.thtml&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=-120&amp;xuuid=0ad38a56c8611bae7d8f9493083ecd87&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue #400</a>), CEO Swen Vincke explained that the sheer amount of ceremonies they needed to attend caused a workflow disruption:</p>
<p><em>It affects development - there's a lot of them. This has been a real problem. We had to rotate teams so that different people went to different award shows. It would be cool if everybody could agree to do it all at the same time because it is surprisingly draining on the soul.</em></p>
<p>Nowadays, Larian has nearly moved on from Baldur's Gate 3 after <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-no-sequel-dlc-larian-dropping-dungeons-and-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refusing to create a sequel or even DLCs</a>. The team has decided to leave the Forgotten Realms behind and create something entirely new. They have two original projects on the way, and they've just <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-opens-new-office-in-warsaw-to-help-make-its-two-very-ambitious-new-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> a new office in Warsaw, Poland, to grow even further.</p>
<p>However, they are still working on a final update to add the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-closed-alpha-starts-today-with-beta-in-july-and-release-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official modding tools</a> (the Alpha started last month, while the Beta is expected later this month) in September. As per the community's request, the evil endings will also be improved.</p>
