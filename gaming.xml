<p>Sink your teeth in</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Poncle has just released a brand new gameplay trailer for its upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> spin-off, <em>*deep breath*</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_crawlers_the_turbo_wildcard_from_vampire_survivors">Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard from Vampire Survivors</a>, which is coming out some time in 2026.</p>
<p>And it probably should come with a health warning, because the chaotic blobber-inspired (that's a term used to describe a number of first-person RPGs from the '80, broadly) dungeon crawling rogue-lite is going to be a huge time sink, just like Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>Anyway, Vampire Crawlers will introduce your vampire hunting friends to turn-based combat, brand new abilities, new ways to use existing abilities, and... digging?</p>

<p>We've also got a sneak peak at some familiar locations, a museum, and other buildings that you'll likely need to use to progress. And yet somehow, it all seems to come together with that same moreish Vampire Survivors flair.</p>
<p>More details will be coming soon on the game, but for now, we just want to know when to take some time off work to sink our teeth into the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda has been known to 'jump the gun' when it comes to announcing its upcoming titles. Starfield, for example, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-reveal-e3-90-percent-likely-2021-launch/">was a game we knew about for years before it released</a>, and there's an argument to be made that it was to the game's detriment that we knew about it coming for so long. Now, the same could be happening with The Elder Scrolls VI, as Bethesda provided an update on the game's development in a recent interview that essentially amounts to the studio saying nothing more than it's still coming.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development">GameInformer</a>, three lead members of Bethesda spoke about how things are going with The Elder Scrolls VI. Studio director Angela Browder, director and executive producer Todd Howard, and studio design director Emil Pagliarulo. </p>



<p>No one dared to suggest a release window of any sort, and all of them said some version of Howard's initial comment, which was that "<em>It's progressing really well</em>." Pagliarulo was perhaps the most blunt and furthest away from marketing-speak, as he said, "<em>I can say that it's going</em>!"</p>



<p>"<em>It's funny, because the time pressure that players put on us, we don't put on ourselves,</em>" Pagliarulo continued. "<em>And I know that can be frustrating for players who are dying to play a game. Games take a long time, and games get pushed all the time; GTA just got pushed again, which was the smartest thing they could do, because a game the size of these games they take not just a long time to make, but a long time spit and polish and iron out the bugs. And so, what do fans really want? Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn't meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know? That's what I think people are going to want. So, we're going to make our time and as long as it needs to be great</em>."</p>



<p>Howard was much more succinct with his words. After saying that it is "<em>progressing really well</em>," he added, "<em>the majority of the studio's on VI, but I'll say this: we always overlap. So, we're very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it's a process. We wish it went a little bit faster - or a lot faster - but it's a process that we want to get right</em>."</p>



<p>Lastly, Browder added that they are "<em>actively excited about what's in front of us</em>," with how hardware and technology have improved since development on The Elder Scrolls VI first started, <a href="https://wccftech.com/uesp-wiki-met-bethesda-design-character-the-elder-scrolls-vi-excited/">a comment that we've seen before regarding the game's protracted development</a>. "<em>The Elder Scrolls VI is this endless set of possibilities that is really, really exciting as a developer</em>," Browder added.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it's good that the developers at Bethesda aren't putting a massive amount of pressure on themselves to try and get The Elder Scrolls VI done as soon as possible. No one does their best work if they're also always trying to think about getting their work done as fast as possible. Sometimes, you really do just need to sit with something and let it take as long as it takes before you end up in a good place.</p>



<p>That said, knowing that doesn't necessarily make the waiting easier for players. <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">Even as Howard "<em>preaches patience</em>,"</a> the more the game sits in players minds as nothing but a short teaser that was shown to early, the more volatile its eventual launch will feel, which could be great for the game, or it could have the same impact it did with Starfield, where players are largely unimpressed with what Bethesda spent years toiling away on. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912</link>
            <guid>1385083</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Larian Studios is experimenting <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-studios-gen-ai-divinity-bg3-2000653850">with generative AI</a> and fans aren’t too happy. The head of the <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> maker, Swen Vincke, released a new statement to try to explain the studio’s stance in more detail and make clear the controversial tech isn’t being used to cut jobs. “Any [Machine Learning] tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft,” he said.</p> <p>He was responding to a backlash that arose earlier today from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">a <em>Bloomberg</em> interview</a> which reported that Larian was moving forward with gen AI despite some internal concerns among staff. Vincke made clear the tech was only being used for things like placeholder text, PowerPoint presentations, and early concept art experiments and that nothing AI-generated would be included in Larian’s upcoming RPG, <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845"><em>Divinity</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The reaction on social media was swift. “Don’t mind me, currently living through my personal 9/11,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/okbuddybaldur/comments/1po65yn/dont_mind_me_currently_living_through_my_personal/">wrote</a> one fan on Reddit. “Consider my feedback: I loved working at Larian until AI,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g">wrote</a> an artist who worked on <em>BG3</em>. “reconsider and change your direction, like, yesterday. show your employees some respect. they are world-class &amp; do not need AI assistance to come up with amazing ideas.”</p>

 <p>Vincke has since tried to address those concerns in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">long statement sent to <em>IGN</em></a>:</p> <blockquote><p>We’ve been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists, writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Since concept art is being called out explicitly – we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Any ML tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>While I understand it’s a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it’s something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone’s working day better, not worse.</p></blockquote> <p>The studio head reiterates that Larian is hiring more artists, not fewer, and that it’s bulking up its creative resources for its upcoming game, not trying to cut corners with AI. There won’t be AI in <em>Divinity</em>, Vincke has promised, and the aim is to help employees, not force the tech on them as some publishers like EA <a href="https://kotaku.com/nhl26-ai-ea-college-football-madden-card-packs-2000646229">have reportedly been doing</a>.</p> <p>But the statement doesn’t necessarily address deeper divisions over generative AI tools, which many have likened to being plagiarism machines, and the skepticism that’s bound to arise from letting it near game development at all. “Early Access and the way they managed their community across all their updates helped humanize that team in ways that only helped <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, weird for the studio to be so willing to throw all that goodwill away,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeffgerstmann.com/post/3ma4izugsds24">wrote</a> former<em> Giant Bomb</em> host Jeff Gerstmann.</p>

            <guid>1385080</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>If you can take your mind way back to the beginning of 2025, you might remember a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/is-2025-finally-the-real-year-of-half-life-3-confirmed/">fresh wave</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/fresh-leaks-suggest-half-life-3-development-may-be-nearing-completion/">rumors</a> suggesting that <em>Half-Life 3</em> was finally reaching the final stages of production, and could be announced and/or released at any moment. Now, though, 2025 seems set to come to a close without any official news of a game fans have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/12/valves-doug-lombardi-kinda-confirms-half-life-3/">waiting</a> literal <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/half-life-3-totally-absolutely-confirmed-by-hidden-dota-2-update-file/">decades</a> for.</p>
<p>That doesn’t necessarily mean a <em>Half-Life 3</em> announcement and/or release isn’t imminent, though. On the contrary, veteran journalist Mike Straw insisted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/x7GRLcaZtgA">on a recent Insider Gaming podcast</a> that “everybody I’ve talked to are still adamant [<em>Half-Life 3</em>] is a game that will be a launch title with the Steam Machine.”</p>
<p>Straw—who has <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1514651538026815490">a long</a> <a href="https://x.com/mikestrawmedia/status/1869824116339159465?s=46">history</a> of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-in-development/">reporting</a> gaming rumors <a href="https://mikestrawmedia.com/column/lets-talk-about-anonymous-sources/">from anonymous sources</a>—said this <em>Half-Life 3</em> information is “not [from] these run-of-the-mill sources that haven’t gotten me information before. … These aren’t like random, one-off people.” And those sources are “still adamant that the game is coming in the spring,” Straw added, noting that he was “specifically told [that] spring 2026 [is the window] for the Steam Machine, for the Frame, for the Controller, [and] for <em>Half-Life 3</em>.”</p>
<h2>For real, this time?</h2>
<p>Tying the long-awaited <em>Half-Life 3</em> to a major hardware push that has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">already been announced for an “early 2026” window</a> certainly sounds plausible, given previous leaks about the game’s advanced state of development. But there are still some reasons to doubt Straw’s “adamant” sources here.</p>
<p>For one, Straw admitted that the previous information he had received on potential <em>Half-Life 3</em> launch and/or announcement dates was not reliable enough to report in detail. “I had been told a date. I was not going to report that date because they weren’t 100 percent confident in that date,” he said. “That date has since passed.”</p>

                <p>While learning a language is challenging, it's never been easier to start, thanks to the abundance of learning apps and online classes. One of the longest-running and highest-rated of these is <a href="https://go.linkby.com/ONMGOMZQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rosetta Stone</a>. The service offers comprehensive courses in 25 languages, all of which use a unique immersion learning style, making it one of the most effective language learning programs out there. Of course, as with any language-learning program, the trick is to stick with it--luckily, Rosetta Stone is offering <strong>a limited-time discount on lifetime subscriptions</strong>, dropping the price to<strong> just $149 (was $400)</strong>, which could make it much easier to commit to the process.</p><p>While the Lifetime Subscription is arguably the best deal, it's not the only Rosetta Stone discount. The 3-Month Plan is on sale for $48 (was $60; billed every three months), while the 12-Month Plan is $126 (was $240; billed every 12 months). While the Lifetime Plan includes all 25 languages (listed below), monthly plans only unlock a single language--making the lifetime subscription by far the best deal. All plans offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. Rosetta Stone also lets you gift plans to others, which could make this deal a fun holiday gift. Here's a look at all the options side-by-side:</p><h2>Rosetta Stone Subscription Discounts</h2><ul><li>Lifetime Plan -- $149 (<del>$400</del>) (single payment) | Includes 25 languages</li><li>12-month plan -- $126 (<del>$240</del>) (billed annually) | Includes one language</li><li>3-month plan -- $48 (<del>$60</del>) (billed every 3 months) | Includes one language</li></ul><p>Rosetta Stone's deals are only available for a limited time, so be sure to sign up at these discounted rates before they disappear.</p><p>Rosetta Stone offers mobile and web apps, all of which grant you access to the same set of lessons, activities, and learning tools. Rosetta Stone uses an immersion learning approach where lessons primarily use the langauge you're trying to learn, rather than relying on explanations and translations in your native language, especially as you pass the early lessons. That may sound more intimidating than, say, Duolingo, but the upshot is this approach is closer to how you would learn a language if you moved to a new country, which helps your brain learn the information faster.</p><p>Along with the lesson plans, Rosetta Stone also includes access to free livestream classes and interactive activities like Seek &amp; Speak visual vocabulary scavenger hunts, a collection of stories read by native speakers, and a Phrasebook filled with common words and phrases that use Rosetta Stone's proprietary TruAccent tool to aid in your pronunciation accuracy. The vast majority of Rosetta Stone's content is also downloadable and usable offline.</p><h2>Rosetta Stone Languages</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Arabic</li><li dir="ltr">Chinese (Mandarin)</li><li dir="ltr">Dutch</li><li dir="ltr">English (American)</li><li dir="ltr">English (British)</li><li dir="ltr">Farsi (Persian)</li><li dir="ltr">French</li><li dir="ltr">German</li><li dir="ltr">Greek</li><li dir="ltr">Hebrew</li><li dir="ltr">Hindi</li><li dir="ltr">Irish</li><li dir="ltr">Italian</li><li dir="ltr">Japanese</li><li dir="ltr">Korean</li><li dir="ltr">Latin</li><li dir="ltr">Polish</li><li dir="ltr">Portuguese (Brazil)</li><li dir="ltr">Russian</li><li dir="ltr">Spanish (Latin America)</li><li dir="ltr">Spanish (Spain)</li><li dir="ltr">Swedish</li><li dir="ltr">Tagalog (Filipino)</li><li dir="ltr">Turkish</li><li dir="ltr">Vietnamese</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-exclusive-lego-sets-best-deals-holiday-2025-sale/1100-6536986/">Target's Best Exclusive Lego Sets Get Rare Holiday Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controllers On Sale For Even Better Prices Than Black Friday Deals</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-anniversary-edition-pixel-remasters-nintendo-switch-playstation-best-amazon-deal/1100-6527670/">Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster Collection Is Back On Sale For Black Friday Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-nintendo-switch-2-wheel-set-for-mario-kart-gets-first-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536789/">Nintendo Switch 2 Racing Wheel Set Drops To $20 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-gets-110-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536577/">Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gets $110 Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-rosalina-storybook-nintendo-switch-book-deal/1100-6534724/">Super Mario Galaxy: Rosalina's Storybook Gets 30% Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psvr-2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle-is-still-on-sale-for-all-time-best-price/1100-6529777/">PSVR 2 Horizon Call Of The Mountain Bundle Is Still On Sale For All-Time Best Price</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>More chatter from Myles</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> has received mostly positive reception, but it's safe to say that not everybody is keen on the dialogue from Samus' Federation Trooper pals. Now, thanks to a video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXkXBIabO04">Bearborg</a> (cheers, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-want-me-to-build-rocket-skates-fans-uncover-30-mins-of-cut-metroid-prime-4-dialogue/">VGC</a>), even more unused dialogue has been showcased (from approx 7:38 in the above video).</p>
<p>Accessed by simply listening in to the conversations between the Galactic Federation Troopers at Base Camp in Fury Green, some of the additional dialogue includes musings from VUE-995 about how much it can bench, a new breach technique from Nora Armstrong, and a recollection from Ezra Duke about an unpaid debt back on the planet Tanamaar.</p>
<p>All told, there's more than 30 minutes' worth of voiceover work that seemingly didn't make it into the final game, though why is anybody's guess. It's important to note that these conversations aren't mandatory to the story, and are instead bonus interactions that you can choose to listen in to when chilling out at Base Camp.</p>
<p>One of our key criticisms of Beyond wasn't due to the added dialogue, but rather the freqeuncy at which Myles Mackenzie would contact you over comms when you're about exploring Sol Valley. Ultimately, we thought the game was a welcome return for Samus, awarding it a score of 9/10.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-productions-co-founder-leaves-studio-after-nearly-30-years/</link>
            <guid>1385059</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A huge changing of the guard has occurred behind the scenes at Sucker Punch Productions. The mega-successful developer has announced that co-founder Brian Fleming has left, and two new faces will oversee the company’s future moving forward. </p>



<p>Since 1998, Brian Fleming has served as co-founder and producer of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-ghost-of-yotei-possible-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sucker Punch</a>. The team has created banger after banger through a myriad of Sly Cooper games, inFamous titles, and the acclaimed ‘Ghost’ series, from the PlayStation 1 all the way to the PS5. But December 16 is a significant day in the studio’s illustrious history.</p>







<h2 id="h-co-founder-behind-sly-cooper-infamous-amp-ghost-leaves">Co-Founder Behind Sly Cooper, inFamous &amp; ‘Ghost’ Leaves </h2>



<figure><figcaption>The dawn of a new era. Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment announced the big news through a blog <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/the-next-chapter-of-sucker-punch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> on December 16.</p>







<p>The article states that “The Next Chapter Begins” with Jason Connell and Adrian Bentley teaming up to take the studio forward with new releases and ideas. The statement rather transparently reveals that Fleming has actually ‘worked closely with PlayStation Studios to ensure that Sucker Punch was in the best hands moving forward’ for the last year.</p>



<p>Here’s a more in-depth look at the statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Jason and Adrian have been instrumental in shaping the creative and technical direction of Sucker Punch in recent years. Jason, who served as Co-Creative Director on the Ghost franchise, has helped define the studio’s visual identity and storytelling style, bringing cinematic depth and emotional resonance to PlayStation players around the world.</p>



<p>Adrian, as Technical Director, has led the studio’s engineering and production efforts, driving innovation across development tools and game systems that make Sucker Punch’s worlds so immersive. Together, they represent the perfect blend of creative vision and technical excellence that has always set the studio apart.</p>



<p>Nate Fox will continue as Co-Creative Director to complete the overall creative leadership team.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It closes by wishing Fleming the best and reassuring fans that Sucker Punch is in good hands with its new direction. There’s also a little eyebrow-raising line at the bottom about “Crafting new adventures.”</p>



<p>This is nothing new, as it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sucker Punch might make a new Sly Cooper or inFamous game after Ghost of Yotei</a>. There’s still no word on the studio’s next game, but it will be under new leadership.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/unrecord-tencent-investment/</link>
            <guid>1385056</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The developers behind the viral game ‘Unrecord’ have announced that it has received investment from Tencent to accelerate its development.</p>







<p>In a report via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-makes-minority-investment-in-frances-drama-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gamesindustry.biz</a>, it was said that Tencent bought a “minority stake” in Unrecord publisher Drama Games, but the percentage and investment amount was not disclosed.</p>



<p>“Since the surge of attention after our initial trailer, we’ve worked relentlessly to build a game that meets the expectations of our community,” Drama studios CEO and founder Theo Hiribarne said.</p>



<p>“In Tencent, we found not just a world-class partner, but a team genuinely passionate about our game and vision. Despite its scale, Tencent has approached this partnership with humility, respect, and a real appreciation for our creative identity. It believed in Unrecord early and has supported us at every stage of our growth. We’re confident this collaboration will help us reach our full potential.”</p>



<p>Tencent Games Europe’s VP of partnerships, Mark Maslowicz, said“Tencent believes deeply in creative talent. We’ve been consistently impressed by the drive and dynamism of Drama Studios, and the remarkable progress it has made on Unrecord, especially with such a small team and limited resources. This investment will help the studio unlock their full potential and deliver the first of many outstanding games. We’re excited to be part of Drama Studios journey.”</p>



<p>Unrecord currently has no set release date and it only targeting PC, but is currently number 9 on Steam’s wishlist chart.</p>







<p>The studio received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unrecord-developer-drama-studios-secures-2-5m-in-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.5 million in a seed series investment</a> from The Games Fund in September 2024.</p>

            <guid>1385053</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The past few years have felt like an embarrassment of riches when it comes to RPGs, and so expectations were <em>high</em> going into 2025. Thankfully, the last 12 months certainly lived up to such a bar. While that's good for gamers, it made things more than a little tough when whittling down our list of the best role-playing games of the year, especially because we had a wide variety of RPG styles that satisfied different tastes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> gave us some of that Obsidian magic in a fantasy world that was tighter and more focused than many of its contemporaries, resulting in a game that didn’t feel as overwhelming as typical open-world RPGs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deltarune-full-release">Deltarune</a>’s new chapters elevated the ongoing Undertale-adjacent saga to new heights with increasingly clever gameplay twists and sharper narrative chops. And if you had 100-plus hours to spare, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> offered a stunning conclusion for an unforgettable journey to cap off the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The definition of RPG is fairly free-flowing these days, so you’ll see games with elements of the genre in our other award categories. But we made careful considerations for games with RPG mechanics at the forefront of their gameplay, along with deep stories, for this particular list. However, there can only be five games and one winner, so the IGN team voted and deliberated on which games would make up this year’s list. We believe the genre is in good hands with the games we picked, and the game we've chosen as the Best RPGs of 2025 is something very special.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best RPG of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Trails in the Sky: 1st Chapter</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-rpg-of-2025-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-1765881299847.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Trails series, part of the larger Legend of Heroes franchise, has been gaining more and more traction over recent years. But it’s tricky to recommend as it now numbers 13 entries, all of which are part of a continuous timeline. Remake <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter">Trails in the Sky: 1st Chapter</a> helps rememdy that problem, as it went right back to the beginning to create one of strongest and sharpest games in the series – and now, it’s the easiest one to recommend. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trails revolves around a deeply developed world with captivating geopolitical drama at its heart. 1st Chapter does such a good job of painting that broad picture, which is seen in detail through the eyes of its two leads, Estelle and Joshua. As budding Bracers (a peacekeeping guild) whose father is a legend in the guild, they're perfect conduits to provide a pretty intimate understanding of the world's various regions and how they feed into the larger story. The turn-based battles feature a fantastic blend of action combat and the series’ unique positioning system, which creates a gameplay flow that ushers you through this expanded version of this classic RPG. The true magic of Trails lies in the multifaceted stories from multiple perspectives, but it all starts here in Trails in the Sky, and this remake is a terrific representation of that.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Dragon Quest 1&amp;2 HD-2D Remake</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-rpg-of-2025-dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-1765881324680.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix has done excellent work in revitalizing the Dragon Quest games of yore, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-quest-12-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest 1&amp;2 HD-2D Remake</a> is the best example yet. The high-definition pixel art makeover is more than just a sensible way to pretty-up these classics, it also lets them stay true to the spirit of their original look without the weird pixel smoothing effect of past remasters. These Remakes also retain the turn-based combat system and characters without sacrificing the distinct spirit of the original games from all those years ago (frustrating difficulty spikes and all), but even then, quality of life improvements make sure they’re still enjoyable in a modern sense. Combined with the DQ3 HD-2D remake, these games complete the "Erdrick trilogy" of Dragon Quest games, and you can see how the series pioneered the genre, especially with the second entry’s emphasis on characters and storytelling. This package is one of the best examples of modernized nostalgia – faithful to the originals and approachable in today’s gaming landscape. And it’s some of the best role-playing we experienced this year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – The Outer Worlds 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-rpg-of-2025-the-outer-worlds-2-1765881341967.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to RPGs and letting players dictate how they interact with the world, Obsidian is one of the best studios to do it. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> improves on the first game in almost every way, from punchier gunplay to much deeper role-playing systems. The options you have to build your character and make pivotal choices have a larger impact on what you can do in combat, but also create specific avenues for how quests play out. We keep pointing to the Flaws system, which was present in the original, but has been expanded in unpredictable, creative ways by giving you some serious pros/cons to consider based on your playing habits. However, the much more expansive areas, smarter level design, and dynamic combat encounters make sure the actual gameplay experience is a significant leap over the first game. And you can’t have an RPG of this style without choice and consequence at the heart of the story, and Obsidian reminds us with The Outer Worlds 2 that it still has the chops, even in a post-Fallout: New Vegas era.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-rpg-of-2025-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-1765881358523.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> is an investment that pays back multiple times over in its 120-hour runtime. It’s a commitment - a slow-burn game you have to want to live in. But it’s also an action-packed cinematic adventure that proves to have an emotional range that the original didn’t. You might be just "some guy" as Henry, yet that role often lets you see the world for what it is, whether you’re doing seemingly mundane activities or the pivotal story quests where your choices matter. What this game does better than most, though, is first-person melee combat, a tough thing that even the mighty Elder Scrolls franchise has struggled with for so long. It is intricate, skill-based, and stays engaging even as you get deeper into the furthest corners the campaign. Although developer Warhorse Studios arguably tries to bite off more than it can chew at times, you’ll find the quality writing and great combat leads you to a satisfying conclusion. This sequel might pick off where the first ended, but jumping into Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 regardless of your experience will open you up to a rare RPG that deserves its flowers, 2025 or otherwise.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner – Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/the-best-rpg-of-2025-clair-obscur-expedition-33-1765881377069.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Suprise, surprise – the Best RPG of 2025 is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and for good reason. The folks at development team Sandfall Interactive drew direct inspiration from Japanese RPGs like Final Fantasy 10 and Persona 5 (their words, not ours), and made the kind of game they wanted to play. We know there’s still a huge appetite for good turn-based RPGs, and Clair Obscur is further proof of that, but it’s the mechanics built into the combat system that makes it stand out. The active timing inputs keep you engaged in each fight, and recognizing attack patterns so that you may parry and inflict damage on an enemy turn is some of the most satisfying stuff we’ve experienced in a turn-based system. Each party member plays uniquely and has their own unique gameplay gimmick, as to represent a Job or Class, but there's then the Picto/Lumina system that lets you stack on perks and wild buffs – at some point it feels like you’re breaking the game. However, the toughest challenges ensure the game pushes back on you to really test your mastery and understanding of its more intricate mechanics. It’s one of the best combat systems we’ve seen in a good long while, and it keeps that momentum throughout its story and optional content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Expedition 33 wouldn’t be a true homage to JRPGs without a melodramatic and heartwrenching story. While it immediately hits you with the theme of time wiping away swathes of people – friends and loved ones disintegrating before your eyes – it grows into a meditation on grief and how it changes people, seen through the eyes of fully formed characters who change alongside each other. Whether or not you want intricate systems, fun combat, or deep stories from your RPGs, Clair Obscur delivered all of that in a way that won the hearts of us here at IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more of our end-of-the-year celebrations, be sure to check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-awards-2025-winners">list of awards and nominees</a>, which is being updated daily in the lead-up to our official Best Game of 2025 announcement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael is the tech reviews editor at IGN, but regularly contributes to games coverage with reviews, features, and news.</em>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> trailer that revealed Leon S. Kennedy also featured yet another familiar face from the series' past, fans believe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blink and you'll miss it, but the trailer also includes a blonde female character speaking to Leon over comms, who fans believe is none other than Sherry Birkin — and, listening to the voice performance, they may well have a point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sherry first popped up in Resident Evil 2 (where she met Leon for the first time) but more recently featured in Resident Evil 6. Compare Sherry's voice actress from Resi 6 to the dialogue heard in Capcom's new Requiem trailer, and the two sound remarkably similar, if not identical. Take a listen via the fan comparison embedded below.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The character speaking to Leon is most likely Sherry Birkin, the voice is the same as hers in Resident Evil 6, the hair color is exactly the same, and she also works in the same organization as Leon, DSO.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/REBHFun?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#REBHFun</a> <a href="https://t.co/mYXTGAfYYa" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/mYXTGAfYYa</a></p>— Waleed (@Waleedx2007) <a href="https://twitter.com/Waleedx2007/status/2000711516669039003?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has remained coy about confirming Sherry, perhaps to give Leon his moment in the spotlight, but there seems no reason it couldn't be her. After all, Resident Evil 6 showed her working for the Division of Security Operations, the FBI-like government agency that also employs Leon. And with Leon involved, it seems straightforward enough that Sherry is also along for the ride. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Leon's recent confirmation, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-reveal-how-much-well-play-as-leon-and-say-the-survival-horroraction-contrast-is-like-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna">Capcom's subsequent explanation that the floppy-haired fan favorite will feature in around half of the game</a>, Requiem is said to still hold plenty of mysteries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, as Resident Evil fans peer closer at Leon's reveal trailer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leon-kennedys-new-look-for-resident-evil-requiem-makes-him-a-hot-uncle-heartthrob-among-japanese-fans">and celebrate the Resident Evil 4 star entering his "hot uncle" era</a>, there has also been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-capcom-really-kill-leon-in-resident-evil-requiem-new-images-showing-a-mysterious-mark-on-his-neck-have-fans-worried">concern over a nasty-looking mark glimpsed on the hero's neck</a>. Is it a zombie bite, or new infection? Could Capcom really bring Leon back just to kill him off, rather than let him retire in peace? Whatever's going on, Capcom has said Leon holds "a big secret" — hopefully Sherry can help him out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week also brought word of yet <em>another </em>returning Resident Evil character who will apparently also make an appearance, Rosemary Winters. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-gamestop-listing-leaves-fans-bewildered-by-mentioning-a-shock-second-character-and-its-not-leon">product listing for Requiem's Deluxe Edition that was leaked by GameStop</a> mentioned the inclusion of extra costumes for the character, who Capcom has so far not mentioned at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's still a couple of months to go until Resident Evil Requiem releases on February 26, 2026, and until then, Capcom has certainly given fans plenty to discuss.

                <p>The month of December is a busy one for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>. The major highlight of the month is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-the-arc-raiders-cold-snap-update/2900-7344/" data-ref-id="2900-7344">Cold Snap update</a>, which introduces a slew of content to the game and balancing fixes across the board. However, launching right after the Cold Snap update is the first Expedition in Arc Raiders, which is essentially the game's version of a "wipe."</p><p>To find out more about Expeditions, including when the first one will begin and the requirements to embark on one, check out the guide below.</p><h2>How Expeditions work in Arc Raiders</h2><p>For starters, what exactly are Expeditions? If you've played a game like Rust or Escape from Tarkov before, then you can think of an Expedition like a wipe. This involves your character's progress being reset, forcing you to start over from scratch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4623958-026da46f2492-expedition-project.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623958" data-ratio="0.56382978723404" data-width="940" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4623958-026da46f2492-expedition-project.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623958"></a><figcaption>Expeditions are a way for players to build their Raider back up </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4623958-026da46f2492-expedition-project.jpg"></figure><p>However, unlike in other games, <strong>Expeditions in Arc Raiders are not forced upon every player</strong>. Instead, players can individually choose whether or not they want to participate in the Expedition. So, if you want to keep grinding out your current character, you don't have to opt into the Expedition and can simply play like you have been since the game launched. Players also have to be at least level 20 for Expeditions to unlock.</p><p>If you choose to enter the Expedition, your character isn't totally wiped. While you lose your skills, gear, blueprints, coins, quest progression, stash upgrades, and more, here's everything you keep after entering an Expedition:</p><ul><li>All unlocked maps</li><li>Cosmetics</li><li>Raider Decks</li><li>Raider Tokens</li><li>Cred </li><li>Entries in the Codex</li><li>Workshop Stations</li><li>Trials</li><li>Active Leaderboards</li><li>Personal Event progress</li></ul><p>For players who want to participate in the Expedition, though, it's not a simple one-click process. While you can choose to send your Raider on an Expedition, you want to ensure you have as much loot as possible in your stash, as the more you have, the more rewards you earn in the Expedition.</p><h2>All Expedition Rewards</h2><p>You receive one Skill Point for every one million coins of value you have in your stash at the time you enter the Expedition. You can earn a maximum of five Skill Points this way, meaning you only need five million coins or items of equal value in your stash. You can store all of this value away in your Caravan, which you can find in the Expeditions menu in-game. This allows you to save up coins and gear for the Expedition.</p><p>In addition to the extra Skill Points, here's a list of other rewards you earn by embarking on the Expedition:</p><ul><li>Patchwork Raider Outfit</li><li>Scrappy Janitor Cap</li><li>Expeditions Indicator Icon</li><li>12 extra stash spaces</li><li>10% repair buff (temporary)</li><li>5% XP boost (temporary)</li><li>6% more materials from Scrappy (temporary)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4623959-expedition-project-cosmetic-rewa.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623959" data-ratio="0.49404761904762" data-width="1512" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4623959-expedition-project-cosmetic-rewa.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623959"></a><figcaption>The rewards for the first Expedition in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4623959-expedition-project-cosmetic-rewa.jpg"></figure><p>The temporary rewards remain active until the next Expedition in Arc Raiders. To keep the buffs active, you'll have to participate in the following Expedition. Doing so also rewards you with increased buffs, meaning you get an even larger XP boost, materials, and repair times. If you don't participate, the buffs will deactivate.</p><h2>What is the release schedule for Expeditions?</h2><p>The first Expedition in Arc Raiders is going live on December 23, 2025. However, you need to register for the first Expedition between December 17-22. If you don't register in time, you won't be eligible for the Expedition.</p><p>After Dec. 23, you can expect the next Expedition to begin roughly two months later. We don't have any official dates for the second Expedition as of yet, but mid-February is likely when the next one will open registration.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/baldurs-gate-3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/baldurs-gate-3-developer-larian-studios-announces-new-divinity-game">Larian Studios revealed Divinity</a>, a new game in its long-running Divinity series that includes 2017's Divinity: Original Sin II, during The Game Awards 2025 earlier this month. Though we all assumed it, Larian has since confirmed that <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/divinity">Divinity</a> will be a turn-based RPG in a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Larian founder, CEO, and creative director Swen Vincke called the game a "turn-based RPG," quelling any fears the studio would be experimenting outside of its bread and butter. That said, Vincke also teased the game's massive scale.&nbsp;</p><p>"This is going to be us unleashed, I think," Vincke told <em>Bloomberg</em>. "It's a turn-based RPG featuring everything you've seen from us in the past, but it's brought to the next level." That lines up with what The Game Awards 2025 host Geoff Keighley said on stage following the game's reveal, where he called it Larian's biggest game ever.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Watch the Divinity cinematic reveal trailer below:</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VxzyVeAG00w?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VxzyVeAG00w?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>For the uninitiated, Divinity is an original series created by Larian that began with Divine Divinity in 2002 and continued with 2004's Beyond Divinity, 2009's Divinity II, 2014's Divinity: Original Sin, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/divinity-original-sin-2">2017's Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, which launched yesterday <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/15/divinity-original-sin-2-surprise-launches-on-ps5-xbox-series-xs-and-switch-2-today">on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 2</a>. That said, as you might know, despite success in its original Divinity series, it was 2023's Baldur's Gate 3 that propelled Larian to new (and successful) heights.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Baldur's Gate 3 wasn't an original IP – it's owned by Wizards of the Coast, the maker of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Magic: The Gathering. In 2024, Vincke revealed <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/03/21/larian-ceo-says-the-studio-is-done-with-baldurs-gate-3-to-focus-on-something-new">the studio is done with Baldur's Gate 3 to focus on something new</a> (presumably Divinity), adding that Larian is not returning to the Baldur's Gate franchise for its next game.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no release date for Divinity in sight, but Vincke tells <em>Bloomberg that </em>Larian plans to do an early access release before its 1.0 launch.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting to learn more, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/baldurs-gate-3/a-true-soul-stirrer"><em>Game Informer's </em>Baldur's Gate 3 review</a>, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2/a-godly-ascension"><em>Game Informer's </em>Divinity: Original Sin 2 review</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>[Source: </strong></em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em><strong>Bloomberg</strong></em></a><em><strong>]</strong></em></p><hr><p><em>Are you excited for Divinity, or would you have preferred Larian make another Baldur's Gate game?

If you grew up gaming before the NES hit the US, you were probably using (or drooling over) the Quickshot II. Now, you can get <a href="https://retrogames.biz/products/thequickshot-ii/?ref=retrododo.com">a recreation of the popular controller</a> for £29.99, or around $40. It is expected to be available starting on January 30th, 2026.</p><p>The new version of the Quickshot II, created through a partnership between Retro Games and Plaion Replai, carries forward the aviation-inspired joystick design that was frequently used in controllers before Nintendo’s first console helped popularize gamepads. Its ergonomics may look a little outdated now, but the Quickshot II’s large contoured handle was more comfortable than previous versions, and it introduced a trigger alongside its top-mounted button, replicating the controls found on many arcade machines at the time.</p><p>This revamped Quickshot II looks nearly identical to the original, but with the addition of six more buttons on its base that can be remapped to accommodate modern titles, although the controller is probably best suited for playing simpler retro titles. The joystick now features a “floating ball-joint design” for smoother movement, but still relies on microswitches for detecting inputs.</p><p>The original version’s now-antiquated DE-9 connector has been replaced with USB and plug-and-play compatibility with PCs and consoles, but two retro features have been preserved. There’s still a switch on the base to temporarily activate an auto-fire mode, and on the underside of the Quickshot II you’ll find suction cups to keep it securely perched on a desk, even during intense gaming sessions.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/845447/retro-games-the-quickshot-ii-joystick-controller-commodore-64]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Friends, it is time to break into Jeff Bezos's bunker and steal his porn. Jeff Bezos - so sorry! I mean J### B#### - doesn't need his porn anymore because he's dead. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the bunker is now full of "RICH MAN DEATH RADIATION", making it unsafe for humans. Fortunately, the people's pervert committee have supplied us with some remote-operated drones that are capable of firing clones of themselves in the direction of the camera. To secure the B#### smut, you must accordingly point and click-hurl yourself around the bunker's surprisingly soft and hazy confines. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>Beware the purple robot sentinels that prowl the alcoves, having hysterics over every orb-shaped interloper they encounter. Also be sure to delete drones as you go: each one you regurgitate is tethered to a separate screen in the starting hub, and they'll overlap and obscure each other if you don't take time to tidy the interface.</p>
<p>The game described here is VERMIN3000 DATAHEIST, available to <a href="https://polclarissou.itch.io/vermin3000-dataheist">play in a browser or download from Itch</a>. It was created by Vignettes and Nuts developer Pol Clarissou for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/7dfps">the 7dfps gamejam</a>, which invites you to "challenge yourself, and first person games, by creating a game that takes us to new places in new ways". Be warned that VERMIN3000 contains abstract depictions of blood and suicide, together with woozy renderings of Kate Perry singing "what a wonderful world".</p>
<p>The pornos - three in all - consist of balls and hoops squidging and squeaking together. They are the filthiest thing I've seen since my lunch, which also consisted of balls and hoops squidging and squeaking together.</p>
<p>It feels vaguely like a response to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">the payment processor crackdown on naughty videogames</a>, but Clarissou is a fearsome smartypants and I dread putting words in his mouth. The developer also has a blog on which you will find essays like <a href="https://polclarissou.com/boudoir/posts/2023-02-03-Artisanal-Intelligence.html">"Artisanal Intelligence: what's the deal with AI art"</a>. The rest of that gamejam seems worth checking out, too.</p>

		<p>Here we go again. Yet another run-based tactics game trying to wring the last dregs of novelty from the increasingly exhausted formula of <em>FTL </em>and <em>Into the Breach</em>, functioning like a cut-down version of other strategy and tactics games and using skill trees, loot, and item builds to add complexity to an otherwise simple tactics game.</p><p><em>Master of Command </em>takes this concept to… wait, this game is about Frederick the Great? It's a horse-and-musket real-time tactics game set in the Seven Years' War? You can customise each regiment's uniform and colours?</p><p>Hang on. Forget all that stuff I said before. Let's take this from the top.</p><hr><figure></figure><p>"History says don't hope," wrote poet Seamus Heaney, "But then, once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up, and hope and history rhyme." <em>Master of Command</em> arrives on PC to redeem Haney's prophecy, bringing overdue justice to the underrepresented and ignored Seven Years' War.&nbsp;</p><p>Years from now, children not yet born will sharing memes about how they wish they had it as good as people living in 2025, and you'll fruitlessly try to correct them. "I know you think it was all powdered wigs and bearskin mitres but there were some bad things happening in 2025 too, kiddo."</p><p>"There's bad things happening now too," they'll point out sadly. "But at least you had <em>Master of Command</em>."</p><p>Then they'll run off to make a video titled "POV: It's 2025. You make seven figures having AI write emails. You just met the love of your life in the Christopher Duffy section of Barnes and Noble."</p><figure></figure>

              <p>Is <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> running at 30fps on Switch 2 disappointing or good enough? Is the Game Awards bump really worth an estimated $12 million in new sales? And just how long will fans have to wait for <em>Terminator: Survivors</em> to come out of its self-imposed indefinite delay? It’s the latest edition of <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a>, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>We’re just beginning to wrap up our year-in-review coverage here, but my heart is already looking past the upcoming holidays to my favorite time of year: backlog season. I’m making a list, checking it twice<!--StartFragment --><span>—am I </span><!--EndFragment -->gonna maybe finally finish <em>System Shock 2</em> and not just replay <em>Xenogears</em> again?</p>

 <h2><em>Terminator: Survivors</em> is barely hanging on</h2> <p>With just two weeks left to go until it was supposed to release, Nacon’s post-apocalyptic adaptation of the franchise won’t be making its planned 2025 launch after all. Instead of getting a new ship date, however, the open-world game has been indefinitely delayed. It also won’t be launching with the previously promised co-op mode. There won’t be an Early Access phase either.</p>

 <p>“After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we came to the conclusion that to give you an authentic “<em>Terminator</em>” experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay,&nbsp;we would have to put aside the&nbsp;cooperative multiplayer,” the publisher <a href="https://x.com/SurviveTheT800/status/2000959289918132344">announced on Tuesday</a>. “We know this may come as a disappointment, but we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day.”</p>

 <h2>Nintendo shareholders are worried about spiking memory costs</h2> <p>That big <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">RAM shortage</a> everyone keeps talking about? Investors are worried it’s about to hit the Switch 2 in a big way. <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that the cost of manufacturing the new console could already be going up. “The price Nintendo has to pay for the 12GB RAM (random access memory) modules in the Switch 2 jumped 41 percent in the current quarter, according to market intelligence firm TrendForce,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/nintendo-sheds-14-billion-value-after-chip-squeeze-fears-grow">it writes</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">Why is this happening</a>? Why, the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrmunchertoyou.bsky.social/post/3m7zmn5hnkg2b">AI bubble of course</a>.</p> <h2>Players are flocking to<em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> all over again</h2>   <p>A Game Awards sweep, a big free update have, and a small sale on Steam have conspired to catapult the French RPG back up the charts.&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3ma23xntiwk2v">Alinea Analytics estimates</a> that the game has sold another 300,000 copies since the showcase last week. Old players <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7zxuzbclk2f">are coming back too</a>. The Game Awards bump <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/moomanibe.bsky.social/post/3ma2ks7sx7s2a">remains very real</a>, at least for games that everyone already loved.</p>

 <h2><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em> has a free demo on Switch 2</h2> <p>The port includes the <em>Intergrade</em> expansion and arrives on Nintendo’s new console on January 22, 2026. Progress from the demo will carry over to the main game. It runs smoothly, though some fans are disappointed it’s locked at 30fps despite the slight visual downgrade. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094">I played the opening earlier this year</a> and thought it looked surprisingly great in handheld mode.</p>

 <h2>The Amazon-funded MOBA studio founded by ex-Ubisoft devs has been sold back to Ubisoft</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn2aJ3UmVnk"><em>March of Giants</em></a> was revealed earlier this year. It’s led by creative director Xavier Marquis, the original creative director of <em>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</em>, and producer Alexandre Parizeau, the previous managing director of Ubisoft Toronto. <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6TYgLsRkVYP97hVH0Rhzn7/ubisoft-acquires-march-of-giants-from-amazon">Amazon divested them back to Ubisoft</a> amid its latest round of big gaming cuts. Is this like a life raft seeking shelter aboard the Titanic?</p> <h2><em>Dota 2</em> gets its 128th hero: a frog who plays the mandolin</h2> <p>Largo was just added to Valve’s long-running MOBA in its mammoth <a href="https://www.dota2.com/largo">7.40 update</a>. The most important part? He has a rhythm-based ultimate called Amphibian Rhapsody. “Every time he strums successfully, he gains a stack of Groovin,'” the description reads. “Each stack gives him bonus armor and reduces the mana cost of every song, but he loses a stack if he misses a beat. Stacks linger for a short duration when Largo’s song ends.”</p> <p>Neat! Will this get me to go back to <em>Dota</em> after a multi-year break?

            <guid>1384999</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Todd Howard has been all over the place recently. The visionary developer has been at the forefront of a marketing streak for the new season of the Fallout TV show, the first episode of which drops in mere hours. He has found himself staring down the microphones of many outlets, but he might have gotten a bit mixed up on recent quotes.</p>



<p>In a newly revealed interview with Game Informer, Howard said that ‘the majority of the studio’ is working on The Elder Scrolls 6, but just days ago, he was captured saying that <strong>Fallout </strong>is the franchise that the team is working on the hardest.</p>







<p>To give Howard credit, his interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a> did mention that the majority of his team is working on The Elder Scrolls 6, <strong>but </strong>the company is ‘used to overlapping development.’</p>



<p>However, stressing that most employees are engaged on The Elder Scrolls 6, while also saying that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-chief-todd-howard-says-fallout-is-the-franchise-that-were-doing-the-most-in-right-now-coy-on-potential-return-to-new-vegas-or-a-fallout-3-remaster-while-fans-wait-for-fallout-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fallout is the franchise</a> that Bethesda Game Studios is ‘doing the most in right now’ is a little confusing.</p>



<p>GamesRadar captured <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/bethesdas-todd-howard-says-fallout-76-is-the-game-were-still-doing-the-most-work-in-and-fans-of-the-prime-tv-show-should-give-it-a-try/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another quote</a> where Todd was talking about a similar topic and said that Fallout 76 is specifically ‘the game we’re still doing the most work in.’</p>



<p>Perhaps Todd Howard is jetlagged from flying all over the world to promote the Fallout television show. From what we know, The Elder Scrolls 6 is the next game in the pipeline once Starfield’s development cycle has wrapped (although it might have already), and then Fallout 5 comes next.</p>



<p>In the interim, fans of the post-apocalyptic series are still expectant of a Fallout 3: Remastered or a Fallout: New Vegas 2. Aside from years-old rumors and old documents, there’s little to suggest they’re close to being released.</p>



<p>Would you rather have The Elder Scrolls 6 or Fallout 5 right now? Let us know how you’d decide on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A tectonic shift in the political climate has given rise to a sharp increase in authoritarian practices and policies and made 2025 an unprecedented and disconcerting year for censorship, including for the video game industry. In the face of outstanding pressure on the payment processors powering storefronts like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/">Itch</a>, thousands of games--largely pertaining to adult subject matter that was sexual in nature and labeled NSFW--were either removed or deindexed from those respective stores. Though the uproar around these removals died down with time--partly due to loss of momentum pressuring these stores to rescind the bans, partly because certain free games were eventually reindexed on Itch--the recent release of Santa Ragione's Horses has brought the conversation back for another round before year's end.</p><p dir="ltr">That's because, once again, a title with a significant amount of adult content (seriously, Horses fits a lot of taboo material into a fairly brief runtime) has found itself in the crosshairs of the ongoing puritanical culture war that's raging throughout the country, as well as in the world of video games. And as it continues, the controversy around certain games and their subject matter begins to raise questions about artistic expression, who in this medium is allowed to discuss and prominently feature adult-oriented content, and what kind of conversations and explorations of these subjects will the corporate powers in control of the industry permit.</p><p dir="ltr">Horses is a notable development in this ongoing controversy for several reasons, not the least of which is the preventative measures taken against it. Whereas the bulk of the censorship mentioned here came well after games were released and available to play, affecting many games that had already been listed on these stores for some time, Horses has been facing an uphill battle leading to its release on December 2.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYewjNYxV-8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JYewjNYxV-8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In the week preceding its launch, Santa Ragione published an </span><a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/" rel="nofollow ">FAQ</a><span> explaining that Horses had already been banned on Steam, as well as outlining why the storefront might have made this decision. Why? According to Santa Ragione, the chief reason for Valve's response seems to stem from a review build of Horses back in 2023 and a back-and-forth between the game's publisher and Valve that resulted in Horses' ban before the game could even be finished or meaningfully altered. More specifically, the development team believed that a scene from the in-progress build, which featured a child riding on the shoulders of a naked woman, was Valve's biggest cause of concern. </span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>But as anyone who has actually played Horses can attest, the scene has been altered for the better, and now features a grown woman in the place of the little girl. The scene becomes stronger with this change largely due to the dialogue the player has with the woman, who calmly acknowledges the human-shaped horse in the room, making herself and her father knowingly complicit in the awful violence being enacted on the farm. The alteration also happens to clear up any suspicion that Horses ever featured a pornographic scene--even if the interaction in question was never sexual--with a child.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Despite the ban, Santa Ragione still forged ahead and released the controversial title on December 2 across other digital storefronts, including the Epic Games Store, Itch, and GOG. In an unfortunate eleventh-hour reversal, EGS (through which a handful of reviewers had actually redeemed and played through Horses) <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-store-bans-this-new-indie-game-and-the-developer-has-questions/1100-6536662/">removed the game from its storefront</a>. A few days later, Humble briefly took down Horses from its store as well, before reinstating the game after reviewing it more closely.</p><p dir="ltr">Suffice to say, the impact of these bans has irreparably harmed Horses and the publisher behind it, even if the controversy and noise around the game has drawn support and attention it might not have otherwise received.</p><p dir="ltr">Horses' ban is just the latest in a concerning trend though. In the months since Valve first purged its store of a number of concerning NSFW games and simulations--ones that <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/win-new-steam-policy-games-removed" rel="nofollow ">promoted</a> "rape, incest, sexual torture, and child abuse" and that the organization Collective Shout <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-and-steams-new-policies-reflect-a-larger-battle-on-free-speech/1100-6533750/">reportedly</a> applied pressure to Steam's payment processors in order to remove--it appears to also be increasingly clamping down on many current <em>and</em> future adult games that might broach similar themes. To that end, games which feature "mature themes," i.e. sexually explicit content, are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-is-no-longer-allowing-adult-games-in-early-access/1100-6534685/">no longer permitted in Steam's early access program</a>, making it that much harder for independent developers who regularly explore these topics to have viable pathways to success (let alone visibility) in the medium. Despite the fact that the intent of this movement appeared to be ridding these stores of harmful bad actors, the consequences of it have rippled outwards in a way that threatens many developers, though it certainly isn't impacting everyone equally.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4624026-2358886564-7c6ec.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624026" data-ratio="0.57354925775978" data-width="741" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4624026-2358886564-7c6ec.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624026"></a><figcaption>Horses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4624026-2358886564-7c6ec.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>Paired with the AA and AAA gaming space's reluctance to explore and address similar themes (with a few notable exceptions), the chilling effect of this wave of bans threatens to stunt the growth of the games industry, its creative forces, and the audience that engages with games. We are currently watching a digital storefront pick and choose who and what passes a purity test whose terms and requirements are largely nebulous, and policing what art gets to entertain and provoke us. If Horses' ban, which on Steam alone threatens to preclude it from "</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-is-scary-humiliating-and-patronising-santa-ragione-facing-closure-after-horses-barred-from-steam" rel="nofollow ">more than 75 percent of the PC gaming market</a><span>," as well as the numerous developments around Steam's policies, are any indication, there is tremendous cause for concern about the future of artistry in games.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Moreover, I'm concerned about what these enforcements have to say about what is permissible in these stores, and more importantly, <em>who</em> is allowed to do it. As <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-indie-game-banned-steam-epic-review-impressions-santa-ragione/" rel="nofollow ">Aftermath</a>'s Chris Person points out, there are games, even whole franchises, that feature similar themes and have gotten away with little to no scrutiny over their depictions. He writes: "If the invalidating content was slavery, then Final Fantasy XVI, Fallout: New Vegas, and Dragon Age: Origins would never be allowed to be sold. If torture is unallowed, then (Grand Theft Auto) V violates Epic's terms of service with 'By The Book,' a mission where Trevor tortures a guy by pulling his teeth out with pliers and electrocuting his nipples on behalf of the government. Americans understand and respect graphic violence, torture, and abuse as art, and on that front Horses is far less graphic than any 30 seconds in a recent Mortal Kombat game."</p><p dir="ltr">The actual events of Horses are gnarly, and its content warnings should not be taken lightly, but it is not only tamer than the far cruder works from which it takes inspiration--chiefly the Italian film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal%C3%B2,_or_the_120_Days_of_Sodom" rel="nofollow ">Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom</a>--but shows far more restraint in its depictions of violence than most M-rated games. The content Horses features, and the themes it uses these subjects to probe, are not exactly the stuff of children's books and fairy tales, so why is it and its potential audience being handled with kid gloves?</p><p dir="ltr">The answer, as usual, seems to come down to some degree of clout and/or reputation. If you are too large to fail or deny--like a Grand Theft Auto game bound to sell millions of copies for the decade following its release--and replicate the same tepid and self-serving explorations of these adult subjects, then you can probably get away with being a game for adults by adults. In other words, games can be about sex so long as the player can romance and sleep with their in-game crush. Games can be about violence if the player is the one capable of committing outstandingly gratuitous and self-aggrandizing acts of violence or if they can reap the benefits of it. But you can only really be about either if you're sure to be a big seller, and you don't actually need to look much further than the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/">2025 Game Awards</a> for proof of this trend, either.</p><p dir="ltr">Larian Studios, the now beloved developer behind 2023's landmark game Baldur's Gate 3, recently unveiled its upcoming game, Divinity, in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-the-game-awards-trailers-got-really-gross-this-year/1100-6536908/">boundary-pushing trailer</a> that reveled in extremely photorealistic violence, gore, and depictions of brazen sexuality. In it, a man is strung up to be sacrificed in a pyre while cultists watch, self-flagellate, and engage in public orgies. As he catches fire, we watch his skin melt off and his gaunt figure be torn to shreds. A child, who at one point seems concerned about the violence and is shown tugging on her mother's dress, is then revealed to be yet another zealous onlooker of all the violence and seemingly crass displays of sex that we've all just witnessed. And while the whole thing has caused some stir and raised some eyebrows, Larian is far less likely to be condemned and have their game withheld from stores than Santa Ragione.</p><p dir="ltr">The only clear distinguishing factor between these games and Horses seems to be that some of the above companies are too affluent (and their games are considered too profitable) for any of these stores and their creators to police. Santa Ragione and the likely hundreds of independent developers suffering at the whims of Steam's policy changes, aren't. Threatening one of the former would impact these stores' bottom lines. The latter likely won't.</p><p dir="ltr">It seems the corporations in control of the games industry seem intent on infantilizing gaming audiences, and bottle-feeding them the "right" kind of mature games. Anything that falls outside those thinly defined parameters, set by the most influential and powerful figures in gaming, is now morally deviant. But in a medium increasingly dominated by the likes of Fortnite, PlayStation's growing crop of prestige bids, AI slop, and games that are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-ceo-responds-to-child-predator-concerns-poorly/1100-6536445/"><em>actually</em> harmful to kids, like Roblox</a>, I desperately want games to <em>also</em> carve out a niche for avant-garde and otherwise deviant experiences. Games that push boundaries, raise questions, and give voice to uncomfortable notions and themes. Games that live up to the foundational tenets of art, even if I don't like or play them. Anything less is unbecoming of a field that constantly fights for a seat at the table of other artistic mediums, all of which have borne fruit far more boundary-pushing than anything found in Horses.</p><p>There is a rot at the core of this issue that threatens to swallow the artistry of the medium whole. A rot that wants to paper over the uncomfortable and authentic tendencies of art that are often antithetical to the profit-driven motives of corporations. For the sake of this maturing field, a field which so desperately wants to be seen and treated as if it's grown, I hope that we can stymie its efforts. For Horses, for every NSFW and adult game wrongfully censored before it, and for any future deviants to come.</p>

The former title is a return to form for a legacy franchise, while the latter leads the charge for the fledgling extraction-shooter genre.</p><p dir="ltr">Left in the dust in the shooter space, however, is Splitgate 2, a game that its makers thought would revitalize a genre they saw as growing stale. Developer 1047 Games released the first-person shooter in May, exuding extreme confidence in its product. Splitgate 2 tried to bank on nostalgia for old-school arena shooters, directly invoking Halo and even Titanfall. Yet, the game was also marred by contradictory decisions, adapting present-day monetization models and industry-wide fads like battle royale modes.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Splitgate 2 - "Something to Fight For" Launch Announcement Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Splitgate 2 is a blip in the big picture of 2025, but the issues and drama surrounding the title and its release were so prolific that the game is certain to be the subject of YouTube essays and analysis for years to come. From microtransaction controversies to studio CEO Ian Proulx donning the most egregious headwear possible in a livestreamed industry event, along with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-dev-lays-off-staff-co-founders-forgoing-salaries/1100-6532622/">developer layoffs</a> and an extremely unusual<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-is-reverting-to-beta-og-servers-shutting-down/1100-6533350/"> "unlaunching" of the game</a>, 2025 was nothing but tumultuous for the Splitgate team.</p><p dir="ltr">But what is easy to forget amid the public drama is how Splitgate 2 played--and it actually played very well. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-excels-at-feeling-like-its-own-thing/1100-6525852/">Splitgate 2 delivered crunchy gunplay</a>, retaining the simple-to-play, hard-to-master feel of its sleeper-hit predecessor. Whizzing around the map through portals was still a thrilling sensation, and the streamlined controls map portal creation to just one button (instead of two, like the previous Splitgate), made traversal feel faster and snappier.</p><p dir="ltr">Placing and traveling through portals remained an excellent and approachable movement tool. While other first-person shooters today have more advanced and esoteric movement techniques like slide-canceling and other exploits, portals are an easy concept to grasp--one that even the most casual player could use for creative strategies and plays.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620333-yo40sq5wr82f1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620333" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620333-yo40sq5wr82f1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620333"></a><figcaption>Splitgate 2 successfully retained the fast and frenetic pace of its predecessor.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620333-yo40sq5wr82f1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The early days of Splitgate 2 were also a reminder of the joy of "discovering" a game, watching new players try to wrap their heads around the portal traversal, and either stumbling or instantly excelling in matches. In those early days, it was much easier to create portals in strategic zones and completely mow down clueless opponents through them--which was fun in its own way. But as time passed, the budding player-base collectively figured out the inner workings of Splitgate.</p><p dir="ltr">The new game also addressed one of my biggest gripes with the prior one: the lack of any personality or visual identity. Splitgate 1 came across as a hodgepodge of assets and art styles, with generic soldiers that looked like "Master Chief at home" and anthropomorphic characters that make Peely from Fortnite look grounded in comparison.</p><p dir="ltr">Splitgate 2, on the other hand, presented a bolder and more refined art style, defined by bright, pastel colors. With sleeker character designs and environments, Splitgate 2 not only looked a lot better and more coherent, but the world of Splitgate became more tangible. Instead of vaguely resembling a Halo rip-off, Splitgate 2 made strides to build its own look and universe.</p><p dir="ltr">More controversial in Splitgate 2 was the addition of Factions, which were essentially archetypes or classes, each with its own unique kit of abilities. Larger franchises like Call of Duty and Halo have toyed with the concept, adding elements of Overwatch-style hero shooters in the mix, usually resulting in fan backlash.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620336-splitgate2_launch_blog_storm_01_1080p0_f12e7ca6d8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620336" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620336-splitgate2_launch_blog_storm_01_1080p0_f12e7ca6d8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620336"></a><figcaption>The addition of a battle royale mode felt contradictory to Splitgate 2's mission.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620336-splitgate2_launch_blog_storm_01_1080p0_f12e7ca6d8.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">From my experience, Factions and abilities are mostly harmless, rarely changing the calculus of a match, though I did desire game modes that lacked these additions and put a greater focus on the core portal FPS arena action. At the very least, the presence of Factions showed that 1047 Games was tempted by modern shooter ideas, even ones that were at odds with Splitgate's stated mission of bringing back a pure arena experience.</p><p dir="ltr">The strength of Splitgate 2 as a game was ultimately upended by the behind-the-scenes strife and widely reported missteps by the studio's management. Enjoying Splitgate 2 became a frustrating affair, knowing how much better the game could be if its makers stopped fumbling the ball.</p><p dir="ltr">That's because, on paper, Splitgate is an easy property to root for: It's built by an independent studio out of love for classic, beloved games, and it's an underdog swimming in a sea of live-service games. On the surface, 1047 Games appears to be a very collaborative studio, engaging directly with the community and seemingly taking feedback to heart. But the questionable decisions added up, with Splitgate 2 flying too close to the games-as-a-service sun with ridiculous in-game shop prices and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-battle-royale-mode-out-now-alongside-splitgate-2-official-release/1100-6532195/">shoehorned battle royale mode</a>. Proulx's "Hatgate" at Summer Game Fest also suggested that this studio, or at least the top brass, simply wasn't ready for the spotlight it craved on its crusade to revive the arena-shooter genre.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620338-abyssactionwithportal1p.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620338" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620338-abyssactionwithportal1p.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620338"></a><figcaption>The rebooted Splitgate: Arena Reloaded represents a rare second chance for a struggling studio.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620338-abyssactionwithportal1p.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the past few years, 1047 Games experienced a greater volume of triumph and turmoil faster than most studios ever will. Splitgate 1, years after a lukewarm launch, blew up during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-to-have-historic-launch-with-many-new-features-planned-thanks-to-100-million-investment/1100-6496241/">massive amounts of funding</a>. Then, the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-developer-announces-end-to-feature-development-shifts-focus-to-new-game/1100-6507095/">pivoted to making a sequel instead of building on the original game</a>. And after a botched launch of the sequel, the studio pulled the game back into a beta state, which, quite honestly, I didn't know was something game developers would even dare to do.</p><p dir="ltr">Even after all of this, 1047 Games is still standing, ready to relaunch Splitgate 2 into a new, even more streamlined experience<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-arena-reloaded-will-relaunch-the-halo-meets-portal-shooter-after-a-rough-year/1100-6536677/"> called Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</a>. Somehow, the studio survived ordeals that would kill most organizations, and it has a second chance that many studios would never receive.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who played Splitgate 2, or at least found some investment in the game, has likely made up their mind on whether or not 1047 Games deserves this second chance. But with how fun and pure its Halo-meets-Portal action is, the gameplay concept itself is absolutely deserving.</p>

Well, Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino has spoken up to put fan concern to bed.</p>
<p>Yes, <strong>The Sinister Broker Bazario’s Schemes</strong> is still coming this December on Switch 1 and 2, and it''ll be here "around Christmas", the founder of the company <a href="https://x.com/akihirohino/status/2000857953973264733">shared on social media earlier today</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this new free DLC brings the Fantasy Life i's blend of RPG elements, crafting, simulation, and exploration into a roguelike formula. Ginormosia is transforming and you'll be going up against new monsters, discover a new artifact, and find new weapons and mounts, too.</p>
<p>So it's pretty meaty! Something to play after you've over-indulged this holiday season, then. Hino said that the team will "be sharing the latest information from the official channels soon, so stay tuned!" So expect something in the next week or so. Because yes, Christmas <em>is</em> next week.</p>

<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time's upcoming DLC was announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fantasy-life-i-free-dlc-will-steal-more-time-in-huge-roguelike-open-world-mode">in June this year</a>, a little under a month after the game's release, with a release window <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-scores-a-free-dlc-update-this-december">following in September</a>.</p>
<p>There have been plenty of other free updates and tweaks since launch too, and with Level-5 riding high after Fantasy Life i and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven</a>, we can't help but be extremely excited for the future.</p>
