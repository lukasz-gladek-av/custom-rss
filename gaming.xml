            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yet another round of layoffs has hit Microsoft, affecting employees working at the tech giant's gaming division, as well as two of its other divisions.</p>

<p>A report by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-hit-security-devices-sales-gaming-2025-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Business Insider</a> (which is paywalled; we're using additional reporting by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-to-lay-off-unknown-number-of-staff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>) cites a spokesperson as saying that a small number of Microsoft employees would be affected, although the spokesperson stopped short of saying how many constitutes that small number.</p>

<p>Given that Microsoft is a massive company that employs hundreds of thousands of people, a small number could refer to tens of employees, a few hundred, or even a few thousand; anything short of thousands and thousands of employees being laid off would likely be a drop in the ocean for Microsoft.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025-flight-sim.jpg?itok=0Vm9UEUt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025-flight-sim.jpg?itok=KUruUp6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft's latest round of layoffs affect employees in gaming, as well as other divisions.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the gaming division, the latest layoffs also affect employees in Microsoft's security and sales departments, although we don't know what proportion of employees were laid off across each division.</p>

<p>As noted by GI.biz, the spokesperson said that these layoffs weren't related to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/08/microsoft-confirms-performance-based-job-cuts-across-departments.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">performance-based job cuts</a> announced last week, so it doesn't sound like these employees are being let go because their performance is unsatisfactory (or not solely because of that, anyway).</p>

<p>Back in January last year, Microsoft apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">laid off almost 2,000 staff</a> solely from its gaming division, with Xbox head Phil Spencer reportedly claiming the cuts were part of reaching a "sustainable cost structure" to support Xbox's "growing business".</p>

<p>Of course, those layoffs didn't prevent CEO Satya Nadella from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">scoring a payrise</a> to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. Perish the thought that the C-suite could perhaps absorb some of the cost when it comes to considering layoffs.</p>

<p>Microsoft is kicking off the year the same way it did 2024, holding layoffs across the company. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-hit-security-devices-sales-gaming-2025-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Business Insider</a>, Microsoft is letting go people from its sales, security, and gaming teams.</p>



<p>Business Insider sources say that employees started getting notifications of the layoffs on Tuesday. Microsoft told the outlet that the layoffs “are small” while not giving information on the number of cuts.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft about the exact number of people being let go from the gaming division in this latest round of layoffs. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>



<p>In January 2024, Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-microsoft-layoffs-affect-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let go 1,900 people</a> from its gaming team after it closed on its purchase of Activision Blizzard. More layoffs were held throughout the year via studio closures and other mass layoffs, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-650-people-lay-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including 650 people</a> in September 2024. The company even shut down four studios in May 2024, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. Tango Gameworks, however, would ultimately be purchased by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-acquired-by-pubg-publisher-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Krafton </a>and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-rebirth-krafton-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relaunched</a>.</p>

<p>Last year saw nearly 16,000 people let go from their jobs in the games industry across more than 160 companies.  In the first 15 days of 2025, <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">there have been 10 known layoffs</a> and closures with at least 160+ people let go based on known numbers. With estimates, we are looking at well over 200 people thus far. </p>

Meanwhile, the FTC says checks must be cashed within 90 days for the Zephyr face mask refunds, while PayPal payments need to be redeemed within 30 days.</p><p dir="ltr">For more information about the refund, the FTC points people to call Simpluris at 1-833-285-3003 or to check out <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/recent-ftc-cases-resulting-refunds/refund-programs-frequently-asked-questions" rel="nofollow ">the agency's FAQ page</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-ending-is-really-dumb.1082832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-ending-dumb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rocksteady has released the final update for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, and it looks like the joke's on you if you're still invested in the game's narrative for some reason.</p>

<p>Over on social media platform X, content creator Synth Potato <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1879239456320032790" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> the game's final cutscene in its entirety. It takes the form of a&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>-style 2D animated storyboard cutscene, probably - as Synth Potato notes - "due to budget cuts".</p>

<p>The cutscene is narrated by Harley Quinn, who tells the story of how she and the Suicide Squad entered Brainiac's lair only to find Superman alive and well (and, notably, not Brainiac-possessed). It turns out that the evil Justice League wiped out in the main story were just clones. Of course.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-ending-superman.jpg?itok=-JFeShDJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-ending-superman.jpg?itok=0Phn5dIy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can't scare me, Superman. You're just a clone.</figcaption></figure><p>The whole thing turns out to have been one of Batman's characteristically complex plans, although when Batman asks how the Suicide Squad knew the Justice League were clones, Quinn says they didn't. Ha, and indeed, ha.</p>

<p>Superman then says the Justice League needs to "atone" and put as many worlds right as it can, while Harley and the Suicide Squad get their collars shorted by the "wonder trio of Hack, Lawless, and Toyboy", pledging to go on a "road trip".</p>

<p>It's all exactly as abrupt and nonsensical as it sounds. I'll put my cards on the table and admit I didn't play&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>, so I have no idea whether this is a satisfying ending to the story or not, but I'm going to hedge my bets and say that it isn't.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">announced back in December</a> that&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s fourth season would be its last, and that an offline mode would be added in order to allow players to play without an online connection.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-harley-gang.jpg?itok=bZwP6Owb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-harley-gang.jpg?itok=KkqqP2ok 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>'s ending is unlikely to have many fans.</figcaption></figure><p>This decision was almost certainly made due to&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s terminally small player base, as well as the fact that its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">disappointing sales</a> contributed to a $200 million loss for publisher Warner Bros.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the best thing one can say about this ending is that it technically leaves the door open for another game in the&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>series, although with longtime voice actor Kevin Conroy now sadly no longer with us, that might not be such a good idea. Stay tuned for more.</p>

In March 2024, developers of Nintendo Switch emulator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settled-for-24-million-between-nintendo-and-tropic-haze"><u>Yuzu</u></a> were ordered to pay $2.4 million in damages after a court settlement with Nintendo. In October 2024, Switch emulator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-emulator-ryujinx-nintendo"><u>Ryujinx</u></a> ceased development following “contact from Nintendo.” In 2023, the developers behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dolphin-emulator-wont-release-on-steam-after-all"><u>Dolphin</u></a>, an emulator for Gamecube and Wii, were advised against a full Steam release by lawyers at Valve, who were contacted by Nintendo’s lawyers alongside “strong legal wording.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most famously, in 2023 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-released-from-prison-still-owes-millions"><u>Gary Bowser</u></a>, a reseller of Team Xecuter products that allowed users to bypass the Nintendo Switch’s anti-piracy measures, was charged with fraud and ordered to pay $14.5m back to Nintendo, a debt he will repay for life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, a patent lawyer representing Nintendo has lifted the lid on the company’s approach to piracy and emulation, and discussed how the propagation of emulators could lead to software piracy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a report from <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/kikakuthetower/250112a#i-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Denfaminicogamer</u></a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/are-emulators-illegal-or-not-nintendo-lawyer-explains-why-its-been-taking-them-down/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>) at Tokyo eSports Festa 2025, “Intellectual Property Managers” from Capcom, Sega, and Nintendo gathered to discuss the laws designed to protect companies’ intellectual property. Speaking for Nintendo was a patent attorney and Assistant Manager of the Intellectual Property Division, Koji Nishiura. In a translation by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendos-attorney-weighs-in-on-what-makes-emulators-illegal/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>, he explained: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To begin with, are emulators illegal or not? This is a point often debated. While you can’t immediately claim that an emulator is illegal in itself, it can become illegal depending on how it’s used.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nishiura explained further that if an emulator copies a program from the game it is running, it may constitute copyright infringement, and this is also the case if the emulator can disable a console’s security mechanisms. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is largely down to Japan’s “<a href="https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3629" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Unfair Competition Prevention Act</u></a>,” or UCPA, which is only enforceable in Japan itself. This makes it more difficult for Nintendo to pursue legal action overseas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The example given in a slide during the Tokyo eSports Festa talk was the Nintendo DS “R4” card, which allowed users of the cartridge to circumvent and run backed-up or pirated versions of games on a single cartridge. Ultimately, after Nintendo and 50 other software manufacturers cried out about the R4, Nintendo won a ruling that the manufacturers and resellers violated the UCPA, effectively <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-after-sales-ban-japan-finally-blocks-import-of-r4-cartridges" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>outlawing sales of the R4 in 2009</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nishiura further explained that tools that allow users to download pirated software within an emulator or piece of software would also constitute copyright law infringement. Named “reach apps” in Japanese law, these third-party tools like the 3DS’s infamous “Freeshop,” or third-party app installer “Tinfoil” for Switch, may also violate copyright laws.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its Yuzu lawsuit, Nintendo claimed that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-tears-of-the-kingdom-was-pirated-1-million-times-pre-release-in-lawsuit-against-emulator-creator">pirated one million times</a>. Specifically, the filing claimed that Yuzu's Patreon page allowed its developers to earn $30,000 per month by providing subscribers with "daily updates," "early access," and "special unreleased features" to games like Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Sayem is a freelancer based in the UK, covering tech and hardware.

                <p dir="ltr">When Dr. Doot took the stage on the final day of AGDQ 2025, the pressure was on. The speedrunner, whose nickname is surprisingly descriptive--he has a doctorate in music composition--was attempting a live run of Elden Ring using a digital saxophone as a controller. Beating Elden Ring's toughest bosses via traditional methods is difficult enough, but Dr. Doot put that PhD to good use and quickly slayed the final boss, as well as the maddingly difficult optional boss Malenia.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot had the chance to chat with Dr. Doot (who wished to only use his handle rather than his real name), and we were surprised to learn how the saxophone speedruns came to be. Rather than coming about simply as another way to beat Elden Ring or Dark Souls, they were an extension of Dr. Doot's practice on his digital instrument, the Roland Aerophone.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Aerophone actually became a game controller initially as a joke," he explained. "I actually got the Aerophone to help me with my music composition, because I play saxophone. And then I found the program that you can use to translate MIDI input, which is what the saxophone sends to the computer, to [computer] keyboard input. Then I realized, 'Oh, you can play games that way then!'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaCvZd7iOkM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yaCvZd7iOkM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The setup is relatively intuitive and undeniably hilarious. The keys of the Aerophone are mapped to different functions in whatever game Dr. Doot is playing. In the case of Elden Ring, only his character's movement is handled via an analog nub on the back of the device. Everything else, including moving the camera, is accomplished by pressing down the corresponding keys and blowing into the mouthpiece. This produces a "doot" noise, which is funny on its own, but hilarious when it's accompanying violent sword attacks finishing off a deadly boss. This, naturally, elicited plenty of laughs from the packed Wyndham Grand in Pittsburgh, and there have been some occasions when he's accidentally composed a new melody on the fly.</p><p dir="ltr">"Every once in a while, something wacky will happen, where I'll have a very specific script, and I'll play a jazz lick out of nowhere--it's really funny. And it always catches me off guard, like, 'Wait, that actually sounds like music!'"</p><p dir="ltr">Other games have allowed for more literal applications of the Aerophone, such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, in which Dr. Doot matched the button inputs for the ocarina songs to the keys of the Aerophone. Still, it sounds like using the instrument for… unintended gaming purposes seems to be a priority now, and he has a very lofty goal.</p><p dir="ltr">"There are only a handful of people who have done a full hitless run of the Dark Souls trilogy back to back. So, playing through all three games back to back without taking a single hit in any of the games."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4428031-elden-ring-doot-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428031" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4428031-elden-ring-doot-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428031"></a><figcaption>Incredible image not at all doctored by Darryn Bonthuys</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4428031-elden-ring-doot-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But that isn't his Mt. Everest: Dr. Doot's ultimate goal is to complete what the community calls "God Run 3." This consists of beating not only the three Dark Souls games, but also Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Elden Ring--all without taking a single hit. Only a few people have been able to do this using traditional means, which would make a saxophone run one of the most legendary gaming accomplishments in history.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, one genre proves nearly impossible to play using this method for Dr. Doot: the shooter. Controlling the camera and weapons using the Aerophone proved to be maddening with playing Doom 2016, as did the third-person shooting in the Resident Evil 2 remake. Perhaps someone will create the first true FPS (first-person saxophone) game and allow him to finally cross the genre off his list. For now, however, beating some of the hardest games in the world in one of the funniest ways possible is plenty impressive. Doing so with thousands of people watching, both in-person and online, is even more mind-blowing.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> merch is releasing, even though we still don't actually have a date for the game itself.</p>
<p>Konami's upcoming remake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-announced">first announced back in May 2023</a>, and will retain the 2004 original's story. This story follows Naked Snake on an operation deep within the Soviet jungle, some 31 years before the events of Metal Gear.</p>
<p>Around this time last year, it was then suggested by PlayStation that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater would release at some point in 2024</a>. However, that obviously did not happen. We are now two weeks into 2025, and a release date still remains unknown. But, what we do have in lieu of a date for the game is a date for… Funko Pops. Yay?</p>

<p>The Funko Pops in question are modelled on the two main characters in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater – Naked Snake and The Boss.</p>
<p>Naked Snake's figurine is wielding his combat knife. "This skilled soldier is sure to prove himself an invaluable asset to your POP! Games lineup," reads the Amazon description.</p>
<p>The Boss, meanwhile, has her signature The Patriot weapon in her hands and will also "prove herself an invaluable asset to your POP! Games lineup."</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D98SHGXZ,B0D98W27ML&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;tag=distrackers-20&amp;linkId=0ba0328aa880433028e4734d8a191b95&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Amazon sale's page</a>, these Funko Pops will be available on 25th March, in America at least (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/DisTrackers/status/1878859570199875716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1878859570199875716%7Ctwgr%5E84317e71e7c588a514aa5a0a9e82664bf76eca54%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fmetal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-funko-pops-before-release-date%2F">DisTrackers</a>).

<p>Last year, series producer Noriaki Okamura said Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is being remade as Konami believed that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-being-remade-as-konami-says-younger-generation-now-unfamiliar-with-the-series">"younger generation" was now unfamiliar with the series</a>.</p>
<p>Also, did you know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/20-years-later-konami-confirms-fan-suspicions-metal-gear-solid-3s-eva-was-voiced-by-the-little-mermaid">Metal Gear Solid 3's Eva was actually voiced by the same actor who played Ariel in Disney's The Little Mermaid.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>2024 was a year to remember for roleplaying games, and 2025 is looking to be no different. Whether you are looking into getting into a new series featuring a brand-new world, returning to a well-known universe, experiencing a well-known universe from another perspective, or enjoying a classic game with improved visuals and new quality-of-life features, the next 12 months will not fail to provide exactly what you are looking for.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a></em></p>
<h2>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (February 4 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-2.png"></a></figure>

<p>The original Kingdom Come: Deliverance was almost a bolt from the blue. Developed by a relatively small team, the game set in 15th-century Bohemia, starring the young blacksmith apprentice Henry from Skalitz, is still to this day one of the most immersive roleplaying games ever released. Very few games managed to make players feel like they were indeed living in a medieval European kingdom as much as the game developed by Warhorse Studios did.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will not revolutionize the formula of its predecessor, but this should be fine for the vast majority of fans, as the second entry in the series will turn every feature of its predecessor up to eleven, offering a lot more different ways to complete quests, better NPCs reactions to Henry's actions, an improved combat system and much more. With a game world twice as large as that of its predecessor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will provide plenty of content for players to get lost once again in 15th-century Bohemia and help Henry better shape his future and his destiny. Read our first impressions from a press preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Avowed (February 18 - PC, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Avowed_Wallpaper_3840x2160-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Obsidian Entertainment is a developer that needs no introduction, as it is the studio behind some of the best RPGs ever released, including the celebrated classics Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, Fallout: New Vegas, and the Pillars of Eternity series, which, together with a few other games, rejuvenated the top-down roleplaying games that were seemingly being left behind in the early 2010s.</p>
<p>Instead of releasing a third entry in the series, Obsidian decided to expand the world of Pillars of Eternity with Avowed, a project that was pitched as the studio's take on the Skyrim formula but eventually became more in line with what the studio always offered: a more focused game with a smaller scope and heavier emphasis on story and characters. While the world may be smaller compared to other roleplaying games, Avowed will still offer plenty of opportunities to have fun as the player investigates the Dream Scourge plague that is scouring the Living Lands as an envoy of the Aedyr Empire, thanks to multiple recruitable companions, a combat system that will incentivize combining magic spells with weapon attacks, plenty of skills to learn and tons of different locations to explore. Our first hands-on with the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very promising</a>.</p>
<h2>Elden Ring Nightreign (2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ELDENRING_NIGHTREIGN_Key_Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>By all accounts, Elden Ring was a massive success for FromSoftware. The open-world take on the Souls series formula captivated fans all over the world, and the excellent Shadow of the Erdtree expansion didn't sate their hunger for more adventures in The Lands Between. No one, however, would have thought that their next journey to those lands would be with Elden Ring Nightreign.</p>
<p>The new entry in the series will be a slightly different game than its predecessor, twisting its hardcore action roleplaying game formula with co-op mechanics and procedurally generated locations where up to three players will have to survive for three days and prepare for a massive boss battle while the playable area gets shrunk every time a minor boss is defeated. This battle royale-meets-co-op-meets-roguelite-meets-Monster Hunter experience sounds incredibly exciting on paper, and knowing FromSoftware, there's no doubt that they will be more than up to the challenge of expanding the experience of the original game in a rather unexpected way.</p>
<h2>Fable (2025 - PC, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fable_logo_trailer-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Despite having been announced a while back, there isn't a lot we know about Fable, the next entry in the series since the Kinect game Fable: The Journey, released in 2012. Still, the game is among the most anticipated role-playing games <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launching this year</a> for the simple reason that it is more Fable!</p>
<p>From the little we have seen so far, Playground Games will not deviate much from the formula seen in the first three entries in the series developed by the now-defunct Lionhead Studios, as the game will still be set in the luscious fantasy world of Albion, where nature and magic live in perfect harmony, where people talk with an unmistakable Shakespearean flourish, and where villains constantly attempt to disrupt peace and order to further their own nefarious ends. As the series has always been about becoming the hero, it will be very interesting to see how the morality system will return and if the player can decide to become not the paladin Albion needs, but a dark knight that still achieves salvation, but with less savory methods. A lot more will inevitably revealed throughout 2025, and we'll make sure to keep you informed of all the latest info.</p>
<h2>Monster Hunter Wilds (February 28 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Monster-Hunter-Wilds-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Monster Hunter Rise is among the most successful entries in the series, but those who got into CAPCOM's franchise with Monster Hunter World were looking for something more than the condensed, combat-centered experience the game offered. These hunters will get what they are looking for this year with the biggest entry in the series to date.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is not looking to reinvent the wheel in any way, but if the open beta is any indication, the game will offer a little bit for every sort of player, no matter what they are looking for. With huge open-world maps to explore teeming with life and danger, including different weather conditions that can massively affect hunts, massive monsters to take down using any of the 14 weapon types available, a huge number of craftable gear coming with skills to create unique builds, and new gameplay mechanics, which include the ability to bring two weapons and Focus Mode that will allow players to better target monster parts to disable certain attacks and obtain specific materials no matter the weapon they are using, Monster Hunter Wilds is setting out to be yet another landmark release in a series whose popularity is set to skyrocket once again, as we've glimpsed in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preview</a>.</p>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Destiny 2</h2>



<p>Developer: Bungie | Release Date: September 6th, 2017</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p><em>Destiny 2</em> has reached a new era. After ten years of being the series that popularized the live service shooter, its current state is less a complete fall and more of a denouement. The main story regarding The Witness has been resolved, but there are still lingering story threads being set up by Bungie's team. Threads that are potentially less cosmic in scope.</p>

<p>Players have been given the most tools to explore the combat sandbox to date. Weapons with the most exotic support mods. Prismatic subclasses allowing for greater player expression. It is a gameplay loop the fanbase has become intimately familiar with, for better or for worse.</p>

<p>The state of the game is a far cry from where it started. But this year, Bungie can officially say that their decade-long story came to its conclusion</p>

<h2>Second Place - Fortnite</h2>



<p>Developer: Epic Games | Release Date: September 26th, 2017</p>

<p>Written by Blair Bishop</p>

<p>Three things in life are certain: Death, taxes, and <em>Fortnite</em>. As Epic continues to embellish and reinforce the creative aspects of what’s possible inside their game, what’s spawned is now a nearly-endless cavalcade of combat game modes, quirky reenactions of multiplayer hits like <em>Phasmophobia </em>and <em>Battlefield</em>, and it’s breathtaking to watch.</p>

<p>That isn’t to detract from its primetime Battle Royale mode, however, which continues to shake up and modify the formula in many different ways. With the re-introduction of <em>Fortnite</em>’s OG island towards the end of the year, it’s clear that Epic are looking to recognize the history of the game that brought them to the peak, and has continued to since 2017.</p>

<h2>Winner - Helldivers 2</h2>



<p>Developer: Arrowhead Game Studios | Release Date: February 8th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Dan Rockwood</p>

<p>When <em>Helldivers 2</em> dropped last February, it offered an impressive array of gameplay options with two battle passes (Warbonds), countless ship and stratagem options, and a wide assortment of maps on two fronts with a variety of mission objectives. Now, nearly a year later, the game has expanded multiple times, cementing its legacy from just another live service game to one of the most iconic titles of 2024.</p>

<p>Though there were issues along the way, like nerfing fire weaponry immediately ahead of releasing the Freedom's Flame Warbond, or requiring Steam players to create and link a PlayStation Network account, these have been largely rectified through patches, indicating to players that Arrowhead Game Studios is listening to their needs.</p>

<p>Today,<em> Helldivers 2</em> offers many more options for new and returning players. There's now a whole new enemy added to the frontlines: the Illuminate alien race, new planets to fight on, vehicles to commandeer, and multiple new warbonds that offer unlockable weapons, armor, and more. With so many changes that helped improve the game throughout 2024, it's exciting to see what the next year will bring.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortunes-run-developer-prison<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Development on sci-fi immersive sim FPS&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>is being halted, and it's because the developer has been sentenced to three years in prison. Yes, you read that right.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805318" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news update on Steam</a>, developer Dizzie, who is now "the sole developer" of&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run</em>, shares that they've been "sentenced to prison for the next three years", describing the sentencing as "a long story".</p>

<p>According to Dizzie, they've been going through the legal process for their case all the time that they've been working on&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run</em>. They say that they were "a very violent person" and that they "hurt a lot of people in [their life]".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortunes-run-development-stopped-dev-prison-punch.jpg?itok=MBQpS2KX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortunes-run-development-stopped-dev-prison-punch.jpg?itok=beU8Mmhl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Development on&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>has been halted for the foreseeable future.</figcaption></figure><p>Cryptically, Dizzie says that "the other developer" on&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>has left the project, stating that after she recovered from "botched surgery", she decided she no longer wanted to work as a game developer.</p>

<p>Dizzie says that their case doesn't relate to&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run</em>'s other developer, Arachne, who is - or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/4234028300480496465" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">was, at one point</a> - Dizzie's wife. They also say that their crime is not a "sex crime", but that they're not going to go into specific charges, simply stating that what they did was "wrong".</p>

<p>Before Dizzie's incarceration, however, they have released a major update for&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>that contains plenty of new story content and gameplay changes. It will invalidate previous save files, though, so you'll have to start a new game if you want to experience it.</p>

<p>You can read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805320" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes for that update right here</a>. Naturally, owing to Dizzie's prison sentence, it may be quite a while before another update for the game is released.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>is, it's an immersive sim-style shooter inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EYE: Divine Cybermancy</em>. It also features what the devs call "the campy tone of space operas and titles like&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid</em>".</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>right now on PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1692240/Fortunes_Run/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Steam Early Access</a>. Again, though, it's probably going to be quite some time before any more content is added to the game, so bear that in mind before you make a purchase.</p>

<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 announcement feels imminent if rumors and leaks are to be believed. Every passing day feels like an excruciating wait for Nintendo fans, so we’ve collated every possible detail including the latest rumors, leaks, and Switch 2 speculation—including a potential Nintendo Direct in January 2025.</p>



<p>March 3, 2017, was a landmark day in the annals of gaming history. It was the official launch of the Nintendo Switch. A money-making phenomenon that has allegedly sold close to (if not more than) <strong>150 million units</strong>. The OG Switch has printed money for Nintendo, and after eight years, it’s about time we got its successor—the long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/we-desperately-need-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Rumors and gossip have circulated for months about when its announcement could be. 2025 has picked up where 2024 left off, only, the speculation has intensified one millionfold. The Nintendo Switch 2’s announcement feels closer than ever, and evidence supports this.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-date">Do we Know the Nintendo Switch 2 Announcement Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a line-up. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No official date has been officially or unofficially announced yet regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement, but it’s believed it could arrive on Thursday, January 16.</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo hasn’t confirmed the existence of the console, but it has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-acknowledges-recent-nintendo-switch-2-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged the Switch 2 leaks</a>. The company’s response was in retaliation to alleged <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-have-seemingly-surfaced-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons surfacing</a>. </p>



<p>Nintendo has previously said the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 will be announced before April 2025</a>. Everything feels like it’s dovetailing nicely, and the rumors are only the beginning.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-direct-january-2025-rumors-amp-leaks">Nintendo Direct January 2025 Rumors &amp; Leaks</h2>



<p><strong>A January 2025 Nintendo Direct could be on the cards with the showcase happening as early as the week of January 13.</strong></p>



<p>As of writing, this means the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-revealed-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 is being announced this week</a>! This is the biggest <em>take with a pinch of salt</em> imaginable, but the source is a reliable one. YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nate the Hate</a> says the console is going to be shown off, along with a reveal trailer.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Nate also says the Direct will “<strong>focus almost exclusively on the console itself</strong>” and is saving software reveals and information for a later date.</p>



<p>Again, <strong>January 16</strong> is being outed as the crucial date, but we’ll update you as and when we get new information or leaks.</p>

<h3 id="h-leaked-switch-2-games">Leaked Switch 2 Games</h3>



<p>2025 could be a big year for Nintendo Switch 2 games, and possible launch-day software includes <strong>Metroid Prime 4</strong>, <strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</strong>, and <strong>classic Xbox titles</strong> too.</p>

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios CEO has recently stated that he would like to see A-list actors “get violently killed” in the upcoming Helldivers movie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1i1sa6p/arrowhead_ceo_on_actors_for_the_helldivers_movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Helldivers</a> subreddit (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-movie-arrowhead-wants-hollywood-stars-die-opening-montage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>), the Helldivers 2 community has been discussing the upcoming movie in its official Discord channel, where the CEO, Shams Jorjani, recently shared some interesting thoughts. When asked whether the team knows details about the upcoming film, Jorjani responded that they do have some information, as the production keeps them “in the loop.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jorjani was also asked whether A-list actors like “Chris Pratt” will be featured in the upcoming Helldivers movie. He replied that the whole team is “hoping for as many A-list actors as possible—as long as they all get killed violently immediately.” </p>



<p>The essence of Helldivers 2 comes from giving your life for democracy, and the developers want this same form of hilarious self-sacrifice to be relayed in the movie, too.&nbsp;Players have already started making their predictions in the comment section, hoping to see the likes of Sean Bean, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Tom Holland and more get killed. Fans also don’t mind joining in as nameless actors if they get the opportunity to be mowed down by friendly fire. </p>



<p>On the topic of the Helldivers movie, the creative director also revealed Arrowhead’s involvement in the upcoming film, explaining that they are unaware of what it takes to make a movie and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-director-talks-about-their-involvement-with-the-upcoming-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“don’t, and shouldn’t, have the final say.”</a></p>



<p>In other news, Helldivers 2 developers have already begun fleshing out the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dev-next-game-concept/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high concept’ for the team’s next game</a>. Also, the title was Insider Gaming Community’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-best-multiplayer-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Best Multiplayer Game” of 2024</a>.

                <p>Microsoft reportedly considered completely shutting down Xbox in 2021, prior to its acquisition of ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Information</a>, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly had the choice in 2021 of winding down Xbox, or acquiring more studios to drive Game Pass subscriptions. He chose the latter, purchasing both ZeniMax for $7 billion in 2021 and Activision Blizzard for $75.4 billion in 2023.</p><p>Some big-name studios have also reportedly have not been swayed by Xbox Game Pass, which doesn't bode well for Microsoft's internal target numbers. Prior to its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft reportedly wanted to hit 100 million Game Pass subscribers by 2030, which would mean tripling its current base in five years. However, Microsoft has reportedly been unable to hit Game Pass internal growth targets in the past two years.</p><p>Microsoft also reportedly wanted other developers to rent its Azure servers after the Activision acquisition. Ironically, Activision reportedly still rents Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services while using its own servers for development, instead of utilizing Azure.</p><p>Since the launch of Xbox Series X|S, Microsoft has seen some ups and downs, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">closure of four of its own ZeniMax studios</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">lay offs</a> last year. While many developers participate in putting their games on Game Pass, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said back in 2022 that it doesn't make sense to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-launching-new-games-into-a-subscription-service-like-game-pass-makes-no-sense/1100-6509015/" data-ref-id="1100-6509015">put new releases into the service on launch day</a>.</p>

                <p>A new report may contain fresh clues about the apparent partnership between Ubisoft and Tencent, Ubisoft's fortunes continue to slide and the company looks for a way forward.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-15/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-mull-ubisoft-asset-venture" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> reported that Ubisoft and Tencent are considering, among other options, "creating a new venture" that could include "certain Ubisoft assets." The overall aim is to improve the company's value, sources said. The two companies are now "evaluating which assets to include in a new entity and their valuation," the report said, citing anonymous sources.</p><p>Should a deal come together, Tencent could "gain more control over" some of Ubisoft's franchises, the report said, adding that Tencent would also benefit from improving its own business results outside of China.</p><p>Sources told Bloomberg that no final decisions have been made and that conversations remain ongoing. None of this should be surprising, either, as Ubisoft said on January 9 that it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">appointed advisors to examine opportunities for Ubisoft to maximize the value of its company</a> through a variety of possible business maneuvers. In a conference call, though, Ubisoft declined to comment on the reported Tencent discussions, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-a-major-change-to-its-structure/1100-6526909/" data-ref-id="1100-6526909">date back many months.</a></p><p>A spokesperson for Tencent declined to comment when approached by Bloomberg, while a representative for Ubisoft pointed to the January 9 announcement.</p><p>During a conference call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said he sees "several potential paths" for the company and its franchises going forward to maximize shareholder value. It was previously reported that Ubisoft was considering numerous different possibilities for its future, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-a-major-change-to-its-structure/1100-6526909/" data-ref-id="1100-6526909">selling to Tencent.</a></p><p>On the call, Ubisoft declined to comment on the report of the company potentially selling to Tencent, but management said it is "exploring different options," adding, "We can't say more."</p><p>Ubisoft's share price rose on January 15, following the publication of Bloomberg's report. This came after periods of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/" data-ref-id="1100-6526262">consistent declines.</a> Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20/1100-6528717/" data-ref-id="1100-6528717">delayed its next big game, Assassin's Creed Shadows, to March.</a></p><p>In related news, the Biden administration recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-blacklists-tencent-over-alleged-ties-with-chinese-military/1100-6528668/" data-ref-id="1100-6528668">added Tencent to a list of companies affiliated with the Chinese military.</a> Tencent said the US government "clearly" made a mistake, going on to deny that it is a military company or supplier for the Chinese government.</p>

			<p>The Decima Engine, the game engine developed by Guerrilla Games that powers the Horizon series as well as the original Death Stranding and its upcoming sequel, could be used by other PlayStation Studios titles in the future, according to some recent findings.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/playstation-studios-embrace-decima-engine-guerrilla-expands-dev-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twisted Voxel</a>, Guerrilla Games Senior Producer Astrid Huntjens is listing on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/astridhuntjens/?originalSubdomain=nl">LinkedIn</a> among experiences at the studio, the management of communication and relations with other Sony studios interested in or using the Decima Engine, essentially confirming how Guerrilla has already expanded the support it can provide to other studios.</p>
<p>At the time, it is unknown which other games could be using the Horizon series Decima Engine, but there's a good chance Bend Studio's unannounced next project could be among them. On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-seymour-019b0b93/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn,</a> former Senior Game Designer at Bend Studio Mathew Seymour, who was involved in the development of the unannounced game until their departure from the studio last year, mentioned the Decime Engine among the tools used for the project, strongly suggesting that it will indeed use Guerrilla's game engine.</p>
<p>The aforementioned Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be the next game using the Horizon series Decima Engine, and although we haven't seen much of the game in action so far, there's no denying that what we have seen looks <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-looks-even-crazier-than-the-first-one-in-the-new-tgs-2024-footage/">extremely impressive</a>. The latest iteration of the engine can also be seen in action in <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-greatly-enhanced-visuals-performance/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered,</a> which launched a few months back on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

            <p>Nintendo is collaborating with Sea Life UK to tour an interactive, live <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> experience.</p>
<p>The event will allow guests to "discover incredible marine life alongside some of the game's characters" as they explore the 'Sea Life Islands', meet Tom Nook and Isabelle, and collect character stamps.</p>
<p>There will also be a fossil dig to reveal the ancestors of marine life, as well as a search for Gulliver who washed up on the island's beaches.</p>

<p>Animal Cross: New Horizons merchandise will also be sold in aquarium stores.</p>
<p>It begins next month in Sea Life Manchester, before continuing in Sea Life Birmingham, Sea Life Brighton, Sea Life London, and Sea Life Chessington World of Adventures, with the following dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sea Life Manchester: 8th Feb – 9th March 2025</li>
<li>Sea Life Birmingham: 12th April - 5th May 2025</li>
<li>Sea Life Brighton: 24th May - 15th June 2025</li>
<li>Sea Life London: 30th June - 27th July 2025</li>
<li>Sea Life Chessington World of Adventures: 1st – 31st August 2025</li>
</ul>
<p>Sea Life UK is part of Merlin Entertainments, which also owns theme parks Alton Towers and Thorpe Park.</p>
<p>However, it appears other aquariums in the UK - including Scotland - aren't included.</p>
<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons has of course proven exceptionally popular since its release on Switch in 2020. By 2022 it had become the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-new-horizons-now-the-best-selling-game-ever-in-japan"> best-selling game ever in Japan</a>.</p>
<p>A sequel is presumed for Nintendo's next console, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, though there's no official word.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Destiny 2: The Final Shape</h2>



<p>Developer: Bungie | Release Date: June 4th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p>Bungie's Light and Darkness saga concluded this year with<em> Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>. This finale managed to end their space opera tale and deliver the most robust expansion ever to the game.</p>

<p>The Pale Heart location is a stellar showcase of Bungie's impeccable art direction, presenting familiar locations twisted into grotesque corrupted shapes. The story campaign managed a strong blend of pitched gunbattles, haunting imagery, and powerful character moments.</p>

<p>Its fundamental game design reached a zenith with the introduction of Prismatic subclasses and its most challenging Raid to date, Salvation's Edge.</p>

<p><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shap</em>e reminded the world of Bungie's talent and dedication. For an entire generation, this expansion will be what they remember when they imagine what this studio is capable of.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Alan Wake II: The Lake House</h2>



<p>Developer: Remedy Entertainment | Release Date: October 22nd, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p>While light on runtime, <em>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House</em> continues the atmosphere and overarching themes of the original game. Blending the reality-bending surreality of a world at the whims of Alan's creative process with the sterile procedural office culture of the Federal Bureau of Control.</p>

<p>The level design also manages a similar mix, combining the key-hunting navigation of <em>Control </em>with the meticulous dangerous monster encounters of <em>Alan Wake 2</em>. This is punctuated perfectly with the introduction of the new painted enemies.</p>

<p>In two short hours, <em>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House</em> expands the possibilities of the Remedy Connected Universe and alludes to the nightmares and thrills that we may see in the next title</p>

<h2>Winner - Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</h2>



<p>Developer: FromSoftware | Release Date: June 21st, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Joseph Allen</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is longer, more involved, and more rewarding than many full-length games.</p>

<p>Given the huge success of the base game, director Hidetaka Miyazaki and his studio FromSoftware could have just indulged in a victory lap, but that’s never been their style, and <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is arguably even more ambitious than the foundations upon which it’s built.</p>

<p>This expansion packs in some of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s most beautiful (and horrifying) sights, from ruined, flooded castle courtyards to caves embedded with giant coffins and gorgeous fields full of delicate blue flowers in bloom.</p>

<p>The story you’ll discover as you explore those locations is characteristically obscure, but Miyazaki and company know that if you’re invested in <em>Elden Ring</em> enough to reach the point you need to in order to access <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, you’re in it for the long haul.</p>

<p>It’s that attitude that also allows FromSoftware to craft some of the most involved, satisfying, and occasionally maddening bosses they’ve ever put forth in one of their signature Soulslike action RPGs.</p>

<p>It’s best to know as little as possible about <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s gauntlet of boss encounters before playing, so if you’ve yet to experience this near-masterpiece, I won’t go into detail. Suffice it to say that if, for some reason, you thought <em>Elden Ring</em> went too easy on you, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> will give you the run for your money you want.</p>

<p>Like all of FromSoftware’s work, it’s not perfect, but <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> cements the studio’s legacy as an art-driven collective looking to engage and inspire you with its work rather than simply to help you kill time.</p>

    <p>There's no I in TEAM!! We're all on the case, and this is how you know it :)</p>
