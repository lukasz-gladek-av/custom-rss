		<p>The War of the Worlds: Siberia has got its first proper trailer that gives a look at the game which has been inspired by H.G. Wells classic story. The game is set in 1896, in a world where the Martians have invaded Earth. Cities and nations have fallen to the invasion. London fell first followed by other capital cities. The story of The War of the Worlds: Siberia is set after the invasion of Petrograd, and your are one of the survivors heading east.</p>
<p><iframe title="The War of the Worlds: Siberia — Premiere Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/63r65WiQoww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The player character is simply called Student. He is separated from his friends and family after fleeing Petrograd, and is embarking on a new life in Siberia on a mission to survive. The War of the Worlds: Siberia is a third person action adventure, in which the Student will use weapons from the era as well as his brain to solve puzzles. The real enemies are the other survivors as groups try to survive in a world where the aliens could strike at any moment. There will be a number of characters that will shape the Student’s journey, both friends and foes.</p>
<p>War of the Worlds: Siberia is not open world and instead will have levels to progress through, with the story being the focus. In this alternative universe Saint Petersburg is Petrograd, even though in our universe, the name Petrograd was not used until 1914. The imperial family is also called Romeyev, not Romanov, and players will not meet any historical figures. Players will not be venturing as far as Lake Baikal, but the Trans-Siberian Railway does appear. Three difficulty levels are planned which will essentially be easy, medium, and hard. Player choice will impact the story in some ways, and there will be abilities to unlock though these will be grounded in reality.&nbsp; At the moment, War of the Worlds: Siberia is only set to be released on PC, though 1C will consider other platforms.</p>

The two sides have different opinions on how to defeat Knull: Venom, having extracted the Knull Essence from a controlled symbiote, argues for caution due to its volatile nature and the risk of harming the planet’s symbiotes. With Knull still dormant, Venom prefers to wait until they can harness this power safely. On the other hand, the Guardians, tasked by Shuri, are eager to immediately neutralize Knull’s influence over the gods including Bast. At an impasse, they decide to go their separate ways.</p></blockquote></div><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) on December 6th.

		<p>Motorsport Games has confirmed that all of its NASCAR games will be delisted from digital storefronts on December 31st, 2024. This follows on from the sale of the NASCAR license to iRacing, which has been completed. Motorsport Games is not in the best of positions as it struggles with its finances, with recent financial results stating the company needs more funding to continue operations over the next year.</p>
<p>In a statement, Motorsport Games said, <em>“<span>To the NASCAR game community! From December 31, 2024, all NASCAR game titles and their DLC content will no longer be available for purchase on all digital storefronts but will remain available to play after this time. This includes the NASCAR Heat, </span><span>NASCAR Rivals, and NASCAR Ignition </span><span>franchises. Please lookout for various platform promotions this December to complete your NASCAR console game collection while you can! We sincerely thank our community for the enthusiasm and support you’ve shown for these games over the years and hope you have enjoyed racing with us.”</span></em></p>


<p>The recent <a href="https://motorsportgames.com/motorsport-games-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results/">third quarter 2024 financial results for Motorsport Games</a>, have reference to the company’s troubles, with it saying, <em>“Based on its cash and cash equivalents position and the average monthly cash burn, the Company does not believe it has sufficient cash on hand to fund its operations over the next year and that additional funding will be required in order to continue operations. In order to address its liquidity short fall, the Company is actively exploring several options, including, but not limited to: i) additional funding in the form of potential equity and/or debt financing arrangements or similar transactions; ii) other strategic alternatives for its business, including, but not limited to, the sale or licensing of the Company’s assets in addition to its recent sales of its NASCAR license and Traxion; and iii) further cost reduction and restructuring initiatives.”</em></p>
<p>Motorsport Games has already seen developers get laid off, and it seems the company could be considering such a move again if it cannot secure additional funding, along with selling other licenses. Motorsport Games currently holds the license for Le Mans.</p>

Roblox gift cards can be converted into the Robux needed to make those purchases, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-2024-deals">Cyber Monday</a> is one of the best times to find those gift cards on sale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are slight discounts on digital gift cards, the best savings you can possibly get is by going physical: Right now, you can get <a href="https://zdcs.link/92bnVY?object_uuid=39532ff3-ef49-4e73-ba5e-8b9fe2472693&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a full $20 off $100 Roblox gift cards</a>.

Though, I have to admit, getting $100 worth of Robux at a $20 discount is something you could even gift to yourself. A $100 gift card is equivalent to about 10,000 Robux. By saving $20, you're basically getting a whopping 2,000 Robux for free. Act fast, however, because I'm sure this Lightning Deal will sell out quick. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on what month you redeem your Roblox gift card, you’ll also get a different free virtual item. In November, that gift is the Midnight Crimson Sombrero, but if you wait until December (heads up: That's tomorrow), you’ll get the Festive Deadpan Alpaca Head.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Does Roblox Have Its Own Cyber Monday Sale? </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox as a platform doesn’t have an "official" Cyber Monday sale, but you might find deals, discounts, and special events within specific experiences.

<p>Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455844537830474746">full list of fixes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue when the second wave of monolith soldiers would not spawn during the On the Edge mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>Fixed the issue when Ritcher could be found dead during the A Minor Incident mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>The fixed issue was a player could get stuck after installing the fuse in the Wild Island area if they got the Emitter from Faust's Cell first during the Just Like the Good Old Days mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>The fixed issue was when a player could not successfully complete the All That is Left mission while exploring the Chemical Plant region.</li>
<li>Fixed issue when quest enemies could spawn in unreachable areas for a player during the “Down Below” mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when Scar could be missing during the Visions of Truth mission.</li>
<li>A few more EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION errors are fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Thanks again for your support. We will continue working on future updates, reading your comments and feedback, and fixing 'anomalies' if they occur," the team concluded.</p>
<p>"If you detect any - report them to our <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.stalker2.com%2Fhc%0A">Technical Support Hub</a>. That will help us investigate your particular case and implement fixes faster."</p>
<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has, of course, got off to an impressive start despite its technical issues. Earlier this week, GSC Game World revealed the shooter has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">already sold 1m copies</a> - and that figure doesn't including all those players exploring The Zone via Game Pass.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This second patch is not as fix heavy as the first patch, instead fixing some progression issues in some of the game’s missions. Those fixes include making sure enemies spawn when they should, and having characters be where they are supposed to be. Patch notes are below, but be aware of spoilers.</p>

<p>In our STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl review, Stefan said, “STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</p>

            <p>Re-Logic has confirmed there's "no way" we'll see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a> 1.4.5 released this year.</p>
<p>In a lengthy update on the official <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-state-of-the-game-november-2024.139594/">forums</a>, Ted "Loki" Murphy said that whilst the team was approaching the end of their respective to-do lists, end-of-year releases are "fraught with peril" due to review cycles and people going on early leave for the holiday. Consequently, he will not "force anyone on our team or anyone else's team to crunch".</p>

<p>"The work on the final lists from each dev team member is nearing its conclusion, which is a great measure of progress," wrote Murphy. "That said, we are pretty certain that there is no way that we will see Terraria 1.4.5 release this year.</p><p>"To make a long story short, end-of-year releases (especially if you are trying to sync launch across PC-Mobile-Console AND do so globally at the same time) are fraught with peril due to review cycles, people leaving early for the holidays, etc. The hope was that we would be able to get things in ahead of that end of year mess, but that isn't looking to be the case.</p>
<p>"We are also not going to force anyone on our team or anyone else's team to crunch for what would be an arbitrary deadline," Murphy added. "So, that said, the next Terraria update is moving along into 2025."</p>
<p>After acknowledging that the news "will not be welcome for many", Murphy added that Re-Logic "remain[s] committed to being a quality-first studio, so we will take the time necessary for each update to feel 'just right'... and we think that once the update is out, everyone will appreciate that time and care".</p>
<p>"Apologies for this one taking so long for sure, but it will be well worth it," he added.</p>
<p>We recently learned that Terraria will be linking up with open world pocket monster survival game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-announces-major-update-terraria-crossover-despite-ongoing-legal-issues">Palworld for the latter's first big brand crossover</a>. Exactly what this will entail remains to be seen, but artwork posted to social media earlier this week shows characters from the two games interacting ahead of the crossover happening at some point in 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The best Asleep deck in Pokémon TCG Pocket is not only fun, but it’s useful for completing certain Battle Tasks. Having a top-end Asleep deck is a vital part of your Pokémon portfolio, and I have the perfect team you need to build.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has been a revelation. The older TCG app feels like a distant memory already, and Pocket’s future is looking brighter than a Flash HM. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Future expansion</a> details sound promising, and Pokémon TCG Pocket keeps dropping exciting events to bolster the wealth of content.</p>



<p>Most players already have a slew of dastardly decks designed to win battles in only a few turns. Our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pokemon-tcg-pocket-electric-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Electric deck</a> is the perfect example of this, but don’t sit around daydreaming when there’s a boss Asleep deck to assemble.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-asleep-deck-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Asleep Deck in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s best Asleep deck requires two copies each of <strong>Drowzee</strong>, <strong>Hypno</strong>, <strong>Snom</strong>, <strong>Frosmoth</strong>, <strong>Jigglypuff</strong>, and <strong>Wigglytuff EX</strong>.</p>



<p>The only downside to this deck is it mixes Grass, Water, and Psychic Energy—but it’s not the end of the world. Most Pokémon cards in this deck have moves featuring Colorless Energy anyway. </p>



<p>In terms of its strengths, you have <strong>multiple Pokémon here capable of inflicting Asleep</strong>. Another huge benefit to our Asleep deck is <strong>no Stage 3’s are required</strong>. There’s a high likelihood your first draw—along with a Poké Ball or Professor’s Research—can get you up and running immediately.</p>



<p>Furthermore, no one’s sleep move costs more than three energy, and the focus is on Wigglytuff EX—<strong>these are the cards we want</strong>. Its <strong>Sleepy Song move costs three Colorless Energy</strong>, does <strong>80 Damage</strong>, and <strong>guarantees your opponent falls Asleep</strong>. Prioritize Jigglypuffs and Wigglytuff EXs, if you can.</p>



<p>Here’s our best Asleep deck in full.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-asleep-alternatives-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Asleep Alternatives in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>The evolution line of <strong>Oddish, Gloom, and Vileplume</strong> is the only other serious consideration for the best Asleep deck in Pokémon TCG Pocket. </p>



<p>Its omission from the main deck is the result of one aspect: <strong>It’s a three-stage evolution</strong>. </p>



<p>Meaning, you need a lot more luck on your side to get and use Vileplume. If you do, it’s one of the strongest Stage 3 cards in all of Pokémon TCG Pocket—primarily because it deals a lot of damage, puts Pokémon to sleep, and has 140 HP (unreal for a non-EX card.)</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-asleep-deck-so-powerful-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Why is Asleep Deck so Powerful in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>A lot of Pokémon TCG Pocket decks boil down to coin flips—and putting your opponent’s Mon to sleep can ruin entire game plans in the first few turns. It renders Pokémon catatonic, stops them from doing damage, and gives you free hits for as long as the coin flips are on your side.</p>



<p>Plus, in the case of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/venusaur-drop-event-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-new-promo-a-cards-rewards-tasks-how-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Venusaur Drop Event</a>, certain Tasks and Rewards are tied to the Asleep condition. The aforementioned event features a Battle Task instructing players to “<strong>Make your opponent’s Pokémon Asleep 1 time.</strong>” So, even if you’re not concentrating on winning, this deck is sure to put someone to sleep.</p>

It's time to respawn, with upgrades. After checking out the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-review" rel="nofollow">Halo Flashpoint Recon Edition</a>, we're now delving deep into the larger <em>Halo Flashpoint </em>Spartan Edition and <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Paint Set.</p>

<p><em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is a brand new miniatures game from Mantic Games, of which we've covered several of their products over the years, from the sci-fi skirmish game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/deadzone-3e-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Deadzone</a>, the sports battler <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/overdrive-review" rel="nofollow">OverDrive</a>, and their awesome fantasy mass battle game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/kings-of-war-guide" rel="nofollow">Kings of War</a>. In this article, we won't be going over how to play <em>Halo Flashpoint</em>, you'll have to check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-review" rel="nofollow">Recon Edition Review</a> for that, here we're going to look at what extra you get in the Spartan Edition set, along with the <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Paint Set, and talk about whether it's worth the upgrade.</p>

<p>The <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Spartan Edition is a much larger box than its Recon counterpart, this is because it contains over double the amount of miniatures and extra scenery.</p>

<p>The <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Spartan Edition contains (with the items in bold signifying those that are different from the Recon Edition):</p>

<ul><li><strong>16x Spartan models</strong></li>
	<li><strong>4x Banished Elite models</strong></li>
	<li>Rulebook</li>
	<li>Playmat</li>
	<li>Pre-coloured card terrain and tokens</li>
	<li><strong>Deluxe 2-sided playboard</strong></li>
	<li><strong>20x Weapon cards</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Extra terrain and tokens</strong></li>
	<li><strong>20x Player/model cards</strong></li>
	<li><strong>3x Reference cards</strong></li>
	<li>12 x D8 dice</li>
	<li><strong>8x Command dice</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Plastic 3D arena accessories</strong></li>
</ul><p>Like in the Recon Edition, the miniatures are single piece and ready to play, but you don't just get more of the same miniatures, you get the 8 from the Recon Edition, along with another 8 (2 of each of the 4 types), but with new armaments. You also get 4 Banished Elite models to pit your Spartans against.</p>

<p>Along with the paper playmat from the Recon Edition, you get a much more durable double-sided card playboard that features 2 terrain types that match the double-sided scenery (of which you also get more of), and you also get some plastic 3D arena accessories like flags to use in the different mission types. And because you're going to be playing bigger games, you get more command dice, more tokens, and a duplicate of each of the equipment cards.</p>

<p>The <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Paint Set is an incredible little product. It's currently the only place to get the Master Chief miniature (worth the purchase alone), but it also serves as a starter paint set for those who might be new to the hobby. Inside the box you will find:</p>

<ul><li>8 x Army Painter Warpaint Fanatic Paints</li>
	<li>1 x Brush</li>
	<li>1 x Master Chief Model</li>
	<li>2 x Game Cards</li>
</ul><p>We've covered the awesome <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/army-painter-gift-sets-guide" rel="nofollow">Army Painter</a> sets in the past, but this isn't just a rebox of their normal paints, this comes with 8&nbsp;<span><em>Halo-</em>branded</span>&nbsp;paints:</p>

<ul><li>UNSC Armor Green</li>
	<li>UNSC Visor Gold</li>
	<li>UNSC Techsuit Grey</li>
	<li>Red Team Red</li>
	<li>Blue Team Blue</li>
	<li>Banished Black</li>
	<li>Forerunner White</li>
	<li>The Flood (which is an absolutely incredible bit of marketing, is a wash that goes over the other paints once dry to bring out the detail)</li>
</ul><p>The brush that comes in the set is a basecoating brush, which is great for putting the base layer in black or white, and then the first layer of colored paint before adding the wash. If you want to start adding detail, you just need to pick up a brush with a slightly thinner tip, and mix the paints in this set with white (to make them lighter) and you can highlight your Spartans with just this set.&nbsp;The Army Painter also has a full video tutorial for painting the Master Chief miniature that you get in the set, which you can check out <a href="https://www.manticgames.com/news/learn-how-to-paint-master-chief/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Master Chief miniature that comes in the set is awesome, and John-117's pose really captures the feeling of him striding purposefully forward with an energy sword. Master Chief's stat card is also pretty insane, and as a result, he counts as 2 Spartans when using the drafting rules out of the box. John has 3+ stats across his profile for ranged, fight, and survive, along with an extra hit point and energy shield over his Spartan counterparts.</p>

<p>Master Chief also comes with the One Man Army Special Order, which means that if you use a special order command dice, you can then use any number of advance, fight,t or shoot command dice to throw Master Chief into the fray. John-117 is armed with an Energy Sword that has the same stats as the equipment card from the set, but no ranged weapon, so you will have to cover him with other Spartans until he can collect one, or close the distance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-spartan-edition-4.jpg?itok=vUl8jVyB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-spartan-edition-4.jpg?itok=xILnKoev 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Halo Flashpoint</em>&nbsp;Spartan Edition inlcudes 2 copies of 4 new Spartan armaments&nbsp;(Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure><h2>What New Units Does The Halo Flashpoint Spartan Editon and Paint Set Contain?</h2>

<p>The <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Spartan Edition comes with the same 2 copies of the 4 Spartan types as the Recon set, along with 2 copies of the same 4 Spartan types, with different armaments, and 4 types of Banished Elites.</p>

<p>The Spartan Editon includes 2 identical teams of 4 Spartans from the Recon edition:</p>

<ul><li>Spartan MK VII - Armed&nbsp;with an MA40 Assault Rifle.</li>
	<li>Spartan Brawler - Armed with a CQS48 Bulldog.</li>
	<li>Spartan Zvezda - armed with a&nbsp;VK78 Command.</li>
	<li>Spartan Deadeye - Armed with a&nbsp;M392 DMR rifle.</li>
</ul><p>Along with 2 teams of identical teams of the following 4 Spartans:</p>

<ul><li>Spartan MK VII - Armed with a Pulse Carbine, which rather than have rapid fire like the MA40 Assault Rifle, has Armor Penetration (1) and Energy Shield Depletion.</li>
	<li>Spartan Brawler - Armed with a Needler, which has a longer range than the CQS48 Bulldog, and rapid-fire / weight of fire, rather than knockback.</li>
	<li>Spartan Zvezda - Armed with a Cindershot, which has a shorter range than the VK78 Commando, but has energy shield depletion, grenade implosion, and lethal.</li>
	<li>Spartan Deadeye - Armed with a Stalker Rifle, which has Armor Penetration 1, and a sniper scope, which allows a long action shot, taking more actions, but adding 2 dice and getting headshots on a 7 or&nbsp;8.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-spartan-edition-3.jpg?itok=eKnqIW9_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-spartan-edition-3.jpg?itok=ZWkHH5qi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Currently, the only place to get hold of the Banished miniatures and profile cards is the The&nbsp;<em>Halo Flashpoint</em>&nbsp;Spartan Edition (Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure><p>The 4 Banished Sangheili Mercenaries included in the Spartan Edition, all have the same stats, with 4+ in ranged, fight, and survive, but also Energy Shield 3 and evade which allows them to move after being shot. The Sangheili come with the following armaments:</p>

<ul><li>Energy Sword / Plasma Grenade</li>
	<li>Energy Daggers / Needler / Plasma Grenade</li>
	<li>Energy Daggers / Plasma Rifle / Plasma Grenade</li>
	<li>Energy Daggers / Pulse Carbine / Plasma Grenade</li>
</ul><p>And to keep the pressure on the Spartans the Sangheili come with Reinforcements Incoming special order, which allows their player to use a special order to speed up their respawn. You can't mix Banished with Spartans, so the Banished team selection is fixed in this box, but it does add a welcome dynamic to the set, rather than just fighting against other Spartans, until further factions are released.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Halo Flashpoint Spartan Editon and Paint Set?</h2>

<p>I'm a big fan of the <i>Halo Flashpoint Recon </i>Edition box, and the Spartan Edition is the Recon Edition, but with much more. You get a lot more variety for your drafts, making teams entirely of any of the 4 types is possible here, and the different armament options make games more interesting, especially with the addition of the Banished team. It's also worth noting that while more Spartans are on the release roadmap for the next few months, the Banished aren't, so this is a very worthwhile purchase to start playing with them.</p>

<p>And if you want to add Master Chief to your games, the paint set for me was worth it for the miniature alone, and the additional <em>Halo-</em>themed paints and brush were a bonus.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Should I Buy The Halo Flashpoint Spartan Editon and Paint Set?</h2>

<p>If you just want a simple pick-up-and-play deathmatch game, then the Recon Edition is very solid for the price, but if you want a lot more variety, or you're looking to go full into <em>Halo Flashpoint</em>, then the sheer variety of the Spartan Edition makes it worth it. You get 5 different full-fire teams, along with all the extra scenery, 3D arena accessories, and the durable gameboard, which is well worth the extra investment.</p>

<p>The paint set is worth it for the Master Chief miniature alone if you're a <em>Halo</em> fan, and adding him to your games is a lot of fun. If you're a <em>Halo</em> fan but not a tabletop gamer, then this box is perfect to get the miniature and the paints you need to have him looking great on display.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is the definition of great power coming with great responsibility: It is a blockbuster shooter with a lot of star power but also requires enough firepower to sustain itself. This is where the Marvel Rivals System Requirements need to rise to the occasion, so let’s see if you meet the criteria.</p>



<p>Throughout the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> alpha and beta tests, it became apparent the hero shooter is a good-looking game. Its cel-shaded visuals pop and every attack pulsates with a rich palette of colors and effects. Marvel Rivals is easy on the eyes, but players wonder if it’s as forgiving on hardware.</p>



<p>NetEase Games wants as many people playing Marvel Rivals as possible, and having higher system requirements can be costly.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-minimum-requirements-on-pc">Marvel Rivals Minimum Requirements on PC</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Detail on detail. Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The minimum requirements for Marvel Rivals are designed to be as inclusive as possible. While a low-end rig is probably not going to cut it, I’ve definitely seen worse figures where minimum requirements are concerned. I experienced some issues during the alpha test with a good system, but this is probably a thing of the past now.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals should play just fine if you have decent RAM and a solid processor. It’s also recommended you install the game on an SSD drive for an improved experience.</p>



<p>Check out the full minimum specifications for PC below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">PC Specification</th><th data-align="center">Minimum Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 64-bit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 5 1600X / Intel Core i5-6600K</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD RX 580 / Intel Arc A380 / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">70 GB</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-recommended-requirements-on-pc">Marvel Rivals Recommended Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>If you want your gameplay to look heroic and ripped straight from an MCU scene, the best Marvel Rivals graphical settings go a long way to accomplishing this. The recommended PC specs satisfy the higher-end requirements, and make the shooter look its best.</p>



<p>Your setup needs to have a better CPU and graphics card, this goes without saying. A lot of the settings are the same though, as is the advice to install Rivals on an SSD drive.</p>



<p>Here are the recommended Marvel Rivals PC specs to maximize the title’s content.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">PC Specification</th><th data-align="center">Minimum Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 64-bit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 5 5600X / Intel Core i5-10400</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD RX 5700-XT / Intel Arc A750 / NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (Super)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">70 GB</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

		<p>Now that Thanksgiving is out of the way in the US, and as we tick on over into December this weekend, it’s time for everyone to accept that it’s Christmas. Start your Advent calendars, decorate trees, make and/or eat mince pies, panic over any presents you have to buy and haven’t yet… you know. Christmas.</p>
<p>And that also means that almost all the big games of the year are now out – there’s pretty much just Indiana Jones, it feels like – and we’ve got all those Game of the Year awards to sort out. The Game Awards is just around the corner though, to add a little spice with expensive advert slots for trailers and announcements.</p>
<p>All of which means that this week has been a little slow.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-hardware-ray-tracing-playstation-5-pro-pssr-avatar/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Like other popular games, Fortnite was recently updated with a PlayStation 5 Pro patch that introduces some new features that elevate the game's visuals considerably and provide a glimpse at the future of Unreal Engine 5-powered games on the system.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> shared their analysis of the game's PlayStation 5 Pro patch, showing how the introduced additions make a big difference, as does the absence of PSSR support. Instead of using the AI-powered upscaler, which is producing a variety of issues in several titles, Fortnite on PS5 Pro continues to use TSR, a choice that makes total sense considering it is tailored to Unreal Engine 5 and has less cost on the GPU, allowing the game to run at 60 FPS and higher with fewer issues.</p>
<p>The most significant addition included in the Fortnite PlayStation 5 Pro patch is the introduction of Unreal Engine 5 Hardware Ray Tracing, making the popular battle royale game one of the few UE5 games to support it on consoles. The difference, as shown in multiple comparisons, is night and day with software ray tracing, as Hardware Ray Tracing is generally more stable and consistent, bringing massive visual improvements and fixing some of the stability issues seen on the base model.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Upgraded For PS5 Pro - Unreal Engine 5 Hardware RT Makes A Big Difference" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HrYk0J9-ITY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the Fortnite PlayStation 5 Pro patch showed how the Unreal Engine 5 can take advantage of the system's power to enable features not possible on the base model, other patches show how one of the system's new features, the aforementioned PSSR upscaler, still has a long way to go. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is among the latest games to support the upscaler, but the results are extremely disappointing, as showcased in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamingTech-YouTube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamingTech</a>'s analysis.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - PS5 Pro Patch 1.2 Is Terrible - PSSR Is Not For Every Game!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQGQug_A4_I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the system by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a> that The Witcher 4 has officially entered full-scale production, Eurogamer has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an article featuring quotes from CD Projekt RED developers on the project.</p>
<p>Joint CEO Michał Nowakowski claimed the game will be bigger and better than previous titles made by the Polish studio because that's simply how they roll in terms of ambition.</p>
<p><em>Again, I will not say it's easy, but I think that we have some cool stuff going, and hopefully that will have some good showcase of the technology. The only thing I will say is that changing the tech for us does not change the fact that we always will be ambitious. And the next game we do will not be smaller, and it will not be worse. So it will be better, bigger, greater than The Witcher 3, it will be better than Cyberpunk - because for us, it's unacceptable to launch that way. We don't want to go back. </em><em>Even if there will be some 'sweaty moments' and maybe even some bad stuff happening, still, I think that we will try everything we can to make it even more than what we achieved in the past years. So the technology should not be a blocker for us, basically.</em></p>
<p>Speaking of the technology, the article also includes a quote from VP of Technology Charles Tremblay regarding the somewhat puzzling decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switch</a> from the RED Engine to Epic's Unreal Engine 5, starting with The Witcher 4. Tremblay first said that CD Projekt RED is very proud of its achievements with the RED Engine, including Cyberpunk 2077. However, the studio noticed it was problematic to handle multiple projects at once, whereas it should be simpler with UE5. Moreover, using the most popular game-making tool, CDPR could put more players working on the actual games.</p>
<p><em>So the idea was that we can push the technology, we can finally have all the technical people in the company working together on different projects, rather than super centralised into one technology that can very difficultly be shared between other projects.</em></p>
<p><em>We can share expertise, share people, share knowledge. And also we wanted to be sure that we developed some of the technology correctly this time around - with our expertise, we know how to do things with the experience we had in the past, and now it's time to actually make it shareable across all the groups.</em></p>
<p>Another key aspect is that for The Witcher 4 and the subsequent future games, CDPR understandably wants to avoid a repeat of the Cyberpunk 2077 situation on consoles. For this reason, they are now making sure all versions of the game run equally well during all stages of development.</p>
<p><em>Having the console working super late, it's unacceptable anymore, and it's part of our process. So we do the reviews on console, so we know exactly where we are on all the platforms - the lower platforms we have - rather than, you know, 'Oh PC is fine, so we can go forward'. So we changed this approach to have a broader visibility on the other platforms we want to have.</em></p>
<p>Tremblay also hinted that there likely won't be a PC-only launch, even though that might have helped optimization by focusing on a single platform at a time.</p>
<p>Lastly, Joint CEO Michał Nowakowski discussed the marketing plan for The Witcher 4. The studio doesn't want a long marketing phase like with Cyberpunk 2077, so the goal is to start roughly a year before launch rather than two years. That said, Nowakowski also added that doesn't mean there wouldn't be teases or anything like that before the start of the full-scale marketing campaign. This leaves fans with a bit of hope to see something of the studio's next game sometime next year.</p>

LEGO can be a bit pricey, but this set is still cheaper than most battlemats and painted miniatures!
