            <p>
Back in April, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stray-gods-a-roleplaying-musical">Stray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical</a> developer Summerfall Studios <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-writer-teases-a-new-arcane-deckbuilder-from-his-stray-gods-studio">launched their Kickstarter for Malys</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilder where you play as a "former priest turned demon-hunter" that certainly looked quite atmospheric. This is the same studio co-founded by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> writer David Gaider, so it's not like they came out of nowhere. However, it fell a bit short of meeting its goal, something that quite often guarantees that death of a game. Except it just launched into early access this week. Go figure!
</p>

<p>
Let's add a bit of context as to how that came to be, as explained by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/malys">Malys</a> project director Liam Esler in a <a href="https://www.summerfallstudios.com/malys-developer-updates/devlog-one-malys-early-access">devlog post</a>. The team always had a plan on how to get to 1.0 for Malys, "but games like this live and die on their communities." With the Kickstarter failing, that changed plans, leading them to need more feedback than they'd originally intended, hence the early access release.
</p>

<p>
"The community response both to the game itself and to our team has been overwhelmingly kind, and even though Malys isn’t quite where we’d ideally like it to be for a public launch, we feel bringing this current version of the game to Early Access is the best step we can take", Esler explains.
</p>
<p>
One thing that he also made clear is that "this is very much a work in progress build of the game. Early Access on Steam in 2025 is nowadays games that are ‘mostly done’, excluding adding additional content. If you don’t want to play a version of the game that is in-progress, we don’t recommend buying this Early Access version and instead waiting for the 1.0." A caveat was added that the price will go up after early access too, so keep that in mind depending on how much faith you have in the team.
</p>
<p>
Apparently the plan is to put out gameplay updates "about once every three weeks", which will range from planned content, adjustments based on feedback, and bugs. In terms of what's currently included, there's the first region, a "segment" of story, and a "variety of cards/ curios to choose from." A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3449690/view/525346350588493892?l=english">Steam post</a> announcing the early access also lists some known bugs for you to keep in mind too.
</p>
<p>
Essentially, it sounds like Summerfall Studios are taking another big swing here after not quite managing to make contact with that Kickstarter. Good luck to them, I say, the game looks neat.

            <p>
Right now, I can't really tell you much of what A Short Hike developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-short-hike">adamgryu</a> is working on. He <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adamgryu.bsky.social/post/3ls5lvip3nc2j">shared a little look</a> at whatever is next last week, and it certainly looks adjacent to A Short Hike vibes wise - we'll come back to this one with the tiniest of details in a bit. At the very least, I can certainly tell you what he's not working on: a game called <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game">Untitled Paper RPG</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As described by adamgryu, Untitled Paper RPG is an "untitled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> inspired by the classic Paper Mario games. It’s got turn-based combat with quick time events and a detailed overworld to explore." This of course begs the question why I'm telling you about this game at all if it's ostensibly cancelled. Well, last week the indie dev actually shared a short one to two hour long demo of the game, essentially the entirety of what was made. Adamgryu also offered up a <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game/devlog/971220/i-might-never-finish-this-game-so-im-releasing-the-demo">short blog post</a> explaining the project a bit, and what led to it now being officially cancelled.

Untitled Paper RPG initially started development back in 2016, after adamgryu saw the announcement for Paper Mario Color Splash. "I was nostalgic for the old style of Paper Mario and thought - well, I make games, why not try making the game I want to see?" he explains. After leaving his job in 2017, he set out to make indie games, but while working on this one in late 2018 he took a break and started on A Short Hike. "It unexpectedly did really well for me! I had planned to go back to my RPG at some point, but there was still a lot of work I could do on A Short Hike."
</p>
<p>
In the end, his reason behind "sort of" cancelling the game was a simple one: after putting out A Short Hike, he just "didn’t really want to go back to this game? The development for the RPG had become difficult, which was why I took a break from it in the first place. I might return to this project someday, but I’ve been working on other things and don’t see myself making time for this RPG in near future."
</p>
<p>
Adamgryu then listed out a few of the reasons that working on the game felt "overwhelming," including the classic issue of the scope feeling too big, not actually having a story, and having doubts over the turn-based combat system. He ultimately decided to release this demo partially because some people still ask about it, so "sharing the demo is better than nothing."
</p>
<p>
Back to that GIF of one of his upcoming games, Adamgryu also shared that this is an action adventure game he's working on. It's one of three projects he's tinkering away at, including a micro-RPG with a claymation aesthetic, and an online platforming roguelike.
</p>
<p>
It's often sad when exciting games get cancelled, but it's also rare that we in the first instance get this much insight as to why, and in the second have the ability to actually play some of it. There's a value to be found in something that's incomplete. I often think about Satoshi Kon's Opus, a manga he never finished before his death in 2010, and how it's then forced to leave so much to the imagination of the reader. What would Untitled Paper RPG have become? Perhaps a worse game than what its demo presents! So let's appreciate what we do have instead.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I thought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/locomoto">Locomoto</a> would be the perfect game for me amidst the Switch 2 chaos. With all the excitement of opening new games and speeding around the track in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, I needed something much slower, calmer, and cosier.</p>
<p>And, for the first five hours, Locomoto slotted into that role perfectly. You're the conductor of your own train which you use to ride across a surprisingly sprawling countryside setting, populated by anthropomorphic characters. It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a>-meets-train sim, but with a focus on community building and quests.</p>
<p>You spend most of the game helping residents with their problems, driving them around, and delivering mail. You get paid in tokens which you use to buy materials (which you can also harvest with tools) to craft furniture. Initially, I adored this gameplay loop. I could take my time making my train look pretty and give my passengers the comfiest seats. I enjoyed talking to the characters because each of them had their own personal dramas that often spilled out.</p>
<p>It's all very low stakes, and that works for a 5-10 hour game, but Locomoto is more than double that if you take time to do deliveries and quests. When every train journey is the same rotation, and every task is some variant of a fetch quest, it's no longer relaxing, it's exhausting. Eventually, I just marked my destination on my map and popped my Switch down to let the journey carry on, occasionally checking to see if I needed to fuel up.</p>
<p>The customisation is hugely impressive, and you can create the cutest animal avatar of your dreams. I went for a red panda named Ruby, because c'mon, <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/red-panda">look at how irresistible they are</a>. There are tons of clothes to collect throughout the game too, and I was changing outfits basically every hour.</p>
<p>You can decorate your train too, filling it with furniture or painting the outside. It's another great little way of expressing yourself in-game, but it's a little awkward, with stiff-feeling controls as you try to shift furniture across the grid-based decoration system. And if your train is too long, then forget about painting those back carriages.</p>
<p>Lastly, while the game's pastel look is lovely, performance is a little shaky on Switch, even after a day-one patch. Most of the time, it runs at sub-30fps, with weather, busier train journeys, and late-game stations tanking that more. There are also visual bugs too, like suitcases appearing on train tracks, missing textures, characters walking in mid-air, and items spawning inside characters. If you have a Switch 2, play it on there — the game runs at 60fps, and looks better as a result.</p>
<p>Locomoto is clearly a game that puts the 'vibes' first. For a slice of its runtime, it was perfectly pleasant, but by the end, I was running on fumes. Yet, if it's a sedate and steady adventure with solid characters and a cosy atmosphere you're after, you'll love this. Just don't expect a lot of variety.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/locomoto]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Given just how categorically weird Hideo Kojima’s games are, and how otherwise risk-averse AAA publishers tend to be, it is downright miraculous that <em>Death Stranding </em>was enough of a blockbuster hit for someone to greenlight a second one—even moreso since that’s a game where even the people who played it will give you one of those puppy dog tilted-head looks if you ask them what the plot was. Yes, there’s Norman Reedus; there’s a baby in a jar; Guillermo Del Toro’s in there somewhere; there’s a guy named after <em>Die Hard </em>for some reason; there’s a lot of squids and walking, and that’s all you can really expect. It’s a lot to try and make sense of. That’s not even to blame players or the modern attention span, that’s thoroughly by design—and Kojima knows it. Hideo saw how David Lynch stood on business, refusing at every turn to explain his art to anybody, and said “bet.” You love to see it. </p><p>But, the sequel has arrived, and just maybe some of you might want a nice handy primer on this wild story before dropping the money on <em>Lone Daryl Dixon and Cub Volume 2</em>. That’s no easy feat, given how plentiful but scattershot the lore is. But damn it, we’re gonna give it everything we’ve got to distill and streamline a hell of a lot of information and lore as much as possible. As long as this is gonna be, we cannot stress this enough: <em>this is the short version</em>. Strap in, kids, we’re going on a wild—<strong>and yes, spoilerful</strong>—ride.</p></div><figure id="" data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h177385"><a id="1"></a>The History of the (Other) World, Part I</h2><figure id="" data-id="25f5b0501a462cb3d8e04afcefe4494f" data-recommend-id="image://25f5b0501a462cb3d8e04afcefe4494f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="BTs hover in the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="BTs hover in the air." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="25f5b0501a462cb3d8e04afcefe4494f" data-recommend-id="image://25f5b0501a462cb3d8e04afcefe4494f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="BTs hover in the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, while this guide is going to attempt be as easy to parse as humanly possible, I’m sorry to say, we are gonna have to drop some absolute, pure, Grade A, metaphysical nonsense beforehand; there’s no way for this whole thing to make sense unless you have an idea of the basics.</p><p>Specifically, the basics of death.</p><p>In <em>Death Stranding</em>’s universe, there’s the world we all physically inhabit while we are alive—we all know the rules here, in theory—and then <strong>upon death, human souls pass through an area called the Beach</strong>. It’d be easy to describe the Beach as Purgatory, where the ocean is the true void of death and/or whatever comes after, but that’s not a full picture of <em>Death Stranding</em>’s conception of it. This “afterlife” is not dependent on morality, and not everybody’s Beach functions like a literal sand-filled beach (though many do, complete with dead sea creatures, especially when there’s mass death involved).</p><p><strong>Functionally, think of The Beach as a one-way trip across the U.S./Canadian border</strong>, where the U.S. is life in the physical realm as we know it, and the great wolverine-infested wilderness of Northern Canada is death. The Beach is the checkpoint, the last look at America, all the duty-free shops, “last gas station before the border” signs, and some ridiculously tight security. In the normal world of <em>Death Stranding</em>, every person that dies has their soul take a drive up North, waits way too long in their car at the border, gets its passport checked out, and moves right along up North to join Alpha Flight or whatever people do up there. Canada, however, still has the big cities closer to the border, your Montreals, Torontos, Vancouvers, etc, before you get into the wilderness. They still feel familiar, but they can be extremely specific to the individual, and have their own rules outside the aforementioned. But instead of, say speaking French, or a crippling maple syrup addiction, the<strong> Beach mostly just throws out the normal rules of the flow of time, and is mostly made of antimatter</strong>. Still with us? Good.</p><p>Now, let’s assume someone breaks the rules, and sneaks a plate of poutine out of Canada into the U.S. without it being properly declared. Well, American politics being what they currently are, chances are good that person’s being shunted off to El Salvador. In Kojima’s world, however, the consequences are arguably even more severe, where <em>any</em> Canadian goods whatsoever winding up on the U.S. side of the border has a chance of triggering a nuclear bomb, the fallout of which affects both countries for years. More specifically to the world of the game:<strong> Any matter from the realm of the dead that winds up in the world of the living ends up wreaking total havoc with the natural order.</strong> And if that matter happens to be, say, a human soul trying to reinsert itself into its dead body, it triggers an explosion called a voidout, one big enough to completely wipe out a city in a split second, and punch a hole in both realms large enough for immigrants on both sides of the border to cross back and forth.</p><p>Tl;dr: the worlds of the living and the dead shouldn’t mix. And yet....</p><h2 id="h177386"><a id="2"></a>The Original Death Strandings</h2><figure id="" data-id="26d2ad5f332bce636d7921af4a09f4b0" data-recommend-id="image://26d2ad5f332bce636d7921af4a09f4b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam stands in front of a voidout crater." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sam stands in front of a voidout crater." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="26d2ad5f332bce636d7921af4a09f4b0" data-recommend-id="image://26d2ad5f332bce636d7921af4a09f4b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam stands in front of a voidout crater." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now for the actual in-game history lesson: <strong>Every few million years or so, a being ends up tied so strongly to Earth <em>and </em>to their Beach that both sides eventually glitch out, and a Voidout so severe occurs that it triggers an Extinction Level Event (ELE)</strong>. Specifically, the game infers that the Big Five ELEs—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that bit of lingo’s 100% real, btw</a></span>—were the result of that exact glitch in the fabric of reality, of so-called Extinction Entities coming into being. <em>Evangelion </em>fans: think Third Impact, and you have a rough idea what’s going on here, just no Angels involved, and the last one was caused by a Neanderthal, to give you an idea how long ago that was.</p><p>So, fast forward a few million years, humanity is evolved and thriving. At some point, an incident occurs in New York City where a woman has been pronounced braindead while she’s seven months pregnant. While they try to keep the mother on life support long enough for the baby to develop, when her vital signs start dropping, the obstetrician eventually makes the call to try and deliver the baby via C-section. Something about this whole situation doesn’t sit well with the laws of metaphysics, and during the procedure, the second the doctor tries to cut the umbilical cord, a voidout occurs, basically annihilating New York. The resulting tear blurs the borders between the realms of life and death enough for recently deceased humans to become potential voidout bait, and elements of the Beach—”Beached Things”, or BTs—to become stranded in our plane of existence, a phenomenon known as, drumroll, please, Death Stranding.</p><h2 id="h177387"><a id="3"></a>The (new) Manhattan Project</h2><figure id="" data-id="0c3a7c385b93413c45e7c547f80e97fe" data-recommend-id="image://0c3a7c385b93413c45e7c547f80e97fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam, Amelie, and Die-Hardman have a converastion while looking at a holographic image of cars." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sam, Amelie, and Die-Hardman have a converastion while looking at a holographic image of cars." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0c3a7c385b93413c45e7c547f80e97fe" data-recommend-id="image://0c3a7c385b93413c45e7c547f80e97fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam, Amelie, and Die-Hardman have a converastion while looking at a holographic image of cars." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Following the destruction, the then-president of the United States orders a thorough investigation into what happened, which includes in a series of fucked-up secret experiments attempting to recreate the exact circumstances of the voidout—specifically breeding children called “Bridge Babies” in the wombs of braindead mothers, and observing their connection to the realm of the dead. The president is eventually killed in a voidout while observing one of those experiments, leaving the vice-president, Bridget Strand, in charge, finally giving America its first female president. By then, though, it kinda doesn’t matter. America is already in downright shambles after its greatest city gets merked, all sorts of unexplainable deadly antimatter phenomena start occurring across the country, making much of it uninhabitable. The chaos sends much of its population into quarantine to escape the worst of it, and social order completely breaks down after the people find out the government was getting its Unit 731 on with braindead women in the middle of it all. Google that one on your own time, and bring a stiff drink.</p><p>Bridget Strand, to her credit, is trying her best. She publicly orders the end of the experiments, and instead uses all of America’s resources to create an organization called Bridges. Their main goal is to try to give the cloistered pockets of America a way to stay connected and try to find a solution to this phenomenon while still remaining safe enough where no single BT event can have the effect it once did. <strong>She rebrands the country from the United States of America to the United Cities of America, and by using the antimatter (a.k.a. chiralium) of the Beach to power some new technology and protection measures, a sort of rudimentary, metaphysical internet now exists, known as the Chiral Network</strong>. Bridget is hailed by many as a hero.</p><h2 id="h177388"><a id="4"></a>The truth about Bridget Strand</h2><figure id="" data-id="2608f14298ced3f353e8c7dab4455dc4" data-recommend-id="image://2608f14298ced3f353e8c7dab4455dc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bridget Strand lays on a hospital bed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bridget Strand lays on a hospital bed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2608f14298ced3f353e8c7dab4455dc4" data-recommend-id="image://2608f14298ced3f353e8c7dab4455dc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bridget Strand lays on a hospital bed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>All that, however, is what the public knew of President Strand. Behind the scenes, however, things are a wee bit more fucked up. </p><p>See, while the actual devastation began with the incident in Manhattan, Bridget Strand’s connection with the Beach began years prior. Bridget was diagnosed with uterine cancer in her 20s, and while undergoing an emergency procedure, she came close enough to death to find herself straddling the realms of this world and the next. <strong>Her physical body was successfully able to recover and function as normal on Earth. However, her soul, while somehow able to take shape in reality as well, was then permanently bound to the Beach</strong>, one of a few events that primes the two dimensions for what came later. Naming her phantom half Amelie, and explaining away her ageless appearances on Earth by branding her Bridget’s daughter, the two begin gathering information about the Beach and using government facilities to run experiments in secret for years before New York is destroyed. After the Manhattan voidout, however, and the chaos that ensues, Bridget already has the knowledge and infrastructure ready to build the protections humanity needs to endure, all while the strange phenomenon wracking the country gives her all the cover she needs to keep the truth about Amelie under wraps, and to keep running tests on Bridge Babies. </p></div><h2 id="h177389"><a id="5"></a>Le Fabuleux Destin d’Amelie Strand</h2><figure id="" data-id="dfce2e611a5ec4888d2167fc4d76034f" data-recommend-id="image://dfce2e611a5ec4888d2167fc4d76034f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amelie stands in the Oval Office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Amelie stands in the Oval Office." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dfce2e611a5ec4888d2167fc4d76034f" data-recommend-id="image://dfce2e611a5ec4888d2167fc4d76034f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amelie stands in the Oval Office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Oh, but wait, there’s more. During this period of research,<strong> Bridget starts having constant apocalyptic nightmares tied to Amelie, eventually determining that Amelie is, in fact, an Extinction Entity, and her very existence heralds the end of the world</strong>. The good news is that, in the cosmic sense, “the end is nigh” really means the end is hundreds of thousands of years away, which Bridget hopes will give humanity plenty of time to figure out a proper solution to the Death Stranding. That can only begin if humanity is able to communicate, share resources, knowledge, experience, and technology, though. Thus, Bridget spends the rest of her life trying to complete the Chiral Network.</p><p>Amelie, as an Extinction Entity, however, is less optimistic about those goals, seeing the next hundreds of thousands of years as painful, lonely, and hateful. She has other plans, ones that don’t involve her being isolated on the Beach twiddling her thumbs waiting for life to collapse. <strong>Her ultimate plan is to use the connections created by the Chiral Network to accelerate things, to create a Last Stranding big enough to end existence and the suffering of humanity in one shot.</strong> And she would’ve gotten away with it too, if not for that meddling Sam Porter-Bridges.</p><h2 id="h177390"><a id="6"></a>The Cliffs of Insanity</h2><figure id="" data-id="1eba3391980bb92ec7a5e44c0ea40251" data-recommend-id="image://1eba3391980bb92ec7a5e44c0ea40251" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cliff looks down at BB." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cliff looks down at BB." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1eba3391980bb92ec7a5e44c0ea40251" data-recommend-id="image://1eba3391980bb92ec7a5e44c0ea40251" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cliff looks down at BB." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, to tell the story of Sam Porter-Bridges, we need to talk about a dude named Cliff.</p><p>Cliff Unger is an Army Special Forces soldier, and a damn good one. Famously, no member of his squad ever got left behind, with one of his guys earning the nickname Die-Hardman because of how often Unger managed to save his ass in combat. Probably doesn’t hurt that his actual name is John Blake McClane. Look, nobody ever said Kojima was subtle. Either way, we’ll come back to him.</p><p>Cliff eventually gets his honorable discharge, and decides to start a family with his wife Lisa. However, the couple and their unborn son, B.B., get into a car accident. Cliff survives, but his wife is left braindead, and his son is in critical condition, and you can probably guess where that’s going. Desperate for solutions, Cliff eventually winds up pulling some strings and accepting an offer for some experimental treatments from his government, keeping his wife alive, and making a solemn attempt to save B.B. Cliff stays with the two of them as long as possible, obsessively talking to his wife and son when not becoming a full blown alcoholic. When it becomes obvious Cliff’s wife couldn’t be saved, the doctors decide to focus on salvaging B.B. for their burgeoning chiral research. What they don’t count on is somebody blabbing that fact to Cliff. That somebody, it turns out, is Die-Hardman.</p><p>While warning Cliff ahead of time that if he got an official order, he’d have to carry them out, Die-Hardman gives Cliff a window of time to mercy-kill Lisa, and get out of Dodge with B.B., who’s still developing in an artificial womb. The escape fails, with Bridget herself intervening to kill Cliff using Die-Hardman’s own gun when he hesitates from pulling the trigger himself. However, the shot doesn’t just kill Cliff, but B.B. Given that things on the other side of reality are already starting to get a little wonky, Cliff winds up trapped on his Beach—doomed to live in the collective unconscious nightmares of every single American war—desperately searching for his child on the other side. Meanwhile Amelie herself, recognizing the child as too valuable to her goals, intervenes on the Beach to send B.B. back to its body (a process called repatriation in-game). This is yet another major no-no that weakens the dimensional borders.</p><p>That small act of mercy does, however, have a few other unexpected effects. While the newly reborn B.B. is no longer viable as a Bridge Baby, one, he’s able to safely repatriate on his own should he ever find himself on the Beach, and two, Bridget, in genuine remorse for what happened to his parents, decides to officially adopt the poor kid, and give him a new name: Sam.</p><h2 id="h177391"><a id="7"></a>I am Sam; Sam I am</h2><figure id="" data-id="8b5eea290b51cc689f3e86e15dc272b4" data-recommend-id="image://8b5eea290b51cc689f3e86e15dc272b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam floats in a mysterious realm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sam floats in a mysterious realm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8b5eea290b51cc689f3e86e15dc272b4" data-recommend-id="image://8b5eea290b51cc689f3e86e15dc272b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam floats in a mysterious realm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As one might expect, growing up in the time of the Death Stranding, Sam doesn’t exactly have an easy life, even as Bridget’s son. It doesn’t help that the poor kid has two pretty awful health conditions. One is aphenphosmphobia or haphephobia—a very real and legitimate fear of being touched. The other is DOOMS, which is, in short, a severe allergy to chiral matter that can manifest as uncontrollable tears and the ability to see BTs at best, and psychosis caused by connecting directly to the Beach in their dreams at worst. Sam is at least able to cope with that latter problem thanks to his big stepsister Amelie consistently stepping in to keep him calm whenever she finds him on the Beach, giving him a special necklace made of knots as a sort of anchor to the world of the living.</p><p>Still, Sam does grow up, eventually even joining Amelie and Bridges on their expeditions to reconnect the country. He even falls in love and gets married to a therapist named Lucy, originally assigned to help him with his phobia. Apparently, he gets over his phobia enough to get her pregnant with a little girl they plan to name Louise. That should be joyous, until Lucy finds out Sam has passed his DOOMS onto his unborn child, connecting Lucy to the Beach by proxy, and barraging her with horrible nightmares. The nightmares are, eventually, bad enough where Lucy commits suicide while Sam is off on a mission. Sam arrives home just in time to see his wife’s body, now gone necrotic with the unborn child, trigger a voidout. He, of course, is able to repatriate, but as the sole survivor of the voidout, rumors very quickly spread that he murdered his wife. The tragedy and the subsequent scandal, combined with his haphephobia returning with a vengeance, cause him to quit Bridges and disappear, changing his name to Sam Porter-Bridges, and has now fully isolated himself from what’s left of society. </p><h2 id="h177392"><a id="8"></a>Rebuilding Bridges</h2><figure id="" data-id="3dc7ff4cc4e4844cf7e6cd99792fd496" data-recommend-id="image://3dc7ff4cc4e4844cf7e6cd99792fd496" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam looks off to the horizon while wearing sunglasses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sam looks off to the horizon while wearing sunglasses." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3dc7ff4cc4e4844cf7e6cd99792fd496" data-recommend-id="image://3dc7ff4cc4e4844cf7e6cd99792fd496" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam looks off to the horizon while wearing sunglasses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sam spends the next 10 years as a freelance porter, basically what the post-Stranding world has instead of a postal service (though, those guys are still out there too, and—look, this thing is long enough). After a corpse disposal mission goes wrong, Sam is brought to a Bridges outpost by a government doctor/mortician named Deadman, and given a very special delivery mission: bringing morphine to a nearby facility where Bridget is on her deathbed, being watched over by a very promoted Die-Hardman. </p><p>While the two don’t exactly reconcile, Bridget does try to convince Sam to take the journey west and finish her mission of reconnecting the cities to the chiral network. Sam refuses before she dies. However, when Amelie asks, she gets to play the sympathy card, telling him that a terrorist group named Homo Demens took her hostage when she reached the West Coast—naturally, obscuring her actual end goal when she gets free. Still feeling some sense of obligation to his sister, Sam actually agrees.</p></div><p>And so, with a necklace of chiral hard drives with all the software to get any outpost on the network, Sam sets off to finish Bridget and Amelie’s work. Herein, the brunt of <em>Death Stranding</em>’s action takes place, with Sam making copious deliveries, hearing stories all across the derelict, blackened landscapes of America, making new friends—such as fellow DOOMS-afflicted porter Fragile, and Deadman, who becomes Sam’s man-in-the-chair for most of his mission. He also makes some asshole enemies—specifically, Higgs Monaghan, the psychotic leader of Homo Demens, violently committed to keeping the West Coast independent of the rest of the United Cities of America by any means necessary. And, of course, Sam ends up having <em>a lot</em> of run-ins with BTs. This is the stuff you can get from a Wikipedia entry. There is, however, one particularly special friend worth addressing....</p><h2 id="h177393"><a id="9"></a>Sweet Child O’ Mine</h2><figure id="" data-id="7dbff7235033b508c5b9aef44ec07216" data-recommend-id="image://7dbff7235033b508c5b9aef44ec07216" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lou looks at someone from her jar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lou looks at someone from her jar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7dbff7235033b508c5b9aef44ec07216" data-recommend-id="image://7dbff7235033b508c5b9aef44ec07216" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lou looks at someone from her jar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, in the intervening years since the Death Stranding, Bridges does, in fact, manage to find a use for all the Bridge Babies they pumped out: Since the poor things are partially connected to the Beach, they’re able to actually sense BTs. Thus, anyone who goes outside on Bridges business takes one with them, contained in a special capsule meant to simulate a braindead mother’s womb, at least until their abilities wane and they must be disposed of (if the baby gets too acclimated to the world of the living, it can create a voidout). That’s a lot of really fucked up experimentation to produce the world’s most elaborate early-warning system, but whatcha gonna do?</p><p>Either way, during Sam’s delivery-gone-wrong, he inherits a Bridge Baby from one of the soldiers who went with him who died in the subsequent voidout. Connecting to this bridge baby triggers visions of Cliff Unger in Sam, occasionally even dragging Sam into Cliff’s Beach as Cliff mistakes Sam’s Beach Baby for his own, not realizing (yet) that Sam is his son. For his part, however, even though people aren’t meant to get too attached to their bridge babies, Sam can’t help but form a bond, eventually coming to name the baby Lou—his dead daughter’s nickname. In return, Lou finds herself using her connection to the Beach much more often to keep Sam safe.</p><h2 id="h177394"><a id="10"></a>The West Coast and the Last Stranding</h2><p>Once Sam reaches the West Coast, he and Higgs end up having a few chats over tea and punching, with Higgs informing him about Amelie being an Extinction Entity, and the fact Amelie gave Higgs a tiny Whitman’s sampler platter of her powers over the Beach to become her “agent of extinction” on Earth. While he manages to neutralize Higgs (thanks to an assist from fellow porter Fragile), and fully connect the network, he is told to make his way back East. Die-Hardman gives Sam a call to tell him about Cliff, Bridget, and Amelie’s original plans, and it ends in Fragile using her teleportation powers and connection to the Beach (look, like i said, long story) to bring Sam to Amelie.</p><p>Amelie doesn’t try to hide, and offers Sam a choice: let her finish her work, so the Extinction can happen as humanely as possible or shoot her fully dead and sever her from the world of the living permanently. Sam chooses...neither. He recognizes her plans as an act of desperation in the face of an eternal loneliness beyond measure. And he embraces her as a sister. The extinction can’t be stopped, but it can be postponed, allowed to occur when hopefully life has an opportunity to come out of it stronger than before, just as it did the previous five times. And so, Amelie pushes Sam back to Earth, and chooses to remain at the Beach, alone, to give life its chance.</p><h2 id="h177395"><a id=""></a>The last delivery</h2><figure id="" data-id="7bdec62c68622ab5e2285f9ef502ff6d" data-recommend-id="image://7bdec62c68622ab5e2285f9ef502ff6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam stands in an corpse disposal facility." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sam stands in an corpse disposal facility." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7bdec62c68622ab5e2285f9ef502ff6d" data-recommend-id="image://7bdec62c68622ab5e2285f9ef502ff6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam stands in an corpse disposal facility." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When Sam gets back, he discovers a month has passed. Die-Hardman has been sworn in as the new UCA president, which is great news. The bad news: Lou has been separated from Sam for too long, and on Die-Hardman’s orders, has to be decommissioned. That is, destroyed. However, Deadman suggests, as yet another experiment, that instead of just dropping Lou in an incinerator that he should separate her from the artificial womb container, and “see what happens.” While Lou initially is unresponsive to Sam’s efforts to revive her, BTs of the other lost bridge babies appear around them, and Lou actually sputters to life, holding one of Amelie’s knotted necklaces, implying that Amelie kept Lou out of the Beach. Big sis is apparently still looking out for the family, and Sam walks off into the sunset to, presumably, raise his daughter in peace. </p><hr><p>Now that you’re all caught up, it’s time to jump into the epic sequel that is <em>Death Stranding 2</em>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-story-synopsis-lore-explained-amelie-1851785252]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today, it's Rush mode. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1llyrat/battlefield_6_alpha_leak_rush_game_mode_27_06_2025/">18 minutes of it</a>, to be precise.

<p>Despite branding the playtest as the "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" and requiring participants to sign an NDA, plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">gameplay footage popped up in various corners of the internet</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reminds-battlefield-players-things-taking-place-in-labs-may-or-may-not-make-their-way-to-the-final-game">EA was not happy</a>, eventually hitting back at a grumpy Reddit thread about an unsupported claim about skill-based matchmaking with "Okay, enough", and the publisher has seemingly been busy trying to plug the most recent leaks, too.</p>
<p>Pretty much all we officially know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, Sam Bridges is tasked with the job of reconnecting Australia like he did in America during the first game. Equipped with a bunch of new toys for Sam to transport cargo with, many of the methods in the first game can be applied to his new adventure. But don’t worry, there are some new tricks! Here are some tips on how to succeed in delivering cargo in <em>Death Stranding 2</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195410" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="169" data-playlist="195410,196299,196903" data-current="195410"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20876.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h550"><a id="1"></a>Vehicles are essential for efficiency</h2><p>During the story, the most efficient way to deliver cargo, especially heavy ones, is to store them in vehicles. These are best for flat terrain deliveries where you won’t have to go uphill through mountains. You’ll unlock the Tri-Cruiser first, which is a fast and mobile motorcycle. You can take a few good cargo items on here, making it an efficient option for traversing between point A and B.</p><p>However, you’ll eventually unlock the Pickup Off-Roader, which is a truck that Sam can drive. It’s incredibly useful for any XL-sized cargo that Sam needs to haul. It can be clunky to control at times, especially on rocky terrain, but it’s one of the best ways to transport cargo during long distance deliveries. Later on in the game, you can unlock the Spiked Tires for Slopes modification, letting the truck traverse steep slopes that are otherwise impossible.</p><p>Furthermore, Sam can customize the truck with various contraptions, including the Sticky Cannon, which is a hook that can automatically grab lost cargo found nearby in the open-world and place it in the truck. This lets Sam avoid stopping and leaving the truck to pick it up manually. Weapons like the Heavy Machine Gun can also be fashioned on it if you feel like taking on MULEs in your ironclad vehicle.</p><h2 id="h551"><a id="2"></a>Always carry a few PCCs with you</h2><p>Portable Chiral Constructors, or PCC, are devices you need in order to create structures like bridges, ladders, Timefall Shelters, Generators, and more. If you come across a river, you might want to create a ladder in order to walk across it. A strong current could put you at risk of damaging or even losing your cargo. </p><figure id="" data-id="ff6659efda117798ec831147f8bd6531" data-recommend-id="image://ff6659efda117798ec831147f8bd6531" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows various items in Death Stranding 2.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re operating a vehicle, a Generator can be a lifesaver if you run out of battery in the middle of your delivery journey. It’ll let you replenish your vehicle’s cells so you can complete the delivery. It’s better to be prepared than to regret not bringing along some PCC.</p><p>Remember that the current area you’re in needs is connected to the Chiral Network, or else the PCC won’t deploy.</p><h2 id="h552"><a id="3"></a>Take advantage of the DHV Magellan</h2><p><em>Death Stranding 2</em> has a new fast travel system in the form of the DHV Magellan ship that you receive quite early in the game. This will let you fast travel between different terminals in Australia, as well go back to Mexico if needed.</p><figure id="" data-id="2c25f9a2441dc004ca6d1d30a418a0c2" data-recommend-id="image://2c25f9a2441dc004ca6d1d30a418a0c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows a key location." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map shows a key location." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2c25f9a2441dc004ca6d1d30a418a0c2" data-recommend-id="image://2c25f9a2441dc004ca6d1d30a418a0c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows a key location." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The ship is also useful for transporting cargo instantaneously between terminals so that you can easily deliver them. Simply accept an order, load up the required cargo onto a vehicle, and then drive it into the ship. From there, open up the map and fast travel to the destination of your choosing. The ship will zip there, carrying you, the vehicle, and cargo all the way there along with it. Easy delivery!</p><p>However, there are some restrictions. For example, live cargo such as animals cannot be transported as the in-game explanation notes that chiral jump between locations could have unintended consequences. In these instances, you’ll have to deliver the live cargo manually.</p><h2 id="h553"><a id="4"></a>Establish zip lines across the continent</h2><p>In the first <em>Death Stranding</em> game, zip lines were by far the best method to transport heavy cargo. The same applies for the sequel. Sure, vehicles are fine for the main game, but in terms of efficiency and speed, almost nothing comes close to ziplines. You have to manually drive vehicles, but with ziplines, there are no terrain limitations and you simply just have to ride on it.</p><figure id="" data-id="d060e9bd15dbb43973b56c6deab47362" data-recommend-id="image://d060e9bd15dbb43973b56c6deab47362" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam hangs in a zipline transporter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sam hangs in a zipline transporter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d060e9bd15dbb43973b56c6deab47362" data-recommend-id="image://d060e9bd15dbb43973b56c6deab47362" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam hangs in a zipline transporter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In fact, it’s the preferred method for unlocking all of the achievements if you’re into that whole process. You’re going to be delivering A LOT of cargo to max out every single facility’s level across the entire game. In order to do that, zip lines are necessary to do so quickly and with minimal effort. This is especially true for facilities that are located high up in the mountains where vehicles don’t fare quite as well.</p><p>The only downside is that you’ll have to create the ziplines yourself, which means initially making the manual trip on foot between facilities to set them up. However, once they’re installed, you can start using them.</p><hr><p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> is now available on PS5.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-vehicles-ziplines-pcc-dhv-magellan-1851785247]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">League of Legends has become a global phenomenon, reaching out to multiple audiences with the likes of the popular MOBA game, the award-winning TV series Arcane, and the virtual K-pop group K/DA taking on the music world. Among the many projects that Riot Games has tinkered with, we’re finally getting a look at the anticipated League of Legends physical Trading Card Game, Riftbound. After getting hands-on with the cards and learning about the flow of the game, it’s a pleasant surprise how well the Riftbound team has translated the MOBA into a competitive card game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After getting a chance to talk to the Game Director of Riftbound, Dave Guskin, and receiving a breakdown of the game’s inception to the upcoming release, I had a good grasp of what the Riftbound team’s hopes were for the future. With the four trial decks on hand representing Jinx, Viktor, Volibear, and Yasuo, it was time to get some games in. Like many TCGs premiering their first set, keywords specific to the game will have brief descriptors for new and experienced players to familiarize themselves with the mechanics. With that said, gameplay was pretty easy to pick up if you have any TCG experience. Guskin did mention that they’re not trying to “reinvent the wheel,” taking inspiration from other card game systems and developing an “approachable” game that highlights the League of Legends champions. Based on my experience so far, I do think League of Legends players will take to this gameplay pretty well. Either way, it looks to be a great foundation for folks that are fans of both the game and TCGs.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Riftbound Trading Card Game (League of Legends)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All the usual suspects for TCG card types are there, with specific ones being reminiscent of leader-type game formats. First and foremost, there is the Legend card that dictates the deck you’re playing. For example, Jynx Loose Cannon is a red and purple Legend, so the deck must consist of cards with either of the two colors. These also dictate the deck’s playstyle – typically with their abilities – so choosing a Legend is very important to deciding what kind of deck you want to play. Next, we have units, which are the creatures or characters that will help you vie for domination on the field of play. Another familiar type are spell cards that can be used for removal or support. Then there are gear cards that serve as artifacts or items that stay on the field alongside your units. Rune cards are the resource or mana of the game that sits in its own resource deck to pull from. Finally, an interesting card type that really emphasizes the MOBA aspect are battlefield cards. Players will conquer these battlefields to both score and win the game. Each battlefield has unique effects as well which makes for interesting interactions as players go back and forth to hold these battlefields throughout a match.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The One Piece Card Game or Hearthstone, for instance, are good examples of what Riftbound feels like.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With some games under my belt, the gameplay reminds me of other card games that revolve around leaders. The One Piece Card Game or Hearthstone, for instance, are good examples of what Riftbound feels like, with leaders having unique abilities that support the cards you play. Unlike leaders who typically have the choice of engaging in combat, your Legend takes a step aside and benefits the player with a passive or activated ability which can be used at certain times. For instance, the Viktor Legend can play a recruit unit token onto the field by paying one rune and tapping down or exhausting himself. With that said, players can choose a champion unit of the same name as your Legend to sit outside of your deck to be played whenever possible. So instead of a single leader unit dishing out and using abilities, the game has a Legend aside safely to always assist the player while the champion unit goes in to handle the combat. This champion unit acts like any other unit in your deck. As part of the setup, the game guarantees that you see the champion unit that you most want to play versus hoping you draw into it. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/27/viktorr-1751042726714.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The game starts with a hand of four and the draw phase only gives one card, but I didn’t feel like I was dumping my cards too much to my detriment. Jynx, for instance, thrives on rushing down and playing cards because she allows the player to draw a second card if the player begins the turn with one or less cards in hand. Sometimes you can luck out for a turn and you just don’t have enough runes to play anything meaningful, but there were enough chances to manipulate the field to give myself time to set up. Also, if all else fails, you have the champion unit that was chosen at setup as an option. Getting two mana or rune cards every turn is a familiar concept and it helps avoid being mana-screwed. In this game, there’s a maximum of 12 runes, which leaves a bit more room for card plays compared to similar games. There is a recycle action, which is just another name for “putting at the bottom of its respective deck,” whether it’s a rune card or a card from your main deck. Recycling mostly happens with your runes in the form of payment for cards. Strong cards tend to have a recycle cost, meaning you bring your total rune count down to play the powerful cards. This helps to avoid spamming said strong cards, and also makes players consider their choices if they want to play cards efficiently or on curve. It happens fairly often here, but it’s not debilitating enough that it’s a distraction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help with this recycle mechanic, there are gear cards in the decks that help pay for the recycle cost versus using your actual rune cards. It’s a nice addition that helps speed things along and ramp up the action. Speaking of which, the combat and scoring is probably the most interesting part of the game. Battlefield cards are the locations that your units will fight over, similar to how players fight for lanes in the MOBA. In a one-on-one game, each player chooses one battlefield from the three they have with their deck and sets them onto the field. When a unit enters or conquers a battlefield, the player scores one point. If the player continues to hold the battlefield up until the beginning of their next turn, they also score a point. Scoring the final point is a little nuanced, but the concept is pretty straightforward. In addition, Riftbound streamlined a lot of the math that players tend to do when going into a combat for said battlefields. Unlike Magic the Gathering, unit cards in Riftbound have only one number that signifies both their strength and health in the form of Might. If a unit card with five Might attacks a battlefield with two units, one with three Might and another with two Might, all three units kill each other and are sent to the trash. That’s right! It’s as simple as adding the total might of both the attacking and defending units in a battlefield showdown to determine who survives. Of course, spells can help break any ties or turn around the tables, but this system streamlines the combat compared to other games. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/27/yasuoo-1751042904646.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I can see League of Legends players getting a good understanding of the strategy with this game based on how positioning works in the gameplay. When first deploying your units, they are played in your base. From there, you can move your units when able to any battlefield whether there are enemies or not. A unique keyword in Riftbound is ganking, which MOBA fans are familiar with. For those that don’t know, ganking is another term for surprise attacks on enemy units. In Riftbound, units can only move to and from the base and a battlefield. They cannot move from battlefield to battlefield unless they have the ganking ability. The strategy of knowing when to move and where really matters in this game, and it’s a pleasant surprise from the typical ongoing charge of characters to an opponent’s life in other TCGs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, deck brewing is, for me, the lifeblood of any TCG. There’s no better feeling in card games than creating a deck that caters to your playstyle or taste and seeing it perform well against your friends or at your local store. Riftbound has six different colors – or domains, as they call it – to build decks around. Red or Fury is of course the aggressive color, which consists of damage removal and putting out cheap units that can attack quickly. Green or Calm appears to revolve around buffing and counterspells. Blue or Mind has a lot of draw capabilities and is usually known for control. Orange or Body appears to play around big bodies and mana-ramping effects. Purple or Chaos consists of bouncing enemies off the field and movement abilities. Finally, Yellow or Order seems to focus on token units and going wide. This is all based on what I see from the trial decks, but I have seen some overlap in terms of removal. The most exciting color for me is purple because of the movement in this game. It really does matter in Riftbound how you move throughout a match, and purple has some benefits when moving.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Coming into Riftbound with a medium understanding of the MOBA and characters, I was quite surprised by how much I enjoyed the gameplay.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From what I’ve experienced and heard from others, matches can be fairly quick – averaging less than 25 minutes if both players are familiar with the mechanics. Guskin mentioned to me that they’ll leave it up to the stores about whether or not events are best of one or three. When it comes to the bigger competitive events, best of three from Swiss to Top Cut is the plan, but final details are still being determined at this stage. Riftbound is launching this summer in China first before going global later in October. As I’ve seen in other card games, staggered releases do leave a sour taste – especially if it affects big competitive events – but Guskin assured me that the goal is to “narrow the gap in the first few sets and eventually have a simultaneous global release”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming into Riftbound with a medium understanding of the MOBA and characters, I was quite surprised by how much I enjoyed the gameplay. I come from an RTS background and never really understood what the MOBA custom game was in Starcraft at the time, but I learned about the genre much later. Now I enjoy aspects of League of Legends through Arcane or even the K/DA music. Like many TCGs nowadays, the existing fandoms help folks get that first foot through the door to experience a new TCG. And with League of Legends’ pedigree, I really think Riftbound has a great foundation for what they’re hoping to build and I look forward to checking out more of the game when they do. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-is-an-impressive-league-of-legends-trading-card-game]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Most of what happens within the video games we play is invisible to us. Even the elements we're looking straight at work because of what's happening behind the scenes. If you've ever watched a behind-the-scenes video about game development, you might've seen these versions of flat, gray game worlds filled with lines and icons pointing every which way, with multiple grids and layers. These are the visual representations of all the systems that make the game work.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519553-assassins-creed-shadows-lanterns.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519553" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519553-assassins-creed-shadows-lanterns.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519553"></a><figcaption>Assassin's Creed Shadows</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519553-assassins-creed-shadows-lanterns.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is an especially weird dichotomy to consider when it comes to lighting in any game with a 3D perspective, but especially so in high-fidelity games. We don't see light so much as we see everything it touches; it's invisible, but it gives us most of our information about game worlds. And it's a lot more complex than "turn on lamp, room light up." Reflection, absorption, diffusion, subsurface scattering--the movement of light is a complex thing that has been explored by physicists in the real world for literally centuries, and will likely be studied for centuries more. In the middle of all of that are game designers, applying the science of light to video games in practical ways, balanced with the limitations of even today's powerful GPUs, just to show all us nerds a good time.</p><p dir="ltr">If you've wondered why many games seem to be like static amusement parks waiting for you to interact with a few specific things, lighting is often the reason. But it's also the reason more and more game worlds look vibrant and lifelike. Game developers have gotten good at simulating static lighting, but making it move is harder. Dynamic lighting has long been computationally expensive, potentially tanking game performance, and we're finally starting to see that change.</p><p dir="ltr">Case in point is Assassin's Creed Shadows and Ubisoft Technical Architect Nicolas Lopez. Lopez spoke at the Game Developers' Conference this spring, and reading through his slide deck was fascinating, with the release of the video recording of the show only amplifying that. I reached out to  Ubisoft talked with Lopez via email about how technology like ray tracing is changing game lighting. For more on those aspects of video game visuals, check out our primer on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-says-real-time-path-tracing-is-on-the-horizon-but-what-is-it/1100-6502837/" data-ref-id="1100-6502837">path tracing, ray tracing, and rasterization in game graphics</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj5pYktC3X8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yj5pYktC3X8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The thing that initially piqued my interest was a specific set of numbers Lopez put on the screen during the GDC presentation. Lopez noted that if lighting were calculated in Assassin's Creed Shadows the same way it had been in Assassin's Creed Unity, Shadows would've taken nearly two years to "bake" all the lighting--that is, precalculate and render it--and around 2TB of storage space to store all of that lighting. (Assassin's Creed Shadows requires 115GB on PC for the entire game.) Those numbers seem to represent a vast difference between the games of yesteryear and modern triple-A titles. I wanted to put those numbers into context as soon as I saw them.</p><p dir="ltr">Cities in Assassin's Creed Unity and Syndicate, Lopez explained, were pretty small spaces: dense cities about four square kilometers in area. In those games, developers used uniform lighting probes to dictate how global illumination was rendered (alongside other lighting techniques). Lighting probes are points on the map that contain information about what lighting is passing through the empty space in that area, which is then used to help light the static and dynamic objects in that space. These were 50-centimeter probes, meaning they were requesting light information every half a meter across Unity's entire city of Paris.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's pause for a moment to discuss global illumination, also referred to as GI. This is a broad term used to describe a variety of techniques meant to imitate and mimic realistic lighting, especially indirect lighting. These include cube maps, screen-space reflections, probe lighting, and more. Digital Foundry has a great primer on global illumination that breaks this stuff down into chunks.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEkryaaAsBU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yEkryaaAsBU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"The small scale [of these smaller game worlds] let us afford high-quality lighting, even though it required significant storage," Lopez told me. From Assassin's Creed Origins forward, though, world size exploded, and suddenly we were exploring worlds 256 square kilometers in area. That much baked light information would've caused games to explode in file storage size, so the team began to use a dynamic system.</p><p dir="ltr">"We vary probe density based on scene complexity--dense urban areas still use 50-centimeter spacing, but in open landscapes like deserts or forests, we reduce the resolution," Lopez explained. Artists paint this "GI density map" directly--meaning they can focus the quality of light where it matters most--which Lopez said "dramatically reduces data size while preserving visual quality where it matters most."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519551-bakedgi-uniform-resolution-acu-resolution-lowers-with-distance.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519551" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519551-bakedgi-uniform-resolution-acu-resolution-lowers-with-distance.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519551"></a><figcaption>Uniform light probe distribution in Assassin's Creed Unity.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519551-bakedgi-uniform-resolution-acu-resolution-lowers-with-distance.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning that Assassin's Creed Unity had a limited number of times of day--just four, compared to 11 in Shadows--and had very limited weather effects, while Shadows has a dynamic weather system. All those elements in Shadows create changes in lighting the game has to take into account to present believable visuals.</p><p dir="ltr">That original question--why would baking the lighting take so long and require so much file storage?--comes back to a simple conclusion. The limitations of hardware and game engines at the time forced the team to pre-bake a lot of lighting information; neither the hardware nor the software was ready to handle calculating so much light data in real time.</p><p dir="ltr">Historically, most if not all game lighting has been "baked." That means that the various techniques used to light a given scene are calculated ahead of time and then stored as textures and maps that the engine overlays onto the basic scene, so your computer or game console doesn't have to do those calculations while you're playing and slow the game to a crawl. This works for really static games and can provide very convincing, impactful lighting. As a game becomes more dynamic, though, baked lighting becomes less viable. If we consider cube maps (see our primer and that Digital Foundry video above for the specifics), you'd have to calculate a cube map for every possible place a character could stand, and that's where game install sizes can start ballooning when it comes to game lighting.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519552-bakedgi-non-uniform-resolution-acsh-resolution-painted-by-artists.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519552" data-ratio="0.63420427553444" data-width="1263" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519552-bakedgi-non-uniform-resolution-acsh-resolution-painted-by-artists.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519552"></a><figcaption>Light probe distribution as determined by artists in Assassin's Creed Shadows.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519552-bakedgi-non-uniform-resolution-acsh-resolution-painted-by-artists.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Unity's game world was a small, uniform space when compared to the more recent Assassin's Creed games. The same approach applied to the much larger areas of Shadows, with more dynamic effects and varied density, would've made for a truly massive game.</p><p dir="ltr">But it has been a long time since the release of Assassin's Creed Unity. More than a decade, in fact, and in that game, a lot has changed! One of the biggest changes has been ray tracing, which is available to all PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S gamers, and about 30-40% of graphics cards shown in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/" rel="nofollow ">Steam Hardware Survey</a> as of this May.</p><p dir="ltr">"Ray tracing has had a major impact on how we approach lighting, from both a creative and production standpoint," Lopez said. "In traditional pipelines, lighting was mostly baked global illumination, reflections, ambient occlusion, etc. That meant lighting couldn’t react to world changes. Change or move a piece of architecture? Suddenly the lighting is invalid. Teams would have to re-bake the lighting data, which could take hours or even days. At Ubisoft, we ran overnight compute jobs so artists could get fresh lighting each morning. But it still slowed down iteration dramatically."</p><p dir="ltr">Ray tracing freed artists from many of those constraints, he said.</p><p dir="ltr">"Artists can move objects, adjust scenes, or iterate without waiting for long bakes. And since lighting is computed per pixel, the visual fidelity is much higher and more physically accurate," Lopez explained. In other words, artists can do art at their own pace instead of waiting for computers to compute before they do so.</p><p dir="ltr">Even so, ray tracing is often invisible to us on the consumer side of things, especially when we consider how static many game worlds can be. In those games, ray tracing is all but invisible, as it's doing the same thing that game designers were doing with creatively placed static lights. A Call of Duty level, for example, doesn't have to account for procedural changes to time of day and weather, so traditional lighting can be very effective.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4519554-pbr-night-rendering-lighting-only.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519554" data-ratio="0.81682242990654" data-width="1070" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4519554-pbr-night-rendering-lighting-only.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519554"></a><figcaption>Night rendering with light only in Assassin's Creed Shadows</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4519554-pbr-night-rendering-lighting-only.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"The benefits can be subtle," Lopez admitted, with respect to that set of game-design rules. Shadows, Lopez said, is a truly dynamic world, and that makes ray tracing a genuine game changer--in a figurative and literal sense. Shadows has, as previously mentioned, 11 different times of day, four seasons, a variety of dynamic weather effects, and destructible environments that all affect the way players see the game as they play. The hybrid solution Shadows uses, combining some baked and some dynamic lighting, "pushed baked GI to its absolute limits."</p><p dir="ltr">"Ray tracing allows us to light these dynamic environments accurately and consistently," Lopez explained. "Lighting behaves as it should, even when the world changes drastically. No hacks, no workarounds. It makes the world feel more grounded and believable."</p><p dir="ltr">"Interiors light up naturally when doors open," Lopez continued. "Destructible objects finally contribute to the scene lighting. Season lighting changes the mood of a scene. Without ray tracing, these effects can only be approximated to a certain extent."</p><p dir="ltr">The team iterated on Ubisoft's Anvil engine, which is used across the Assassin's Creed series, in other ways. They adopted the Academy Color Encoding System, for example, which is a universal color standard used by the film industry to keep the work of hundreds or thousands of people consistent across many devices. It helps ensure that people working on different machines, in different locations, creating different parts of the game in a variety of applications, are working with the same color information. That gives us a more consistent and more grounded game--that is, the characters, buildings, foliage, and even effects look like they belong in the same game and feel convincing--at the end of development. Color Look-Up Tables (LUTs) allow the team to shift the visual tone and color grading to match the weather and environmental ambiance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519556-assassins-creed-shadows-shadows.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519556" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519556-assassins-creed-shadows-shadows.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519556"></a><figcaption>Assassin's Creed Shadows</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4519556-assassins-creed-shadows-shadows.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of the key parts of getting Shadows right in particular fell, again, to getting the lighting just right. With HDR screens being so ubiquitous these days, developers can rely on having some ability to show a greater range of light and dark--but dark can still often mean pitch black. Even high-quality displays are subject to a user's personal preference, the qualities of that particular display, and a game console's ability to display color accurately. This became especially important when Ubisoft decided to finally fulfill years of gamers wishing for a ninja-focused Assassin's Creed game.</p><p dir="ltr">"We reworked key parts of our physically based rendering and exposure pipelines to behave more accurately in low-light conditions," Lopez said.</p><p dir="ltr">With ray tracing helping to inform the way lighting works in Shadows, the team can "deliver nights that feel moody and authentic, without relying on artificial fill lighting," Lopez said. The quality of the lighting directly supports the gameplay, both giving it more weight and believability, and making it feel more cinematic.</p><p dir="ltr">All of these changes came together, Lopez said, to create a "unified, reactive visual where everything feels connected," with Shadows in particular having sparked a cycle of innovation that pushed Anvil and Assassin's Creed both forward.</p><p dir="ltr">For the rest of us, Assassin's Creed Shadows works as an example of how video game design is adapting to new technology for both gamers and game designers alike. Designers working on tentpole games like Shadows have new ways to create games more quickly without sacrificing fidelity. In return, we get more dynamic worlds that live and move around us.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Image credits: Ubisoft</em></p>

<figure><a title="Dave the Diver - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/88e03632c95f5/dave-the-diver-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Developer Mintrocket has seemingly confirmed that a free upgrade is on the way "soon" for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a> on Switch 2.</p>
<p>This comes via a recently-posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yMR-2k127U">2nd anniversary video on YouTube</a> in which the developer responded to a comment from our very own community member 'PikaPhantom', simply stating "we will be providing free Switch 2 upgrade soon!".</p>
<p>We're not sure exactly what this might entail, but chances are it'll probably boost the game up to a silky-smooth 60fps.</p>
<figure><a title="Dave the Diver - Switch 2 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/04de0553a9c54/dave-the-diver-switch-2-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yMR-2k127U">Youtube - Mintrocket</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Dave the Diver has proven to be a massive hit with fans, and its success has led to many collaborations with other indie titles and even a few so-called "AAA" games, too.</p>
<p>In our review, we awarded it a score of 9/10 and said "It's one of the few games to come out this year that rivals <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario Wonder</a>'s all-out density and charm while doing something almost completely new". Definitely one to keep an eye on if you've not played it yet, then.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kjhnms&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman</strong> played “more Tainted Grail, 10 hours into Act 2 and still getting on great with it.”</li>
<li>And&nbsp;<strong>Andrewww</strong> got in some more Death Stranding via PS Plus. “What I don’t quite get just yet is that you have a bike, but the paths for some missions just seem impossible to drive, as the terrain seems too rocky to get through (getting to the port for the first time). And walking all that distance seems rather a drag. So, I’m still very early on, figuring out how to get around.”</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, but I hope you have a great time, whether you’re watching fast cars, hiding from the sun, basking in it or whatever you have planned.</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:183377 @ 1751129951 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>With my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> P Switch journey complete, I'm excited to actually spend some time with the damn machine this weekend. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> is still tickling me in a "I can't believe I'm actually playing this" kinda way, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> is... well, it's Wind Waker! <em>On the go</em>!</p>
<p>My big plan is to play some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> over the next couple of days, though. That DK Direct has left me with Power Moons on the mind, and crossing a few more off the seemingly never-ending list is my only course of action. What a game, eh?</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m still playing quite a bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> at the moment, though I must say I’m quite tempted to dive back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/worms_armageddon_anniversary_edition">Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</a> and check out the new additions to the game line-up.</p>
<p>I’ve been a bit manic with my Switch 2 games recently; jumping between a handful of them at frequent intervals out of an abundance of excitement. I’m conscious to just slow down for a little bit and focus on one thing at a time. Probably won’t happen, though.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>. That's it. When I start it up, I'm physically unable to pull myself away for about two hours. It's a real problem, but the whole darn thing is just excellent all around. I'm going to hit the 100 hour mark on this loooong before the year is out...</p>
<p>Amazingly, I haven't actually tried out the GameCube NSO app yet, so I think a few rounds of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a> are on the docket for the weekend. But I can't leave my island alone for too long. I've got too many lives to level up.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>Still making my way around TRON: Catalyst after some unexpected plot twists. But this week’s champion on the Switch eShop is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a>. Questionable choices of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/front-mission-3-remake-appears-to-replace-2d-art-assets-with-generative-ai">generative AI usage</a> on the game’s fictional internet aside, this is one of the strongest entries in the whole franchise and while being a very “safe” remake, I quite welcome the upgraded PS1 visuals in glorious 16:9 screen ratio.</p><p>

On the Switch 2 front I got a few new bangers but am still too hooked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> and its latest free DLC update while carving my way into chapter 7 of Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut. There was also a very nice update on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II</a> that brings the new siege PVE game mode that will surely take a chunk of my weekend. Assuming I can safely ignore STEAM summer sales, that’s my weekend sorted.</p></div>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Well, I'm off for holiday the next two weeks, so I'm planning on doing some serious damage to a few things, including my game collection. I'll be playing a whole lot of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2</a> on PS5, and the amazing <strong>Dune: The Awakening</strong> on PC, those are my main priorities, and if I don't do serious hours in them on my week off it's never happening. However, my beautiful Switch 2 is also gonna be getting plenty of action, fret not</p>
<p>My sons and I will be continuing to hoover up everything in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, but I'm also making my way very steadily through the new and improved <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, which I rushed through first time out. It's got me wanting to 100% this time, though. Otherwise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civ 7</a>, Cyberpunk 2077 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shin_megami_tensei_v">Shin Megami Tensei V</a> are all on my holiday hit-list.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend, and catch you all after a quick two-week power nap. Take care, pals!</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend... I'm on a plane! Again! But that means that perhaps it's time to catch up on my backlog. Or... time to do research for my own project! Which means that my options are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, which I'm using as inspiration for a game I'm making to learn programming</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a>, which I know I'm going to love (as I've mentioned in at least one other WAYP)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>, which I bought full price and then only played a couple of hours of</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a>, which I hear great things about</p>
<p>So many games! So little time. I haven't decided yet, which means I'll probably default to Fantasy Life... again...</p>

<h2>Fraser Gilbert, Pure Xbox Editor</h2>
<p>Hello from the world of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/">Pure Xbox</a>! I haven't delved into the world of Switch 2 yet, but I'm excited about my latest purchase for the Switch 1 - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>! I managed to pick it up at a great price on Vinted, and as someone who tends to stay away from 2D Mario (but loves <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>), I'm curious to see how I get on it.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm also still playing a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> (kinda addicted to the Koopathlon, not gonna lie), and I'm meaning to get back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ring_fit_adventure">Ring Fit Adventure</a>. I had a great streak going on Ring Fit for weeks, but things got busy around the Xbox Showcase, and I ended up neglecting it. It's time to right that wrong!</p>

			<p>With Battlefield Labs continuing its testing phase with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-will-add-more-players-to-battlefield-labs-playtesting-this-month-across-europe-north-america-and-asia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more players</a> from various regions, new leaked videos of Battlefield 6 regularly appear on the Web. The latest one<span>, featuring a full match of Rush Mode from the Alpha, was posted yesterday on the Battlefield subreddit</span>.</p>
<p>So far, feedback from the test phase (and from these leaks) appears positive. Destruction is set to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come back in a big way</a>, with the developers seeking to make it once again an integral part of the core Battlefield experience. Interestingly, destruction also causes rubble that remains on the map, creating new cover opportunities as the match goes on.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1llyrat/battlefield_6_alpha_leak_rush_game_mode_27_06_2025/">Battlefield 6 Alpha leak - Rush Game Mode ( 27_06_2025 )</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Brilliant-Sky2969/">u/Brilliant-Sky2969</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/">Battlefield</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Battlefield 6 would be revealed this Summer with a launch planned by April 2026. However, the new game was nowhere to be seen at Summer Game Fest 2025. There are two options left: either it's going to be featured during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 (airing on August 19, 2025, 8:00 PM local time) or Electronic Arts is preparing a dedicated event specifically for this unveiling.</p>
<p>Four development studios are <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> on the new Battlefield installment: franchise creator DICE is spearheading the multiplayer experience, while Criterion is working on content across both single-player and multiplayer modes. Motive is leveraging its expertise in storytelling and action (they crafted the single player campaign for Star Wars Battlefront II and worked on the Dead Space remake, in addition to making Star Wars: Squadrons) to deliver an engaging campaign for players to explore, which they <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> to be inspired by the movie Civil War and the TV show Lioness. Finally, Ripple Effect is working on a new Battlefield experience "fueled by the unique Battlefield DNA". This could be some sort of variation on the extraction shooter/battle royale formula.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will have to compete against <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. We don't have the release date yet, but it's safe to say it will be between late October and early November, just like most Call of Duty games. The new Battlefield could launch later and try to capitalize on potential discontent from COD users.</p>

<p>The once-lost GBA chapter returns this Summer</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It's been another week of action-packed showcases and to top it off, WayFoward gave fans another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>A new trailer was shared during the 'IndiaMania 2025' showcase, with extended gameplay footage on display. It highlights how this modern version of the revived GBA project will include "more action, more environments, and more transformations" than before.</p>
<p>This "once-lost chapter" in the Shantae saga is scheduled to arrive in <strong>Summer 2025</strong> on the Switch and multiple other platforms. In some related news, the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae">Shantae</a> title was recently made compatible with the Switch 2 thanks to a recent firmware system update.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Bandai Namco remastered the PlayStation Vita exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/freedom_wars_remastered">Freedom Wars</a> for the Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>If you've been wanting to give this action RPG a go since then, there's now a demo available on Nintendo's eShop. The full game is also currently on sale in the US for <strong>$29.99 USD</strong> instead of $39.99 USD.</p>
<p>In our review, we said this game was a welcome addition to the Switch library - reviving one of the PS Vita's most unique and enjoyable games, even if there were a few setbacks in terms of story and performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Its core gameplay is challenging and satisfying in equal measure, with plenty of customisable options and upgrades to keep you hooked."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:176132 @ 1751127281 -->
<p>Since launch, the development team has also rolled out some updates for the game to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/freedom-wars-remastered-updated-on-switch-here-are-the-patch-notes">improve the overall experience</a>.

<p>When the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lunar_remastered_collection">Lunar Remastered Collection</a> arrived on the Switch in April, it had a bit of a rocky physical launch.

<p>Now, though, this has changed with GungHo Online Entertainment America announcing the Althena's Treasure Box will be made available in the US and Europe as a "limited-edition" release. This special collector's boxset includes "one-of-a-kind" items based on Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete and Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kjhnms&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

Ivysaur - 167/165</h2><div catalogid="adb6b196-6dcd-4a7e-ab99-4844468d534b" id="223551"><div id="223551" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ivysaur - 167/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Glancing at 151’s full-art holofoil of <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ5OY?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ivysaur</a>, it’s not hard to understand why it’s a pricey contender to start off this list. Drawn by Yoriyuki Ikegami, who has been working on the TGC since the Crown Zenith days, this Ivysaur is a beautifully drawn card featuring the Seed Pokémon in a forest, staring into the water and seeing its former self as a Bulbasaur staring into the water.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a vibrant, colourful card with a bit of emotion under the surface. Plus, this is a solid card for gameplay as well. Its 100HP makes it a bit tanky for a Stage 1 card. While it’s three-Energy Vine Whip dealing 80 damage feels standard, Leech Seed being able to heal and pepper damage at the same time is a nice bonus. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Charmeleon - 169/165</h2></div><div catalogid="7c24db06-3ef7-4529-8884-6d778802c567" id="223549"><div id="223549" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Charmeleon - 169/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re back to a Stage 1 illustration rare, but this time of a <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q473ld?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charmeleon</a> drawn by Miki Kudo, a long-time Pokémon TCG artist who’s been around since the 2016 Generations set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When looking at all three full-art versions of the Charmander evolution chain, you can see that Kudo has gone for a mountainous theme, respective to what’s thought of as a Fire Pokémon’s natural habitat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of gameplay, needing to discard an Energy each time for the already costly Fire Blast may seem cumbersome, but its 90 damage could quickly turn the tide depending on early game situations. That said, it shouldn’t be much trouble anyway if you plan on evolving it quickly. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Bulbasaur - 166/165</h2></div><div catalogid="bed8f282-efd4-4afd-87c6-ac9db6851a4e" id="223550"><div id="223550" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bulbasaur - 166/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of the illustration rares beyond the standard 165 cards in 151, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWYJrA?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulbasaur</a> is another Ikegami card that captures what Pokémon fans love about the original Grass starter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While collectors can enjoy its adorable face, sitting under a tree and loving life, also having Leech Seed as an attack with 70HP makes it a pretty reliable Basic Pokémon that can at least take a hit or two at the start of a match. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Alakazam ex - 201/165</h2></div><div catalogid="10253fac-98fb-4225-b3a0-8d6e29fef852" id="223541"><div id="223541" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alakazam ex - 201/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first among the pricey ex cards of 151 is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgj3E?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alakazam ex</a>, who can quickly stack some serious damage, both by using its Mind Jack to take advantage of your opponent’s benched Pokemon, and Dimensional Hand to deal damage from your own Bench. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Drawn by Shinya Komatsu, it wouldn’t be surprising if this Alakazam ex’s design is one of your favourites among 151 like it is mine. Set in the back of a home with potion bottles and books everywhere, testing its psychic abilities with those iconic spoons, it’s a thoughtfully done yet cosy sort of card that shows Komatsu understands Alakazam’s genius and drive to gain the edge in battle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Squirtle - 170/165</h2></div><div catalogid="cac6fcfd-399f-4bf5-81aa-16cdfe3d67fb" id="223540"><div id="223540" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Squirtle - 170/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The illustration rare of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgw7B?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Squirtle</a> is where 151 starts to get pricier, but it’s not hard to understand why when you look at its artwork and who illustrated it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Placing the Tiny Turtle Pokémon in the ocean water at the beach, this Squirtle was drawn by Mitsuhiro Arita, a veteran artist who has been working on Pokémon cards since the TCG’s very inception and has drawn almost 700 of them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The risk of its Withdraw attack and the two-Energy cost of a 20-damage Skullbash doesn’t make it the best gameplay-wise. And yet, with the amount of jaw-dropping detail put into Squirtle and the ocean waters themselves, this can more be considered a work of art than a playing card.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Charmander - 168/165</h2></div><div catalogid="b440d385-5030-4d17-9b9e-27c615da2908" id="223539"><div id="223539" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Charmander - 168/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that we’ve reached Kanto’s Fire-type starter, it’s the illustration rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL82wM?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charmander</a> that turns out to be the most valuable among the original three, compared to Squirtle and Bulbasaur. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also illustrated by Miki Kudo, you can see its design is much like Charmeleon’s in a mountainous canyon, but this time at the bottom. The crowning touch for this theme is further down this list, but its duo Fire attacks, one dealing damage and another removing a troublesome Stadium card, this Charmander is a must for any Kanto-based Fire deck when its full evolution chain has been added. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Zapdos ex - 202/165</h2></div><div catalogid="d90cc191-aa00-4caa-900a-660bf81f4aac" id="223538"><div id="223538" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zapdos ex - 202/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Conjured up by the artistic talents of Shiburingaru, who has been of part ot the Pokémon TCG since 2022’s Brilliant Stars, 151’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwOG3?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zapdos ex</a> is stunning, with a majestic illustration featuring the electric bird soaring through the sky with its fellow Legendaries, Moltres &amp; Articuno. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its ability and moveset are nothing to overlook either. Along with Voltaic Float giving it flexibility for an easy retreat, Zapdos’ Multishot Lightning attack gives it the capability to shred through your opponent’s benched Pokémon as well as those active. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Venusaur ex - 198/165</h2></div><div catalogid="9434fc56-5232-437f-b0a8-b70052fba801" id="223537"><div id="223537" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Venusaur ex - 198/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A vivid and colourful card design, even more so than its pre-evolutions, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ5LY?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Venusaur ex</a> looks both peaceful and intimidatingly stoic at the same time. Another card by Yoriuki Ikegami, it’s fitting for the fully evolved Grass-type starter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also like Bulbasaur and Ivysaur, it’s fairly tanky as well with 340HP, paired with it being able to steadily heal your team and inflict Poison plus Confusion to your enemies too. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Blastoise ex - 200/165</h2></div><div catalogid="f195fc8d-ec53-4736-a93b-bcadc97a550e" id="223536"><div id="223536" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Blastoise ex - 200/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The second most expensive card in 151 is this resplendent vibe of a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWYJLA?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blastoise ex</a> card. Another by veteran Mitsuhiro Arita, there are multiple reasons this special underwater-themed card has drawn quite a high price. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As well as its very pretty illustration facing the final Squirtle evolution underwater, it’s just as Venusaur ex, with the ability to deal more damage. While its HP isn’t as high, its Solid Shell reduces damage, while its Twin Cannon attack can deal up to 280 damage at a time at the cost of two Energy cards, even though you have to discard Energy cards each time you use it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Charizard ex - 199/165</h2></div><div catalogid="c67f18cf-0db2-4d1d-b6be-06f80faf129c" id="223535"><div id="223535" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Charizard ex - 199/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At over $173 in market price in writing, the 199 full-art <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wR0dx?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard ex</a> is both the most expensive in the Pokémon TCG’s 151 set, but also the most exquisite in terms of design. The crowning jewel of Miki Kudo’s illustrations, this Charizard completes the trilogy: starting with Charmander at the bottom of the mountainous canyon, Charmeleon slightly higher up, and Charizard itself soaring above with a fiery volcano in the background. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That, combined with the natural nostalgia for the practically priceless <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/11/pokemon-just-hit-us-in-the-nostagia-with-updated-pokemon-base-set-cards"><u>Charizard from the base set</u></a>, is arguably why this is the most expensive card in 151 by over $100. Although its Brave Wing and Explosive Vortex attacks make it a strong damage-dealer, you might want to keep this one in a special case rather than a tournament deck if you manage to pull one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like in other current sets such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-back-in-stock-amazon-new-updated-2025"><u>Prismatic Evolutions</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-destined-rivals-cards"><u>Destined Rivals</u></a>, and even the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-mega-symphonia-sets-announced-for-2025"><u>upcoming Mega Evolution set</u></a>, 151 has plenty of rare holofoil cards that have driven up a high market price on sites like TCG Player. In this case, though, it’s all of the full-art holofoil editions of Kanto favourites, also known as “illustration rares”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

<p>A fusion of "belt-scroll action and fighting games expertise"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last year, Arc System Works lifted the lid on <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_revive">Double Dragon Revive</a></strong>, but one thing missing at the time was a Nintendo version.</p>
<p>Now, during the company's latest showcase this week, a Switch version has been confirmed for release alongside other versions of the game on <strong>23rd October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This new entry will "revive" this classic beat 'em up series in a new form tailored to modern playstyles. It will also be leveraging Arc System Works' fighting game development experience to deliver a modern beat 'em up "that pursues an exhilarating gameplay feel".</p>
<p>Development producer Tatsunori Ishikawa says the team is pouring its "full effort into development" to ensure the latest entry in this 38-year-old series is released in fighting form.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's been confirmed if you pre-order the game, you'll receive the exclusive classic <strong>Double Dragon Dodgeball</strong>. Pre-orders are also available for this upcoming release in physical and digital form.</p>
<p>Here's some additional PR from Arc System Works official game page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Double Dragon Revive - The Fusion of belt-scroll action and fighting games expertise"</p>
<p>"In Double Dragon Revive, players will find modern belt-scroll action and exhilarating gameplay. Both longtime fans and newcomers to the series will once again be able to experience the action-packed thrills of the Lee Brothers as they face off the powerful foes of their city!</p>
<p>"Players will find the beloved characters from the golden age of arcades recreated in modern 3D graphics with a unique style! Powerful foes from their past return to face off against the Lee brothers. <em>Double Dragon Revive</em> will feature familiar boss characters from earlier entries along with new bosses. Face the intimidating Shadow Warriors all in this brand new style!"</p>

New to this version of the game is Bowser's Fury, an entirely unique experience that features 100 different Cat Shines to collect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even at $41.99, Super Mario Odyssey is well worth the price of admission. It's still arguably the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-super-mario-games">best Mario game</a> to date, featuring a giant sandbox to explore, hundreds of collectibles, and an unbelievable soundtrack. For 3D platformer fans, Odyssey is nothing short of a masterpiece, and it's a game you can replay time and time again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> is another game that was given a second life on Nintendo Switch, having first released on Nintendo 3DS in 2013 as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/21/luigis-mansion-dark-moon-review">Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon</a>.
