            <p>
Arcane showrunner Christian Linke has responded to fan feedback on the beloved <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> series' second season, and specifically the suggestion its final episodes speed through their story too quickly.
</p>
<p>
The excellent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> spin-off has now finished its run on Netflix after two highly-acclaimed seasons of eye-popping animation. (There are no spoilers here, if you haven't yet finished.)
</p>
<p>
But while still highly-regarded, a common theme among fan responses has been that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">Arcane's second and, sadly, final season</a> simply had an enormous amount of story to tell in order to finish up its various plotlines - and not always enough time to do it complete justice.
</p>
<p>
"Some theories here a bit too far out there," Linke said, writing on the Arcane <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/arcane/comments/1h0opv7/s2_act_3_spoilers_holy_shit_cocreator_christian/lzbvuwv/">reddit</a>. "No, we didn't ask Fortiche to produce a 1h30 final episode. It's quite the opposite, our scripts are always shorter than what Fortiche ends up proposing in the story board phase. We wanna let them get inspired and roam free so we can then reel it in while also allowing for the magical moments to find themselves. 
</p><p>
"It's a tight creative collaboration, not some sort of 'alright vendor company, do your work, achieve the impossible, but do it quickly!' I consider many of the people at Fortiche to be some of my closest friends. I find it disappointing that people suggest these things.
</p>
<p>
"No, we didn't get 'corporate greed' pressure or anything," Linke continued. "However, yes, there are always constraints, both in budget and time. That's part of our job as creatives, to work within those constraints. Constraints are NORMAL, and they were always generous, and I always had final say on anything creative. But they do exist. They also existed during Season 1."
</p>
<p>
Arcane has made headlines for reportedly being the most expensive animated TV series of all time in terms of how much money is spent on each 25-minute episode. Linke said he'd of course wanted more time still, but that his team and animation studio Fortiche had been extremely lucky as-is.
</p>
<p>
"It would have been great to have more time to work on this second season, or extra time to add to the episodes, but we didn't have it. For a number of reasons. Budget being one. We have been EXTREMELY lucky to get these absolutely insane budgets from Riot to produce Arcane. We all feel incredibly lucky. NOBODY ELSE gets these types of budgets. Please don't forget that.
</p><p>
"Time being the other constraint. There's a release window that a massive amount of people work towards, not just at Fortiche, but also at Riot on different games, at Netflix, brand partners. Even key talent that works on the show that, simply put, is getting tired cranking away at this incredibly long season and project over multiple years. Don't forget that at the end of the day, this is just a collective of human beings, of people.
</p>
<p>
"I would assume that there is no other TV show that has taken as long as Arcane to produce two seasons, without any pauses. Arcane is unrivaled in sheer scope of high fidelity animation. I don't wanna use any of these things as an excuse, but, yeah... this work demands a lot on a human level.
</p>
<p>
"Our Season 2 is amazing. We have made you feel more than you've ever felt when watching animated characters," he concluded. "It's not perfect. You don't take these types of hefty swings and expect that everything wraps up perfectly with a neat bow tie. It grows and evolves in its own way, and it becomes what it becomes."
</p>
<p>
With Arcane's story now concluded, the same team is now working to expand the show's world with three more stories set in other areas of the League of Legends universe. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-cinematic-universe-to-expand-with-three-more-league-of-legends-animated-series">Link confirmed these locations</a> would include Noxus, home to Arcane's Mel Meldarda, plus Demacia and Ionia. There's no word yet on when these stories might debut.
</p>
<p>"Some iffy pacing moments aside, Arcane's second and final season truly puts the money on screen," our Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">Eurogamer's Arcane season two review</a>. "This is a striking, emotionally wrought, hard-punching climax."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo now seems unlikely to unveil <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> this year, but you can already buy carry cases and screen protectors for the company's unannounced console. 
</p>
<p>
Listings for Switch 2 accessories have now begun to appear on China's wholesale platform Alibaba (as spotted by <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-speculation-thread-st-this-is-furukawa-president-of-nintendo.7757/page-2257">Famiboards</a>), with products available to buy in bulk that claim to have been made based on the actual Switch 2 console.
</p>
<p>
Hardware companies regularly provide accessory manufacturers with moulds for unreleased devices to aid the production of add-ons. Additionally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-designs-posted-by-3d-model-enthusiast-setting-internets-tongues-wagging">purported 3D-printed plans for the Switch 2</a> have been floating around online for several months, based on a leaked form factor that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">Digital Foundry dubbed as "almost certainly real"</a>.
</p>
<p>
One image of the Switch 2 accessories shows what looks to be a comparison shot of the new screen protector next to another for Switch 1. The difference in size backs up prior reporting that Switch 2's screen will be larger. There's also now no space for a light sensor.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/8Oo2L1r.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Switch 2 screen protector comparison with Switch 1. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Famiboards / Alibaba</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
As for the Switch case, its dimensions are 290mm in length, 135mm in height and 50mm in depth. It's tough to draw firm conclusions on the dimensions of Switch 2 from that, but all signs point to a longer and chunkier device overall.
</p><p>
For its part, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">Nintendo has said it will unveil the Switch 2 properly</a> at some point before the end of the current financial year, on 31st March 2025. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">an analyst told Eurogamer the "ship had sailed" on Nintendo lifting the lid this year</a>.
</p>
<p>
When Switch 2 might actually go on sale is another matter, however. Eurogamer understands <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025">Switch 2 will not launch before April 2025</a>, though should finally arrive before the end of next calendar year.

            <p>As Graham pointed out earlier this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-difficult-game-about-climbing">A Difficult Game About Climbing</a> is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-difficult-game-about-climbing-is-a-difficult-game-about-climbing">difficult game about climbing</a>. A Bennett Foddy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a>-inspired limb-flailer, where hoisting yourself up a mountain as a bald man is painfully moreish. Well, let me introduce you to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-difficult-game-about-driving">A Difficult Game About Driving</a>, a difficult game about driving. Again, you play as a bald man (called Jeff) who sits in a 4x4 bathtub and must ascend a series of difficult roads. There's a demo out now and let me tell you, it's awfully good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Jeff's Bathtub Defender reminds me a bit of the vehicles from the PlayStation 1 game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPjXU2uxQo4">Speed Freeks</a>, where the wheels were like, way bigger than the main chassis. <em>Anyway</em>, you're to drive upwards. You tickle the throttle, feather the break, press space to jump, and frantically tap WASD to avoid tumbling off gigantic gnarled tree branches and floating rocks. If you do? A parachute will engage, but the likelihood is you'll float right back to where you started.</p>

<p>Early on at least, it doesn't strike me as always twisty and turny for the sake of it. The game understands that in order to mess with drivers, it must tap into everyone's desire to go fast.</p>
<p>Occasionally it offers you a ramp with an enticing hole to launch yourself into, which in any other game might be the way forwards. Or you might transition from tree branches to a race track, with the game suddenly timing your effort. Take the bait and forget the premise of the game momentarily, and that's Jeff sailing back to the bottom. The game is dastardly, I have to give it that.</p><p>Another thing I like: it's fairly easy to control. Although overly heavy keyboard inputs can spell disaster, you're not forever wrestling with limbs and trajectories in your head. The straightforward movement gives things a nice flow while also providing a steady trickle of anxiety.</p>
<p>A Difficult Game About Driving is due out sometime in early 2025 and you can find the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3175860/A_Difficult_Game_About_Driving/">Steam demo here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A few hours ago, Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1863659427452129292" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled will debut on Game Pass tomorrow. The slow drip feed of Activision Blizzard games on Game Pass continues. It all started with Diablo IV, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lands-on-game-pass-on-march-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined</a> Microsoft's subscription service on March 28. Then, it was time for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-is-coming-to-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaped</a> on GP starting July 24, and Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy followed suit on August 8. The new Call of Duty, Black Ops 6, joined Game Pass from day one on October 25, the first in the franchise to do so. Then, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/spyro-reignited-trilogy-flies-to-game-pass-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought</a> Spyro Reignited Trilogy to GP on November 12.</p>
<p>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled was originally released in July 2019, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earning</a> a 7.5 score on Wccftech from Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled is that beautiful vintage ride that’s great for short joyrides, but maybe not a long road trip. It&nbsp;doesn’t break any new ground, but the 20-year-old game at the heart of the package holds up well and Beenox has done a commendable job of updating it for the 21st century. Unfortunately, most of the extras that have been added, including Crash Nitro Kart tracks and the usual pile of unlockable cosmetics, aren’t terribly inspired, making Nitro-Fueled feel less essential than other recent Activision remakes. Hardcore CTR fans and those looking for a surprisingly-stiff challenge should give Nitro-Fueled a shot, but others might find it runs out of gas surprisingly quick.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the game is still only available on consoles for some reason, and this will apply to this Game Pass launch, too. PC subscribers won't see it appear in their libraries simply because there is no PC version available. The announcement post on X was filled with many comments asking for a port, but at this point, it seems highly unlikely for a mildly successful game from five and a half years ago.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youve-got-ten-days-to-pick-up-the-original-warcraft-i-ii-from-gog-before-blizzard-pull-them-but-gog-will-support-their-preservation-forever<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>In response to a decision from Blizzard to pull the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warcraft-2-tides-darkness">Warcraft I &amp; II</a> from GOG later this month, following the release of the remastered versions, GOG have updated their preservation policy. The real time<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc"> strategy</a> games will no longer be available to buy on the storefront from the 13th of December, but GOG have <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1863583943229833251">released a statement</a> committing to maintaining and updating the games for existing owners as part of their preservation program. If you don’t own them already, they’re also <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle">currently on discount</a> as a bundle.</p>
<p>"We’re deeply saddened to share the news that Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and Warcraft II will leave our store on December 13th, 2024,” wrote GOG on X. "Seeing these masterpieces leave our store is tough, but it also serves as another reminder of why our mission at GOG is so important. With that in mind, we’ve decided to update one aspect of the GOG Preservation Program’s policy." Here's the critical line in ceremonial blockquote attire:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>Going forward, even if a game is no longer available for sale on GOG, as part of the GOG Preservation Program, it will continue to be maintained and updated by us, ensuring it remains compatible with modern and future systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>They go on to say that they’re incredibly proud of the work they’ve done on both games, and that anyone who’s purchased them before their removal will "still enjoy the most compatible, high-quality versions," including offline installers. They then go on to say the word ‘gamers’ a few more times, presumably pausing while they type to imagine rapturous applause. It’s a great initiative, GOG, but I’ve seen dairy farmers milk it less. Love you though!</p><p>GOG recently relaunched 100 games newly minted with the "Good Old Game status", which means they’ll be kept updated, preserved, and playable in perpetuity. As James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">deftly pointed out in his coverage</a>, "GOG ultimately exist to sell games, not immortalise them in museums, nor hand them out to people who owned an original CD-ROM copy back in yesteryear," though it’s "better that someone profits off a healthy game preservation pipeline than to not have one at all."</p>
<p>And that’s about where I land too: without some sort of profit incentive, this stuff just isn’t going to happen without a serious fight. "I don’t believe that we’ve found a commercial solution for your video game staying alive forever. No one is against the idea of video game preservation, but companies and their shareholders are against the idea of not making a profit," Frank Cifaldi of the <a href="https://gamehistory.org/">Video Game History Foundation</a> told me <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/piracy-preservation-and-the-devs-who-dont-mind-if-you-have-to-pirate-their-game">earlier this year</a> . "It's a technical black hole; It costs a lot of money to port a video game, and if the margins are just not there, then there's not a business rationale to keep things alive."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Later this month, Nintendo Switch Online members will be able to get their hands on the NES version of Tetris.</p>
<p>We previously got wind that this particular version of Tetris would be coming to the service back in August. During a dedicated Tetris Forever 'Partner Direct' video, Nintendo stated the game would be heading to Switch Online at some unspecified point during the winter. And, to be honest, I had forgotten about this until today, when I woke up to the news that a release date had now been set (or blocked out, if you will).</p>
<p>Yes, I am pleased to say, the NES version of Tetris will be arriving on Nintendo Switch Online next week, on 12th December.</p>

			<p>Another day, another Nintendo Switch 2 leak. Yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-pictures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> a leak of the first alleged pictures of the console's new controller. Today, pictures of a Nintendo Switch 2 case and a tempered glass screen protector were uploaded on Alibaba, the massive Chinese e-commerce website, and Reddit users immediately <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1h5j5oq/tempered_glass_and_switch_2_case_appears_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked</a> them up.</p>
<p>It's hard to say if they're real, of course, but the frequency of the leaks hints that the product is getting into more hands. This, in turn, makes us hopeful that Nintendo will finally say something about the console very soon. It's been years since the first rumors started, and customers (and even us journalists) are frankly a bit tired of all this wait.</p>
<p>At any rate, the Japanese corporation has promised to unveil the new hardware (which we are confidentially calling the Switch 2 but hasn't been officially named yet) before the end of their fiscal year, which translates to March 2025. That would also mark the eighth year after the launch of the original Switch.</p>
<p>Let's quickly recap what we know about the Nintendo Switch 2. The hardware is supposed to be powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA's Tegra T239</a>, which combines an Ampere-powered GPU featuring 1280 CUDA Cores and an 8-core ARM Cortex A78 CPU. There will be 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM, split in two modules of 6GB each, and 256GB of storage space. For the RAM, there would be a 3x increase compared to the Switch, while the storage space would be eight times larger than the original Switch and four compared to the OLED revision.</p>
<p>NVIDIA's chipset will reportedly include built-in support for NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) Super Resolution and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ray Reconstruction</a>, the latter indirectly confirming ray tracing support. However, Frame Generation isn't expected to be supported.</p>
<p>On paper, the Nintendo Switch 2 should be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-chip-hardly-match-xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even less powerful than the Xbox Series S</a>, which is the weakest console of the current generation. However, its games can be tailored for the specific hardware, so it could very well punch above its weight.</p>

            <p>Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-30th-anniversary">week-long coverage of PlayStation's 30th anniversary</a> begins today with a very special interview: an extended conversation looking back behind the scenes at PlayStation's original launch, how the brand became a breakout success despite established competition, its "Icarus moment" in the PS3 era, and then its ongoing battle for industry dominance. 
</p>
<p>Few saw more of PlayStation's last 30 years than Shawn Layden, who was already at Sony when the company's console ambitions were first forming. Over more than three decades, Layden became a pivotal figure within its gaming division, and ultimately served as Sony's chairman of PlayStation Worldwide Studios. </p>
<p>Layden began his tenure tasked with bringing countless games to PlayStation, and ended it by overseeing the launches of PlayStation's biggest blockbusters from its own development powerhouses. Now, five years on from his 2019 departure after an astonishing 32 years of service, it was high time for a catch up and look back at everything PlayStation had achieved - and how it all began on a huge gamble.</p>
<p><strong>What's your first memory of PlayStation? You were already working at Sony at the time, what was your reaction to it? Was the idea of a games console taken seriously?</strong></p>
<blockquote>A 'fool's errand', some of them might have even called it at the time</blockquote>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> When PlayStation launched I was still with corporate, back at Sony headquarters where I'd been since 1987. I was attached to the office of the chairman, Akio Morita, the founder of Sony. I was his assistant, speech writer, ghost writer, interlocutor when I had to be. And we were watching all that from afar, so to speak. But I remember having a presentation early on where they brought the PlayStation prototype to the chairman's office, and we got to see what they were building. I remember back in mid '94 before the launch, standing up in a boardroom playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> and going, 'oh my god, this is going to be fucking amazing'.</p>
<p>But within Sony, I think a lot of the leadership at the time didn't take it seriously. They thought: 'Oh my god, Sega and Nintendo own this thing [the console industry]. You think Sony's going to come in sideways and try to divvy that thing up into a three piece pie?' It was a 'fool's errand', I think some of them might have even called it at the time. But [then-Sony president Norio] Ohga-san was a believer. A lot of people thought we were taking a risk. It was a fight to get the Sony name onto the machine - they didn't want to be associated with it.</p>
<p><strong>You moved over to the PlayStation division specifically pretty soon after - how did that happen? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> I joined PlayStation specifically in '96 when they were a year into it. They'd already launched in North America and in Japan. Sadly, the chairman had suffered a stroke, so that position was no longer required, and the president of PlayStation at the time was a guy named Terry Tokunaka. We'd worked together on the acquisition of Columbia Pictures, so I was kind of a known quantity. After the chairman's death, Terry asked me 'what are you going to do now? Why don't you come and join us in this new company, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/sony-computer-entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a>?' I said, 'Okay, that's great. What would I do there?'</p><p>He said: 'You'd be a video game producer'. I said: 'I'll be honest with you, I don't know anything about making video games'. And Terry was very upfront. He said, 'It's all right. None of us do either. This is the perfect time to get in. We'll all make this stuff up as we go along together.'</p>
<p><strong>What was it like actually working inside PlayStation back then?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> Talk about baptism by fire. I was walking around trying to get to know people in my first week and my boss comes up and says, 'Hey, are you going to E3? Because that's next week'. I said, 'Do you want me to go to this E3?' He said yes I should go. 'Great!' I say, before finding a colleague. 'What the hell is E3?' I didn't have business cards, and I landed in LA in 1996 going to E3 after only being in the company for 10 days. If you want total immersion in the game business as a neophyte, get dropped into E3 on day 10. You either catch on really quick, or you get rolled over by the leviathan. You just have to run faster than the slowest bear, as they say.</p>
<p><strong>PlayStation faced established competition - Nintendo, Sega were already giants of the console world. How did Sony decide it was going to take them on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden: </strong>Obviously, we were going to build - or rather, we built - an optical drive peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Nintendo realised cartridges had already maxed out their memory footprints and so we - or rather, Ken Kutaragi - created the compact disc technology to support the SNES. And we were just about ready. I think it was at CES [Computer Entertainment Show] 1993, we were going to announce the partnership. And Nintendo left us standing at the altar, after they did a pivot at the last minute and went with Philips.</p><p>So there was Ken, proverbially standing at the altar with his optical disc drive in his hands. And, indignant, he went back to the leadership at Sony at the time and said: 'All I need is an OS and some more connecting tissue for this thing, and we can build our own game machine'.</p>
<p>We moved out of Sony's headquarters to a place in Aoyama, which is about 20 miles away but more in the entertainment district of Tokyo, because they felt that was important to the DNA of the company - and that was probably the best decision the company made.</p>
<p><strong>How so?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden: </strong>When they decided they were getting into the game business, they knew they had the technology, the engineers. But they said 'let's be honest, we sell electronics'. Sony knew that without entertainment DNA, we would not be successful.</p>
<blockquote>They'd look at the Nikkei paper for 45 minutes, drink a cup of tea, and then go: 'alright, lunch'.</blockquote>
<p>So the initial stage was made a joint venture between Sony Electronics and Sony Music. Half the company was from the music side and, well, you could see it on the shop floor at 8am. All the hardware engineers were at their desks wearing their Sony vests, working on their engineering thing. And then around 10 through 11am, all the Sony Music guys would come in - hungover, sunglasses, cigarettes hanging out their mouths. They'd look at the Nikkei paper for 45 minutes, drink a cup of tea, and then go: 'alright, lunch'. They'd all stand up. They'd all leave.</p>
<p>We wouldn't see them again for the rest of the day, because Sony Music populated sales, marketing, advertising, publisher relations. So those were the guys who would go out with the people at Square and ply them with whiskey until the wee hours of the morning to finally get <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> off of Nintendo and onto PlayStation. When that announcement was made, that was really the 'oh my god' moment. 'Sony's really serious about this now.' And that's down to the music guys, the doggedness of just trying to get a deal over the line. They were amazing.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>What other big decisions were made early on, that helped get PlayStation a foothold?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> We had the optical technology, and games were all on flash ROM at that time, so that was a huge leap. ROM carts were $8 to $10 a pop to get blanks, and then you had to get them flashed, usually in Taiwan or in Hong Kong, which meant lead times of six, eight weeks to get stock refilled. Optical discs were $1 a throw and you didn't have a minimum amount, you could just pop 10,000 out and throw them in the marketplace. 'If it catches fire, call me on Thursday. I can refill you by Tuesday.' The momentum really changed the business model of that.</p>
<blockquote>We always knew PlayStation would only be successful if we made it, quote, 'The People's Platform'</blockquote>
<p>Sony deliberately never had more than maybe 22 percent of [first-party] software share. On the Sega platforms and Nintendo, first-party had 80, 85, 90 percent of the software market. But we always knew PlayStation would only be successful if we made it, quote, 'The People's Platform'. It's for third parties to come make a business. We'll come in and we'll get, you know, 25 percent typically at launch, the share is higher because we put all the bets on the new games. But over time, you know, the real leaders in that marketplace as far as revenue and share goes were the Activisions and the Take-Twos and EA.</p>
<p>Our first party responsibility was to grow the pie overall, and as the pie gets bigger everyone's slice gets bigger, so everyone's happy. Growing the market overall meant creating new types of games, new genres of games, and not competing in some of the standard genre categories. And so you got games like PaRappa the Rapper. You got games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/singstar">SingStar</a>, Ico and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>. Who's going to make those games? It was a first-party imperative to show, firstly, the power of the platform, and then secondly, the endless categories that we could build games into. We weren't just trapped into three genres and trying to fight for market share from each other.</p><p>So I think those are the important decisions taken early on. I think the founders of PlayStation had a really, really keen view on what it took to be successful and how to differentiate it in the marketplace. And a lot of those decisions were taken super early.</p>
<p><strong>Aside from the hardware and games, PlayStation had some memorable marketing too. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> Absolutely. If you look at the Japanese TV advertising, it was like nothing you'd ever seen in gaming. Gaming advertising had been really straightforward. 'Here's the character, here's the action scene.' But the advertising team at PlayStation came from Sony Music, so we were marketing games like you market rock bands - with a little of the mystery, a little of the sexy. It was the same in England too.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Sony's infamous UK WipEout advert featured Sara Cox with a bloodied nose. | <span>Image credit: <cite>PlayStation</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Yes. WipEout here had a memorable advert that caused some controversy, back in the day. And then there was the suggestion the 'E' in the game's name was a nod to drugs culture.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> [Laughs] I think these urban legends are cool, and people extract meaning where there wasn't necessarily one. I think the innovations of WipEout were us teaming up with creatives like Designers Republic, who were at the top of their game. The Wipeout packaging was like nothing anyone had ever seen before, except maybe on like an EDM album cover. And then the music - I thought that was genius too. I was in Japan when WipEout released, so I had to bring it to Japan and localise it for the Japanese market. But it helped that Japan hadn't heard of the Chemical Brothers or Crystal Method or Prodigy. WipEout was like a music introduction vehicle.</p>
<blockquote>You've got your vodka Red Bull in one hand, and you're playing WipEout with the other.</blockquote>
<p>And in London, I would come over on business to go to Sony Liverpool and see the guys up there, and we'd be going to clubs during that time and see PlayStation 1 kiosks with WipEout in nightclubs. You've got your vodka Red Bull in one hand, and you're playing WipEout with the other. It was the beginnings of making gaming into a lifestyle, the beginnings of making it something where gaming is more than just a distraction. All of a sudden, gaming became less something whispered about in pubs and more you overhearing someone saying 'oh I'm playing Tomb Raider'. 'Oh, Tomb Raider. Oh, do you play games? That's cool.'</p>
<p><strong>I think for a lot of folks, coming home from the pub or the uni bar and playing WipEout was a bit of a ritual. Even if playing it at that point was difficult.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> Let's be honest, the original WipEout is rock hard. It's unforgiving. And honestly, you know, we'd do that too, come home from the pub and play. You can't play it, but you laugh your ass off. Everyone can't take the first corner. With the sequel, we did make the handling a bit more forgiving.</p>
<p><strong>Specifically for people back from the pub?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> Not specifically but it was definitely a benefit to them. And for people like me, who could barely get into the original WipEout without throwing my controls at the screen.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like being part of those early conversations around what consoles could do? You were on board when Sony came up with the Cell Processor, the Emotion Engine - these magical terms that now seem to have gone away. What's changed?</strong></p>
<blockquote>Things like the Emotion Engine and the Cell processor were the biggest headaches of the day </blockquote>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> From a development perspective, things like the Emotion Engine at the heart of PlayStation 2, and the Cell processor at the heart of PS3, were the biggest headaches of the day. Trying to learn to build for those proprietary architectures required you learn new skills to get the most out of them. Naughty Dog always found a way to get under the hood of the tech before anybody else. Of course they had early access, but they burrowed deep. Being platform exclusive allowed you to push the limits of that platform's capabilities and you didn't have to make compromises, which you do when you do a multi-platform product. It's like, 'don't push too hard on the frame-rate, because this other platform can't handle that'. </p>
<p>Rather than make two versions of the same game where one looks remarkably better than the other, you just sort of balance everything out so it all looks the same. It's why the PlayStation homegrown stuff looks better on PlayStation than anything else, because that's all they do. That's all the tech they need to know about. And I think that gave special advantages on PS2 and PS3, which took other people a long time to catch up, but that wasn't necessarily a good thing. It was a bit of a headache, and there was a huge cost involved. PS3 hardware took a long time to get to profitability, a long time, whereas when we launched PS4, it was pretty much a non-loss product from day one.</p>
<p><strong>I remember <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-expects-to-recoup-playstation-4-hardware-loss-at-launch">being at Sony's Tokyo headquarters for the PS4 launch</a>, and the console's near-immediate profitability clearly being a big deal.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, and that comes down to us moving to more commoditised silicon. You know, I think there was a vision at one time where the PS3's Cell processor would somehow go off-platform and compete in the world of CPUs with the likes of Intel and Nvidia and AMD and others. But that didn't happen. And without that happening, all of the economies of scale that you might have predicted for the technology were impacted negatively, because you couldn't build enough of them [fast enough].</p>

<figcaption>"PS3 was Sony's Icarus moment. We had PS1, PS2... and now we're building a supercomputer!" | <span>Image credit: <cite>PlayStation</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>What was it like at Sony during the PS3 era? Of all the generations, I think it's the one that stands out as having been the biggest struggle to get right.</strong></p>
<blockquote>We flew too close to the sun, and we were lucky and happy to have survived</blockquote>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> PS3 was Sony's Icarus moment. We had PS1, PS2... and now we're building a supercomputer! And we're going to put Linux on it! And we're going to do all these sorts of things! We flew too close to the sun, and we were lucky and happy to have survived the experience, but it taught us a lot. And going to PS4, we learned things like: buy it, don't build it, if you can. You can manage the cost better. You can argue with vendors, get better deals instead of building your own thing.</p>
<p>We also learned that the center of the machine has to be gaming. It's not about whether I can stream movies or play music. Can I order a pizza while I'm watching TV and play? No, just make it a game machine. Just make it the best game machine of all time. I think that's what really made the difference. When PS4 came out, it set us against what Xbox was trying to do. [They wanted to] build more of a multimedia experience, and we just wanted to build a kick ass game machine.</p>
<p><strong>Which lead to Shuhei Yoshida's legendary 'here's how you share games on PS4' video…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> That was created on the fly, in the moment, when announcements were made by other people and we said, 'what's our answer to the sharing question?' And in a moment of inspiration, they came up with that. And it was... it was devastating in its simplicity.</p>

<blockquote>That's what you need sometimes when you're riding too high on your own supply</blockquote>
<p>PS3 got us back to first principles, and that's what you need sometimes when you're riding too high on your own supply. You take a little tumble, you hit your head on the wall, and you realise, 'I can't continue to operate this way'. PS3 was a clarion call to everybody to get back to our first principle. </p>
<p>Over time, we had the PS3 fat, then the PS3 not-so-fat, then the really tiny one. And that was all just in the pursuit of 'it's a game machine, make sure it's a game machine'. That's all we did here. And, by that time, the learning curve on the Cell processor was solved so a lot of developers were able to come out with stuff. The first couple of years, though, that was pretty grim.</p><p>We learned a lot and we were able to put it into practice. Learning is one thing but then, based on that learning, the question is - can you execute a different approach? Sony had the ability and the capability to take a deep look inside and go, 'we've got to stop doing these things over there'. We had to start doing these things like we used to.</p>
<p><strong>Stepping back to PS1 then for a moment, as it is its anniversary - what are your favourite games from that era?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> The first game I worked on - a localised Japanese version of a game called ESPN Street Games. It was just a number of mini-games, just going down the streets of San Francisco on a skateboard, on a luge, on a mountain bike, and just racing. It was super simplistic, and the graphics, looking at it now you go, 'Oh my God. How pixelated is that?' But it was exciting, and it gave me a good understanding of the excitement around couch co-op or couch competitive play. That will always be my first love, because that's the first game I worked on.</p>
<blockquote>That was the first time we had to create a sticker that says 'explicit content' - you know, 'mothers beware'</blockquote>
<p>Later on, I love the stuff we did with things like PaRappa. Sadly, I think PaRappa is a game that probably doesn't get made today because so many publishers are risk averse on doing new things. Vib-Ribbon, from the same studio, I loved. Also Biohazard, or rather, Resident Evil. When that came out, that was a shocker. That was the first time we had to create a sticker that says 'explicit content' - you know, 'mothers beware' - on the box. But more than that - Resident Evil created an entire new genre, as the idea of survival horror didn't exist beforehand. When that came out from a third-party, not from a first-party, we were validated with our idea that game companies could do something new here. We weren't just going to be about JRPGs, or another fighting game or some racing game. We worked very closely with Capcom to get the right promotion around Resident Evil in Japan. </p>
<p>And then Metal Gear came out with stealth action - what is that? Kojima made it happen, and that created another new genre. It's about growing those pies. It's making more categories, getting more people into gaming. I think that is something PlayStation spent a lot of a lot of time thinking about and trying to do. Not just simply to grow the market, but also to give it longevity and stability as a medium.</p>
<p><strong>Were you ever jealous of a game on a rival platform?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> The one time I really felt jealous... I'm going back to my time in Tokyo on PS1. My job was to bring Western titles to Japan. And in your local parlance, that's like bringing coals to Newcastle, right? I would bring things like Twisted Metal to Japan, and the Japanese market would go 'what the hell is that?'. But one game I saw early on, and I heard the buzz, and I went out to Core Design in Darby because... I wanted to get Tomb Raider for the Japanese market. I wanted it to be on PlayStation. And I saw the Smith brothers, and we talked about it, and they were really excited about the concept. We talked it through. They talked it through. Bada bing, bada boom... they signed to bring it out on Sega Saturn. <em>Sega?!</em> And then shortly thereafter, they did get it onto the PlayStation in Japan as well, but it launched on Sega. And yeah, that always felt... What could I have done to have actually gotten it? But I came that close.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, is there one classic franchise or game that you'd like PlayStation to go back to? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> This is just a personal preference. This is just a game that spoke to me when I first saw it, and I love the guys working on it - so much so we got a sequel out of it, which was also fun and fabulous and I was able to get it remastered for PS4... I would love another whack at MediEvil. The Cambridge studio guys were called Millennium at the time they were making the original MediEvil and Sony bought them shortly thereafter. The humour is kind of Tim Burton meets Monty Python though it was really hard to localise the comedy into foreign languages. If I could wave a magic wand and have one more bite at an apple, it would be the MediEvil apple.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-shown-in-new-43-minute-long-gameplay-video/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is the game featured in December's IGN First, so fans of the upcoming first-person open world action roleplaying game can look forward to new content and reveals throughout the whole month. To start with, IGN posted the first 43 minutes of gameplay, which were taken from the PC version of the game. You can watch them in the embed below.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is still based on Crytek's CryENGINE technology rather than switching to the far more popular Unreal Engine by Epic Games. During <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Gamescom 2024 chat with Martin Klima</a>, we asked him why. Here's what he had to say on the subject:</p>
<p><em>When we finished KCD, we took a look at the technology we were using and were considering our options, but we decided that keeping CryENGINE made the most sense for us because we spent a lot of time customizing it for our needs and I think we are very happy. I'm quite proud of the performance we have now.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We have access to the latest version of the engine. Of course, we also wanted to keep our customization. In the end, although the engine that we have is not quite the same engine that Crytek uses for Hunt: Showdown, it is very close.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Gameplay - The First 43 Minutes | IGN First" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6GXG1HD6bg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Warhorse Studios still hasn't shared the game's system requirements. However, they did share that the game can run smoothly even on relatively low-end machines, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-runs-buttery-smooth-on-rtx-3050-wont-have-denuvo-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> by PR Manager Tobias Stolz-Zwilling in the first official Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 live stream:</p>
<p><em>We learned from what we did in KCD. We took way more time than in the first game for bug fixing, optimization, performance testing, and so on. We are working on this right now and not only on PC but also on consoles for the console players, so there's good news for everyone. Give us a tiny little bit more time, but I think by the end of the year, we should be able to tell you exactly what you should get. I personally at home play on a 3050 GPU I think, and it runs buttery smooth. As I said, give us some time on performance testing, and we will tell you soon.</em></p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is slated to release on February 11 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>PlayStation is in the midst of celebrating the 30th anniversary of the brand. From bold sales to nostalgia-fuelled montages celebrating the label’s expansive history, players have been wrapped up in the last three decades of PlayStation-based gaming for several days.</p>



<p>Later this month, several esports tournaments will surface on PS5, utilising the onboard PlayStation Tournament platform that was added to the system towards the end of 2022.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-games-are-in-the-playstation-tournaments">What Games Are In The PlayStation Tournaments?</h2>



<p>It was revealed that a string of PlayStation Tournaments will unravel between December 6 – 8, allowing users to win exclusive celebratory prizes. These prizes will include in-game items and avatars created in celebration of PlayStation’s milestone.</p>



<p>Here are the games confirmed to be contributing to this special event:</p>



<ul>
<li>College Football 25</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 25</li>



<li>Guilty Gear Strive</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat 1</li>



<li>Madden NFL 25</li>



<li>MLB The Show 24</li>



<li>NBA 2K25</li>



<li>Tekken 8</li>



<li>UFC 5</li>
</ul>



<p>For some, the list is a little lacking – there are no FPS or racing options, which might seem a little short-sighted given the state of the esports industry and its preference for such games, but that’s a conversation for another day.</p>



<p>If you consider yourself a talented player in one of these games, you can sign up through the PlayStation Tournament function on your PS5, competing across one – or several – of these games in an attempt to win some exclusive prizes.</p>



<p><a href="https://compete.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation’s ‘Competition Center’</a> is the place to go to find out everything you need to know about this promotional event.</p>



<p>Will you be taking part in December’s PlayStation Tournaments? Let us know what game you’ll play on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gray Zone Warfare Rip-off Appears On PlayStation Store]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-copy-playstation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare-rip-off-appears-on-playstation-store.1050399/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-copy-playstation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently noticed that a knock-off copy of Gray Zone Warfare, ‘Gray Zone Attack’, has appeared on the PlayStation store, set to be released in 2025. It’s from a developer named ‘Esail’, and at first blush, it’s a carbon copy of the popular tactical-slash-extraction shooter that was released in April 2024.</p>



<p>The cover art featured on the PlayStation store was made using AI, and everything from the iconography on down is a thinly-veiled replication of Gray Zone Warfare.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shameless">Shameless</h2>



<p>It’s the nature of the business – when a game becomes successful enough, replications of said game will surface.</p>



<p>Last year, I covered a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-switch-clone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hilarious Last of Us clone</a> on Nintendo Switch called ‘The Last Hope’. It featured characters reminiscent of Joel and Ellie, slaying the undead and looking for a ‘brighter future’. It was pulled from the store not long after appearing, though.</p>



<p>Gray Zone Attack has appeared under similar circumstances. It’s listed on the PlayStation store as a single-player shooter, whereas Gray Zone Warfare is a PvEvP FPS. The game’s blurb and spiel reads could be describing MADFINGER’s GZW, though.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Prepare to enter a hostile and unpredictable world where danger lurks at every turn. In Gray Zone Attack, you’re part of an elite tactical unit sent to uncover the secrets of a devastated quarantine zone. Every decision matters, every bullet counts, and survival is never guaranteed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>“Every decision matters.”</em></p>



<p>MADFINGER’s slogan for Gray Zone Warfare is ‘every move matters’ – the audacity of this replication is mind-blowing.</p>



<p>On social media, MADFINGER’s Rick Lagnese wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While #GrayZoneWarfare brings players tactical depth and strategic thrills, “Gray Zone Attack” might be a little too busy attacking the idea of originality. We prefer crafting something one-of-a-kind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full description of Gray Zone Attack talks of an immersive open world, customisable gear, tactical combat with realistic weapon handling, and a dynamic injury system. These are all features that sit front and centre in Gray Zone Warfare, which has been painstakingly crafted by MADFINGER over many years.</p>



<p>I’d bet hard cash this title will never see the light of day, and if it does, it’ll be some bizarre, stripped-down microtransaction farm.</p>



<p>What’s the most ridiculous copy of a game you’ve seen? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The RTX 4070 has a maximum TGP rating of 120W, which is actually quite impressive for such an affordable gaming laptop.

The best deal is definitely on the consoles themselves: the PS5 Slim Disc Edition has dropped to $424.99 (originally $500) and the PS5 Slim Digital Edition has dropped to $374.99 (originally $450). I would choose the Disc Edition because it's only $50 more and then I have the option to buy (and later sell or trade) physical disc media. But if you want to save some money and go the Digital Edition route, I would suggest getting the NBA 2K25 bundle, which also includes a game.

Retailers usually release their hottest selling items in batches so that every sale event has at least some inventory reserved. That said, I also expect plenty of new, never before seen deals. Traditionally, Black Friday was known as the "retail holiday," where the best deals were found in-store, and Cyber Monday was known as the "online holiday," where the best deals were online only. Although today the lines have blurred, it is still true that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">many online only retailers still consider Cyber Monday the sale event of the year instead of Black Friday</a>. Expect some amazing sales to come out of online-only sites like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, Lenovo and several online-only deals from traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. In fact, Amazon has taken the preemptive and already switched over to Cyber Monday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
