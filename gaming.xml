In addition to providing his perspective on the company’s early days, he took the time to recount how some of its biggest victories and hardest falls helped shape it into what it is today.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When it was working, it was magical.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hines started with Bethesda in October 1999, seeing it through everything from the launch of The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind in 2002, to Skyrim in 2011, to Fallout 76 in 2018. He also remained as a key figure at the gaming publisher throughout Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media, which was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-zenimax-acquisition-officially-complete-bethesda-now-a-part-of-xbox"><u>completed in 2021</u></a>, before going on to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesdas-pete-hines-announces-retirement"><u>announce his retirement in 2023</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hines brought his time at Bethesda to an end after 24 years. However, it seems it was the quieter moments working with ZeniMax founder and CEO Robert Altman, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-a-altman-zenimax-founder-and-ceo-dies"><u>passed away in 2021</u></a>, that he remembers most fondly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was Robert Altman's company, and we were his employees, no question,” Hines said. “But he treated us more like family, and we found a culture that really fit us. When it was working, it was magical. We were a small, private company. It's way easier to stay out of scrutiny when you're not having to put your earnings reports out for the whole world.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda, which now serves under the titan that is Microsoft, encompasses a variety of different game studios. This includes its development arm, Bethesda Game Studios, Doom developer id Software, Deathloop developer Arkane Studios, Wolfenstein studio MachineGames, and The Elder Scrolls Online studio ZeniMax Online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gamers have turned to the company for everything from giant, trend-setting RPGs to laser-focused first-person shooters, but in 2024, the Bethesda umbrella shrunk. Just three years after Microsoft completed its acquisition, the Xbox company announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shock-and-anger-as-xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-more"><u>shutting down Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush studio Tango Gameworks</u></a> (Tango was later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/krafton-says-it-didnt-buy-tango-gameworks-from-microsoft-for-profit-we-dont-think-hi-fi-rush-2-is-going-to-make-us-money"><u>acquired by Krafton</u></a>).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's just no question that the company is not the same.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has gone through major shifts both before and after the Microsoft acquisition. For better or worse, Hines says there’s no denying the company he started at in 1999 has changed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's just no question that the company is not the same,” he added. “It has been radically changed and altered from the company that we built. It is what it is. Things change. Things move on, but at its height, it was really a special thing to be a part of.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in the interview with Hines, the former Bethesda executive touched on how he <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pete-hines-comments-on-the-confusion-surrounding-how-bethesda-named-prey-2017-dont-even-get-me-started?_cache=pass"><u>fought to change the name of Arkane’s Prey</u></a>, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bethesda-exec-says-gaming-subscription-services-worth-jack-s-without-proper-support-for-game-developers"><u>his thoughts on gaming subscription services like Game Pass</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> publisher Paradox is now offering PlayStation Store pre-order refunds as it makes “big changes” after a backlash to its decision to lock clans behind DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The furore began with the confirmation that Bloodlines 2 would feature four clans: Brujah; Tremere; Banu Haqim; and Ventrue. While this selection provides four different starting options for how you build your protagonist, it’s a more limited offering compared to the cult classic original Bloodlines, which featured seven clans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer The Chinese Room added a further two clans to Bloodlines 2 (Lasombra and Toreador), but these were only available as part of the Shadows and Silk add-on pack, which costs $21.99 as DLC, or included as part of the $89.99 Premium Edition. The standard edition costs $59.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This DLC is available from day one, which has created the impression that the “full” roster has been carved up, with only those paying extra getting the complete launch experience. As you’d expect, fans were quick to express their dissatisfaction.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At gamescom 2025, a representative for publisher Paradox told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-two-clans-locked-behind-dlc-because-of-business"><u>the decision was a “business” informed choice</u></a>, prompting further outcry. Then, last month, a post on Discord from Paradox suggested a significant change would be coming ahead of launch, and now the publisher has gone one step further by issuing PlayStation Store pre-order refunds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hi,” <a href="https://x.com/VtM_Bloodlines/status/1964016313958838399" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on social media on the official Bloodlines 2 account began</a>. “We’re making adjustments and will share the details on Sept 17. Big changes take time, and we want to do this right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“PS Store pre-orders will be refunded on Sept 8. You’ll be able to pre-order again before launch on Oct 21.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thanks for your patience; we’ll share more soon!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are now wondering whether Paradox will include Lasombra and Toreador by default and not as DLC at base game price. Certainly, the sentiment online is that’s the expectation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Honestly nothing short of fully including them at base game price will turn me around on this,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bringdownthesky.bsky.social/post/3ly47xynyyk2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said one social media user</a> in response to the announcement. “Otherwise I'm skipping.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The only way to salvage this and regain trust with the community is to sell the base game as-is with all clans available and rather sell DLC with new side stories and cosmetics on the side or just add the cosmetics/side stories as part of a higher tier eg deluxe edition/premium edition, as that won't mess with the main story/narrative etc,” <a href="https://x.com/SplashbangOW/status/1964040019204809157" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said another</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some expressed thanks for the reaction to the backlash. “I'm very excited and hopeful to see what you came up with for the two clans locked behind DLC issue,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kixieboo.bsky.social/post/3ly4xxtqfbc2g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said one fan</a>. “I'd like to thank you for listening to community feedback and working to fix the issue. I'm sure refunding store pre-orders was not an easy decision.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 has suffered a difficult development and a number of high-profile delays, but it is a crucial release for Paradox. The publisher will be keen to give it the best chance possible to succeed, and backtracking on its DLC plans may be the only viable option at this stage.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Darksiders 4 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darksiders-4-continues-the-original-games-story-after-15-years/1100-6533653/" data-ref-id="1100-6533653">officially announced in 2025 during a showcase for developer THQ Nordic</a>, and many longtime fans of the franchise are curious about its release date, story, and gameplay. The last time we saw the Darksiders franchise was in 2019 with the release of Darksiders Genesis, a prequel to the original trilogy. This game was met with positive reviews from critics and fans alike, but after radio silence from THQ Nordic for several years, many players thought it could be the last time we'd see the Four Horsemen in action.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, with Darksiders 4 confirmed, we finally get to see what THQ Nordic has been cooking up all of this time. We know the Four Horsemen are returning and picking up where they left off at the conclusion of the original Darksiders, but what else do we know about the fourth installment in the franchise? You can check out everything we know about Darksiders 4 in the guide below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When will Darksiders 4 be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">While we did get the reveal of Darksiders 4, THQ Nordic still has not given us a release date for the new action-RPG. Right now, the current release date is "to be announced," and there's no indication as to when an announcement is expected.</p><p dir="ltr">So, as of right now, we're pretty much in the dark when it comes to a release date for Darksiders 4. It's unclear how far along in development THQ Nordic is with the game, either, so we don't have anything to go on at the time of writing.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Preorder Darksiders 4</h2><p dir="ltr">As we don't have a concrete release date for Darksiders 4, there's currently no way to preorder the game on any of its available platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S). This also means we don't know how much Darksiders 4 will cost. However, Darksiders has, in recent years, usually been priced under the industry standard for a new AAA game. For example, Darksiders III retailed for $40 at launch, and Darksiders Genesis came in at $30. THQ Nordic could take that same approach with Darksiders 4, which would put it at around $50-60, but it might also be a full-priced, $70 game.</p><p dir="ltr">All you can do right now is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203170?utm_source=thqnordic-next-darksiders4" rel="nofollow ">wishlist the game's Standard Edition on PC via Steam</a>. This gives you a notification when Darksiders 4 officially goes live for preorders.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Watch the Darksiders 4 teaser</h2><p dir="ltr">If you want a small glimpse into what THQ Nordic has in store with Darksiders 4, you can watch the official teaser trailer for the action-RPG below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eafBknCPcI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, this is only a sneak peek at the game that confirms the return of the Four Horsemen. We'll have to wait for a proper trailer to see exactly what Darksiders 4 will look like.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Darksiders 4 Platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">Darksiders is coming to PC via Steam, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. It's currently unknown if THQ Nordic will attempt to port the game to other platforms, such as Nintendo Switch 2, in the future. For now, though, Darksiders 4 will launch for only the current-gen platforms.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Darksiders 4 Story, Setting, And Characters</h2><p dir="ltr">As we only have a small teaser trailer to go off, we don't know too much about the story of Darksiders 4. We do know that the game picks up at the conclusion of the original Darksiders, though, so the setting will still be the post-apocalyptic version of Earth that's remained prevalent throughout the franchise's life. The developers also said that the setting will take place over different realms within the post-apocalyptic landscape, and each realm has unique bosses, items, and visuals.</p><p dir="ltr">During the game, you'll get to play as one of the Four Horsemen characters, who have become staples of the franchise. Death, Strife, Fury, and War are back in Darksiders 4, and you can choose which one to play as for a playthrough. Each of the Horsemen features different weapons, abilities, and playstyles, giving you more replayability options for second, third, and fourth playthroughs of the main story.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from the Four Horsemen, we're unsure of any additional characters in Darksiders 4. However, with the story starting from the end of the first game, it's a safe bet that some characters from the original will make an appearance.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Darksiders 4 Gameplay And Multiplayer</h2><p dir="ltr">While we await more details and showcases of Darksiders 4, the developers have given us an idea of how the game will play. Just like the other games in the series, the fourth installment is a third-person action-RPG that emphasizes combat, narrative storytelling, and exploration through a lore-rich world.</p><p dir="ltr">The combat in Darksiders 4 features up-close melee action and supernatural abilities that each of the characters possesses. These abilities can all likely be used in combat in some fashion, but other abilities could be more useful outside of engagements with enemies. In the case of Strife, we'll also likely be able to use his guns. Building on the cooperative feature in Genesis, it's also been confirmed that Darksiders 4 will support up to four people in cooperative play, with each controller one of the Four Horsemen.</p><p dir="ltr">THQ Nordic specifies "traversal and puzzle-solving" as key components to the game. Darksiders is no stranger to unique movement and puzzles across the post-apocalypse, but the early marketing seems to suggest those elements will play a larger role in Darksiders 4. Some characters might offer more traversal abilities than others, which could give them an edge while exploring the map, while other characters might have abilities that make them tankier in battle.</p><p dir="ltr">We still don't know a large chunk of how Darksiders 4 will look when it comes to gameplay, but THQ Nordic should be able to build off the foundation from the previous games in the franchise.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

<figure><a title="BOKURA: planet Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158489/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bokura-planet">BOKURA: planet</a> is a two-player, two-device-only co-op game that launched on Switch and Switch 2 on 7th August.</em></p>
<p><em>A follow-up to 2023's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bokura">BOKURA</a>, indie developer tokoronyori <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/bokura-planet-switch-2/">says of the first game</a> that he "kept wondering what scenery I might have seen if I'd gone in the complete opposite direction...In the end, I couldn't hold back. I ran the other way, which is how BOKURA: planet was born, and the view here is incredible."</em></p>
<p><em>Intriguing. Let's see how NL's two-man expedition went...<br></em></p>
<h2>Crew member #1's log (Blue)</h2>
<p>I've played my Switch 2 near enough every day for the past three months, and the one fancy new feature I have used less than any other is GameChat. I have fiddled about with it hesitantly in the odd game of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, but I was yet to have as much fun with it as those squeaky clean 20-somethings in all the console's marketing were promising.</p>
<figure><a title="BOKURA: planet Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158483/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It was then that I stumbled onto Bokura: Planet, an online co-op-only Switch 2 game that I had heard next to no one talking about, but one that felt tailor-made for some GameChat good times. Keen to see one of the Switch 2's flagship features in action, I recruited a willing participant (say hello to Gavin, everyone!) and stepped boldly into a space puzzle adventure where (seemingly) few had gone before.</p>
<p>The result? A little over three hours of belly laughs and head scratchers, with a refreshingly creative story structure. It might not be the most visually or technically taxing use of Switch 2, but you'd be hard pushed to find a better use for GameChat.</p>
<p>But before I blast off into all that, let's cover some context. This and its predecessor, 2023's BOKURA, have a lot in common. Both are two-player-only affairs played online across two systems with a heavy focus on communication, which is vital to progression. Both use that central gimmick to give each player their own view of the same puzzle, often splitting you into different areas, which necessitates poor descriptions, bad sound mimicry, and a lot of trial and error. Both adopt the same simplistic pixel art visuals that frequently walk the line between cute and creepy.</p>
<figure><a title="BOKURA: planet Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158491/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The big change for the sequel (aside from the addition of GameChat if you're playing on Switch 2, although the game is also on S1) is that the central 'split' gameplay mechanic extends to the story structure. A pair of space explorers crash-land on an alien planet and set about hunting down their lost recon drone and getting their bearings. The two nameless heroes are quickly split up, and each undergoes their own private story beats, which are kept secret — or <em>should</em> be — from the other throughout the rest of the game.</p>
<p>It's an idea that I struggled to get my head around at first. A small crossed-out mic symbol appears on the screen before you enter your private story content, and it's only after getting your first dose of text exposition that the game, or more specifically your character, explicitly says to keep it a secret from your partner. Unfortunately, Gavin and I are both certified blabbermouths, and for whatever reason, the mic symbol didn't immediately line up with "Don't tell your partner this bit" in either of our heads, as we both gasped and exclaimed in surprise before the game eventually put us in our place.</p>

<p>Even with the initial surprise half-spoiled — seriously, why not replace the mic symbol with something more concrete, like, I don't know, a big red message reading "KEEP THIS BIT A SECRET, YOU FOOL!"? — the split story means Bokura: Planet stands out in the sea of co-op puzzlers. I chucked inwardly as I heard Gavin ponder the relationship between our characters (something I had extra knowledge of thanks to my private, and often unexpectedly dark storyline), and sat open-mouthed when certain revelations reminded me how little of the 'full picture' I'd seen myself.</p>
<p>It's not all story and surprises, mind you. You'll spend most of your time with Bokura: Planet working your way through a series of single-screen puzzles, where you're tasked with describing your view to your partner, flicking switches, aligning symbols, and opening gates. The 'split' perspective is, once again, a neat idea (if not a particularly novel one), but Planet does a good job of mixing up the objectives so things don't become too stale. We were smirking as we described suggestively-shaped symbols on one screen, then screaming as we dodged grotesque creatures, deadly drops, and lasers on the next.</p>

<p>The difficulty seemed to sit in a sweet spot, too, even when the screen-sharing capabilities of GameChat meant that we could peek at each other's view and solve the problems quicker if we got really stuck. - <em>Jim Norman</em></p>
<h2>Crew member #2's log (Red)</h2>
<p>I quickly realised my error after blurting out my shocking onscreen events to which Jim wasn't privy. In hindsight, of course the crossed-out mic symbol <em>obviously</em> means 'STFU', but with all the (well-localised) dialogue boxes I'd seen up to then, it felt odd to use a symbol to communicate such important instructions. I suppose the text represented in-game dialogue and thoughts, while the symbol was meant only for you, the player.</p>
<p>Anyway, that was only one of two communication hiccups — the other being when firing up the game for the first time and being presented with a Japanese EULA (don't panic, just move to the option on the left and hit 'A' to cycle through the available languages - English is the second option) — but, honestly, it didn't affect our enjoyment.</p>

<p>The ensuing blend of cutesy pixel art and slightly gungy body horror came as a surprise — a welcome one, although, along with all the phallic symbols, it did have us pondering that PEGI 7 rating — in a game that otherwise presents block-pulling, button-pushing, laser-disabling, now-I'm-controlling-a-robot-on-<em>your</em>-screen puzzles and light platforming challenges. It's clever co-op stuff, mixing audio and visual conundrums engagingly, but the underlying narrative adds a touch of spice. It's a poignant story that ties in the few verbs at your disposal in neat ways.</p>
<p>When it comes to negatives, the jump takes a little getting used to, and you'll likely fall off some ledges during the three or four hours you'll be playing - although auto-save means you shouldn't have to redo much. Using GameChat means the audio is quieter, although that doesn't affect the ambient soundtrack here too much — you'll just have to listen carefully in sound-specific puzzles.</p>
<p>The game's opening menu screen isn't the most user-friendly, either. Sharing your code with your partner is straightforward enough (and the game automatically picks up where you left off when you pair up again in your next play session), but navigating the three menu icons feels more awkward than it should. Bokura: Planet also supports Mouse Mode, which is nice, although we struggled to find any reason for it beyond navigating menus.</p>

<p>For the low asking price, though, there's nothing to get upset about, and Nintendo couldn't ask for a better GameChat showcase. Indeed, having now played it, it's easy to see why the platform holder waved this onto the Switch 2 eShop when so many other indie teams are struggling to even get dev kits. - <em>Gavin Lane</em></p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bokura: Planet was a lovely surprise, with an intriguing, diverging co-op narrative that creates tension beneath its novel puzzles without completely jettisoning its cutesy vibes for pixel horror. If you're looking for a reflective, grown-up adventure with laughs, gasps, and perhaps even a tear or two, this affecting little expedition will claim but a few hours of your life and is worth enlisting a friend for.</p></section>

Bosses evolve with shifting modifiers, and the new progression system means each run builds toward the next, letting players experiment with different approaches against an ever-changing challenge. It’s a way to expand TFT’s core mechanics while giving players new stories to create with every climb.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teamfight Tactics: Ao Shin’s Ascent launches on September 24 at 10am Pacific Time, shortly after the release of patch 15.5.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">In early 2024, Disney invested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-it-invested-1-5-billion-into-fortnite-and-what-it-hopes-to-achieve/1100-6525584/" data-ref-id="1100-6525584">more than a billion dollars in Fortnite creator Epic Games</a> and announced some sort of new Disney-powered metaverse experience. We've already seen a few aspects of this deal come to fruition, like Fortnite skins for the Incredibles and the Disney Villains, plus new Marvel and Star Wars-themed seasons. There's been <em>a lot</em> of Disney in Fortnite since that announcement, in other words.</p><p dir="ltr">But the big Disney x Fortnite metaverse mode has yet to see the light of day, and the project remains shrouded in mystery. Let's take a look at what we know about it so far.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What actually is the Disney x Fortnite mode?</h2><p dir="ltr">We don't really know. There's been no teaser images or videos, and nobody is talking about it in terms that we would consider concrete. But here's how Disney described it in the <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-and-epic-games-fortnite/" rel="nofollow ">original announcement</a>:</p><p dir="ltr">"In addition to being a world-class games experience and interoperating with Fortnite, the new persistent universe will offer a multitude of opportunities for consumers to play, watch, shop and engage with content, characters and stories from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar and more. Players, gamers and fans will be able to create their own stories and experiences, express their fandom in a distinctly Disney way, and share content with each other in ways that they love."</p><p dir="ltr">While most of this is too nebulous to accurately break down with any real confidence, the key detail there is that Epic's new Disney experience is described as being its own thing that "interoperates" with Fortnite, rather than being a Fortnite mode. The reason for that distinction is that Disney x Fortnite will be its own walled garden of content--not every Fortnite skin will work with it, and there will be skins that work in the Disney mode that don't work in the rest of Fortnite.</p><p dir="ltr">"Not every outfit will be able to do everything," Epic executive Saxs Persson told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a> in October 2024. "A [Lego] minifig doesn’t hold a gun. Brands should be able to enforce the brand guidelines to the degree that they’re comfortable with that brand being associated with particular ratings."</p><p dir="ltr">In March 2025, meanwhile, a Disney Imagineer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-teases-theme-park-integration-with-disney-x-fortnite-project/1100-6530010/">speaking at South by Southwest</a>, indicated that Fortnite's Disney experience will have some interactivity with the Disney parks in the real world.</p><p dir="ltr">"Imagine ... what if you could go to the park and have an experience in Smuggler's Run [and] go on this amazing mission, but then have that affect or connect your gameplay at home?" said Asa Kalama, head of interactive experiences at Disney.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2bRcSIUsE" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Yf2bRcSIUsE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr">OK, but what will the game/experience actually be like?</h2><p dir="ltr">Despite the quotes above, we still don't know anything really tangible about the moment-to-moment experience of this Fortnite x Disney thing. Yes, they've teased certain features, like being able to <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1902845839380451462#fromHistory" rel="nofollow ">watch Disney content in-game or buy Disney merch,</a> and leaks indicate the experience will at least partially be set in some sort of <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1930318977080713575" rel="nofollow ">digital adaptation of the real-world Disneyland park</a>, and so perhaps you'll be able to ride those Disney rides in the game. And another leak mentions <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1948443719453298979" rel="nofollow ">cinematic cutscenes and story content</a>, so it may have a campaign to play through.</p><p dir="ltr">But even though we have this smattering of details about what will be included, we still have no real idea of what the core gameplay will be for this Fortnite x Disney thing. All these details are hints, but they don't add up to any sort of big picture.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When is Disney x Fortnite coming out?</h2><p dir="ltr">Considering how vague the details have been so far, there's no reason to expect this Disney x Fortnite project to release this year, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-has-concerns-about-upcoming-fortnite-project-report-says/1100-6533662/">a recent Wall Street Journal report</a> indicated it might be a while before it all comes together. The report claimed the mode is being held up by the many layers of Disney bureaucracy that have to approve anything Epic does with it. However, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney claimed the report was false and that Disney actually has been much more responsive than they expected.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of what is and isn't true with that story, the total lack of tangible info about the mode means there's no real reason to think that the Disney x Fortnite project is close to completion. Expect a 2026 launch at the earliest, unless Epic has majorly improved its ability to keep secrets recently.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <title><![CDATA[Super Robot Wars Y plays just like a kid’s giant robo fanfiction]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/773191/super-robot-wars-y-impressions-demo-nintendo-switch-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-robot-wars-y-plays-just-like-a-kid%E2%80%99s-giant-robo-fanfiction.1290582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When I was 16 years old, I wrote my first fanfiction. It was a crossover fic where the cast from <em>Queer Eye for the Straight Guy</em> gave the anime dog demon Inuyasha a makeover. It was stupid and poorly written, and yet, to this very day, I remember it fondly. This is exactly what it’s like playing <em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> — an exceedingly silly, nonsensical plot featuring characters that have no business speaking to each other all, stitched together by tactical robot action. It rules.</p><p><em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> was released on Nintendo Switch 2 and Steam on August 29th. For this blog, I played the demo that covers the game’s first chapter with progress carrying over to the full game. It is the latest entry in a series of robot strategy games that spans back to the NES days, but this recent game is only one of a handful of English releases. <em>Super Robot Wars</em> takes all the robots from your favorite mecha series — <em>Getter Robo</em>, <em>Mazinger</em> <em>Z</em>, <em>Gundam</em>, and more — and mashes them together in a big ol’ strategy RPG toybox.</p><p>That’s excellent for the Universal Century-loving, Knightmare Frame-driving girlies such as myself, but absolute hell on studios who have to navigate <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2016/02/18/super-robot-wars-og-the-moon-dwellers-will-be-getting-an-english-localized-release/">complex licensing agreements</a> with anime distributors and production companies once you get outside Japan.</p><p>It’s only been through the dedication of fan translators that <em>Super Robot Wars</em> has maintained a robust English-speaking fandom. And it’s apparently big enough that Bandai Namco has decided it’s worth it to give these games worldwide releases, starting with <em>Super Robot Wars 30</em> in 2021 and now <em>Super Robot Wars Y</em>.</p><p>This game is, to use the technical term, goofy as shit. You play as an original character, a mecha-piloting soldier sent to protect a young girl who’s found herself in charge of a giant city that’s also a floating battleship. (If you’re familiar with the original <em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em>’s White Base, it’s that but with a city on it.) From there, it gets really silly. The utterly charming thing about <em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> is it makes an earnest, full-throated attempt to incorporate every component series’ plot and most important moments into a singular coherent story.</p><p>When Domon Kasshu (<em>Mobile Fighter G Gundam</em>) shows up, everyone gushes over him because he’s the pilot who won the 13th Gundam Fight. They also gush over him because he’s the guy who gave the most “romantic love confession ever,” and if you’ve watched <em>G Gundam,</em> you’ll know what they’re talking about. And if you don’t, the game includes a robust encyclopedia of characters, organizations, and events to get you up to speed. But I’ve found I don’t care when I don’t know someone or something.</p><div><p>This game is, to use the technical term, goofy as shit.</p></div><p>In one fight where I was overwhelmed by mecha-kaiju, four teenagers with attitude climbed into four different mechs that then fused into one. Did I know those kids or care about them? No. Why? Because their giant mech — which I’m told is called a Dynazenon — transformed <em>again</em> into a giant, flame-spouting mecha dragon. Who cares about teenagers when you’ve got giant robot dragons?</p><p>Characters with similar motivations and goals are gathered on one side of the conflict and their opponents on the other, leading to legendary team-ups that were once only possible eight pages deep into an AO3 fanfic search. I cannot express how much the sentence “Lelouch vi Britannia mounted an all-out assault on Char Aznable” breaks my brain in half. But I can definitively say it was also the moment I bought all the way into this game.</p><p>The other reason I’m sold is the combat. I’ve been searching for a tactical action RPG. The last couple I’ve played, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23557639/fire-emblem-engage-nintendo-switch-review"><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em></a> and <em>Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp</em>, left me cold with a bland story and uninteresting combat, respectively.</p><p><em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> has adequately scratched my itch. It works like any other tactical RPG: send units out on missions to destroy enemy mechs on a gridded battlefield. Each pilot has a suite of abilities you can swap out and improve, the same way you can upgrade mechs by changing out their parts and enhancing them.</p><p>Since this was a demo of the game’s first chapter, combat was relatively simplistic. But I can see that the upgrade systems offer depth to explore beyond that. You also get abilities called “spirits” that grant you temporary stat bonuses or let you dodge attacks, and support characters who also grant temporary combat boons, so you can build your team to your liking. There’s also something called the “Sacred Tri-Directional Galaxy Memory,” which is basically a skill tree that rewards picking a dedicated path with massive, team-wide bonuses.</p><p>There’s a part of me that wanted to caveat all the praise I have for <em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> with “as childish as it sounds,” but that’s not really fair. Even from the little bit I’ve played, the enjoyment I get out of <em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> is real, and not strictly because the combat scratched an itch or the batshit story provided a rousing good time. It reminds me of the fun I had writing fanfiction as a kid, and I hope, as the game goes on, that feeling continues.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/773191/super-robot-wars-y-impressions-demo-nintendo-switch-2#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/773191/super-robot-wars-y-impressions-demo-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite having yet to be officially revealed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5.7</a> may not be too far from release, judging from some recent discoveries.</p>



<p>As reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/theredpix">TheRedPixel</a>, an Unreal Engine 5.7 branch is already available on GitHub, while the Main branch has been bumped to 5.8, suggesting the new version of the engine shouldn't be too far from release. While we don't know when the announcement and release will happen, there's a good chance a preview may be released later this month during Unreal Fest Stockholm, which will be held from September 22 to September 24, as TheRedPixel speculates. Likewise, there's no news regarding which new features and improvements the latest version of the engine will bring, but it is expected it will include improvements to hardware Lumen as well as Nanite Foliage.</p>

<p>The current version of the engine, <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/">Unreal Engine 5.6</a>, was launched in June, following the annual edition of State of Unreal. This version of the engine packs hardware ray tracing enhancements that boost Lumen Global Illumination performance, faster geometry streaming for smoother loading of massive static worlds, an intuitive redesign of Motion trails, revamped Tween Tools and redesigned Curve editor and more. The improvements made to the engine have also brought siginficant CPU and GPU improvements over version 5.4, as shown in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-significant-performance-improvements/">comparison video</a> putting a Paris Tech Demo running in UE 5.6 and UE 5.4 running side by side.</p>



<p>Hopefully, every improvement coming with Unreal Engine 5.7 will help reduce the stuttering issues prevalent in almost every game powered by the engine. One exception seems to be Silent Hill F, Konami's new entry in the survival horror series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-smooth/">as its Gamescom demo ran so well that it almost felt like it wasn't powered by UE5.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Herdling</em> is a slow game about herding fuzzy animals through a vibrant natural world. That may not sound particularly exciting, but I found it to be a perfect game to unwind with after a stressful day.</p><p>In <em>Herdling</em>, you play as a kid who makes friends with and shepherds large fluffy creatures called Calicorns, which kind of look like a mix of a sheep and a woolly mammoth. The Calicorns are <em>adorable</em>, with cute snorts and head shakes that make them feel like real animals. You’ll even get opportunities to play fetch, and yes, you can pet the Calicorns. You can also name your furry friends, and the game even suggests ideas, which is why my flock have charming names like “Dilruba” (in my head, I called him “Dil”), “Fardar,” and “Toe.”</p><p>You guide the herd with a magical stick. With the push of a trigger, you’ll see a small bright spot ahead of you that the herd will follow. The Calicorns generally do a good job staying grouped up and following your directions, so much of the game is walking behind them and guiding them through scenic locales like a forest and a mountain range. When you direct the herd to walk over rare spots of colorful flowers, the Calicorns essentially get a boost you can use to activate a stampede, which is useful for running across open landscapes or climbing up slippery slopes.</p><p>Most of the time, walking with the herd is quite peaceful. I regularly found my eyes wandering away from the path to take in the game’s scenery as the Calicorns ambled toward where I wanted them to go. The ambient, <em>Breath of the Wild</em>-like soundtrack helps create the calming atmosphere. It all made <em>Herdling</em> great to unwind with after a hectic day in real life.</p><p>But there are some more tense moments too, like when you have to avoid the attention of some giant birds or keep your Calicorns from wandering onto thin ice. These moments require patience so that you can thoughtfully get the herd through trouble, and I was always relieved when I got my Calicorns out of stressful spots. (If you don’t want to worry about putting your Calicorns in danger, the game has a setting to make them immortal.)</p><p>If reading all of this makes <em>Herdling</em> sound a little bit like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/13/22972989/journey-10-year-anniversary-multiplayer-jenova-chen-austin-wintory">indie classic <em>Journey</em></a> but with furry animals, well, it kind of is. There are <em>a lot</em> of similar beats between the two games. That’s not a bad thing, though; the varied locations and tones made <em>Journey</em> memorable even though it’s a short game. There are similarly some standout moments in <em>Herdling</em>, and I had really bonded with my Calicorn crew by the end of our three-hour adventure together. I thought that was just the right length, but maybe I’ll boot up my save down the line to go on another nice walk with Dil and flock — or just to play fetch again.</p><p><sup>Herdling</sup><em><sup> is available now on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</sup></em></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/764810/herdling-panic-review-pc-switch-playstation-xbox#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/764810/herdling-panic-review-pc-switch-playstation-xbox]]></content:encoded>

Right, so things are progressing really smoothly. I can’t really say more — if I suddenly went, ‘Well, actually...,’ everyone would be really surprised! [Laughs.]”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nomura goes as far as to say that the “release timing has already been decided” but stops short of clarifying when exactly Square Enix will share more. For now, he asks fans to be patient, adding that work on Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 is “moving forward according to that schedule.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RPG fans have been on the hunt for news about the next entry in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series since its last installment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a>, launched in early 2024. We know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-in-development"><u>development started as early as June 2022</u></a>, with Square Enix saying last year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027"><u>its goal is to see it launch by 2027</u></a>. Excitement for the third and final chapter in the trilogy grew even more when the team revealed that it had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-a-completed-story-at-square-enix"><u>completed its story earlier this year</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Development for Kingdom Hearts 4, meanwhile, is progressing in a similarly positive direction, though Nomura says even less about when any further updates may arrive on this front.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And this has also come up in the comments here and there,” Nomura added, “but <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em> is likewise steadily moving forward according to schedule, so please look forward to it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingdom Hearts 4 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-and-kingdom-hearts-missing-link-announced-at-the-series-20th-anniversary-event"><u>announced in 2022</u></a>, and updates have been distressingly few and far between since. It wasn’t until May 2025, not even four months ago, that Square Enix was willing to share a substantial update, and even then, all fans had to hold onto was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-finally-breaks-silence-on-kingdom-hearts-4-shares-screenshots-says-its-dedicated-to-making-this-an-experience-that-lives-up-to-your-expectations"><u>a handful of new screenshots</u></a> and <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819231965696436" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a short message from the team</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Hearts 4 Screenshots May 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts," Square Enix said at the time. “We are equally excited and can’t wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts IV when the time is right.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Astro Bot is celebrating its 1-year anniversary today, September 6, 2025. Below, we reflect on what the plucky robot has come to represent for some burgeoning gamers.</em></p><p dir="ltr">More than 30 years ago, I fell in love. I was visiting extended family with my parents and two siblings, and the object of my affection was a boxy gray-and-black video game console hooked up to an equally boxy CRT television. I had seen video games before in arcades, and had played some rudimentary Mac games on our family computer. But Super Mario Bros. was something else entirely. The simple but flexible controls, the stage variety, the <em>music</em>. By the time we left my aunt's house, we three children were staging a coordinated influence campaign to convince our parents to buy our own Nintendo Entertainment System, eager to play more Mario. The rest is history.</p><p dir="ltr">My story isn't unique. Lots of children of the 1980s have similar origins for their gaming obsession. But now, decades later, as a parent myself, I'm struck by how Astro Bot has enraptured my own kids in ways that remind me of my experience with Mario. Years in the future, it will almost certainly be Astro that they credit with first igniting their love of games.</p><p dir="ltr">In my particular case, my experience with Mario all those years ago had a massive impact on the trajectory of my life. It affected not only my hobby and interests and circle of friends, but also my career. It's hard to imagine that I would have gone into writing about games professionally without catching the bug from an early age. I don't particularly think my own kids will become games critics, but it's a testament to how important these early experiences can be, and how they can manifest in unexpected ways.</p><div

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-face-of-playstation-and-the-technomagic-behind-astro-bot/1100-6526261/">extended hands-on</a>. It was a normal-enough studio visit, but I could sense an infectious energy around this game in particular. This was shaping up to be something special, and I think Asobi knew it. In interviews, game director Nicolas Doucet talked about how important it was to make this game appealing and approachable for younger gamers. Astro is a robot with a relatively simple character design, intentionally kept simple enough so that kids would be able to draw themselves. The character communicates wordlessly with expressions and sounds so that even kids who haven't yet learned to read will understand the story. The platforming stages are made to be tough enough to present a nice difficulty ramp for younger or novice players, with optional challenge stages for older and more experienced players.</p><p dir="ltr">"I remember the first few video games that I played, and because of how greatly they were designed, they stayed with me for my whole life," Doucet said. "And both of these are really important, I think. When we make something like a platformer, we have to be able to cater for both. So we've been building not only the game, but the culture of the team, always around that principle."</p><p dir="ltr">While Doucet didn't mention Mario specifically during the studio visit, the inspiration was clearly there. The studio set out to make a game that would feel great and have staying power.</p><p dir="ltr">They succeeded. A year later, Astro Bot is still one of the most-played video games in my house. My youngest, who can't read yet, usually calls it "the wobot game," but has started to know the character as Astro. The levels are just challenging enough to give him a satisfying sense of friction and accomplishment, while still remaining doable. He often surprises the rest of the family with how well he navigates even more challenging late-game stages.</p><p dir="ltr">My older kids are happy to play with him, helping him past the difficult parts, or playing their own extra-tough challenge levels. They all love to take on bosses together. They laugh and cheer each other on as they take on tougher challenges or replay their favorite stages. When one of the kids inadvertently deleted my 100% completion game save--I'm not naming names here; they know who they are--I ultimately shrugged it off because we could just start anew.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4562846-scsiqh.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562846" data-ratio="0.56304985337243" data-width="1023" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4562846-scsiqh.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562846"></a><figcaption>Astro TKOs Wako Tako</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4562846-scsiqh.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now to be sure, Astro Bot isn't likely to be as ubiquitous for my kids' generation as Mario was for mine. In the '80s, video game releases were sporadic and mascot characters were almost unheard of. Today, kids get into video games in all sorts of ways, from mobile devices and tablets to consoles, with massive, established franchises like Minecraft and Fortnite. Almost every gamer who came of age in the 1980s has a memory of Super Mario, but Astro's impact will be more diffused because there are more avenues leading to the same destination. Astro won't be a universal constant for its time period, and only time will tell if it has anywhere even remotely approaching Mario's staying power. Still, it will always be special to me for what it has meant in my household.</p><p>Astro Bot has enjoyed plenty of success over the last year. It has sold well, inspired merchandise (including multiple special-edition controllers), and won the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/">top honor at The Game Awards 2024</a>. For me, though, the impact has been more personal: Astro Bot is the game that unlocked a sense of curiosity and play in my kids, and sparked their interest in playing video games more broadly. When I see them playing it, it's like staring through a portal in time and watching myself all those years ago--face alight with the hypnotic glow of an old brown television, mouth agape as my mind reels at the possibilities of this magical new medium.</p>

            <p>82 per cent of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s Steam reviews may be positive, but it seems the adoration hasn't been universal, with hundreds of Chinese-speaking players slamming Team Cherry for issues with the sequel's translations.</p>
<p>It's been such a problem, in fact, that even though Silksong's reviews are chiefly either Very or Overwhelming Positive when you isolate by language, Silksong's simplified-Chinese Steam reviews are sitting on an anomalous Mixed rating.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, Team Cherry's Matthew Griffin directly addressed Chinese-speaking players on X/Twitter overnight, acknowledging the issue and confirming "we'll be working to improve the translation over the coming weeks".</p>

<p>"To our Chinese-speaking fans: We appreciate you letting us know about quality issues with the current Simplified Chinese translation of Hollow Knight: Silksong," he wrote (thanks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-review-bomb-chinese-translation-2000623496">Kotaku</a>). "We'll be working to improve the translation over the coming weeks. Thanks for your feedback and support."</p> <div>

<p>Chinese-speaking players' feedback suggests Hollow Knight: Silksong's translation "<a href="https://x.com/TigerHixTang/status/1963850592595677350">reads like a Wuxia novel</a> instead of conveying the game’s tone", is "<a href="https://x.com/Ricken_62O/status/1963964912688115861">of rather low quality</a>", and "<a href="https://x.com/Xxyciel/status/1963801738340958441">really ruins the game experience</a>…"</p>
<p>Consequently, of the 16,000+ reviews left for Silksong by players categorised as playing in the 'Simplified Chinese' language, just 44 per cent have left a positive review.</p>
<p>For more on Silksong, Bertie spoke to several developers about the impact its low price will have on other indie games in his feature: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-hollow-knight-silksongs-cheap-price-a-problem-for-other-indie-games-devs-and-publishers-weigh-up-its-impact">Is Hollow Knight Silksong's 'cheap' price a problem for other indie games? Devs and publishers weigh up its impact</a>. And interestingly, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-so-popular-even-pirates-are-urging-others-not-to-pirate-the-game">pirating community is actually urging others to buy the game, rather than pirate it</a>.</p>
<p>And in news unlikely to surprise you as we go into the weekend, Hollow Knight: Silksong has already broken its own concurrent record, hitting <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/">562,814 players</a> on Steam.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> is the latest video game confirmed to be getting a TV adaptation.</p>
<p>As first reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-luckychap-1236509181/">Variety</a>, Amazon Prime Video has greenlit a live-action Life is Strange show.

<p>"Story Kitchen has always believed that Life is Strange deserved to be more than just a game – it's a cultural touchstone," said Story Kitchen's Johnson and Goldberg.</p>
<p>"After a decade-long journey, we're honoured to be bringing this beloved story to Amazon MGM alongside our incredible partners at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, our brilliant showrunner/writer Charlie Covell, and the amazing team at LuckyChap. Together, this thoughtfully assembled dream team is ready to share Life is Strange with the world in an entirely new way!"</p><div>

<p>"It's a huge honour to be adapting Life Is Strange for Amazon MGM Studios," Covell added. "I am a massive fan of the game, and I'm thrilled to be working with the incredible teams at Square Enix, Story Kitchen, and LuckyChap. I can't wait to share Max and Chloe's story with fellow players and new audiences alike."</p>
<p>Square Enix studio heads Jon Brooke and Lee Singleton said, "For years we've had so many people asking us to create a Life is Strange TV show, and we're so pleased to finally partner with Amazon MGM Studios, who we trust will do an incredible job bringing our universe to life."</p>
<p>The franchise's most recent release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposures-first-two-chapters-are-mostly-good-but-making-fans-pay-extra-to-play-early-is-a-huge-mistake">Life is Strange: Double Exposure, launched amidst a major backlash from fans</a> upset at how the game handled the ongoing storyline of returning protagonist Max Caulfield, and the impact of players' choice at the beginning of Life is Strange 1.</p>
<p>The situation turned uglier when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-fans-upset-after-square-enix-removes-reddit-posts-featuring-leaked-content-anonymous-developer-comments">Square Enix removed leaked development material from a popular Life is Strange fan subreddit</a>, even though commenters provided proof they worked at Deck Nine and claimed Double Exposure's story changed due to feedback from Square Enix itself. Square Enix said it had acted to remove the content based on "appropriate legal requirements" for "intellectual property violations".</p>

<p>Community developer DebbieElla told players the refunds were coming as part of recent "adjustments", and confirmed we'll get "all the details" on the changes on 17th September.</p>

<p>As we reported last week, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 publisher Paradox is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/good-the-grubby-paid-clan-plan-for-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-being-adjusted">rethinking its plan to charge for two of the six playable clans in the game</a> following community feedback. The news came after publisher Paradox announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-all-these-years-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gets-an-actual-proper-release-date">the release date for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, 21st October, along with pricing details for the game. It was then we learned the company intended to charge £20 extra to access two clans in the game, via a Shadows and Silk content pack.</p><p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">According to developer, The Chinese Room</a>, these two clans represented content developed beyond what was originally planned for the game after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">inherited development of Bloodlines 2 </a>from Hardsuit Labs. Consequently, The Chinese Room's reasoning was this was additional content developed for the game, so it would sell it as such at release. But not anymore.</p>
<p>Now, in a Discord post, DebbieElla writes: "We are working hard on the adjustments that we promised, and we will be able to tell you all the details on 17th September. Making significant changes like this involves many moving parts, and we want to make sure that we get it right with this change.</p>
<p>"Anyone who pre-ordered the Premium Edition through the PlayStation Store will be contacted and refunded starting Monday 8th September. You'll be able to pre-order your Premium Edition copy later again, before the release on 21st October. Please note that this is an intentional first step in our planned course of action leading up to 17th September to deliver the best possible experience for you at launch."</p>
<p>The post closed on thanking players for their patience, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vtmb/comments/1n9bbhr/comment/ncm9z9o/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">later messages from DebbieElla</a> confirm this only applies to this particular edition sold for PlayStation – purchases on other platforms are unaffected.</p>
<p>Some are now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vtmb/comments/1n9bbhr/comment/nclwom0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">hoping</a> this signifies all clans may be available in the base game, but as one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1n9bf6u/comment/ncoly53/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">points</a> out, however, "taking the clans out of the deluxe editions is the easy part. The hard part is trying to figure out what else they can put in there".</p><p>In his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-action-than-rpg-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-struggles-to-convince-after-a-few-hours-play">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 preview</a> a few weeks back, Bertie wrote: "[T]his is a sequel to a cult RPG after all, and one based on a major tabletop RPG to boot. In this case it feels valid to crave a little more role-playing, a little more texture and depth to the game's people and conversations. And so for now, a question mark remains".</p>

		<p>Even though the game’s long development had morphed into something of a meme, I don’t think anyone was truly prepared for just how big the launch of Hollow Knight: Silksong would be this week. Truly, it was close to being the GTA of indie game releases, with other indie developers doing what they could to avoid launching on the same day – of course, anything with a physical launch couldn’t really do that – and then all of the digital storefront feeling the crunch and stumbling as everyone rushed to download.</p>
<p>All of which is to say…. are you playing Silksong this weekend?</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>

<p>Heading back to our continuing Gamescom catch ups, I had a preview of the intriguing PvPvE horror shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/02/project-spectrum-preview-fight-the-horror-or-become-it-in-this-pvpve-shooter/"><strong>Project Spectrum</strong></a>, which was one of the flaming spade highlights of Opening Night Live, as well as checking in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/hell-let-loose-vietnam-preview-choppers-tunnels-and-a-new-era-of-war/"><strong>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</strong></a> and its leap forward to a very different conflict to the WW2 original.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you played this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Andrewww</b> continues to seemingly only ever play games that are just about to leave PlayStation Plus, giving Dead Island 2 and Night in the Woods a try. Alas, neither of them grabbed his attention, but the Alone in the Dark remake managed to survive past the opening few hours. He also continued his journey through Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but now he’s got stick drift in one of his controllers so it trying for a warranty replacement. Good luck with that!</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week, enjoy the improved weather for the weekend, and we’ll catch you back here on Monday!</p>

<figure><a title="WAYP SILKSONG" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1aae10e995fdd/wayp-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Aloha, amigos, and welcome shorts fans, to another weekend. It's been a very, very quiet one this week, with no games of note to menti...oh, hold on. Wait. We've actually been inundated with bangers. I'm terribly sorry.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has finally materialised. It's a real game that you can play right now! In fact, it's so real that it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-switch-eshop-and-steam-are-buckling-under-the-weight-of-silksong">crashed a bunch of online stores when it dropped</a>, causing both the eShop and Steam to struggle for a prolonged period.</p>
<p>We've also had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, an adventure that had us all worried during the week with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-force-isnt-strong-with-star-wars-outlaws-on-switch-2-initial-impressions-suggest">rumoured poor performance on Switch 2</a>, arriving in splendid form. Utinni indeed, small furry warrior. Of course, game-key cards have also been front and centre in the wake of Outlaws' release; folk continue to rally against them, although explanations for why they are used in this case <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">are showing up</a> to muddy the argument waters even further.</p>
<p>Away from the heady heights of those two games, which we're sure most folk will spend this weekend diving into, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a> has also just gone live. We'll have a review of that one ASAP - but early impressions do seem to point to, well, the early impressions from the internet are 60fps and/or under 30fps depending where you read 'em, so stick with us and we'll know for sure very shortly.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, with Atari's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a> also on this week's ticket, there's certainly a decent spread of games to be getting on with playing, whether you're into walking around knocking wee balls into holes on nicely mowed lawns, or CQC'ing stormtroopers just because you can.</p>
<p>So, without any further interruption, let's have a look at what some of the Nintendo Life team are playing this weekend. Namaste.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187446,187479 @ 1757183080 -->
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I've been having a space-whale of a time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> this week, and I'm very excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>, which I've managed a few hours on already. However, my weekend is gonna be mostly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a>, which I've already been playing through early access on PS5, so I'm very interested to see how it shapes up on Switch 2. Expect a review of that shortly!</p>
<p>Otherwise, yeah, it's gonna be me and my two absolutely enthralled sons (who somehow seem to know all the Hollow Knight lore, despite having not played it), sat in front of a TV for Team Cherry's latest. Not a bad plan.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>This weekend, I will be mostly playing the things I was playing last week. Namely, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>, and a bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_jurassic_world">LEGO Jurassic World</a>. I just finished up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_trek_resurgence">Star Trek: Resurgence</a> (look out for a review soon), so it's back to Hallownest for the most part.</p>
<p>And given the positive reaction to the Switch port, I'm also keen to check out the other recent Star **** game, Outlaws. We'll see if I can squeeze that in too.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Since the game is out now, I don’t mind telling you that I’ll be playing a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> this weekend in an effort to get a review ready as soon as possible. I won’t go into too much detail now, but I’m enjoying it so far – it’s cool.</p>
<p>And of course I’m playing Silksong! I got really caught up in the hype on launch day and I’m glad I did. It’s really quite good. I get lost quite a bit and there’s one mini-boss that’s giving me a real headache, but I shall persevere.</p>
<h2>Damien McFerran, Editorial Director</h2>
<p>Having successfully avoided it for almost a decade, I'm actually getting around to playing the original Hollow Knight this week. I reasoned that, in 2025, resistance was useless; if I want to be part of the Silksong conversation, I need to play the first game before I can dip into the sequel, right?</p>
<p>So far, I'm loving it – in fact, I'm now at the point where I can't believe I sat on this game for so long. The music! The visuals! The dialogue! The challenge! It's like two of my favourite games, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-its-about-time-castlevania-symphony-of-the-night-came-to-switch">SotN</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a>, had a baby and left it on my doorstep, and I cruelly left said baby on said doorstep for ages before finally bringing it in from the cold. Forgive me, Team Cherry!</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>Hornet has bound me to play Hollow Knight: Silksong for eternity. Well, it could be much, much worse... Fortunately, she is letting me go out and celebrate my partner's birthday with family this weekend, so that's good.</p>
<p>Check back for my review soon!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Wizards of the Coast Head Want to See a New D&D MMORPG Happening]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-wizards-of-the-coast-head-wants-new-dd-mmorpg/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-wizards-of-the-coast-head-want-to-see-a-new-d-d-mmorpg-happening.1290513/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following last year's celebrations for the 50th anniversary of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D henceforth), Wizards of the Coast has slowly unveiled a bold plan in the gaming space. This coincided with a new president, John Hight, who joined the RPG, board game, and collectible card games publisher after being the 'Chief Caretaker' for World of Warcraft at Blizzard for ten years. </p>



<p>Therefore, it is perhaps not that much of a surprise to hear him speak about his desire to see a new D&amp;D MMORPG. In an interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-wizards-of-the-coast-president-would-love-a-new-dungeons-dragons-mmorpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, he openly admitted that he'd like to see that happen, although such a project would likely have to deviate from World of Warcraft's two-decade-old formula.</p>



<p><em>I'd love to have that. I think that we'll want to rethink what an MMO is in this day and age. I think the traditional model that Blizzard – well, even before that, Ultima Online, Everquest – pursued, that could use updating. I think in our case, it's probably a crawl, walk, run situation. We want to make sure that we've assembled the talent, we have the backend technology, we have the plans to pursue. But of course, that's a glimmer in my eye. I want to see that happen.</em></p>



<p>D&amp;D and MMORPGs are two of my favorite things in the entertainment space, so I would be lying if I didn't say how excited I am about the prospect. There are already two MMORPGs based on Wizards' IP (Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online, originally released by Turbine in 2006 and now maintained by Standing Stone Games, and Neverwinter, launched by Cryptic in 2013), but they are pretty old by this point and never really got anywhere as big as the franchise deserves.</p>



<p>Still, this is not a game announcement. Hight's statement clarifies that Wizards of the Coast wants to build a tech and talent base before even attempting such a gargantuan task. Then, once the project actually gets the green light, it may take the better part of a decade before it's done, so better sit tight.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we can at least look forward to many other D&amp;D games, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>The fantasy tabletop adventure game&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-launches-in-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked</a>, out later this year.</li>



<li>Project Baxter,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an online cooperative game in development at Starbreeze</a>&nbsp;(the makers of Payday) and scheduled to launch in 2026.</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A new game from Invoke</a>, formerly known as Tuque, which made the Dark Alliance game.</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-deal-with-former-god-of-war-directors-new-studio-giant-skull-to-make-a-single-player-action-dd-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The recently announced action/adventure game in development at Giant Skull</a>, the studio founded by Stig Asmussen. Asmussen knew Hight from their time at Sony, before Hight's move to Blizzard, which made the partnership easier.</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-survival-life-simulation-and-action-rpg-hybrid-announced-by-gameloft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A survival/life simulation/action RPG in development at Gameloft</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier this month, the Wizards of the Coast president also announced hiring a group of former Monolith and Cliffhanger Games developers led by Michael de Plater. That announcement only mentioned this team would incubate a 'cool new game concept' without clarifying whether it would be set in the D&amp;D IP or something new. Wizards isn't putting all its gaming eggs in the same basket, either: they've also funded <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-looks-a-lot-like-mass-effect-in-the-first-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exodus</a>, the Mass Effect-like RPG in development at Archetype Entertainment, and a GI Joe title in the works at Atomic Arcade.</p>

<p>Free and paid DLC is on the way</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> launched for the Switch 2 earlier this week, and now that the game is available, the team has gone into detail about the post-launch content on the way.</p>
<p>This includes a free roadmap update, which will add content from October through to December, along with some paid content. The free DLC starts on 2nd October 2025 with a new boss and cosmetic item. This will be followed by another two new bosses and cosmetic items in the same month, and later in December, three more new bosses will be added.</p>
<p>The paid "Into the Abyss" Expansion Pack is also scheduled to be released at some point in November.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9edff6b020ef1/daemon-x-machina.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>In our review we said this game was a decent mech experience, even if it was a bit clunky in some parts. A Switch 2 demo is also available to download on the eShop, if you want to try the first nine chapters of the game and freely explore the open world. Multiplayer support is also included and save data will carry over to the full release.</p>
