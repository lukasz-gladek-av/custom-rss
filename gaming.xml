            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most highly criticized books from 2014's <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> release is the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>. This book meant as a resource for DMs to craft their own worlds and adventures had issues with it's structure as well as efficiency of contents leading to a book that was cumbersome to get through. Now that we have our hands on the 2024 DMG how much of an improvement is it?</p>

<h2>Running A Game</h2>

<p>The first two sections of the DMG focus on running the game. The basic things that every DM should know and the rules and resolving outcomes. It might seem smart to begin at the beginning, but when the 2014 rulebook launched potentially new DMs into the rules with the pantheon of Gods this revised layout is great.</p>

<p>DMs will be taught what they need – players, dice, ways to make notes – and the preparation tools for running a session. Much like the revised <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed2ad5c2-7b7b-4a5a-84ff-eb15f1121885" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow"><em>Player Handbook</em></a> the DMG also includes examples of play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-running-the-game.jpg?itok=VgpNwqNG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-running-the-game.jpg?itok=f6Kr693O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These scripted session provide an example for the potential DM reading to not just understand what they need to be aware of, but also why they're making those choices. As the party heads into a dangerous location asking something simple like "Whose leading the way" doesn't just help the players, but it also means if that hidden monster is to jump out who will be the one getting ambushed.</p>

<p>This section also highlights how differently something can be ran at a table. This is very important, especially for new DMs, as you don't want to fall into the trap that there's one perfect way to run a D&amp;D game but instead try out a few different methods and see not only what works well for you, but also your table.</p>

<p>As this portion of the book continues there's an excellent balance of offering the DMs a wide variety of possibilities to pick from while also letting them know that they don't need to offer players the world. There are limits that DMs need to know to set, whether that be content limits or calming down disruptive players. I spoke about some of the good ways that the PHB subtly taught that DMs can say 'no' to a player while still enabling a fun game and it's in this section that you'll also learn that players should be respectful of you and your efforts.</p>

<p>This approach to teaching DMing, first in the tools you'll need and how to run the game, to the different expectations you should understand and accept for yourself but also all of your players is an excellent tact. It starts small, building up the game from the ground, without scaring a new DM with any big-picture ideas from the get-go.</p>

<p>This DMG offers a LOT of different tools for DMs to fill their worlds with entertaining objects and obstacles. Here you'll find instructions for creating items for players to interact with like magic items and spells, as well as elements of the world like gods and settlements.</p>

<p>The range of things to learn, and a variety of their permutations was incredible. All of the things you could think you would need to build up a session or a world are present, and so many other things you might not have ever thought about. Want to run a chase sequence but need mechanics for it? What about if the magic potion wasn't brewed correctly and has a side effect? How should I balance the damage of a trap of my own design?</p>

<p>Most of these sections also have context for premade ideas, like traps, and then how to build them yourself. The DMG continues its methodology of showing you something to prompt your creativity, and then handing you the tools to carry your creation to the finish line.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-map-creation.jpg?itok=BrO0dxol 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-map-creation.jpg?itok=8Fi8aNw- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Building Your Own Adventures</h2>

<p>Forty two pages of the 2024 DMG are dedicated to the creation of Adventures, the generic term for a one-shot/smaller group of sessions, and for full-on Campaigns. Each of these sections details how you should go about creating the premise for the journey, how you can make the characters relevant to the world, and how you can plan encounters to be driving the plot forward.</p>

<p>This is a must-read section for DMs of any level of experience. Does well to explain and highlight the collaborative nature of storytelling in D&amp;D, not just an adventure for the DM to write for the party to read but how they can all influence the world that they'll be joining.</p>

<p>This section also highlights important aspects of planning for multiple avenues of problem solving and how to get players more invested.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-greyhawk.jpg?itok=hh2ISjNc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-greyhawk.jpg?itok=NXAPNtbl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I also appreciated how it demonstrated that you could use the book to build a competent and fun adventure, and then string it to another, and another, and another to create a campaign that successfully builds upon itself, but it fun for everyone the whole way. It's not just about the destination or the journey, but both.</p>

<h2>Campaign Setting, Some Assembly Required</h2>

<p>A campaign setting for Greyhawk has been included as a reference for the DM to craft adventures within. This is a great setting off point.</p>

<p>This section gives a good overview of the regions and major locations of Greyhawk as well as cultural information like local gods, and a map of the world. It feels like a nice blueprint for any of the adventures that reading through the prior segments could be built up from.</p>

<p>That being said this isn't going to be a comprehensive guide to the ins and outs of Greyhawk, a DM will still need to do a lot of fill up this world as their players continue to progress through it.</p>

<h2>Bastion Sweet Bastion</h2>

<p>The final major section details Bastions, a returning mechanic from older editions of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> that allows the party to create a "home base" that they will likely call home between adventures. Bastion's can be introduced as early as level 5 and will continue to grow with the party.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-bastions.jpg?itok=I7rJhOYi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-bastions.jpg?itok=rKh595mq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is a really fun way to allow your party to have a piece of the world to call their own, something that players of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="76148372-10c1-43b3-929d-4f8aa273a684" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-waterdeep-dungeon-of-mad-mage-board-game-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</em></a> might be familiar with but with a whole lot more practical uses.</p>

<p>Bastion's start as a blank slate, but can be leveled up with different facilities that can offer all kinds of amazing effects. A meditation hall that can offer advantage on saving throws, a workshop to crate new tools, or a place to craft Spell Scrolls.</p>

<p>This adds further to the idea that was important in shaping the adventure, it's not just a story for the DM to write, but a place where all players are collaboratively able to craft a world and adventure together.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-curses.jpg?itok=RoQKWDAr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-curses.jpg?itok=AEaZD9EK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Dungeon Master's Guide 2024</em> Review | Final Thought</h2>

<p>The <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> has managed to completely eclipse it's predecessor and become exactly what this book is meant to be, a guide (and best friend) to the Dungeon Master. Actually playing the game will be on your shoulders to do, but this book offers everything you need to know before become a DM, clear instructions not just how to run a game but the variety of ways a game can be run, and mechanics behind almost everything that your players will interact with in the world.</p>

<p>It's laid out well, features plenty of alternative ways of learning, and is quick to reference those minor details mid-game. This does feel like an upgrade in all ways, while you might not want to pick up the new PHB immediately, the DMG is definitely a must purchase for a DM planning their next session.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raid-shadow-legends-developer-bought-620m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>developer Plarium has been acquired by Swedish entertainment conglomerate Modern Times Group, and the amount for which the studio was acquired may well surprise you.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.mtg.com/press-releases/mtg-acquires-plarium-developer-of-global-1-mobile-rpg-raid-shadow-legends-and-strengthens-mobile-gaming-position/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a press release</a>, MTG (that's Modern Times Group, of course, not&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>) acquired Plarium for a staggering $620 million, of which $20 million will be deferred to 2026.</p>

<p>That goes to show just how huge the mobile gaming business still is (although, of course,&nbsp;<em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>is also available on PC). We're not quite in the realms of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-acquires-zynga-to-strengthen-mobile-gaming-division" rel="nofollow">Take-Two's monumental Zynga acquisition</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized" rel="nofollow">Microsoft's huge Activision Blizzard merger</a>, but $620 million is not to be sniffed at.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/raid-shadow-legends-developer-acquired-combat.jpg?itok=9RDRq_Sp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/raid-shadow-legends-developer-acquired-combat.jpg?itok=62ml8zur 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>is big money, believe it or not.</figcaption></figure><p>The amount for which Plarium was acquired might sound like a lot, but as MTG points out, the studio "generated $613 million in revenues" between September 2023 and September 2024, so the purchase is worth roughly one year of Plarium's revenue.</p>

<p>The group says that Plarium's "tech and deep expertise in live-ops, marketing and monetization" will benefit its "performance over the long term", and that the acquisition will "substantially improve MTG's already strong cash flow generation".</p>

<p>If you're only familiar with&nbsp;<em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>from interstitial ads and sponsorship deals, then you may not know just how big a deal it is, but suffice it to say that the game does pretty well for itself financially.</p>

<p>Back in July 2022, it was revealed that&nbsp;<em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/youtube-meme-raid-shadow-legends-passes-1-billion-milestone" rel="nofollow">passed $1 billion in overall revenue</a>, and while that doesn't quite put it on the level of a mega-hit like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-has-worlds-first-10-billion-dollar-mobile-game" rel="nofollow">Tencent's&nbsp;<em>Honor of Kings</em></a>, those are certainly big-league numbers.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what MTG's acquisition of Plarium yields, but it's unlikely to change the latter's business practices in any meaningful way. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>"Where’s my Neo-Volkite pistol, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>?" was my perhaps slightly ungrateful reaction upon booting the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game up after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-rolls-back-difficulty-changes-that-made-fighting-xenos-intense-and-stressful">the previous patch</a>. "I didn’t even know what a Neo-Volkite pistol was until five minutes ago, but now this whole game is trash until I get one!." As promised in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fair-play-to-saber-space-marine-2s-roadmap-has-all-the-juicy-bits-for-free-although-sprucing-up-your-blueberry-mates-will-cost-you">roadmap</a>, the last big update added a whole new Operations map, complete with a gargantuan new pseudo-boss in the form of a hierophant bio-titan. It did not, however, give me my beloved pistol. It’s fine. It’s in now, along with a few, less Neo-Volkite updates to other weapons.</p>

<p>Patch 4.5 - which you can read about in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4472730495692571054">detail here</a>, if my whimsical summaries aren’t fucking good enough for you - indeed adds the Neo-Volkite pistol. It’s a new sidearm for the Assault, Vanguard, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bulwark">Bulwark</a> classes, and it’s described as "a powerful thermal ray weapon." As per the above trailer, it differentiates itself from other weapons by firing a continuous beam of hot. I’m a big supporter of any gun that makes me press the triggers less, especially if I’m already hammering the parry button like a maniac.</p>
<p>Alongside the pistol, there are also a few tweaks to other weapons. These include:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Plasma Incinerator</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slightly reduced amount of heat generated by normal and charged shots for versions:</li>
</ul>
<p>Master-Crafted - Alpha</p>
<p>Salvation of Bakka - Alpha</p>
<p>Gathalamor Crusade - Alpha</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause several versions not producing heat at all.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bolt Sniper Rifle</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire rate increased from 50 to 60 rounds per minute.</li>
<li>Headshot bonus increased from x2 to x2.5.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Occulus Bolt Carbine</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scope added</li>
<li>Headshot bonus increased from x1 to x1.33</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bolt Carbine (SMG)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted damage falloff curve: Base damage increased by 50% for the first 10 metres, after that, the damage drops to the original pre-patch value.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Auto Bolt Rifle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Max ammo increased by 1 magazine for each version.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also a few bug fixes, but that’s more or less it for this one. We’re still due some new enemies next year, and based on the correct consensus that the brick spongehouses of Tzeentch aren’t all that fun to fight, I very much hope we’ll eventually get some orcs. Space Marine 2 is great, but god knows it could use just a crumb of levity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/slitterhead-creative-director-keiichiro-toyama-muses-on-his-unique-mix-of-influences<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the director behind the original Silent Hill and the Siren series, it's probably not surprising that Keiichiro Toyama's first game from Bokeh Game Studio is a return to horror. Developers striking out to make their own studios have repeatedly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/frost-giant-studios-raises-25-million-for-its-debut-rts">returned to genres</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> they're already known for—sometimes because they were ideas they'd been noodling on before they left.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an interview with Game Developer, Toyama explained he'd been thinking about the concept before his departure from Sony, which followed the closure of Japan Studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet this game about supernatural monsters taking over humans and hiding in plain sight until their grotesque forms burst out from the head to devour their victims' brains is not just a retread of the past. Although </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slitterhead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has you starting off weak and struggling to survive against its horrifying monsters, it quickly unleashes a diverse cast of characters that have the power to not just fight back but actively hunt them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"My original inspiration wasn't to survive the threat of the Slitterheads, but to be able to overpower them with supernatural abilities and skill," Toyama explains. That's revealed early on in the game when, as a mysterious spirit, later referred to as Night Owl, you're able to possess and body-hop between different NPCs but eventually encounter "Rarities," humans who the spirit is able to create a unique bond with and grant their conscious host unique abilities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of his unusual influences, Toyama mentions his affection for seinen manga, in particular Tokyo Ghoul, whose protagonist becomes a half-ghoul who then also must consume human flesh in order to survive. However, the book the concept had sprung from goes further back, Liaozhai Zhiyi's Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, a collection of short stories written between the early 1670s and early 1700s. One of these short stories introduces the Yegouzi, a supernatural creature with the body of a human and the head of a dog that eats human brains. "I had borrowed the idea and thought the contrast of having them disguised as humans in a crowded city would be a good setting for a horror-themed game."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Slitterhead's "><span>Slitterhead's </span>setting is inspired by 90s Hong Kong</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That crowded city in question is Kowlong, a fictional version of Hong Kong, with Kowloon Walled City as its key inspiration. A densely populated urban setting is certainly unexpected given that horror tends to take place in more remote and isolated environments, but it makes sense for a game where players can jump between and control a multitude of hosts where the whole city is essentially able to fight back against the enemy hidden among them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Demolished in the early 1990s, Kowloon Walled City has reached a mythical status over the years, depicted in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shenmue II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the inspiration behind the location in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stray</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It has undoubtedly endured in Toyama's imagination even when he had visited Hong Kong for on-site research. "I had a sense of regret that I wasn't able to see the city as it once was, so the desire to bring this unique setting to life had always been there," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If anything, it's Hong Kong cinema from the 1990s that served even more inspiration, and perhaps why Kowlong also takes its design from the still-present Kowloon City, iconic for its neon signs and high-rises that caused planes to fly over dangerously close during their descent to the old Kai Tak Airport.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Bokeh Game Studio.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Exploring the perpetual night time of Kowlong's chaotic streets, dark alleyways, and seedy underbelly stacked on floors of cramped and rundown housing conjures images of Chungking Mansions depicted in Wong Kar Wai's 1994 film Chungking Express, while the introduction of rarity Alex riding on a motorcycle through a tunnel even feels like a callback to a scene in 1995's Fallen Angels.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet while one might expect Kowlong to be depicted as an open world city, the team was also getting to grips with learning the ins and outs of Unreal, having long been used to working with Sony's proprietary engines. Although many open world games are made with Unreal, a key issue had been with memory due to all the NPCs populated the city. "Due to memory load, we opted for a mission-based structure," says Toyama. "I believe this decision actually allowed us to have more control over the pacing of the game progression."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Reworking past ideas into Slitterhead">Reworking past ideas into Slitterhead</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For all the bold choices </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slitterhead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> opts for, from a diverse ensemble with equally diverse abilities and movesets, such as Tri, an Indian housemaid who fights with oven mitts, or Betty, an old lady evidently named after the late Queen of England, who fights with a cane, there is nonetheless much of the DNA from Toyama's past works the team was able to learn from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The ensemble cast makes it something of a spiritual successor to Siren, including the first game's use of a time-looping structure as the story progresses. The ability to switch between character perspectives through possession is essentially an evolution of that series' sightjacking mechanic, which even has an explicit nod in certain moments when players can sightjack to see from a Slitterhead's point of view in order to track down their location.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet perhaps the most unusual inspiration isn't from horror at all. Toyama says, "The experience with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gravity Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was valuable for this project, as we'd drawn on level design that utilizes verticality, as well as the experience of having numerous interactive NPCs." On reflection, the ability to possess and hop between NPCs in order to reach paths blocked by a fence or up to a rooftop isn't all too dissimilar and unusual as getting around by changing the directional pull of gravity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Bokeh Studio</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This also marks Toyama's reunion with composer Akira Yamaoka since the two were employed by Konami when developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "In both our youths, we went through the process of understanding one another's way of approaching the concept, so this time I had absolutely no concerns for Yamaoka-san, who I know has spent so much time playing through the game to make iterations and worked hard to convey the unique atmosphere of the game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While there's some menacing sound design that will be familiar with Silent Hill's Otherworld, the score regularly shifts in direction, from the adrenaline of rock during exhilarating chase and combat sequences to dreamlike and noirish soundscapes in between missions. That there's also two original Cantopop songs adds to the feeling of being immersed in a Wong Kar Wai film.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Put together, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slitterhead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a radically different creation, showing that while Toyama may be returning to horror, he's not just content with doing what's expected.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Toyama reminds us that through his past works, he's always been consistent when it comes to having a desire and approach to create something unique and unfamiliar. He concludes, "While I do strongly hope that many people can have a chance to play Slitterhead, I hope that people familiar with my work will be able to resonate with that same, distinctive atmosphere we try to convey."</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Brown as the former security guard to a recently murdered American president. This then jarringly shifts into footage of David Schwimmer in January’s <em>Goosebumps</em> movie, <strong><em>The Vanishing</em></strong>. Then, far more excitingly, we get to see some <strong><em>Alien: Earth</em></strong>, the TV series set in the <em>Alien </em>universe, created by my favorite showrunner, Noah Hawley (<em>Bones</em>, <em>Fargo</em>, <em>Legion</em>).</p><p>There’s a new but extremely brief appearance by Marvel series <strong><em>Ironheart</em></strong>, a few seconds of <strong><em>Daredevil</em></strong>, and then, crikey, <strong><em>Chad Powers</em></strong>. This is a new comedy created and written by, and also starring, everyone’s new favorite beefcake, Glen Powell. It’s based on the Eli Manning character from <em>Eli’s Places</em>, and is about a college quarterback who loses his place on his team due to bad behavior, so creates an alter-ego, Chad Powers, disguises himself, and joins a struggling Southern team. Even weirder is how much the disguised Powell looks like Parker from <em>Gold Rush</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="7d5055061bd65bd6954703e9113b8eb1" data-recommend-id="image://7d5055061bd65bd6954703e9113b8eb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="850" data-height="478" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chad Powers and Parker from Gold Rush." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chad Powers and Parker from Gold Rush." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Discovery / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7d5055061bd65bd6954703e9113b8eb1" data-recommend-id="image://7d5055061bd65bd6954703e9113b8eb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="850" data-height="478" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chad Powers and Parker from Gold Rush." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a moment of a new show that has no online presence called <strong><em>Good American Family</em></strong>, that looks all sorts of weird, and then, finally, the one we’re waiting for, <strong><em>Andor</em></strong><em>.</em></p><p>It’s just 11 seconds, but we get to see once again what makes <em>Andor</em> stand out from so many of Disney’s TV shows—it’s shot on huge sets, and not a Volume stage. There’s big, open spaces! There are Stormtroopers! There are people telling Andor he needs to be a leader now, which he really obviously won’t want to be. There’s very little more to glean from it for an amateur like me, but you know the pros will be poring over this for every hidden detail. Here’s the section clipped out:</p><p>Oh, and after <em>Andor </em>we see some <em><strong>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</strong></em> season two, like anyone was still noticing.</p><p>So, get speculating.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Rockstar has at last updated the PC, PlayStation and Xbox versions of its classic GTA Trilogy to receive the same improvements already found in its mobile port. 
</p>
<p>
GTA Trilogy originally launched for PC and consoles exactly three years ago to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-inundated-with-refund-requests-as-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-backlash-intensifies">decidedly negative reception</a> due to its various graphical issues and glitches, prompting a sarcastic response from the port's original development studio and an apology from Rockstar itself. 
</p>
<p>
Now, three years later, improvements already found in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-tested-on-iphone">GTA Trilogy's warmly-received smartphone version</a> - launched via <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> - can finally be found elsewhere. Most notably, this includes the trilogy's Classic Lighting mode, which restores the brighter and more colourful vibes of the games' original versions.

<p>
As <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/gta-trilogy-remasters-get-big-new-update-three-years-after-release/">RockstarIntel</a> notes, you can find the Classic Lighting option now in each games' pause menu - though, somewhat tellingly, the feature has been enabled by default. Other additions include character model improvements, plus visual improvements for heat haze and ambient clouds.
</p><p>
GTA Trilogy's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-inundated-with-refund-requests-as-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-backlash-intensifies">disastrous launch sparked countless refund requests</a> as the game arrived in a buggy state. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-says-it-pulled-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-from-sale-on-pc-to-remove-files-unintentionally-included">Rockstar quickly pulled the game offline</a> for three days, albeit with different concerns - apparently to scrub the inclusion of unlicensed music within the game's files, as well as files with developer comments and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-discover-hot-coffee-code-in-gta-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition">the infamous Hot Coffee sex mini-game</a>.
</p>
<p>"There are a lot of problems here," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-grand-theft-auto-3-definitive-edition-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">Digital Foundry wrote of the GTA Trilogy</a> upon the package's original launch, "issues that are so blatant and jarring and ridiculous, it's hard to understand how the game made its way through quality control."</p>
<p>Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-apologises-for-gta-trilogy-definitive-editions-unexpected-issues-re-lists-classic-versions-for-pc">apologised</a>, offered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pc-owners-of-the-gta-trilogy-remaster-can-claim-an-extra-game-for-free">free Rockstar game</a> for PC owners, and began providing patches. But problems persisted - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-released-on-steam-in-sorry-state">GTA Trilogy's Steam launch in January 2023 drew similar complaints</a> over its poor quality. Here's hoping now, finally, Rockstar has provided.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA has prepared several announcements for today, starting with the release of a new GeForce Game Ready driver optimized for next week's big releases: STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.</p>
<p>The two games will be released on November 20 and November 19, respectively, and both will support NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will also include NVIDIA DLAA and ray traced shadows to maximize visual fidelity.</p>
<p>Gamers can also enable DLSS Super Resolution or DLAA in Giants Software's Farming Simulator 25, which launches today. Moreover, the fast-paced multiplayer melee action game Mortal Rite <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1655990/Mortal_Rite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on Steam Early Access last week with support for DLSS Super Resolution.</p>
<p>NVIDIA had a marketing announcement to make, too. Starting today, users can get the<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-bundles-indiana-jones-the-great-circle-with-geforce-rtx-40-gpus-full-path-tracing-dlss-3-5-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle GeForce RTX 40 Series Bundle</a>. They will receive the game's Digital Premium Edition (regularly priced at $99.99 value) with the purchase at select retailers of a qualifying GeForce RTX 4090, 4080 SUPER, 4080, 4070 Ti SUPER, 4070 Ti, 4070 SUPER or 4070 desktop or graphics card, or a laptop with a GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU, RTX 4080 Laptop GPU, RTX 4070 Laptop GPU. On top of that, the Digital Premium Edition will allow early access to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on December 6, three days before the official release date of December 9.</p>
<p>Circling back to the new GeForce Game Ready driver, it also adds support for one-click optimization of the following games: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Delta Force, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and Red Dead Redemption. One-click optimization can be performed via GeForce Experience or the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rip-geforce-experience-nvidia-app-to-take-over-year-end/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new NVIDIA app</a>, which launches out of beta today. According to NVIDIA, the app installs in half the time compared to GeForce Experience, uses 17% less disk space, and has a modernized UI that is 50% more responsive.</p>
<p>Users can access various functionalities and even install applications like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-upgrades-geforce-now-middle-tier-but-introduces-100-hour-monthly-playtime-cap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce NOW</a> to play games via cloud, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-broadcast-engine-brings-ai-enhancements-to-livestreams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Broadcast</a> to improve their&nbsp;<span>live streams,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-canvas-ai-app-to-turn-doodles-into-photorealistic-renderings-is-now-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canvas</a>&nbsp;to turn basic brushstrokes into realistic landscape pictures,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-image-scaling-best-in-class-upscaler-and-icat-iq-comparison-tool-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICAT</a>&nbsp;to create image or video comparisons,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-frameview-benchmarking-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FrameView</a> to measure game performance</span>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-chatrtx-improved-llm-support-image-search-speech-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatRTX</a> to add a personalized GPT LLM chatbot hosted locally, or <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction-rtx-remix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Remix</a> to remaster classic PC games. Remaining options from the classic Control Panel, such as Surround, Multiple Display mode, and Video Color settings, will be added in future updates alongside further updates and enhancements.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/antstream-net-yaroze-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/retro-streaming-platform-antstream-adds-five-net-yaroze-games-to-its-lineup.1033521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/antstream-net-yaroze-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Retro arcade streaming platform Antstream has announced that it has added five games from the cult classic PlayStation-era&nbsp;Net Yaroze<em>&nbsp;</em>initiative to its game catalog.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;Net Yaroze, it was essentially an early way of allowing bedroom developers to create games for the original PlayStation without needing to utilize "expensive and complex development kits", as a press release notes.</p>

<p>Those who were interested in&nbsp;Net Yaroze<em>&nbsp;</em>would have to pay a fee in order to receive a special PlayStation console, alongside software designed to help them realize their game creation dreams. They'd also gain access to technical help from Sony and a community of fellow&nbsp;Net Yaroze<em>&nbsp;</em>developers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/net-yaroze-antstream-announcement-arena.jpg?itok=UH5cPff5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/net-yaroze-antstream-announcement-arena.jpg?itok=UPFoQBQb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Net Yaroze allowed bedroom programmers to make their own games, such as the mech shooter&nbsp;<em>Arena</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As an accompanying Antstream press release notes, these games weren't released commercially, and many of them are now considered to be lost since they haven't been made available in any shape or form since the late 90s.</p>

<p>Now, however, the streaming service has added five Net Yaroze games to its library, and Antstream CEO Steve Cottam says the service will "continue working with these fantastic creators and developers to continue to bring new titles to the Antstream platform", so more may well be on the way.</p>

<p>Here are the five Net Yaroze games that have been made available on Antstream.</p>

<ul><li><em>Time Slip&nbsp;</em>(puzzle-platformer in which you must manipulate time to clear stages)</li>
	<li><i>Pushy IIb&nbsp;</i>(block-pushing puzzler)</li>
	<li><em>Bouncer 2&nbsp;</em>(brick-breaking arcade-style game with "difficult physics-based challenges")</li>
	<li><em>Adventure Game&nbsp;</em>(exploration-heavy action RPG with dungeons, puzzles, and monsters to fight)</li>
	<li><em>Arena&nbsp;</em>(fast-paced mech shooter with a focus on multiplayer)</li>
</ul>


<p>The Net Yaroze initiative is far from the only element of old-school gaming to be threatened by the march of time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In recent years, enthusiastic fans have intervened to preserve the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/viva-pinata-pocket-paradise-prototype-preserved-by-forest-of-illusion" rel="nofollow">a prototype of DS game&nbsp;<em>Viva Pinata: Pocket Paradise</em></a>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/toontown-online-preserved-in-massive-preservation-effort" rel="nofollow">Disney MMO&nbsp;<em>Toowntown Online</em></a>, and even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-wordle-launched-to-preserve-wordle-if-paywall-goes-up" rel="nofollow">the word game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-wordle-launched-to-preserve-wordle-if-paywall-goes-up" rel="nofollow">Wordle</a>&nbsp;</em>(following on from its purchase by the New York Times).</p>

            <p>My strongest and most enduring memory of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-definitive-edition">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</a>. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a semicolon and a dash in the same game name.</p>
<p>If you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.</p>

<p>As reported by<a href="https://rockstarintel.com/gta-trilogy-remasters-get-big-new-update-three-years-after-release/"> Rockstar Intel</a>, the ‘Classic Lightning’ mode was a feature added last year when Rockstar released the Definitive Edition games on mobile in partnership with Netflix. The mode - which is now available in all versions as an toggleable graphics menu option - apparently “restores the look and feel of the sky in the original games”.</p><p>I can’t confirm this, but according to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-has-been-updated-on-pc-and-consoles-with-all-the-improvements-from-the-mobile-versions.1033440/">this Resetera thread</a>, the new update has also removed remaster-ers Grove Street Games from the splash screen, which seems incredibly gross and petty, whatever your thoughts on the quality of the release. Take-Two gonna Take-Two, I guess.</p>
<p>In other news Grandiose, Theftacular, and Automatic, Take Two are currently "highly confident" about a fall 2025 release date. That’s ‘Autumn’, for those of you who don’t break down in histrionic convulsions upon seeing a photograph of some beans on a bit of toasted bread.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>BLEED Esports’ leadership team has come under fire once again for reportedly failing to pay players and staff. It has been claimed that for more than a year, the organisation has been lying to <strong>all of their players</strong> across multiple games, withholding salaries, and refusing to pay out tournament winnings.</p>



<p>In a straw-that-broke-the-camel’s-back move, the BLEED Esports Rainbow Six roster has pulled away from the organisation following a month of negotiation and communications with Ubisoft, and the players are now on an exposé mission.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-if-it-bleeds">If It BLEEDs</h2>



<p>The situation with BLEED Esports reached a tipping point when Patrick ‘MentalistC’ Fan, the R6 squad’s IGL, took to social media to slam BLEED’s leadership:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For the past year, BLEED has been lying to all of their players (Valorant, CS2, R6, OW, MLBB, Dota 2…) about payments, failing to pay salaries, making false promises, and withholding prize pools. They only ever provided us payslips with no proof of actual funds, a tactic they used to fool other organisations into thinking that they paid the buyouts of players.</p>



<p>For the past month, we have been consistently and clearly communicating with Ubisoft, pleading our case. We have clearly communicated with Ubisoft that:</p>



<p>BLEED has been ghosting us, having zero intention to cure their contract breach.</p>



<p>BLEED has been full of lies and false promises, and their words cannot be trusted.</p>



<p>As of the writing of this letter, our contract breach notice to BLEED has taken effect. We can now terminate our contracts with BLEED. We are awaiting Ubisoft’s final decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>MentalistC’s Twitter bio now marks him as a player for ‘NOTPAID R6S’, but moving forward, the roster will play under the name ‘BLED’. </p>



<p>He was backed up by other players, such as Taylor ‘Terdsta’ Ching, who claimed BLEED owed him a whopping $35,000. He insisted that he would be unable to pay his bills or even feed himself if it wasn’t for other avenues of income, like streaming.</p>



<p>In the wake of his scandal, seven members of BLEED (including a coach and an analyst) have vacated their Rainbow Six positions. One Counter-Strike coach claimed that BLEED has racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt in the CS world. This allegation came from Aleksandar ‘kassad’ Trifunovic, who claimed that <a href="https://x.com/kassad/status/1856281399617106130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BLEED’s CEO is actively ghosting</a> the situation and is fully aware of what’s happening.</p>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/r6/news/63631-bleed-r6-players-depart-the-organization-they-only-ever-provided-us-payslips-with-no-proof-of-actual-funds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EscoreNews</a> for the references.</em></p>



<p>The CEO, Mervyn Goh, has been scrutinised by fans and critics for the longest time. The bad press surrounding Goh is often insurmountable. In 2022, he allegedly beat a woman at a nightclub, and in 2023, it was claimed that the Singaporean government struck BLEED Esports from the registry.</p>



<p>If you <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/R6ProLeague/comments/1g297l4/a_deeper_dive_into_the_allegations_about_mervyn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dive deeper into the topic</a>, you start to uncover references to ‘Mervyn Goh En Wei’ being embroiled in a vast array of legal issues.</p>



<p>Presently, nobody has been able to reach the CEO for a statement.</p>



<p>What do you think about this situation? If you’ve got anything to share, feel free to make a note in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5&nbsp;</em>director Hideaki Itsuno has signed up with the newly-formed Japanese contingent of the Tencent-owned LightSpeed Studios, where he'll be creating "original AAA action game titles".</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.lightspeed-studios.com/news/Japan-Game-Development-Studio.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post on the Lightspeed website</a>, Itsuno will head up the appropriately-named LightSpeed Japan Studio, which marks "a major step in LightSpeed Studios' global expansion".</p>

<p>Itsuno describes his appointment as "an exciting new chapter for me", promising to create "aesthetic and innovative experiences for the global player community" and exhorting talented developers from around the world to "join [his team's] vision".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-hideaki-itsuno.jpg?itok=aN4GiMW0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-hideaki-itsuno.jpg?itok=yKdR8YhI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hideaki Itsuno is perhaps best-known for his work on&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma</em>&nbsp;and its sequel.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the aforementioned announcement post, LightSpeed Japan Studio will consist of two locations in Tokyo and Osaka, and it "offers a flexible and inclusive work environment".</p>

<p>If you're wondering where you've heard LightSpeed's name before, it's the co-developer of mobile smash hit&nbsp;<em>PUBG Mobile</em>&nbsp;(alongside Krafton, which is apparently also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">currently working on a mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em></a>).</p>

<p>Despite LightSpeed's best-known game being a mobile title, the fact Itsuno and Japan Studio will be working on "AAA action game titles" suggests that he'll be primarily working within the PC and console spaces.</p>

<p>Of course, we're still very early on in Itsuno's appointment and the lifespan of Japan Studio, so we'll have to wait and see exactly what he and his team cook up in future.</p>

<p>The BLAST R6 Major Montreal tournament is unfolding as we speak, and this weekend, it’ll wrap as the action moves away from ‘Phase Two’ into ‘Phase Three’. Presently, the sixteen teams that made it into the Swiss System portion of the $750,000 tournament are battling away, but in just a few days, the victor will be crowned.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the tournament isn’t having as strong an impact as the last BLAST R6 Major, which took place in Manchester, England. Per a report published by Esports Charts, Montreal’s opening days pulled in 36% fewer viewers than the May Major, and things are yet to improve.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-weaker-traction">Weaker Traction</h2>



<p>Despite the tournament being days away from ending, the viewer count hasn’t risen all that sharply. On the first day of the tournament, per Esports Charts, the Montreal Major’s viewership peaked at 55,000 users. By today, that number has managed to climb to 78,000, but the Manchester Major’s peak hit 162,000 viewers.</p>



<p>It was the most popular BLAST R6 Major ever – but it was admittedly helped by an intense grand final between Team BDS, the tournament’s favourite to win, and beastcoast, an underdog side on a tenacious streak.</p>



<p>In the report published <a href="https://escharts.com/news/r6-montreal-major-day-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Esports Charts</a>, it was mentioned that fewer co-casters were covering the action at Montreal, which might go some way towards explaining the lower viewership, but we’re talking a single-digit difference. There’s still a solid spread of teams present at the event, from FaZe Clan to Team Liquid, so the fans <strong>should </strong>be eagerly tuning into the action.</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see how things pick up going into the weekend. The grand final for the BLAST R6 Major Montreal is set to take place this Sunday, and it’ll hopefully be the biggest and most popular match of the event.</p>

<p>A God Pack is a set of opened cards that almost have to be seen to be believed in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket. Every man and his Growlithe are desperate to secure this most sacred of packs, and if you’re a regular Pokémon&nbsp;Pocket player with no idea what I’m talking about, here’s some quick background on a God Pack.</p>



<p>The Genetic Apex set kicked off Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket at launch. The collection features an array of super-special pulls, and the contents of each Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket pack boil down to pure luck and RNG—there are no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-bent-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bent Pack Tricks</a> or secret <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-exploit-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Pick exploits</a> here.</p>



<p>This being said, if luck is on your side, there’s a slim chance you can pull a God Pack—and immortalize yourself in the annals of Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket history.</p>



<h2 id="h-god-pack-explained-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">God Pack explained in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We can all dream. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A God Pack is when every card in a Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket pack is either a Holographic, EX, Full Art, or Gold Crown</strong> <strong>card</strong>.</p>



<p>Ordinarily, you’re hoping for at least one of the above in each pack: Or two at a push! As of writing, the closest I’ve come to a God Pack is two occasions where I’ve had two different Full Art cards in the same pack.</p>



<p>Now, there’s a chance you dear reader haven’t even had two in a pack (don’t envy me, I’ve had plenty of stinkers too), but this is nothing compared to some of the obscene Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket pulls out there. Trickery and clever photo and video editing are part and parcel of the modern age, so not all “God Packs” are to be believed. However, a quick search of “God Pack” on either X or the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/hot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TCG Pocket subreddit</a> is guaranteed to leave your jaw on the floor.</p>



<p>I’ve seen multiple packs featuring <strong>five Full Arts</strong>, and it’s absurd. The lowest pull percentage for a Full Art is <strong>5.263%</strong>—according to Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s Offering Rates—and it boggles the mind how it’s possible to get two, let alone <em>five</em>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-a-god-pack-in-pokemon-nbsp-tcg-pocket">How to get a God Pack in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket</h2>



<p><strong>You must get extremely lucky to get a God Pack in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket as it’s a completely luck-based process.</strong></p>



<p>There are no special items to use, no one-time-use percentage boosters, and no superstitions in the world that can boost your odds of getting a God Pack. Like any gacha-based system, Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s packs harness the concept of chance, inevitably leading to a ton of duplicates and disappointments once you begin to fill your compendium of creatures.</p>

At least, that’s how it’s meant to be played. Not for one determined pacifist, however, who has managed to Prestige without killing a single player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Redditor Pilgore revealed his in-game stats after reaching Prestige 1, confirming a remarkable 0.00 K/D after 111 games, or 19 hours and 26 minutes of Multiplayer. That means he managed to gain enough experience to level up past 55 and trigger Prestige despite having zero kills. Perhaps even more remarkable, Pilgore achieved the feat with a 1.92 win ratio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How did Pilgore manage it? Why do this in the first place? And where does he go from here? IGN interviewed Pilgore, real name John, to find out, and obtained permission to publish one of his matches on the Nuketown map to show off his impressive pacifist tactics. Check it out in the video below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Pilgore employs a combination of playing the objective (I know, rare for Call of Duty!), and using the Spy Cam Tactical equipment and Scrambler Field Upgrade to gain score during the match, then calls in the UAV, CUAV, and HARP scorestreaks as they become available. Pilgore also shoots down any enemy scorestreaks as soon as they come in. Pilgore does not shoot at enemy players at any point; rather, he plays Call of Duty like the most useful support class you could ever want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you'd expect, Pilgore has many more victories in objective-based modes such as Hardpoint and Domination than K/D-focused modes such as Team Deathmatch and Kill Confirmed. And if you’re interested in Pilgore1’s Perks, he uses Flak Jacket, Gearhead, and Dispatcher to trigger Strategist, with the Tactical Expert wildcard granting an extra Tactical. "Four Spy Cams can genuinely get you UAV/CUAV on its own," he said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why bother playing Call of Duty as a pacifist? It turns out Pilgore has done this before with previous Call of Duty games, joking with a friend that he could Prestige before him even if he got zero kills on Black Ops Cold War. “I enjoyed playing that way so I just kept on going,” Pilgore said. He managed to hit Prestige 15 on Cold War, 10 on Vanguard and Modern Warfare 2, and 15 on last year’s Modern Warfare 3 playing this way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s one hell of an achievement and shows incredible focus and discipline, but one thing that bothers me about all this is how Pilgore was able to avoid killing an enemy player just once, even accidentally. I play a lot of Call of Duty and I’ve often killed enemy players by mistake, simply by either pressing the wrong button at the wrong time, or having a rocket intended for a scorestreak blow up an enemy player who just happened to get in my way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was definitely risky at the start (previous games) and I got lucky a few times,” Pilgore explained. “I'd throw a Decoy grenade and it would sometimes hit somebody, luckily, it never got me a kill (yet). I've gotten much better at being careful after doing this for 51 Prestiges now.

This license over product argument will likely be at the crux of Ubisoft's defence.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You never knew that the manufacturer could come in one day, and, without your control, leave you with a skeleton of what you thought you paid for.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Imagine you buy a pinball machine, and years later, you enter your den to go play it, only to discover that the all the paddles are missing, the pinball and bumpers are gone, and the monitor that proudly displayed your unassailable high score is removed," the lawsuit reads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Turns out the pinball machine manufacturer decided to come into your home, gut the insides of the pinball machine, and remove your ability to play the game that you bought and thought you owned.

			<p>The controversial GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition, which includes the first three 3D entries in the series, was patched today on PC and consoles to bring over a highly requested change and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://rockstarintel.com/gta-trilogy-remasters-get-big-new-update-three-years-after-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The patch</a>, which is now live on all PC storefronts, Xbox, and PlayStation, introduces the Classic Lighting Mode introduced in the mobile version of the collection last year. This mode restores the look and feel of the sky of the original games. To better highlight the differences between the vanilla lighting and the Classic Lighting Mode, Rockstar Games shared some comparison screenshots taken from the PC versions of all three games at maxed-out settings. You can check them out below.</p>

<p>Having not been updated in a long time, it seemed like Rockstar Games was done with the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition patches, but thankfully, that was not the case, as the new Lighting Mode is a considerable improvement over the vanilla lighting. Some lingering issues still remain, but there's no doubt the remasters are in a much better state now than they were at release. You can learn more about these issues by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">launch review.</a></p>
<p>GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android devices.</p>
