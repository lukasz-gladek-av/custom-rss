			<p>There's little doubt that CAPCOM crafted a successful roadmap of releases for its Resident Evil franchise, expertly alternating some of the most requested remakes of classic titles with brand new entries.</p>



<p>Following the gamble (won) of <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and its first-person view, CAPCOM dropped the remakes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3</a> in consecutive years (2019-2020). The first one enjoyed universal acclaim and record-breaking sales, eventually becoming the best-selling game in the franchise (and CAPCOM's third best-selling game of all time after Monster Hunter World and Rise) with 16.30 million units, as last reported by the publisher. Resident Evil 3 was received slightly worse, with criticism focusing on its short length, the omission of content from the original, and the scripted set pieces. Even so, the game recently cracked CAPCOM's Top 10 best-selling chart, having sold 10.30 million units at the last update.</p>



<p>The studio then launched another new entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Village</a>, in May 2021, concluding the narrative of RE7. This one fell somewhere in the middle between the remakes of 2 and 3 in terms of reception and sales. According to CAPCOM's latest financial report, Village has sold 12.30 million units to date. </p>



<p>Two years later, the Japanese developer released the remake of the most acclaimed installment in the whole series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 4</a>. It was another success on the level of the remake of RE2, earning awards and becoming the fastest-selling game in the series. <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-breaks-10-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It broke the 10 million units milestone this April</a> and yet CAPCOM reported that it's already at 11.10 million units now. At this rate, it should easily overtake Village over time.</p>



<p>All eyes are rightfully on Resident Evil Requiem right now, as the ninth chapter in the mainline series is less than two and a half months away from launch. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TGA 2025 confirmation</a> that Leon would be a playable character, roughly splitting the game with the other protagonist, Grace, further excited fans.</p>



<p>But CAPCOM is already working on the next remakes, in its bid to keep a constant stream of Resident Evil releases. The community has long requested a remake of Code Veronica, which was originally a Dreamcast exclusive. Three years ago, CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-remake-is-a-maybe-given-the-opportunity-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that it may be considered, given the opportunity. </p>



<p>Last year, CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-zero-code-veronica-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told fans</a> that the developers were crafting not only a Code Veronica remake, but also a Resident Evil Zero remake. IGN quickly corroborated the story. Now, Dusk Golem, fresh from the victory of being vindicated for the long-time prediction of Leon as a playable character in Requiem, has <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1999738896800973030#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> on the status of both remakes. Code Veronica is expected to be announced next year for a planned 2027 launch, whereas Zero is scheduled to release in 2028 (and will presumably be announced in 2027). This would follow a similar output to the RE2 and 3 remake, which were released in quick succession.</p>



<p>In Code Veronica, the narrative unfolds three months after the events of Resident Evil 2, following the sibling protagonists, Claire and Chris Redfield, as they try to survive a viral outbreak at a remote prison island in the Southern Ocean and a research facility in Antarctica. Resident Evil Zero, on the other hand, is chronologically the earliest game in the series, being a prequel to the first installment. In this game, the player switches between two characters, S.T.A.R.S. officer Rebecca Chambers and convict Billy Coen, as they explore an abandoned training facility for employees of the pharmaceutical company Umbrella, located on the outskirts of Raccoon City.</p>

A release date for Early Access was not announced. <span id="more-1015200"></span></p><p>“We want to create a game that evolves thanks to those who play it,” said The Breach Studios CEO Ferran Punti in a press release. “Kickstarter and Early Access will allow us to work hand in hand with motivated, invested, and passionate players. We will carefully listen to this community, which shares our love of rich and satisfying game mechanics, to tune and perfect the experience before the console release. That is why choosing to work with Radical Theory as a strategic partner felt natural as they understand and support studios through their experience, deep expertise, and genuine transparency.”</p><p>Radical Theory CEO Luc Heninger added, “It is a real pleasure to collaborate with the team at The Breach Studios – developers who are as passionate as they are friendly and talented. <em>Westlanders</em> won us over in the first few minutes of gameplay, as the Western setting is still rarely explored in the survival-crafting genre. We have a true sandbox experience here that will allow players from all backgrounds to experiment with rich, deep mechanics. The idea is to have a blast with friends, as we want players to dive into building, fighting, and resource management in co-op as quickly as possible.”</p><div id="carousel_1015208"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Radical Theory:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Forge your legacy in the Westlands.</p><p>Survive a wild-west open-world teeming with riches and fraught with perils. Alone or with your friends, brave unforgiving landscapes and conquer the wilds from your customizable mobile base: The Wagon.</p><p>But don’t just survive; thrive. Lay the foundations for bustling outposts and settlements, recruit loyal companions, and weave a powerful economic network to tame the wilderness and build your legacy.</p><p><strong>Welcome to the Westlands</strong></p><p>“Our dream was simple. Make the trip to the Westlands and find a place to call home. A land of peace and prosperity where we could raise a place to call our own from dust. We saw it in every sun-drenched clearing, in every vast, untamed vista. But this land gives with one hand and takes with the other. After all this journey, all these perils, the outlaws came in like a storm in the dead of night, leaving only fire, ashes, and a single survivor. Me.</p><p>“Now, the dream of my companions is my mission. Their legacy, my burden. I’ll forge here our future—this place we’ll call home.”</p><p>—Westlands, unknown date, from the Survivor’s journal.</p><p><strong>A Solo and Cooperative Survival Journey in a Far West Setting</strong></p><p>Imagine the rich, atmospheric Wild West open reminiscent of The Revenant, where you craft your own story.

Explore, fight, gather resources, craft tools, climb skill trees, and build a network of settlements to bring prosperity to the Valley.</p><p><strong>Explore the Lands on Your Mobile Base: The Wagon</strong></p><p>Within minutes of starting the game, you’ll be repairing your wagon and setting off on the open road. The concept of a horse-drawn mobile base of operations is what truly sets our game apart. We wanted to eliminate the frustration common in traditional <a title="Genres > Survival [497 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival games</a>, where exploration is limited by small inventories and base-building comes too late. In <em>Westlanders</em>, you’ll dive straight into the Wild West aboard your own custom wagon. More than just transportation, your wagon is your home, your workshop, and your progression hub. Explore a vast, untamed world without constraints. Upgrade and expand your mobile camp with new tools and countless enhancements to conquer the wilderness.</p><p><strong>Build Outposts, Recruit Citizens, Create a Full Economy</strong></p><p>Your journey isn’t just about discovery; it’s shaped by your choices. Scout the perfect location to establish your base camp, a place where you can harness the land’s riches while living in harmony with nature.</p><p>From a humble camp, you can grow into a thriving settlement, pushing your reach further.

To create games that awake that sense of immersion, thrill and discovery that we believe videogames convey in a unique way. It is with this spirit we’ve created <em>Westlanders</em>. We are fans of survival, exploration, crafting and management titles. We love games like <em>ARK</em>, <em><a title="Games > Valheim [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a></em>, <em>Palworld</em>, <em><a title="Games > Factorio [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a></em>, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [363 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative games</a>… and we like Westerns since we’re kids. We’ve of course played too much of <em><a title="Games > Red Dead Redemption [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> series, and we wanted to see what could happen if we combined <em>ARK</em> with the mood of <em>Red Dead</em>—this is how <em>Westlanders</em> is born.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement teaser trailer below.

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#918)—Clues and Answers for Monday, December 15]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-15-918/</link>
            <guid>1383190</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re halfway through December (almost), and the festive window is rapidly drawing nearer. Before it gets here, you’ve got a couple of weeks of NYT Connections puzzles to solve. Fortunately, I’m on hand to give you the answers you need! Below, you’ll find the latest NYT Connections hints to crack today’s puzzle as quickly as possible.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-15">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 15)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #918:</p>



<ul>
<li>FINAL</li>



<li>BUMPER</li>



<li>QUALIFIER</li>



<li>GIANT</li>



<li>QUARTER</li>



<li>MONSTER</li>



<li>SEMI</li>



<li>TITANIC</li>



<li>DIVE</li>



<li>CELSIUS</li>



<li>DUMP</li>



<li>COLD</li>



<li>HOLE</li>



<li>ONE HUNDRED</li>



<li>JOINT</li>



<li>SEE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of the stages you pass through before a champion is crowned</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Words you’d use to describe something so big it feels exaggerated</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Places you might warn a friend not to hang out in</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Different contexts where the single letter “C” takes on a specific meaning</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 15:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-15-918">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 15 (#918)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– FINAL, QUALIFIER, QUARTER, SEMI</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BUMPER, GIANT, MONSTER, TITANIC</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – DIVE, DUMP, HOLE, JOINT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> -CELSIUS, COLD, ONE HUNDRED, SEE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When is the ARC Raiders Cold Snap Update Coming Out?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-release-time/</link>
            <guid>1383184</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is set to receive a major update this week, with Embark Studios pushing Cold Snap to all platforms. It’s one of the biggest updates to launch since the game was released on October 30, and it’s set to introduce new map conditions, quests, and a fresh weather system.</p>



<p>Fans are excited, but when is Cold Snap being released in ARC Raiders? Find out everything you need to know about this update below.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-cold-snap-being-released">When is Cold Snap Being Released?</h2>



<p>Cold Snap will be released on December 16th, most likely at 04:30 AM EST. While we know the update is being released on December 16th, Embark Studios has yet to confirm the specific time that the update goes live. However, if it mirrors the launch of North Line on November 13th, it’ll drop at 04:30 AM EST (09:30 AM GMT).</p>



<p>This is the most anticipated update to hit ARC Raiders since the North Line update introduced Stella Montis just over a month ago. While no new maps are being added in Cold Snap, fresh map conditions are coming to blanket the game in snow, altering the landscape.</p>



<p>The Flickering Flames event will also be added to ARC Raiders with this update. Again, not much is known about this event, but it’s widely assumed it’ll be a harsh change that causes players to take damage if they’re stranded outside in snowy conditions. It should function similarly to the other map conditions we already have, like Lush Blooms, Harvester, and Prospecting Probes.</p>



<p>Cold Snap will be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on December 16th. Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re excited to explore ARC Raiders in the snow.</p>

<p>Bethesda Game Studios has invested significant resources into Fallout Shelter, the popular mobile game that has since expanded to multiple platforms, boasting over 250 million downloads as of 2025. The staggering update has introduced a wealth of new content into the game, particularly on Steam, with new quests, characters, themes, and more being added in one comprehensive update.</p>



<p>The supersized update also introduces the first of many Fallout Shelter Seasons, new limited-time events that populate the game with new experiences, exclusive rewards, and a spin-wheel mechanic.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-shelter-is-still-giving-a-decade-later">Fallout Shelter is Still Giving, a Decade Later</h2>



<p>Fallout Shelter is a phenomenal mobile-first title for Fallout fans everywhere. It dropped before the launch of Fallout 4 in 2015 and has remained a staple of the series ever since. In Fallout Shelter, players are charged with building and managing their own vault, embarking on missions into the wasteland, levelling up vault dwellers, and repopulating a fractured planet.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588430/view/514102575975368959">blog post on Steam</a>, the team at Bethesda Game Studios revealed that the <strong>largest update yet </strong>has arrived in Fallout Shelter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Rejoice, Overseers – Fallout Shelter’s biggest update yet is here! Years of content previously only available on mobile is now available on Steam, including new questlines, characters, weapons, themes, and more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This atomic update includes the first Fallout Shelter Season, dubbed ‘Viva New Vegas’ in tribute to the second season of the Fallout television series. It also adds a new questline that mirrors the show perfectly, named Power Struggle. It features all the main characters of the show and boasts <strong>eight </strong>linear quests.</p>



<p>Fans of the show can even unlock CX404, the adorable pup adopted by The Ghoul, as a vault pet.</p>







<p>Are you still playing Fallout Shelter after all these years? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re excited about this content update.</p>

<p>Digital Eclipse and Atari confirm you'll need to "download" it</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="4cfdac97e000f"><a title="Mortal Kombat" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4cfdac97e000f/mortal-kombat.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: via Nintendo / Digital Eclipse, Atari</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you ended up getting the physical version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> for the Switch or Switch 2 last week, we've got some news you might not be too happy about.</p>
<p>Since its arrival in stores, Mortal Kombat fans have discovered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mortal_kombat_4">Mortal Kombat 4</a> is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1pkvcto/bad_news_about_the_switch_1_2_physical_versions/">not included on the Legacy Kollection's game card</a>. Digital Eclipse has confirmed this in <a href="https://x.com/DigitalEclipse/status/1999234250332131659">multiple replies</a> on social media – explaining how this build had to be submitted "far in advance" and MK4 was "just not ready", so it's been <a href="https://x.com/DigitalEclipse/status/1999534794082828309">made available as "downloadable content"</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Xs2kwn_IQEU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xs2kwn_IQEU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytXs2kwn_IQEU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xs2kwn_IQEU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xs2kwn_IQEU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed64676ayrhnwu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Digital Eclipse:</strong> "MK4 did not make it to the Switch cart in time for physical release. The Switch build had to be submitted for production far in advance of the release date, and MK4 was just not ready. All other platforms have MK4 included."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure data-uuid="eb083a66a9225"><a title="Mortal Kombat - Digital Eclipse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eb083a66a9225/mortal-kombat-digital-eclipse.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<figure data-uuid="31dd1208de183"><a title="Digital Eclipse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/31dd1208de183/digital-eclipse.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the <a href="https://atari.com/products/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-deluxe-edition?variant=45781778137253">official Atari website</a>, where you can purchase a physical copy of the Legacy Kollection, the page for this title has now been updated with a notice about a download adding Mortal Kombat 4 to the Switch versions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Atari:</strong> Nintendo Switch Users - In order to fully enjoy Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection we encourage you to connect your Switch console to the Nintendo store and download our post release patches, which add additional content, including MK4, and performance improvements."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo Life has access to a physical Switch 2 cartridge of the Kollection, which runs on Version 1.0.1 out of the box and it <a href="https://x.com/DigitalEclipse/status/1999505589798322671">requires users to perform a day one update</a> to access Mortal Kombat 4 and the rest of the game.</p>
<p>This again follows Digital Eclipse informing Switch and Switch 2 fans the experience would be on the game cartridge:</p>
<figure data-uuid="27bb5ece85368"><a title="Digital Eclipse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27bb5ece85368/digital-eclipse.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Digital Eclipse has also confirmed this only impacts the Nintendo versions of the game. The PlayStation 5 physical release contains <a href="https://x.com/DigitalEclipse/status/1999517869667741902">every game in the Kollection on the disc</a>. It also says if <a href="https://x.com/DigitalEclipse/status/1999642095431147587">a future cartridge reprint happens</a> for Switch platforms, it will supposedly include Mortal Kombat 4.</p>
<p>If there are any significant developments regarding the Legacy Kollection's physical release, we'll provide an update.</p>

<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 has concluded with a series between two titans: Team Vitality, the tournament favorite, and FaZe Clan, an unexpected entrant to the grand final. In the end, Vitality proved unstoppable, defeating FaZe Clan with a memorable 3-1 finish and securing back-to-back Major trophies.</p>



<p>The Major might be over, but Counter-Strike 2 isn’t. Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>

<h2 id="h-team-vitality-just-got-500-000-richer">Team Vitality Just Got $500,000 Richer</h2>



<p>The grand final began with FaZe Clan picking Nuke, where they managed to edge out Team Vitality with a strong scoreline, presenting fans with promise in the earliest map of the final. However, Vitality quickly regained control, crushing FaZe 13-3 in the follow-up. From there, the French-led roster never looked back.</p>



<p>It was a decisive victory for Team Vitality, which has gone down in the history books after putting up one of the best single seasons in the world of esports this year. The team claimed the half-a-million-dollar prize and lifted <strong>another trophy </strong>in 2025.</p>



<p>This makes Vitality the first team since 2019 to secure consecutive Major titles, which is a perfect way to end the season. For FaZe, the loss is a bittersweet one. It was a rocky year for the team, and many had their doubts going into the tournament, let alone the grand final.</p>



<p>Fans of the organization were begging for a redemption shot at the final Major of 2025, but it just wasn’t to be.</p>



<p>Now, we start looking to the 2026 esports calendar and whatever comes next.</p>

Except for 2021, the highly prolific division of Koei Tecmo has released a new game every year, starting with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</a> in 2022, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a> in 2023, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rise of the Ronin</a> in 2024, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> in 2025. Most of these games had their own twists: Stranger of Paradise was a peculiar (and controversial) reinterpretation of the original Final Fantasy featuring a whole party of characters; Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty was the studio's first foray into a Chinese fantasy setting; Rise of the Ronin was an ambitious open world action RPG similar to the recent Assassin's Creed games; and of course, Ninja Gaiden 4 allowed the studio to reintroduce its most prized IP to newer generations with the help of PlatinumGames.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden may be witnessing a resurgence in popularity, but the Nioh series also gained a significant following over time. Koei Tecmo is now self-publishing the new game, too, so they have an even greater interest in making a bigger splash with this new entry.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p>Nioh 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-announced-with-action-packed-trailer-launches-in-early-2026-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> during June 2025's State of Play event. Right away, Koei Tecmo confirmed the early 2026 target release window. In September, Amazon Japan <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026-amazon-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> the final release date of <strong>February 6, 2026</strong>, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-trailer-provides-new-quick-look-at-story-and-gameplay-confirms-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> a few hours later during September's State of Play.</p>



<p>Players will be able to test the game ahead of its release, thanks to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-demo-ps5-pc-january-29-2026-carries-full-game-crossplay-missing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free demo</a> launching on <strong>January 29, 2026</strong>. The demo's save file will carry over to the full version, allowing demo players to continue the journey right away.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, whereas the first two Nioh titles were published by Sony and released on PlayStation 5 several months before the PC version as part of the exclusivity agreement, this new game is being published by Koei Tecmo and is therefore the first in the franchise to get a <strong>simultaneous release on PlayStation 5 and PC</strong> (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>).</p>



<p>Nioh 3 can already be pre-purchased on both platforms. There are two editions: the Standard one, priced at <strong>$69.99</strong>, and the Digital Deluxe Edition, priced at <strong>$109.99</strong>. The latter includes the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Base game</li>



<li>Season pass comprising two DLCs, one due by the end of September 2026 and the second by the end of February 2027</li>



<li>Season pass bonus "Chijiko Netsuke Charm" (accessory)</li>



<li>Infernal Weapons Set (14 types)</li>



<li>Kodama Netsuke Charm (accessory)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both editions have a Pre-Order Bonus and an Early Purchase Bonus. The former will activate if you buy the game before the launch date, whereas the latter can still be received as long as you purchase Nioh 3 by <strong>February 19, 2026</strong>. The Pre-Order Bonus provides the Hellfire Equipment Set (Hellfire Warrior Armor set + Hellfire Ninja Attire set) and Scampuss Furball Netsuke Charm (accessory), whereas the Early Purchase Bonus grants you access to the Hellfrost Equipment Set (Hellfrost Warrior Armor set + Hellfrost Ninja Attire set). Koei Tecmo clarified that these bonuses could be sold separately or given away for free at a later date.</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Like its predecessors, Nioh 3 can be described as a challenging<strong> action RPG</strong>, primarily focused around punishing one-on-one duels and boss encounters rooted in Japanese swordplay and yokai folklore. After the intermission of Nioh 2 (which served as a prequel to the first Nioh chronologically), the story returns to the late <strong>Sengoku period</strong> (16th century). The main protagonist is <strong>Tokugawa Takechiyo</strong>, a young warrior poised to become <span>the Shogun, while his embittered younger brother,&nbsp;<strong>Tokugawa Kunimatsu,</strong>&nbsp;secretly conspires to overthrow him</span> with a horde of yokai (demons in Japanese folklore). Besieged by his brother, Takechiyo travels through time to alter the course of destiny and preserve Japan with the help of his guardian spirit, Kusanagi.</p>



<p>Throughout the course of the narrative, Takechiyo will traverse the Sengoku, Heian, Bakumatsu, and early Edo eras. The developers have confirmed that throughout the game, players will encounter a plethora of historical figures, including, but not limited to, Himiko, Saito Fuku, Hattori Hanzo, Honda Tadakatsu, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, Yagyu Munenori, and Takasugi Shinsaku.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Team Ninja pitched Nioh 3 to fans as an evolution of the series' stance-based combat into a dual-style system where players can freely swap between <strong>Samurai</strong> and <strong>Ninja</strong> modes mid-fight. The <strong>Samurai</strong> style broadly resembles Nioh 1 and 2, emphasizing precision melee with katana and traditional arms, ki (stamina) management, and stance variations, enhanced by new techniques and counters introduced in this new title. The new <strong>Ninja</strong> style, on the other hand, offers a distinctly different experience that emphasizes speed, evasive maneuvers, aerial attacks, and trick-based offense, encouraging hit-and-run and mobility-heavy builds. Players can chain style swaps on the fly, opening hybrid combos that weave heavy samurai strikes into evasive ninja strings. Most of the other familiar series pillars, like guardian spirits, yokai abilities, and loot-driven progression, are returning, albeit now largely tied into a new endgame challenge framework dubbed <strong>The Crucible</strong>, which appears to function as a high-risk, high-reward gauntlet layered on top of the campaign.</p>



<p>The other major innovation is that Team Ninja moved away from the strictly mission-based map of earlier entries toward what they are calling an <strong>“open field”</strong> structure. This doesn't mean a traditional open world; instead, you can expect larger interconnected regions dotted with settlements, roaming yokai, and optional encounters, providing more continuous exploration without abandoning curated combat arenas. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our most recent hands-on preview</a>, main and sub-missions still anchor the experience, but surfacing them organically in the landscape makes progressing through a region feel less like hopping between menus and more like inhabiting a continuous war-torn countryside. Every detour—whether it is sweeping up loot, tackling Myths sidequests from NPCs, clearing Enemy Bases, or hunting down Crucible Wraiths—pushes up a regional Exploration Level that hands out permanent perks, from raw stat bumps to a fully revealed map dotted with markers for points of interest. On top of the usual torrent of gear and materials, those activities drip-feed skill points for the game’s sprawling trees and layer in extra blessings from friendly yokai and Jizo Statues. </p>



<p>Speaking during a recent interview, producer Fumihiko Yasuda also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-dev-made-sure-there-wont-be-sudden-difficulty-spikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that while the game will respect the series tradition of being quite hard, there won't be any sudden difficulty spikes. This should lessen frustration for newcomers to Nioh.  </p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Team Ninja is one of the few triple-A studios that has not switched to Epic's Unreal Engine. Nioh 3 will still run on the studio's proprietary Katana Engine, last seen in the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. Based on the studio's previous games, the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro are likely to offer Performance and Quality modes, although this has yet to be confirmed for this title.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC system requirements of Nioh 3</a> confirmed that Frame Generation will be supported, though they do not specify whether it's AMD's, NVIDIA's, Intel's, or some combination of the three. An SSD is required.</p>

<p>The game supports cooperative multiplayer, but cross-play, as confirmed by Koei Tecmo to Wccftech, won't be available. To play with friends, you'll have to buy Nioh 3 on the same platform.</p>

            <p>Veteran developer and the director behind the upcoming Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, Casey Hudson, has dismissed rumours that players will have to wait years for the new game's release.</p>
<p>While Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o">suggested</a> that a release by 2030 "is an *optimistic* guess" given Hudson's studio, Arcanaut, was only founded in July, Hudson was quick to correct the record.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-revealed-from-knights-of-the-old-republic-and-mass-effect-director-casey-hudson">The new Star Wars single-player RPG was revealed at The Game Awards</a> just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-big-star-wars-game-announcement-on-the-way-and-the-title-ends-with-the-old-republic-teases-leaker">days after rumours swirled that a new KOTOR game could be on the way</a>.</p>
<p>Now confirmed as a spiritual successor to BioWare's Knights of the Old Republic, Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic hails from Arcanaut Studios and Casey Hudson, who was director of BioWare's Star Wars game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>. It's set to be "an epic interactive adventure across a galaxy on the brink of rebirth where every decision shapes your path towards light or darkness".</p><p>"When we developed the original KOTOR, we wanted to create a definitive Star Wars experience - crafting an adventure that consisted of all the things we dreamed of doing as Star Wars fans," Hudson said when the game was announced.
</p>
<p>"Now, 25 years after we started work on that game, our aspirations are equally ambitious. Fate of the Old Republic represents an opportunity to explore a contemporary vision of a definitive Star Wars experience, using state-of-the-art technology and game design, and an all-new story crafted specifically to deliver on the combination of player agency and immersion in Star Wars that was at the heart of KOTOR."</p>

            <p>New Vampire Survivors-a-like Codex Mortis is perhaps one of the first games to proudly declare that everything, from its assets and code to the music, is "100 percent AI-driven".</p>
<p>Developer Grolaf, aka Crunchfest, admits the game – which has taken three months to make – is created entirely with AI, with artwork created in Chat GPT, and animations created using "a shader written by Claude Code".</p>
<p>No game engine was used – "it's pure TypeScript", apparently – with the developer explaining "I use PIXI.js for rendering, bitECS for the entity-component-system backend, and Electron to wrap it as a desktop app. The whole thing was vibe-coded with Claude Code (mostly Opus 4.1 and 4.5)." You can see it in action in the video below.</p>

<p>"In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4084120/CODEX_MORTIS/">Codex Mortis,</a> Death is your weapon," the blurb teases (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/this-roguelite-claims-to-have-the-dubious-honor-of-being-the-worlds-first-fully-playable-game-created-100-percent-through-ai-in-a-milestone-for-slop-everywhere/">PC Gamer</a>). "Mix five schools of dark magic, unleash devastating spell synergies, and raise undead armies in this necromantic bullet hell. Infinite builds, solo or co-op – embrace the forbidden and dominate. 100% AI-driven development."</p>
<p>The developer said they started with a prototype "just to see if this was even feasible", and iterated from there.</p>
<p>"Maintaining a consistent art style was tricky, but GPT managed to remember what visual style I liked and kept it consistent across different sessions," he told one commenter. "I just used regular GPT, not the image API. I also couldn't get character animations to work properly, so I went with shader-based wobbling instead.</p>
<p>"First time building something without an engine. Integrating Steam with Electron wasn't as smooth as it is with Unity or Unreal. I tried Tauri first but it doesn't play nice with Steam at all.</p>
<p>"And the most important takeaway: compared to traditional app development, this is way less mentally draining – kind of like giving an exoskeleton to a construction worker lol."</p>
<p>While the game is yet to release, its Steam discussion forums are full with threads entitled "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4084120/discussions/0/842866343519723340/">Lmao, this looks like ass</a>", "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4084120/discussions/0/842866343519724563/">Garbage AI slop</a>", "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4084120/discussions/0/842866343519752152/">Dangerous slippery slope</a>", and "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4084120/discussions/0/842866343519717962/">100% AI generated - don't buy and don't support this</a>".</p>
<p>There's only one thread that I could find that was ambivalent about its development, which simply asks: "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4084120/discussions/0/842866071372396630/">Why everyone is butthurt about IA [sic] in game development?</a>"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aigamedev/comments/1pidb5g/my_first_vibecoded_game_codex_mortis_demo_is_live/">Commenters over on r/aigamedev were a little less hostile</a>, although several responses have been deleted, so make of that what you will.</p>
<p>Those intrigued can try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4095390/CODEX_MORTIS_Demo/">free Steam demo</a>, although that's currently sitting on a 'Mixed' rating, with one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wraitholme/recommended/4095390/">reviewer</a> writing "The [free] demo is, at least, worth the price".</p>
