                <p>It's fair to say that Concord is one of the biggest flops in recent gaming history, with the hero shooter shutting down after just two weeks of existence. However, despite that, it seems that the game will live on through a side story in Prime Video's video-game-themed TV show Secret Level, which releases on December 10.</p><p dir="ltr">Announced back in August during Gamescom, Secret Level is an anthology series that will feature animated short stories set in the world of various games and gaming franchises, including God of War, The Outer Worlds 2, and Warhammer 40K. Concord was announced as one of the 15 franchises involved in the project, and a source <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-will-remain-in-prime-videos-secret-level-despite-games-sudden-cancellation-source" rel="nofollow ">told IGN</a> that the game will remain a part of Secret Level.</p><p dir="ltr">Secret Level will also feature new stories in franchises that haven't seen a fresh entry in some time, such as Mega Man and Unreal Tournament. A brief moment in the trailer led us to think that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/were-thinking-its-keanu-reeves-in-secret-level-upcoming-armored-core-episode/1100-6526013/">Keanu Reeves might star</a> in the Armored Core episode, but that hasn't been confirmed yet. The John Wick star was recently revealed as the voice of Shadow in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-adds-keanu-reeves-as-voice-of-shadow/1100-6522667/">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The future of Concord remains unclear, with one of the developers of the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-dev-thanks-fans-for-their-support-but-admits-none-of-us-know-whats-next/1100-6526291/">outright stating</a> that "none of us know what's next." Prior to the game's shutdown on September 6, reports suggested that players were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-players-are-repeatedly-killing-their-characters-to-get-a-platinum-trophy/1100-6526260/">killing themselves in the game on purpose</a> to try to gain the platinum trophy before the curtain fell.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lous-lagoon-preview-new-cozy-obsession</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lou%E2%80%99s-lagoon-preview-%E2%80%93-a-new-cozy-obsession.974010/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lous-lagoon-preview-new-cozy-obsession<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes low stakes vibing with a sense of progression is all you want out of a game. To chill yet effect change all the same. <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> is the next up and coming game to let you do just that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> is obviously its own game, but it’s also got quite the interesting mixture. Part <em>Animal Crossing</em>, part <em>My Time at Sandrock</em>, part flying game, and add in a dash of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> -- yes, really – and you’ve got <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your uncle has disappeared and you’ve turned up to figure out what happened to him and to rebuild his delivery business at the same time. Set in an archipelago of islands full of mystery, you’ll be building up and connecting people from all around.</p>
<p>The throughline of the game is the mystery of what happened to your uncle, but the meat of the game will be rebuilding, repairing, and improving the various islands and the inhabitants you meet along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Collecting resources is very <em>No Man’s Sky</em>-like in that you’re “vacuuming” things up with your Swirler 2000, like wood debris and metal parts, to then use to craft things later. Also, what else are islands but a planet analogue with the sea and air between standing in for space? Alright, reaching a bit here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those resources can then be used to repair or build structures, repair stairs to reach new places on an island ,and pretty much anything and everything in-between. You can even craft your own decorations and furniture. There's cooking and a science station, too.</p>
<p>The most unique thing you can repair and upgrade, however, is your plane that's unlocked after you repair it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using the plane isn’t simply a quick travel system, as you will be actively flying it around the archipelago of Lou’s Lagoon. The brief time I had with it showed a simple control set that will be difficult to master if you’re wanting to challenge yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Timed challenges can be found throughout the sky that see you flying through rings. You’ll need some serious practice to complete some of them, let alone set a good time.</p>
<p>With all of those tools in hand, that’s more or less the basis of the game. You go around collecting resources, doing quests for people you meet along the way, find and upgrading more things along the way so you can explore even more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m always a sucker for a game where I can collect some sort of resource or do a quest to then upgrade some sort of town or building. That tangible result of my effort that has a permanent physical affect on the game world is never not satisfying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> is full of things like that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a game of exploration, growth, and connection set in a beautiful backdrop. There's a mystery to uncover and plenty of secrets within many of the islands to find as well. You can go where you want, when you want, at your own pace -- comfort gaming you can curl up with any day.</p>
<p>I think this game will speak to anyone looking for their next cozy game fix. <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> smartly mashes together a few systems with its unique island hopping world to make for a compelling game.&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>Lou’s Lagoon<em> was previewed at PAX West 2024.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/street-fighter-6-sales-top-4-million-around-the-world.974007/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another major milestone around the world, around fifteen months after the game was initially released.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1831814865297489924" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Capcom reveals that&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>has sold more than four million units globally, which presumably counts across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>The studio says that updates and new stuff for&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>will continue, as "more content" and "more events" are on the way for the game. Given that&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-3-million">crossed the three million threshold back in January</a>, that means it's shifted another million units in the last eight or nine months, which isn't too bad.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million-blanka.jpg?itok=VZAO-jhP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million-blanka.jpg?itok=chYcewUM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>has broken another big sales barrier.</figcaption></figure><p>By way of comparison, Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-sales-2-million">sold two million copies</a> within its first month or so on sale, while&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>had sold around 2.47 million copies by the time of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sells-247-million-copies-drives-capcoms-overwhelming-financial-results">Capcom's September 2023 financial results</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it's difficult to compare fighting franchise sales directly; fighting games are a fairly niche genre in the grand scheme of things, and each franchise within the genre arguably has its own audience as well, although there will naturally be some crossover.</p>
<p>Still, four million sales for the latest entry in a pretty major series well over a year after its initial release suggests that there's still a market for&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>, which Capcom will no doubt be happy about. Those might not be&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million"><em>Resident Evil Village</em>-level sales</a>, but hey - there's still time!</p>

<p><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>may already be well over a year old, but the game's not resting on its laurels. It's still getting regular DLC injections;&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury&nbsp;</em>legend Terry Bogard is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1364780/view/4616839976807963593" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the game's latest addition</a>, and other DLC fighters include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-akuma-release-date">Akuma</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-street-fighter-6-dlc-character-ed-gets-release-date-and-gameplay-reveal">Ed</a>, and new character <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-reveals-release-date-gameplay-trailer-for-disturbing-new-character-aki">A.K.I.</a>, to name but a few.</p>

But it was more than just an elaborate tech demo, and established the <em>Astro</em> franchise, previously a VR-exclusive, as a budding Sony first-party A-lister. Leading up to the release of the third game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span>, Team Asobi even added a countdown timer to the mission room in <em>Astro’s Playroom </em>for the September 6 launch. </p><p>That’s where players were able to wait ahead of actually being able to play <em>Astro Bot</em> and watch all of the little guys count down like it was New Year’s Eve 1999. It was a neat little easter egg that’s in keeping with the franchise’s dedication to celebrating PlayStation’s past and taking time to add little touches that make the whole thing feel extra special. </p><p><em>Astro Bot</em> is out now on PlayStation 5 and I’m not alone in thinking it’s a strong frontrunner for GOTY and also one of the best 3D platformers ever. It’s full of whimsical little touches and dazzling set pieces, with levels that revolve around clever mechanics and make full use of the DualSense controller, from the haptic triggers to the speaker. It all gives playing the game the same tactile satisfaction of playing with toys in real life. </p><p>But the seeds of many of those ideas, including blowing onto the touch pad to to create wind gusts in the game, were there in <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, a short game not enough people played despite it being free with each of the over 60 million PS5s that have been sold so far. It only takes three hours to beat and will give you a nice taste of what to expect in <em>Astro Bot</em>. Plus, it will give you a point of reference to see how far the franchise has come in just four years, and a new appreciation for all of the novel ways the new game iterates on what Team Asobi experimented with before. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Street Fighter 6, then, has a long way to go before it beats Street Fighter 5’s sales total.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Street Fighter 6 Akuma Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>To put Street Fighter 6’s sales into context, 1993 SNES hit Street Fighter 2 Turbo sold 4.1 million copies, the seminal Street Fighter 2 sold 6.30 million, and Street Fighter 5 sold 7.60 million.</p><p>Another interesting comparison is with fighting game rival <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, which has sold four million copies since going on sale in September 2023. Mortal Kombat is typically the best-selling fighting game franchise, outselling the likes of Street Fighter and Tekken by some margin. Mortal Kombat 1 hit four million sales around 11 months after launch. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-sells-over-2-million-in-a-month">Tekken 8 sold two million in a month</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Street Fighter 6 is in the middle of Second 2, with DLC characters Terry and Mai from Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters coming soon, and Elena due out winter 2025. Capcom has yet to say what comes after.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

The sheer level of joy the game produces makes it impossible to compare it to anything other than Mario's very best adventure. Astro is no longer a vector through which to reference PlayStation icons; he is a PlayStation icon." -- <em>Jordan Middler</em> [<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/astro-bot/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>VG247 -- 5/5</h2><p>"Astro Bot only cares about fun, and I genuinely can't think of a single moment it made me wish something had been handled differently, tweaked to be easier, or expanded upon. It's just perfect." -- <em>Tom Orry</em> [<a href="https://www.vg247.com/astro-bot-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Eurogamer -- 5/5</h2><p>"Astro Bot is a really, really good 3D platformer. As is often the case with the blockbuster genres of yesteryear, it's always nice when someone busts another one of these out, particularly when they put in so much effort to make it satisfying, curious, lavish and pleasantly odd." -- <em>Christian Donlan</em> [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Inverse -- 10/10</h2><p>"More than anything, my time with Astro Bot is dominated by one word: surprise. There were moments that had my jaw on the floor, moments I cackled with glee, and even one or two where may have shed a tear. Astro Bot is everything that I love about video games — the potential they have to cause wonder and excitement, self-reflection, and, most importantly, fun." -- <em>Hayes Madsen</em> [<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/astro-bot-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>GamesRadar -- 5/5</h2><p>"Astro Bot doesn't just deliver on the promise and potential displayed in PS5 pack-in demo Astro's Playroom, but soars above and beyond to serve up a near-perfect platformer to rival--and possibly surpass--the best of Super Mario's Mushroom Kingdom romps." -- <em>Matt Cabral</em> [<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/astro-bot-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>IGN -- 9/10</h2><p>"Astro Bot made me smile from beginning to end. A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities, it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive. And while you don't need a long history with Sony systems to enjoy it, it is especially a delight for those with a piece of PlayStation in their heart as a treasure trove full of playable nostalgia awaits. Taking the PS5 marketing mantra that “play has no limits” more seriously than you'd expect, Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it." --<em> Simon Cardy</em> [<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Polygon -- No score</h2><p>"Sony has been reaching for something like Astro Bot since PlayStation launched 30 years ago in the age of Mario and Sonic. It has cycled through mascots like Crash, Jak, and Sackboy in its quest for a breezy family game that could hold its own with Nintendo’s best as well as mesh with Sony's cooler, tech-centric brand. Sony ended up settling for edgier cinematic action heroes instead, but deep in the consoles' soul, it felt like something was missing. Astro Bot--a dazzling, joyful game--is a celebration of all the failed attempts and quizzical detours Sony made on that quest. And it might also be the game to fill that hole at last." -- <em>Oli Welsh</em> [<a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/447564/astro-bot-review" rel="nofollow ">Full review</a>]</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/omut-preview-i-died-30-times-in-10-minutes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had no idea what to expect when I went to check out <em>OMUT </em>at PAX West. When I walked away, its weird, dark world had charmed me, and I was more than happy to keep on dying until I ran out of time with my best run being one hit away from victory..&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>OMUT </em>is mechanically simple, lean and mean with the one goal of killing you as much as possible. It’s difficult, punishing, frustrating, tantalizing, alluring, cathartic, and glory-inducing all in one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll get into the combat and how it plays in the moment, but the best aspect of <em>OMUT </em>is that it’s a punishing game where you are going to die a whole lot that also respects your time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting a boss fight after a failure is instantaneous at the click of a button, which makes it easy to just try again, again, again, and again.</p>
<h2>OMUT Is A Boss Rush Demanding Perfection</h2>
<p><em>OMUT</em>’s nothing but bosses, 20 or so all told, so the name of the game is just figuring out their patterns and quirks. If you mow down the bosses perfectly, you could finish the game in probably 30 or so minutes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I can tell you that I played for about 30 minutes and did not kill either of the two bosses I tried in my preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failure is immediate and fatal in <em>OMUT</em>, meaning that only perfection will see you succeed. If all goes well, you can probably clear out a boss in that one perfect attempt in about a minute or so.</p>
<p>If you can do that with any regularity for the first time, I’ll crown you the god gamer now myself. OMUT is hard as nails with little margin for error. There's a lot of dying, trial and error, and close calls until you get that one perfect run.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/omut-deal.jpg?itok=7Yd4EkL- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/omut-deal.jpg?itok=KMhQb-39 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There is a dark world and story in OMUT. Making a deal with this guy gives the kid his powers to come back to life and fight again.</figcaption></figure><p>From what I played, and I understand there may be upgrades and changes later in the game, I was equipped simply with a shotgun with three shells. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The shells replenish automatically quickly but there is a slight delay, so you’ll often find yourself in moments where you don’t have a shot ready when you need it. That means shots need to be strategic and thoughtful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Movement in <em>OMUT </em>is like a 2D sidescroller action game, where you can just shoot and dash. The dash does give you some invulnerability, which you’ll need to time correctly to avoid death. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Shooting and dodging is really all you need to do to win but that’s like saying all you need to do to hit a bullseye is just pull back on the bowstring.</p>
<h2>OMUT's Boss Fights Are Simple But Exacting</h2>
<p>The first boss I fought was a floating demonic ball that was constantly trying to fall to the ground. In later stages of the fight, it would start shooting things out I would have to avoid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time I hit it with a blast of the shotgun, I’d send it back up into the air. If it hit me or the ground at any point, it was game over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Juggling this guy with my measly three shotgun shells was a tall task. The projectiles the boss would send could knock my shells out of the air (or I could block them with a shot), which added another wrinkle to the sporadic movements the boss would make already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add onto that the increase in speed, and the fight had significant ramp ups to account for each step of the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was told it was either 12 or 16 shots to beat the boss and that at one point I was just one hit away from victory. I knew it at the time too and that didn’t make it any easier to step away when I had to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one thing I’ll hold onto is that when I ran into the PR person later that day, he said I was the closest to beating the boss of anyone that demoed the game that day. I knew I'd see him at an event later in the day and hoped <em>OMUT </em>would be there so I could get some more shots in at the boss, but it was never to be. I am happy to live in my own reality believing I got further than anyone else.</p>

<p>The second boss I saw was somehow more frustrating. A large fat naked? man just running at you left and right. Sometimes he changed up the speed, jumped at you, shoots out a projectile, or leaps forward.</p>
<p>This is the fight where you learn where the i-frames are in the dash. The boss has plenty of good animations and clues as to what’s coming next, you just have to be ready to react, so death never felt cheap.</p>
<p>I didn’t have as much time on this one, as I got so close on that first boss I was determined to beat it, but I was no less challenged or engaged with the mechanics.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>OMUT Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>OMUT </em>is cleverly designed in a very meticulous way. The fewer mechanics and systems to engage with, the more glaring a potential problem will be, which thankfully <em>OMUT </em>had none in my brief time with the game.</p>
<p>With 18 or so bosses still left for me to see at some point in the future, I can’t wait to try all of their wackiness out. There’s no way I’m not seeing at least 1,000 deaths along the way.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dark-and-darker-season-4-brings-reworked-map-new-boss-and-more.973959/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-season-4<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>Season 4 is finally upon us, and it's bringing all kinds of goodies to the gloomy multiplayer dungeon-crawler, including a reworked map, a new boss, and plenty more.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2016590/view/4593196713079675998" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam post announcing the new season's arrival</a>, developer and publisher Ironmace first notes that all characters have been reset for the start of this season, which is a fairly standard practice for Early Access games.</p>
<p>As for new features, the first one you're getting is a reworked version of the Ruins map, which also serves as a gateway to two more layers: the Crypt and the Inferno. As you've probably guessed, this season therefore also marks the return of three-layer dungeons.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-and-darker-season-4-ruins-map.jpg?itok=I3ZSSQq2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-and-darker-season-4-ruins-map.jpg?itok=_iUNZXS6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>Season 4 has tons of new stuff for you to discover.</figcaption></figure><p>Other major highlights for this season include a new Spectral Knight boss for you and your friends to take on, as well as a new Dungeon Express system that lets you safely extract loot between dungeon layers.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to encounter new unique monsters, new models for several weapons and items, and more, so even if you think you know&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>inside out, you might want to head back in for this update.</p>
<p>The experience should now be easier on newer players, too; a new Tome of Knowledge has been added "to help with basic game information", and all classes have had their Starting Gear improved as well.</p>

<p>If you're interested in everything that's been added to&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>as part of its fourth season, then you can check out the update's <a href="https://www.darkanddarker.com/news/74" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full patch notes here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>is a multiplayer PvPvE dungeon-crawler in which your goal is to gather treasure, defeat monsters, and stay one step ahead of other groups of players, who'll be looking to take your treasure from you.</p>
<p>The game is one of several of its kind that have popped up in recent years. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-release-date"><em>Dungeonborne</em></a>&nbsp;and, of course,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>, although the developers of that one have seemingly been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-pve-eod-free">doing their best to alienate their community</a> of late.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016590/Dark_and_Darker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only widescreen. No ultrawide for the moment, sadly. As and when they add support for ultrawide monitors, perhaps they should call it "ultramarinewide". Ha ha! Ha. Anyway, here's what's coming in the first round of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> patches.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Saber Interactive's well-regarded battle-bludgeoner isn't fully on sale yet - the public release date is Monday 9th September, but certain Warhammerers have gotten early access by means of the blasphemous Chaotic rite of Preordering, may the God-Emperor shrive their souls. The Steam reactions so far seem broadly positive, but there are a few sore spots, including the absence of ultrawide support, which Saber have said they're <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/68-august-community-update">working to add</a>.</p>
<p>There are also reports of crashing, for which publishers Focus have <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/forums/27-bugs/threads/43800-quick-note-on-the-most-common-issues#post-207833">outlined some possible workarounds</a>. If you're experiencing crashes in general, consider deactivating any overlay software you're using such as Riva Tuner, Afterburner or NVIDIA's equivalent. If you're finding that the game crashes during the first cinematic, the publishers recommend updating to the latest version of Windows, verifying that the game is running on the correct GPU, and updating your GPU driver. And if you're running into an infinite loading bug when playing in multiplayer Operations, try restarting the game - it could be a networking issue, or it could be to do with getting kicked from your squad. </p>
<p>Personally, I think infinite loading bugs are appropriate to a game with infinitely loading bugs (Tyranid swarms). Ha ha! Ha. Anyway, here's what to do if your controller is refusing to work with the game: switch off Steam Input (Right click on game &gt; Properties &gt; Controller &gt; Disable Steam Input) and try plugging in your controller via USB.</p>
<p>If none of these bodges jump-start your Adeptus Astartes, you'll have to wait for some game updates, unfortunately. "We aim to fix all these issues in our first patches," Focus promise.</p>
<p>Crashes and the omission of ultrawide aren't the only bones Spice Margerine aficionadoes have to pick with Spruce Maureen 2. As passed on by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2s-epic-games-client-on-steam-is-for-crossplay-confirms-publisher">Eurogamer</a>, there's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1f9ule0/space_marine_2_is_sitting_at_55_on_steam_due_to/">a stink on Reddit</a> about the "stealth installation of Epic Online Services" when you accept the game's EULA. </p>
<p>The installation of Epic's client is, in fact, mentioned in the EULA, and "was implemented to support optional cross-play between Steam and Epic players and to synchronize friend lists between the two stores", as Focus explain. "However, please be aware linking your Steam and Epic accounts is not required to enjoy the game. These features are entirely optional and will not affect your gameplay experience in any way."</p>
<p>Ugh, I need a final ghastly Warhammer pun to finish off this post. Something to do with Steam Tanks, maybe? The game tanking on Steam? Please go read Brendy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 review</a> while I consult the scriptorium and try to figure out the Warhammer 40K equivalent for a "review bomb".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"Even before this happened, there'd been multiple warning shots from Unity," Verschelde recalled in a conversation at Gamescom 2024. And despite the boon that could come from an influx of users, the Godot team prayed Unity wouldn't make that explosion happen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the two tell it, Godot wasn't ready for primetime until just months before the Runtime Fee debacle—and as it exploded, they faced their first test on what would happen when a userbase used to Unity's tech and values would react in the face of Godot's open-source style. It's a case study in how any team can rapidly scale in the face of surprise growth—and how teams who espouse open-source values can incorporate input from new members.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/from-unity-to-godot-in-a-weekend" target="_self">From Unity to Godot in a Weekend</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Godot wasn't ready for primetime">Godot wasn't ready for primetime</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Linietsky, a longtime technology consultant, told Game Developer that Unity's push to hit the stock market with an IPO was a ticking time bomb. Not necessarily because of the focus on stockholders, but the mission of acquiring technology companies to make Unity a larger tool. "They invested in so much technology that I, as a technology person, know is expensive to maintain," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rumors of Unity's IPO push </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-unity-is-looking-to-go-public-in-2020">began in 2019,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Godot had only hit version 3.0 in 2018. Even though the engine saw "steady growth" over the next few years, Linietsky and Verschelde didn't think that version of the tool was a worthy alternative to Unity. If dissatisfied users came their way, they might not find something that fit their needs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Or worse—they might find a tool that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>almost</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fit their needs, but lacked key features from Unity they'd demand be implemented. But Godot's open-source nature means features can't just be solicited like they are from a licensed engine. They have to be voted on and implemented by the community. "We were just hoping Unity would keep doing a good job and keep users happy so people can willingly embrace Godot for what it is, and not try to change it to what it isn't," Verschelde said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair said it was a major relief that the calamity came after version 4.0 of Godot was released in March of 2023. That version, they felt, was most ready for a sudden rush of new developers. That meant when the calamity came, the founders were more prepared to face the challenges of introducing developers to the open source model.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Godot has been forced to grapple with the needs of Unity users">Godot has been forced to grapple with the needs of Unity users</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When the moment came, Linietsky and Verschelde said there were some user demands that risked running up on the engine's capabilities—but they were relieved to find "Unity refugees" were willing to compromise. Godot's community-first structure did a lot of the heavy lifting, with other Godot developers who'd worked with Unity ready on day one to explain how the new arrivals could replicate desired features with their new tools.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, they found that Unity refugees were surprisingly patient with Godot's shortcomings. Verschelde said users might be frustrated to find tasks they could do in Unity that they couldn't replicate in Godot—but then would uncover tools that existed in Godot they couldn't have used in Unity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There was room for Godot's community to make </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>some</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> accommodations for the new arrivals. An option to move the file system window to the bottom of the screen, just as it's located in Unity, was a relatively easy lift.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What wasn't an easy lift? Unity's beloved feature that lets developers edit their game while in "Play" mode. The pair said it's one of the "top 5 most-requested features," but it's not one that can be added in a straightforward manner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When Godot generates a playable version of the game being worked on, it runs separately to keep both functions more stable. Recreating the "edit while in Play mode" isn't likely to happen any time soon, but Verschelde said there's a proposal in the community for a smaller feature: the ability to click on objects in the game and see them in the inspector. "That can be done," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't expect a C Sharp to C++ compiler any time soon though. Godot uses a more "modern" version of C Sharp maintained by Microsoft that has "other capabilities of optimizing performance."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Developers can always fork their own versions of the engine">Developers can always fork their own versions of the engine</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Godot's limitations are fascinating in part because, as the pair stressed multiple times in our conversation, they're something technically savvy developers can solve themselves.

That isn't possible with Unity or Unreal Engine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those open source values even extend to how you pronounce the engine's name.

		<p>It’s been a hell of a gaming week, with some actual bangers arriving to brighten up a dreary start to September. I’ve been reviewing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a>, and loved its rendition of Warhammer 40,000’s universe, and now I’m jumping into Age of Mythology: Retold, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-plucky-squire">The Plucky Squire</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. There is some juggling going on!</p>
<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has also played Astro Bot, and he played it before the rest of us! He awarded it a massive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">10/10 in our review</a>, and told us, “It’s bloody delightful!” He’s also played little bits of Magic and Monster Hunter Now.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> played the demo of Stories from Sol The Gun Dog and started Final Fantasy XVI where he replayed the intro as he forgot what happened in that (isn’t restarting an RPG literally the worst thing in gaming?) He’s also been playing NBA 2K25 and Beyond Galaxyland for review.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been scoundrel-ing in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, hunting in Hunt Showdown 1896, tried out Quidditch Champions, and has been performing indie songs, beating up weirdos, and having emotional moments about his past in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dustborn">Dustborn</a>. That’s not all though, as he tells us, “I also started Cult of the Lamb, which I didn’t know anything about other than make a cult. Now I know it’s Binding of Isaac with a cult theme I’m not sure if I’ll return.”</p>


<p>Giving up on the “fairly pants”&nbsp;Wukong Black Myth, <strong>Ade</strong> has been playing Wild Bastards and Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions for review instead. He’s returned to being a pirate again too: “I’m also on with Skull and Bones Season 3, which is brilliant! Teaming up with about seven other players to take down a giant flying storm dragon was awesome!”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> started the week off strong by finishing the “entertaining” Dungeons of Hinterberg before moving on to Creatures of Ava in the ‘what’s interesting on Game Pass’ style. He’s continued to bung a lot into one week though, continuing, “Alongside that I have just started what will be a very long-running playthrough of the Age of Mythology: Retold which is super nostalgic as I rinsed the original back in the day. I also finished Atlas Fallen: Forgettable Subtitle which was a surprisingly decent open world Ubi-type game but less bloated than the usual Far Cry/Ass Creed. Nice sand traversal and pretty deep combat too. Finally I have just installed the Silent Hill 2 Enhanced Edition PC mod for a pre-Remake playthrough after finishing my review time with an embargoed upcoming horror game that blew me away.”</p>
<p>While he had hoped to continue his career as a Freegunner, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/">Sony’s decision to axe Concord</a> left <strong>Jim</strong> with no desire to jump back in (until the game’s expected future relaunch). It’s been a tough week all round for Jim, as he says, “I’ve also entered a bit of a slump while playing Fallout: New Vegas and its Lonesome Road DLC which has turned out to be a bruising gauntlet of super tough enemy encounters I clearly wasn’t ready for. Thankfully the end is in sight – when I return to the Mojave Wasteland, I’ll almost be ready to wrap up the main questline.”</p>

<p><strong>Nick P</strong> played and finished <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/the-casting-of-frank-stone-review/">The Casting of Frank Stone</a> for review, as well as continuing his play through of Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth and Parasite Eve. He almost certainly snuck in some Fortnite and Dead by Daylight too.</p>
<p>And finally, we come to&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong>, who’s shared his impressions from going <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preview-link-who/">hands on with Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, and had a great time with the fresh spin on a Zelda adventure (now with playable Zelda!). Beside that, he dabbled a tiny bit with COD Black Ops 6’s beta, with plans to play some more this weekend, and will make a start on Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown today, after a week of server issues has stalled our review on the starting line.</p>
<p>How about you? Have you been scoundrel-ing? Or do you fancy being a tiny PlayStation robot?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/what-car-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of my least favorite things about living in America is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/how-gran-turismo-revolutionized-car-culture">the obsessive car culture</a>. We’re so reliant on them, and they don’t even have legs or rockets! <em>What the Car?</em>, a comedy game from Triband, bravely asks us to reconsider what cars can really do for us.</p>
<p>If you’re a mobile gamer, you’ve already seen this on your iPhone thanks to Apple Arcade. However, on September 9, <em>What the Car?</em> hits Steam, opening the door for so many others to experience this charming game.</p>
<p>At its core, it’s like most other games starring a car: You have to get from point A to B as fast as possible. But like anything worth enjoying, <em>What the Car?</em> is more about the journey than the destination.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-frogger.jpg?itok=mQ_0E3Uq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-frogger.jpg?itok=UTRKszXR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ribbit.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>What the Car?</em> Reinvents the Wheel</h2>
<p>Made by a Copenhagen-based team of developers who primarily don’t drive, <em>What the Car?</em> is a comedy game first and foremost. You might recognize one of their other games, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/what-golf"><em>What the Bat?</em></a></p>
<p>Community Manager Sarah Sanders, who I spoke with at PAX West, said one of their primary measures of success is “laughs per minute.” And I can confirm, I found myself chuckling a lot at this silly little game.</p>
<p><em>What the Car?</em>’s humor lands more often than not thanks to the boundless creativity on display here. You play as the titular Car, who’s primarily on two human legs instead of four wheels—and it only gets weirder from there.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’re a car riding a bike with a jetpack on its back. Other times, you’re an ac-car-dion, slinking along the level, or a carp swimming through water. Occasionally, you're chopping veggies like Cooking Mazda. There’s even one mini-game where you’re a car who would literally rather be fishing.</p>

<p>I’m barely scratching the surface of just how ludicrous these premises get. Each level is named either after the car type or features a punny reference on something else.</p>
<p>Choice names include “Bike Me Up Inside,” “Drop It Like It’s Hot Wheels,” and my personal favorite, “Car on Skateboard but Giraffe.” That last one’s not a pun; it’s just wonderfully silly, with and without context.</p>
<p>Controlling each of these monstrosities is pretty simple, and it’s maybe the biggest giveaway of the game’s mobile roots. You move left or right and have one action button. The action button can be pressed or held, depending on the level and the car’s modifications.</p>
<p>The only thing funnier than the puns is moving Car itself, especially when it's a weird mess of spare parts and gears. Turns out, controlling a car with keyboards for wheels isn't easy, but the absurdity of it all makes it so enjoyable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-pirate-ship.jpg?itok=3FkE5ME7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-pirate-ship.jpg?itok=RSn_q7n5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is the tale of Captain Jack Car-row.</figcaption></figure><p>For the most part, maybe only one or two levels confused me on how they worked, but that confusion lasted for maybe five seconds. Once you play around with it, it’s all pretty intuitive.</p>
<p>Each level, you're ranked by a bronze, silver, or gold crown based on how long it took you to finish. As an added challenge, there's a collectible card hidden in each level, asking you to detour and find some shortcuts.</p>
<p>Thankfully, shortcuts can be easy to find on lots of these levels. The physics in <em>What the Car? </em>are whimsically wonky, giving you lots of leeway to make certain jumps or finagle your way around corners.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-hot-wheels.jpg?itok=k49rJPkc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-hot-wheels.jpg?itok=sT3r0ega 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What's this? A normal-looking racing game?</figcaption></figure><h2>Pumping the Brakes</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I found the wonky physics to also be a small point of contention. There are optional harder levels denoted by a skull, and personally, the floaty feeling sometimes contributed to more annoyance than ingenious shortcutting.</p>
<p>Sometimes Car's legs would get stuck on some debris, and other times, one little bump would send it flying higher than expected. Similar bumps would just result in a smaller hop or something, but it wasn't always predictable.</p>
<p>Momentum also works a little weirdly in <em>What the Car?</em>, where sometimes hopping with a jetpack would carry forward the momentum. Yet other times, it would just kill all the built-up speed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-soccer-cannon.jpg?itok=t5iID_KV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-soccer-cannon.jpg?itok=zK8DKseT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, that's a car sliding along on its top with the power of a soccer ball cannon.</figcaption></figure><p>Levels are grouped into what Triband calls Episodes, and at the time of writing, <em>What the Car? </em>has nine themed Episodes. You can navigate to each of these Episodes through an overworld that Car can run through and explore.</p>
<p>There are lines that denote main-path levels and optional levels, and there's even more to find off the beaten path, like secret quests and skull levels.</p>
<p>On the whole, though, I think the overworld introduces more tedium than fun. Exploring is alright, but it wears out its welcome partway through, and the extra bit of time it takes to navigate through levels doesn't really add to the charm.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm biased by the demo I played at PAX West, where it was just a quick hit of level after level, just a black screen in between. That rapid fire of inventive humor felt better paced than what the overworld provided.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-overworld.jpg?itok=4jAvNj40 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-overworld.jpg?itok=YjHbyV1s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The bears are cute, though.</figcaption></figure><h2>Live Servicing Your Car</h2>
<p>Another sign of <em>What the Car?</em>'s mobile gaming roots, there's already a history of Triband supporting the game with updates after launch. The team continues to add new Episodes, and they release surveys asking players what they should do next.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are daily missions as well as special weekly levels to enjoy. If that's still not enough content, there's a whole library of user-generated levels that you can explore—and there's already a lot, thanks to the Apple Arcade head start.</p>

<p>If you want to get into the level-making game though, I'd recommend a large dose of patience to go with it. The level editor uses the same control scheme as the overworld navigation. In fact, all the menus use this system; you walk up to what you want to do and interact with it.</p>
<p>I found this made for less precision and control over the creation tools, which makes the well-built stages all the more impressive. However, it also meant I wouldn't jump into it for myself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-mad-max.jpg?itok=YujjT6Zv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-mad-max.jpg?itok=v4NZqWYj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm torn between making a Darude - Sandstorm joke or a Mad Max reference.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>What the Car?</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Long story short, there's a lot of content to explore in <em>What the Car?</em>, if it's your kind of game. The mainline levels plus some side content took me five hours, but if you obsess over getting the gold crown and card on everything, you can get a lot of miles out of this.</p>
<p>However, I think this game benefits more from taking it easy on the scenic route. At first, I got caught up in trying to get gold everything, but that detracted from enjoying the absurdity of the game.</p>
<p>As long as you're expecting a silly game that deconstructs the meaning of a car, you'll be in for a good time with a high laughs per minute score. But your mileage may vary if you take it more seriously.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>What the Car? </strong>was reviewed on PC via Steam with a copy provided by the developer over the course of around 5 hours of gameplay. All screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
If we’re measuring the success of What the Car? by laughs per minute, it’s a pretty sweet ride. The overworld eventually wears out its welcome, and some of the harder levels feel a little too frustrating for a comedy game. However, as an overall lighthearted experience, this game kicks it into high gear. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-pathea-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>My Time at Portia&nbsp;</em>developer Pathea Games has revealed&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, the third game in the cozy series of life sims.</p>
<p>Right now, we don't know a whole lot about&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>; a full reveal is coming later this month when <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Kickstarter campaign</a>&nbsp;for the new game goes live. We don't have an official date for that yet.</p>
<p>What we do have, though, is a piece of concept art, which you can see above. It depicts what are presumably several of the characters from&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, as well as the game's logo, which is consistent with the previous two games in the series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-time-at-sandrock-gameplay-my-time-at-evershine.jpg?itok=mlXHZ73M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-time-at-sandrock-gameplay-my-time-at-evershine.jpg?itok=mbtdFlN2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The followup to&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/666140/view/4602203912329491293" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a> teasing&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, Pathea says it opted for a Kickstarter campaign once again with&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>because "indie game development comes with its challenges".</p>
<p>The studio says that&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock</em>'s budget was nearly $12 million, which "stretched [the] studio's resources". Since Pathea wants to "reach and exceed"&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>with&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, crowdfunding will help the devs to "make more decisions earlier in the development cycle".</p>
<p>Pathea says that&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>will feature "major upgrades in graphics, animation, and gameplay", and that it will offer "more consistent product quality across all platforms".</p>
<p>The announcement concludes with Pathea saying that crowdfunding has helped it to gather together a community of passionate fans, and that it hopes those fans will "continue to support [it]" throughout&nbsp;<em>Evershine</em>'s development.</p>

<p><em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-sandrock-early-access-release-date-revealed">hit Early Access back in May 2022</a>, and it was released in full in November last year (having been delayed from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-sandrock-finally-builds-full-release-date-will-leave-early-access-in">original September release date</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when you factor in development time, it's likely we won't see&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>for a good few years yet, so there's still plenty of time to play and enjoy&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock</em>.</p>

Open world games that have level-locked zones allow for the player to feel this sense of power increase; enemies that used to be tough are now easily dispatched and an area the player previously couldn’t have survived, now becomes the play area for them to explore.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conversely, a negative feedback loop can be used to introduce challenges that prevent players from advancing too quickly, ensuring that the game remains engaging and balanced. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Kart</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> uses a negative feedback loop with its item distribution system, the better your positioning within the race the weaker your item will be.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Designing Effective Progression Systems">2. Designing Effective Progression Systems</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Balancing Challenge and Reward:">Balancing Challenge and Reward:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The core of an effective progression system lies in the balance between challenge and reward. If a game is too difficult, players may feel frustrated and disengaged; if it's too easy, the rewards can feel unearned, diminishing the sense of accomplishment. Striking the right balance means creating a difficulty curve that gradually increases, ensuring that players are constantly being tested but are also consistently rewarded for their efforts. This balance keeps players in a state of "flow", where the game is challenging enough to be engaging but not so difficult that it becomes discouraging. Within </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Left 4 Dead 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s The Parish level, the director system will determine a path through the cemetery and how intense of a hoard to fight depending on how the players are progressing, aiming to keep the players in an appropriate state of flow whilst moving through the zone.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Milestones and Plateaus:">Milestones and Plateaus:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In any progression system, the pacing of rewards is crucial. Frequent small rewards keep players motivated, while larger, more significant milestones provide a sense of major achievement. However, periods of slower progression, or plateaus, can also play an important role. These moments of relative stasis build anticipation and make the eventual breakthrough more satisfying. By designing a progression system with well-placed milestones and intentional plateaus, game designers can keep players engaged and eager to continue their journey.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Your Chronicle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, an incremental game, showcases this principle well. The player can progress through each area's minor dungeons, unlocking small amounts of content upon completion (minor milestones), however the story content will plateau unless the player switches gears to focus on increasing the strength of their creatures, allowing them to beat the area boss and unlock the next area of content (major milestone).</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Customisable Progression Paths:">Customisable Progression Paths:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most effective ways to enhance player engagement is by offering customisable progression paths. Whether through skill trees, branching storylines, or personalised upgrades, allowing players to choose how they progress through the game creates a deeper sense of ownership and investment in their character’s development. This personalisation not only makes the progression feel more meaningful but also caters to different playstyles, ensuring that a wide range of players can find satisfaction in their unique journey through the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Path of Exile</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s skill tree will place the player on a different starting point depending on which character they start with, and as they player earns skill points they can move around the tree customising the build to whatever they would like.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="3. The Emotional Journey of Progression">3. The Emotional Journey of Progression</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="From Novice to Master:">From Novice to Master:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players start as beginners, often with limited abilities and knowledge, and gradually grow into experts who can overcome increasingly complex challenges. This progression mirrors many classic tales, where the protagonist evolves through trials and tribulations. By carefully pacing this growth, game designers can create a deep emotional connection between the player and their character, making each victory feel like a hard-earned step toward mastery. The satisfaction of seeing one’s skills develop over time is a key driver of long-term engagement.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Overcoming Obstacles:">Overcoming Obstacles:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Encountering new obstacles and setbacks requires players to measure, compare and adapt the strategies they had been using, allowing them to develop new strategies, eventually leading to learning and triumph. Forcing players to interact with a new item or ability increases their overall understanding and mastery of the game. Effective obstacle design encourages experimentation and enhances the player’s sense of achievement, turning moments of struggle into learning points.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Within my own game Deadbeat Wizard, the player must use their lightning spell to disable shielded enemies.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The Endgame:">The Endgame:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As players approach the endgame, the traditional power progression often slows or reaches its peak. However, maintaining player engagement at this stage is crucial. The endgame can introduce new forms of progression, such as mastery of advanced mechanics, social status within the game’s player community, or the pursuit of rare and prestigious rewards. By shifting the focus from growth to refinement, and from power to prestige, designers can create a satisfying conclusion to the player's journey while still offering goals to strive for. This approach ensures that the emotional investment in the game continues, even after the main progression is complete.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="4.

Within </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur’s Gate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the progression system is deeply tied to the world of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where players experience significant growth as they level up, gain new spells and acquire legendary gear. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Chrono Trigger</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> offers a unique take where the character progression is not only about becoming stronger but also about unlocking new abilities that allows the player to explore different eras and change the course of history.

For instance, adaptive difficulty systems dynamically adjust the game’s challenge based on the player's performance, ensuring a balanced experience that keeps players in their ideal "flow" state. Roguelites, on the other hand, offer a unique twist by using post-run progression, where each playthrough builds upon the last, creating a cycle of learning and improvement. These innovations highlight how contemporary game design continues to evolve, offering new ways to keep progression systems fresh and engaging.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Live Service Games:">Live Service Games:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Live service games, like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, have revolutionised power progression by introducing seasonal content that refreshes the player experience over time. These games keep players engaged through ongoing updates, new goals, and time-limited rewards that encourage regular play. Seasonal progression systems provide a sense of renewal and excitement, with each season offering new challenges and opportunities for growth and mastery of a new set of skills. This approach not only sustains long-term player interest but also creates a dynamic, ever-evolving game world where progression is constantly being redefined.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fortnite Season 4 banners showcasing the new features and locations added within that chapter.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="5. Avoiding Common Pitfalls in Power Progression">5. Avoiding Common Pitfalls in Power Progression</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Power Creep:">Power Creep:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Power creep occurs when new content gradually raises the power ceiling, making older abilities, gear, or strategies less effective over time. This can lead to imbalance and frustration, as players may feel compelled to constantly chase the latest meta to remain competitive. To avoid power creep, designers can introduce horizontal progression, where new content offers different playstyles or abilities rather than simply increasing power. Additionally, seasonal resets or level caps can help maintain balance by ensuring that older content remains relevant and that progression feels fair and rewarding for all players.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Monotony:">Monotony:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the risks in designing power progression systems is falling into monotony, where players feel like they're simply grinding through repetitive tasks to achieve incremental gains. This can quickly lead to boredom and disengagement. To combat monotony, it's essential to introduce variety in the ways players progress. This could involve offering multiple types of challenges, incorporating narrative-driven progression elements, or providing different routes to reach similar goals. By keeping the progression experience dynamic and varied, designers can maintain player interest and help make each step in the journey feel fresh and exciting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Skill level 92 is the halfway point in terms of experience to reach skill level 99 in RuneScape.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Player Fatigue:">Player Fatigue:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Player fatigue is a common issue in games with extensive power progression systems, particularly when players feel pressured to constantly grind for progression. This can lead to burnout and a diminished enjoyment of the game. To prevent fatigue, it's important to design progression systems that allow for breaks and downtime. Implementing features like daily or weekly caps on progression, offering non-progression-based activities, or introducing narrative pauses can give players a chance to recharge without feeling like they’re falling behind. By respecting players' time and providing a balanced pace of progression, designers can help maintain long-term player engagement and enjoyment.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion: Crafting Compelling Power Progression Systems">Conclusion: Crafting Compelling Power Progression Systems</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Striking the right balance between challenge and reward is essential. When players feel that their progress is deserved and impactful, it deepens their connection to the game and enhances the sense of achievement with each milestone. Avoiding missteps like power creep or overly slow advancement ensures that the progression remains exciting and rewarding, encouraging players to continue their journey.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Innovation in power progression breathes new life into familiar systems, offering fresh experiences that keep players intrigued. Whether by revisiting classic mechanics or introducing entirely new ones, designers have the opportunity to create progression systems that resonate deeply, making each step forward feel significant and engaging.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And so in the end, power progression is far more than a method for increasing a player's capabilities; it's the driving force behind a game’s emotional and narrative depth. This system takes players on a journey of growth, where every challenge overcome and every skill mastered becomes a testament to their evolving prowess. The true power of progression lies in its ability to keep players engaged, motivated, and emotionally invested in their journey.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
