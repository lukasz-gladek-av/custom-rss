		<p>The most premium of games which is only for premium players, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a>, is absolutely great and there’s nothing wrong with it, it’s your PC that’s rubbish and you don’t know how to configure it. That’s what <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/16/randy-pitchford-reminds-you-that-borderlands-4-is-a-premium-game-made-for-premium-gamers/">Randy Pritchford say</a>s so we can all ignore the statement released by Gearbox that states:</p>
<p>“We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming. This is our top priority.”</p>



<p data-start="0" data-end="456">Look, folks, let me tell you something very important about Borderlands 4—it runs beautifully.&nbsp; Everybody’s saying it’s one of the smoothest, most incredible games ever made. No performance issues, none. The people trying to say otherwise? Fake news. They’re the same people who always want to tear down great American entertainment, the same tired critics like Jimmy Kimmel, a bad man, who has been wrong about everything from the beginning. Believe me.</p>
<p data-start="458" data-end="780">Borderlands 4 is fast, it’s sharp, it looks amazing—better than anyone thought possible. The developers did a tremendous job, maybe the best job ever. Everybody’s talking about how great it feels, how stable it is, how much fun they’re having. And you know what? They’re right. Because it works perfectly. Zero problems.</p>

<p data-start="782" data-end="1180" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The fake news media doesn’t want you to enjoy it, they want to make up stories about “frame drops” or “performance problems.” Total lies. Don’t believe them. Ask the gamers, ask the fans—they’ll tell you the truth. Borderlands 4 is a massive success, running flawlessly, and people are loving it more than ever before. It’s a big, beautiful win. And we’re not going to let fake news take that away.</p>
<p data-start="782" data-end="1180" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">You know me, I like a border, big beautiful borders with big fences and to keep the robotic pyschos out of my game. We need more Borderlands like this because it’s the biggliest and best Borderlands ever.</p>

		<p>A new video for Football Manager 26 has been released by Sports Interactive, and the core subject is the introduction of women’s football to the series. The video shows how Sports Interactive has incorporated women’s football into Football Manager, confirming there will be 14 leagues across 11 countries with WSL and WSL2 among those leagues. Women’s football has been fully integrated into the game, allowing players to have both men and women’s league active in their games, or you can choose to play either men’s football or women’s football only.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 26 | Introducing Women's Football" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zjJ39Hd-O-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The women’s football database will include over 40,000 players as well, making it the biggest women’s football database in any game. Women’s player stats are equivalent to the men’s stats, but also within the context of the women’s game. Sports Interactive has gone further with animations with women footballers being used to motion capture movements, so the on the pitch action resembles close to the reality of how women play football. Sports Interactive has also confirmed that this is just the first step for women’s football in the Football Manager series, with the database set to expand and the experience to get more depth in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/10/football-manager-26-releases-on-november-4th/">Sports Interactive recently confirmed that Football Manager 26 releases on November 4th</a> for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, Game Pass, and mobile exclusively through Netflix. Football Manager 26 Touch will launch on December 4th for Switch.</p>

            <p>To invert or not to invert? The question of whether to flip the Y-axis in games is often answered with recollections of childhood habits and/or varyingly smug declarations of which joystick setting is 'better'. Now, though, a cognitive research study posits that our control preferences are less about whether or not we played GoldenEye after school and more about the innate quirks of our brains.</p>
<p>As reported by Keith Stuart at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/sep/18/why-do-some-gamers-invert-their-controls-scientists-now-have-answers-but-theyre-not-what-you-think">The Guardian</a>, Dr Jennifer Corbett and Dr Jaap Munneke’s <a href="https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-025-00626-5">paper</a> 'Why axis inversion? Optimizing interactions between users, interfaces, and visual displays in 3D environments' details their experiments into control inversion choices. After answering a questionnaire about whether and why they think they use invert controls or not, participants were tasked to, as Corbett puts it, "mentally rotate random shapes, take on the perspective of an 'avatar' object in a picture, determine which way something was tilted in differently tilted backgrounds, and overcome the typical '<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/simon-effect">Simon effect</a>' where it’s harder to respond when a target is on the opposite v the same side of the screen as the response button."</p>
<p>These experiments, the study claims, indicated that none of the participants’ stated reasons for rejecting or embracing inversion "had anything to do" with their actual choice. "It turns out," Corbett says, "the most predictive out of all the factors we measured was how quickly gamers could mentally rotate things and overcome the Simon effect. The faster they were, the less likely they were to invert. People who said they sometimes inverted were by far the slowest on these tasks."</p>
<p>Or, as Stuart puts it, "It’s much more likely that you invert or don’t invert due to how your brain perceives objects in 3D space." And the speed factor doesn’t mean that electing to invert is a skill issue either, as the study adds that while non-inverters would flip their images at a faster pace, they’d make more mistakes than the cautious inverters, resulting in an overall equal accuracy rate.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>I suspect my C grade in GCSE Biology isn’t quite enough to let me give a learned interpretation of these findings, but it sure sounds like the desire to invert is based mainly on unconscious brainworkings – hardly sure footing for any "No, MY way is better" reasoning. Though on a personal level it’s nice to know, as someone who’s always inverted the Y axis on thumbstick controls but can’t remember a reason why, that I don’t actually <em>need</em> a reason. It’s just how I perceive objects in 3D space, guys. I shall continue to go around gaming trade shows, flipping the sticks at all the demo booths and forgetting to reset them, thus leaving a trail of harmless inconveniences like a hallway full of slightly tilted paintings. And it’ll all be fine, because it was basically an accident of birth.</p><p>Then again, the study doesn’t entirely reject the impact of learned behaviour, and in fact suggests we try practicing the opposite of our control preference – just in case we’ve convinced ourselves to stick with a method that isn't a cognitive match.</p>
<p>"Non-inverters should give inversion a try – and inverters should give non-inversion another shot," Corbett argues. "You might even want to force yourself to stick with it for a few hours. People have learned one way. That doesn’t mean they won’t learn another way even better.</p>
<p>"A good example is being left-handed. Until the mid-20th century, left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand, causing some people to have lifelong handwriting difficulties and learning problems. Many older adults still don’t realise they’re naturally left-handed and could write/draw much better if they switched back."</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I’m running a quick test of something on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, I leave the Y-axis uninverted just because I can’t be bothered to delve into the menus to change it. Does that count?</p>

            <p>Nintendo has argued mods shouldn't be recognised as "prior art", and therefore are irrelevant to its ongoing lawsuit with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> creator Pocketpair.</p>
<p>As part of its defence against alleged copyright infringement of the Pokémon games, Pocketpair has pointed to mods as an example of prior art that would invalidate Nintendo's patent claims. Specifically, it highlighted the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/690?tab=description">Pocket Souls</a> Pokémon mod for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>, which allows players to capture and battle with enemies in the game.</p>
<p>Now, in a response spotted by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/gross-in-palworld-patent-case-nintendo-tells-japanese-judge-mods-should-not-count-as-prior-art-because-they-cant-run-without-underlying-games/">Game Fray</a>, Nintendo is disputing the defence because it believes mods don't stand on their own as they require an original game to run on. As such, mods shouldn't be subject to patent infringement in the same way Palworld is.</p>

<p>As Game Fray points out, game makers often look to mods for inspiration, so Pocketpair's defence should be valid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/nintendo-reportedly-gets-even-more-obnoxious-about-patent-law-by-taking-a-mods-arent-real-games-stance-against-a-dark-souls-3-mod-that-could-invalidate-its-palworld-lawsuit/">PC Gamer</a> reported Japanese courts have a history of siding with patent lawsuit defendants able to present examples of prior art. That's why Pocketpair is using Pokémon-themed mods as such an example, which Nintendo is now attempting to invalidate.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">Nintendo was granted a patent in the US</a> based on the gameplay mechanic of summoning a sub-character to fight another, which covers whether the summoned character battles on player input or automatically.</p>
<p>Games industry lawyer Richard Hoeg told Eurogamer the patent is "enforceable in so far as it has been granted, but Nintendo likely knows it 'got away with one' here and would prefer not to make a court actually sign off."</p>
<p>Don McGowan, former chief legal officer at The Pokémon Company, meanwhile, believes the patent will likely be ignored.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">Pocketpair has disputed Nintendo's claims</a> as part of the ongoing lawsuit, but has already accommodated changes to Palworld.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pocketpair-to-fix-jank-in-hugely-successful-pokemon-alike-palworld-as-it-pushes-past-nintendos-controversial-lawsuit-towards-full-10-release-in-2026">Palworld is also heading towards a 1.0 release</a> next year as it aims to fix "jank".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Codemasters might have the official F1 license, but that hasn’t stopped indie developers from creating their own take on the premier racing class. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/12/new-star-gp-review/">New Star GP</a> drew on classic Sega arcade racing thrills last year, but speeding toward a fierce braking zone is Formula Legends, the fresh-faced rookie, which has taken the hard-nosed, serious sport and given it a cute, hyper-deformed makeover, all the while attempting to retain the competitive racing action of its inspiration. It’s a pretty successful attempt too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Formula Legends - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgUCx--1qfs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Formula Legends is not officially licensed by the FIA, so there’s no official drivers, no official constructors, and no official tracks. What there is, however, is a roster of drivers inspired by their real-life counterparts, so you can welcome Danny Ricchiordi and Luis Hammerton to the sport, rather than Daniel Ricciardo and Lewis Hamilton. You can laugh your little socks off at Batteri Voltas and Charlie Lacreme, or just enjoy my personal favourite, Hans Troll, simply because of how much it might annoy Lance… or more probably his dad.</p>


<p>Formula Legends takes you through the history of F1, through a lightly distorted lens. Starting in the 1960s, the central Story Mode offers a range of races in each era, providing a taste of the different cars, steadily improving technology, and the changes to the layout of each track over the years.</p>
<p>While they’re not allowed to use the official names for each location, the different tracks and their alternate layouts across the decades are close enough to their real-world inspirations to let you pick out the sweeping curves of Spa-Francorchamps and the iconic setting at Monza. They’re definitely ‘inspired by’ though, so if you think you know the Melbourne Park circuit like the back of the hand, you might need to prepare to stare questioningly at the skin there. In some cases the tracks are mirrored too, presumably to avoid too many angry looks from license holders, so you come away with a flavour of the sport, rather than a full course.</p>


<p>The little F1 race cars we get in Formula Legends are undoubtedly cute to look at, but they’re almost as difficult to drive as the real thing. Dropping things down to Easy, alongside a couple of driving assists for braking and traction control, will likely see you whizz by the competition, and Formula Legends becomes wholly approachable here. Meanwhile, playing on Normal really ramps the difficulty up, and it’s a welcome and rewarding challenge where track knowledge and braking points need to be spot on. The Hard setting following that isn’t as much of a leap, but you will need to drive more or less flawlessly to be in with a chance of a podium.</p>
<p>The AI drivers won’t make that very easy. To say that they’re aggressive would be to downplay just how little they care about whose corner it is, and you’ll be glad to discover that damage is a health bar, rather than individual pace-wrecking components. They’re not really all that smart, and you’ll see them careening off at various points, but when Logan Sargeant was still in the sport up until a year ago, that remains fairly realistic.</p>
<p>I really enjoy Formula Legends handling model. It’s undoubtedly an arcade racer, and they feel more like the toy cars they look like than open-wheel race cars, but once you’ve got into the flow of things, sweeping around corners with surety becomes second nature. You can’t treat it like a simulation, and if you do, you’ll actually come off far worse than you might expect.</p>
<p>There are some interesting nods to realism though, including having to select the right tyres, coping with their degradation, and conducting pitstops. These involve a fun little mini-game where you have to match the right button press, all the while repairing and refuelling your car, before mashing the analogue stick buttons in, and it definitely adds to the experience, especially in a tight race. Alongside that, the attention to detail given to each era is a real treat, from the sepia tones and the pitstop tents of the early years through to the inclusion of BRS – definitely not DRS – in the modern age.</p>

<p>Formula Legends is a small-scale taste of F1, and that becomes more apparent the longer you spend with it. There are no multiplayer modes here, whether local or online, and that’s a real shame for an approachable arcade racer. Equally, there are only 14 tracks, and while that number is buoyed by the different renditions of them across each era, they are fundamentally the same track. When the sport has expanded as far as it has, with sprint races and 24 race seasons, that means there’s some obvious gaps.</p>
<p>Those gaps continue onto the grid, so races host 14 cars, rather than the 20 we’re used to, and the maximum championship length you can create is 14 too – fine if you want to recreate a season from the 1980s, but limited for the modern sport. I’d really like the option of multi-season championships, and racers moving about, but that’s clearly not what Formula Legends is designed for. This is an indie game created with a genuine love for the sport, and it offers a wholly different take from its peers.</p>
<p>Performance on PS5 is generally very good, with crisp, clear visuals that make the most of the cute art design. There’s the tiniest hint of pop in, but it fades into the distance so much that you won’t notice while you’re concentrating on the more immediate racing line. We did also get to check out the Nintendo Switch version, and that’s a wholly different story, with glaring pop-in, massively reduced resolution, and the lack of analogue triggers causing all sorts of issues. Make sure to pick up the PC, PS5 or Xbox versions, and cross your fingers for a Switch 2 update…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>German independent developer Shin'en Games announced that The Touryst Deluxe will be released digitally on the Nintendo Switch 2 next week, on September 25. Pre-orders are already open via the Nintendo eShop at $19.99, and owners of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-touryst-renders-at-6k-4k-on-xbox-series-x-s-it-almost-looks-like-a-good-cgi-movie-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Touryst</a> for the original Switch can upgrade for $4.99.</p>



<p>Compared to the original title (which launched in late 2019 for the Switch before making it to PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5), The Touryst Deluxe will add a new arcade game, new items, new quest, and improved visuals. On the 'docked' or TV mode, it will run at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, while handheld mode runs at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second. Now, it should be noted that this is by no means a heavy game to run. In fact, it already ran at 4K resolution on the Xbox Series S back in 2020.</p>



<p>Finally, the studio confirmed that users will have the option to import existing save data from The Touryst.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Here's a brief overview of The Touryst, courtesy of the developer:</p>



<p><em>You are just arriving at the Monument Islands. Want to go swimming? Or rather take a dive into the deep sea? Or do you want to visit the amusement arcade, do some shopping, dance at the beach party? Fancy some surfing? Or will you talk with the strange old tourist and listen what he has to say about these ancient mysterious monuments..</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Discover exotic islands and explore ancient monuments</em></li>



<li><em>Climb into deep mines and uncover secret passages</em></li>



<li><em>Make the trip you always wanted and enjoy the tourist life</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The Touryst Deluxe will be the second game released by Shin'en for the Nintendo Switch 2 after the launch title <a href="https://wccftech.com/fast-fusion-nintendo-switch-2-q-new-hd-rumble-is-very-impressive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAST FUSION</a>, which also runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with HDR support.</p>

            <p>The great 'dematuring' of videogames continues with reports that Valve are now forbidding "post-launch NSFW content" for games on Steam, even those that are already "adult-only". That's according to Crimson Delight Games, the developers of fantasy RPG Tales of Legendary Lust: Aphrodisia. They launched it on September 15th with adult content warnings, after submitting it to Valve's review process in August, and had planned to add sexy scenes through updates while working on a big DLC expansion for 2026. 
</p>
<p>These updates are not going to happen anymore, apparently because everybody's favourite PG-rated cartoon villains, global payment networks, are putting pressure on Valve. Instead, the updates will need to be submitted as proper official DLC so that Valve can give them a formal review.</p> <!--more-->
<p>This will likely mean more work for the devs and potentially, release delays, compared to the relative ease of publishing an update or patch - as Valve <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/updates">explain in their FAQ</a>, "Steam makes it easy to patch your game or add content at any time that you need to in order to best serve your audience on your schedule".
</p>
<p>"We were told all new adult content for our game has to go through DLC, presumably so it can be reviewed and approved," the developers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1nio69j/valve_no_longer_allows_postlaunch_nsfw_content/">wrote in response to a Reddit post</a> about the situation this week. We don't know the inner workings of Valve / Steam, but we're in a couple of NSFW dev communities and these new rules weren't in place before the Collective Shout uproar and subsequent payment processors' censorship."
</p><p>If you're new to Collective Shout, they're an Australian activist group who campaign against "the objectification of women and sexualisation of girls in media, advertising and popular culture", and are also affiliated with conservative groups who campaign against sex work and pornography at large.</p>
<p>Back in July, Collective Shout <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">claimed credit</a> for stampeding Mastercard, Visa and other payment processing companies and networks into forbidding the transaction of a vast number of sexually themed or otherwise "NSFW" adult games on Steam and Itch, including a lot of games from queer developers. Collective Shout have yet to properly explain which individual games they consider unfit for sale and why.
</p>
<p>Steam and Itch have now changed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">their</a> <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">policies</a> to give the payment networks some control over what counts as acceptable "adult" material. They have also delisted or removed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy">a lot</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">of games</a>, with Itch electing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-are-seeking-out-new-payment-processors-who-are-more-comfortable-with-adult-material">seek out new payment partners</a> while revising their catalogue. Valve are reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-appear-to-be-blocking-mature-themed-games-from-steam-early-access-release">denying the release of "mature" games under Steam early access</a>, possibly because (to echo Crimson Delight's point above) the platform holder needs to be able to review the finished work before approving it for sale. I say 'reportedly' and 'possibly' because Valve still haven't made a formal comment on these recent events. I'll ask them again now.
</p>
<p>In the Reddit thread about the rejected NSFW updates, Crimson Delight have only good things to say about Valve's handling of the situation. "I have to say the reviewer was kind and forthcoming, we didn't feel threatened or bullied in any way, and we got the feeling they were trying to do their best to help devs navigate the process," developer Frenzin writes. "But the fact of the matter is that Valve has payment processors breathing down their neck, and the rules keep getting stricter as time goes on." 
</p><p>"Valve isn't the problem here," Frenzin continues. "The big credit card companies are. If anything, Valve has stood up to them and pushed back. They could've simply nuked the 18+ section of Steam, but they didn't, they stuck up for developers. Obviously adult games make Valve money, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the rest of Steam's catalogue. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> itself probably earned Valve more than most NSFW titles put together.
</p>
<p>"Given that we're erogame devs, we're against any sort of censorship (as long as the content isn't sexualizing minors or nonconsensual in any way)," the developer comments. "But it's important to understand where the real problem lies, and it's not with Valve."
</p>
<p>My very Lukewarm Take regarding the on-going NSFW/mature game crackdown is that people should be allowed to get their rocks off to whatever responsibly created fictitious media they choose in the absence of evidence that they are doing harm, and large finance corporations with no actual mandate to serve the public interest shouldn't <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">play the part of moral sentinel</a>.
</p>
<p>I'd flesh that argument out with reference to Tales of Legendary Lust, but my efforts are hindered by the UK's new Online Safety Act, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-now-require-uk-steam-users-to-verify-their-ages-using-a-credit-card">requires me to verify my age</a> to visit the game's Steam page and visit the developer's subreddit (thanks to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/games-on-steam-can-no-longer-be-updated-with-nsfw-content-post-launch-but-valve-isnt-the-problem-developer-says/">Automaton</a> for being the messenger). I don't have a credit card for Steam verification, and Reddit's camera age verification widget seems to think that my age defies categorisation. Which, you know, fair dos. You can find a SFW version of the game on <a href="https://crimsondelightgames.itch.io/tales-of-legendary-lust-aphrodisia-sfw">Itch</a>, though.</p>

            <p>Zach Cregger's forthcoming Resident Evil film will be an "entirely original story", so won't feature fan-favourite character Leon Kennedy.</p>
<p>The director of recent horror-hit Weapons spoke with <a href="https://ew.com/resident-evil-movie-entirely-original-story-set-game-world-zach-cregger-exclusive-11812968">Entertainment Weekly</a> about his next film, based on Capcom's game series.</p>
<p>"When you watch it, you'll be like, 'This is very Zach'," he said. "It's just [that] it takes place in the Resident Evil world. I don't think fans of the games are gonna be bummed."</p>
<p>Weapons star Austin Abrams will lead the Resident Evil film cast, with actor and professional wrestler Paul Walter Hauser also confirmed. Cregger has co-written the script with Shay Hatten.</p>
<p>"I'm not gonna steal Leon and put him in an original story. I think that would be presumptuous," said Cregger. "But I respect the games enough where I'm gonna like tell a Resident Evil story in the Resident Evil canon that still leaves everything they love intact from the games, you know what I mean?"</p><p>He added: "I think that when you see it, you'll understand how I can be obsessed with original ideas and still make a movie that is an IP-based thing. I know that doesn't make a lot of sense now, but I hope that it will later."</p>
<p>In a previous interview, Cregger stated the film "lives" in the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> and 3, but "adheres more to the tone of 4". What's more, the viewing experience will be akin to the journey players take in the game, following a protagonist from A to B "as they just descend deeper and deeper and deeper into hell".</p>
<p>Cregger's Resident Evil film is set for a release on 18th September 2026.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/19/tencent-hit-back-at-sonys-lawsuit-over-light-of-motiram/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-hit-back-at-sony%E2%80%99s-lawsuit-over-light-of-motiram.1302315/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tencent have rebuffed Sony’s claims that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/light-of-motiram/">Light of Motiram</a> is a “slavish clone” of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/horizon-zero-dawn/">Horizon franchise</a> and that it copies multiple elements from they games that would confuse consumers.&nbsp; Sony asked the court to award unspecified damages and block the release of Light of Motiram, Tencent are asking for the whole thing to be thrown out of court.</p>
<p><iframe title="Light of Motiram - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0Of5Xjdwbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Plaintiff Sony has sued a grab-bag of Tencent companies—and ten unnamed defendants—about the unreleased video game&nbsp;Light of Motiram, alleging that the game copies elements from Sony’s game&nbsp;Horizon Zero Dawn and its spinoffs,” the complaint reads, according to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/">TheGamePost.</a></p>
<p>“At bottom, Sony’s effort is not aimed at fighting off piracy, plagiarism, or any genuine threat to intellectual property. It is an improper attempt to fence off a well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it Sony’s exclusive domain.”</p>
<p>I won’t bore you with the rest of the legal waffle but the short version is that Tencent claim that elements such as a red-haired heroine, robotic creatures, and ruined cities are tropes that can be found in many video games, and they give examples such as Far Cry, BioMutant, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west/">Enslaved: Odyssey to the West</a>. Sony themselves published a Ninja Theory game with a red haired heroine, Heavenly Sword, but that doesn’t get a mention.</p>

<p>“In Sony’s telling, Horizon Zero Dawn is ‘like no fictional world created before [or] since.’ That claim is startling, because it is flatly contradicted by Sony’s own developers, not to mention the long history of video games featuring the same elements that Sony seeks to monopolize through this lawsuit,” say Tencent.</p>
<p>That line about Sony’s own developers may be a problem for the PlayStation giant. Sony released a documentary about the making of Horizon Zero Dawn, and in it, Jan-Bart Van Beek, the art director for the game, references Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and suggests the new Horizon title is similar: “I don’t think we should do this; it touches too much of these other points.”</p>
<p>“Long before this lawsuit was filed, the developers of Horizon Zero Dawn publicly acknowledged that the very same game elements that, today, Sony claims to own exclusively, were in fact borrowed from an earlier game,” say Tencent.&nbsp;Enslaved is an action game with mechanical beasties set in a ruined landscape but the hero is male, the red-haired character, Trip, is not playable.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enslaved: Odyssey to the West - PS3  Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nzwQX_orYf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking at Enslaved at first glance it does resemble Horizon but I don’t think Tencent have much of a chance, Sony’s complaint isn’t really about claiming all the individual elements are their own, they are claiming the combination of all these things, along with the art style and music, make Light of Motiram a copy of Horizon.&nbsp; Their claim is comparable to a claim over music copyright; there are only so many notes and everyone uses them, but if you put them in the same order as someone else, then you are making a copy.</p>
<p>Tencent have recently <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/11/all-similarities-between-light-of-motiram-and-horizon-have-been-wiped-from-steam/">wiped every similarity between Light of Motiram and Horizon from the Steam store page</a> and removed all official videos of the game. References to world a “overrun by colossal machines” called “mechanimals” has been removed, as have all the shots of the beasts and the Aloy-like heroine.</p>
<p>Now, can we please, please have that remaster of Enslaved now?</p>

                <p>After several years of being a PlayStation console exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-release-date-confirmed/1100-6534646/">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is headed to Xbox Series X|S and Switch 2</a> in early 2026. Depending on how confident you feel, the game can be fairly challenging with its blend of real-time combat and action-RPG elements. But if you're looking to cruise through each battle and just focus on the story, then you can choose to play the game with the "Streamlined Progression" options enabled.</p><p>This makes Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade even easier than the old-school combat mode that slows the action to a crawl with menu-based commands, giving you an extended window to choose your tactics. Streamlined Progression gives you unlimited MP and HP at all times, unlimited limit and ATB gauges during battles, and every attack will deal a whopping 9,999 points of damage.</p><p>Additionally, you'll gain a faster weapon ability charge, and with some exceptions, you'll always possess the maximum number of items at all times. This mode can be toggled on and off at any given time from the main menu.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4570949-ff7-remake-mode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570949" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4570949-ff7-remake-mode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570949"></a><figcaption>Sephiroth won't be smiling for long.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4570949-ff7-remake-mode.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-mtg-preorder-bonuses-release-date/1100-6534723/">Square Enix has also revealed several of the preorder bonuses</a> for the launch of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on new platforms. Players who preorder the digital edition will receive the original Final Fantasy 7 game to download and play--this offer expires on January 31, 2026--and if you preorder the physical edition, you'll get a Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Play Booster pack of 15 cards with it.</p><p>While it doesn't have a release date yet, Square Enix has confirmed that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will also be headed to Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S in the future.

			<p>While CD PROJEKT RED is focused mainly on The Witcher IV, work at the new Boston office is already ongoing on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel codenamed Project Orion. As of July 2025, 116 developers were already on the project, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently in the pre-production phase</a>. That number is expected to grow steadily, including an intriguing new position for Lead Network Engineer that already has fans guessing at potential online multiplayer modes. Here's the relevant excerpt from the <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/jobs/20217-lead-network-engineer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job ad</a>:  </p>



<p><em>CD PROJEKT RED is currently seeking a Lead Network Engineer to join our team working on Cyberpunk 2, the next mainline Cyberpunk 2077 game. As a Lead Network Engineer, you and your team will play a pivotal role in designing and implementing the network architecture and online systems. You will lead and manage a team of talented engineers, working collaboratively to ensure seamless and robust online systems.</em></p>



<p><em>We are seeking a candidate with a blend of proven management experience and technical expertise in networking for games.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Design, implement, and maintain scalable and efficient network architectures for online features.</em></li>



<li><em>Ensure low-latency, high-performance online experiences for players.</em></li>



<li><em>Lead your team to develop and optimize multiplayer systems, including matchmaking, and address challenges related to latency, bandwidth usage, and server performance.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><em><strong>Qualifications</strong></em></p>



<p><em>Proven track record of leadership in a senior network engineering role</em></p>



<p>As our readers might recall, Cyberpunk 2077 was supposed to receive online multiplayer post-launch. However, just a few months after the game's December 2020 release, CD PROJEKT RED d<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-plan-reconsidered-by-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ecided to reconsider its multiplayer strategy</a>, effectively delaying it so that it might be applied to future projects instead. That made sense at the time, especially due to Cyberpunk 2077's launch issues, such as bugs and performance, particularly on consoles.</p>



<p>Now, the studio appears to believe it's time to go all-in for the sequel. We never really got any inkling as to how the multiplayer would work in the first game, but given the open world city setting, fans have speculated that it could play not too dissimilar to GTA Online, albeit with its own twists.</p>



<p>Recently, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/keanu-reeves-absolutely-play-johnny-silverhand-cyberpunk-2077-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that Keanu Reeves would love to return as Johnny Silverhand in the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel. Mike Pondsmith, creator of the fictional universe, also <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that there will be a second city in addition to Night City, and that it will feel like 'Chicago gone wrong'.</p>



<p>It's worth noting that Project Orion is at least four or five years away, if not more. Fans will have to brace for a long wait.</p>

<p>If you don't want any spoilers, you might want to navigate away from this page now. Right, with this out of the way, according to fan site <a href="https://x.com/sonicstadium/status/1968776533654307043">The Sonic Stadium</a>, Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/mega_man">Mega Man</a> series will be featured in the Season Pass, filling the "last paid DLC" collab slot.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app for Switch Online subscribers typically gets one update per week, but this week is a little bit different.</p>
<p>Following the shadow drop of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a> DLC on the Switch 2 last week, Nintendo has now added a "special release" to this app featuring select music from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. It's similar to the recent update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, which also added a handful of tracks.</p>
<p>Here's a sample of the tracks in this update including Kong Bananza, 2D Challenge Course #1 (Jungle Level), and Breaking Through (Heart of Gold). You can have a listen below:</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4xgvywp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo has also rolled out new themed Switch Online icons based on the new DLC for Donkey Kong Bananza. The first wave starts this week and will be followed by three other waves. Here's a look at the icons up for grabs:</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/endless-legend-2-review-impressions-early-access</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/endless-legend-2-is-another-reminder-that-4x-games-are-leaving-me-behind-and-it-sucks.1302213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there's one genre of game I've spent more time playing in the past decade than any other--<a href="https://aftermath.site/order-of-battle-ww2-turn-based-tactics-game-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than MLGAM tactics games</a>, more than<a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sports games</a>, more than quaint little European games about running a bus company--it's 4X. From <em>Civilization </em>to <em>Endless Legend</em> to <em>Stellaris </em>to <em>Humankind</em>, I've spent thousands of hours exploring, expanding, exploiting and exterminating, but as the calendar creeps closer to 2026 I don't know if I've ever felt further from the things I love about them.</p><p>I've written about this before:<a href="https://kotaku.com/civilization-civ-vi-6-review-2023-retrospective-pc-sid-1850242218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in my fading feelings for <em>Civ VI</em></a>, followed by<a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the crushing disappointment of <em>Civ VII</em></a>. How<a href="https://aftermath.site/humankind-re-review-amplitude-impressions-pc-sega-4x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Humankind</em> is now merely OK instead of Not Great</a>. How<a href="https://aftermath.site/millennia-4x-paradox-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> many of the newcomers to the genre have got nearly everything about it wrong</a>. It really feels like something is going increasingly awry at the heart of the genre, and <em>Endless Legend 2</em>--an Early Access game I've been playing for the past week--is no exception.</p><p>To recap: the original was released back in 2014, adding tactical battles and some cool factional and narrative twists to what was even then looking like a genre in need of some fresh air. And it worked! People <em>loved </em>that game,<a href="https://kotaku.com/endless-legend-the-kotaku-review-1655274702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> myself included</a>, and so fans have been hanging out for a <em>very </em>long time to play the sequel, arriving on September 22 in Early Access 11 years later.</p><p>The thing is, a lot has changed in those 11 years. After years of listing to port, <em>Civilization </em>appears to have finally run aground, and in the middle of that decade <em>Endless Legend's</em> developers, Amplitude, released their own wannabe <em>Civ</em>-killer, <em>Humankind</em>, a game that had some very cool ideas but which also robbed the 4X experience of a lot of its personality, and ended up being pretty boring as a result. I think of all <em>Civ VII's</em> missteps, the worst was that it copied the parts of <em>Humankind </em>that least needed copying. Sadly (if not surprisingly, given it’s the same studio!), <em>Endless Legend 2</em> has now done the same thing.</p><p><em>Endless Legend 2</em> is a game that simultaneously looks gorgeous but is also overwhelming. That appears busy but feels meaningless, because so many of your endless (sorry) notifications are for the most mundane pieces of city-building. There's so much going on at all times, but I quickly found myself numb to the drudgery of progression, of endlessly (SORRY) encountering the same people triggering the same dialogue. <em>Humankind </em>had this same problem, in that watching all those units swoosh around on such a beautiful map is meditative, but not <em>interesting</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ENDLESS™ Legend 2 - Reveal Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5rvxUoYFDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I want to find whoever is responsible for modern 4X's obsession with adjacency bonuses and their resultant megacities and tell them just how disappointed I am. The enormous settlements you have to build in <em>Endless Legend 2</em>--just like those you have to build in <em>Humankind</em>, and <em>Civ VI</em>, and <em>Civ VII</em>--sprawl across half a continent, look ridiculous and even become gameplay concerns later on because, with so much else going on and gently pinging you constantly on the interface, and with 117 units gliding across the screen at all times, you can completely miss the fact they're <em>under attack</em>.</p><p>For all the issues I’ve raised thus far, <em>Endless Legend 2</em> also continues many of the best things about <em>Endless Legend 1</em>, like asymmetrical factions and a very strong insistence on weaving story into the game. The former feels pretty limited right now (only five factions were available in the build I played, meaning you just keep running into the same leaders all the time), and the latter does a much better job of weaving the story into your games, down to turning dialogue options into victory pathway selections, which is a <em>fantastic </em>idea. But again, with the same story repeating each playthrough, and this being the kind of game designed to be played through a <em>lot</em>, it gets tired pretty quickly.</p><p><em>Endless Legend 2</em> also has maybe the single most fascinating 4X twist I've ever seen, in that you start the game on a reasonably normal map--some different types of identifiably Earth-like climate, surrounded by ocean--and then throughout the game these huge storms happen, after which the ocean gets sucked out and the amount of landmass keeps increasing in its place. In theory it's like <em>Civ VII's</em> map getting bigger at the exploration age, but in practice it's much more dramatic, even visually; while the original land area is full of grass and forests, the "new" land is a variety of weird alien undersea stuff. The first time it happened, I gasped. But like so many other attempts at 4X innovation, I'm not sure I'm into it in the longterm, because once the novelty wore off it made the map feel both crowded and indistinct, every game ending up a single chaotic mass of regions all sharing land borders.</p><p>One thing I did like without reservation was the way it continues to get right into the weeds of jacking the game full of fantasy RPG stuff. Your hero units can be levelled up and equipped with loot, but they also just pop up sometimes to have conversations. You can even build them little houses on the map where they can, uh, get married to other characters in the game? Which then prompts even more little dialogue sequences and hero perks? It's wonderful stuff, and really has you investing in the <em>character </em>of your best units.</p><figure></figure><p>Maybe my genre gripes are just a me problem, or at least a generational problem for others who have been playing 4X games for so long. I've been playing Civilization since the first game's release back in 1991; it's now 2025, so it would be totally normal for me to be numb to so much of the genre's bedrock. And yet,<a href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I still find myself drawn to older games built on that very bedrock</a>, and have become increasingly turned off by newer games’ attempts to shift the genre's boundaries.</p><p>This has become a piece about so many other games, not just <em>Endless Legend 2</em>, because so many of these games have done the same thing. The two biggest studios making the two biggest series of 4X games, responsible for nearly all of its best-selling titles of the past decade, are both trying to take the genre to a place that I just...don't like.</p><p>4X games became a thing because they empowered players and let them feel things in a strategy game they'd never felt before. The feeling of being a small tribe, alone in an unknown world, facing the darkness. Of running into rivals who were passionate and erratic and memorable as characters, not just AI trading partners. Of the world you knew so little about feeling <em>vast</em>. And while there was management to be done, so much of the more tedious stuff was kept under the hood.</p><p>Firaxis and Amplitude's more recent games, built with <em>Civ's</em> own board game heritage in mind, have shrunk the borders of that world. Everything feels smaller, less like a planet, more like a game of <em>Catan </em>confined to your dining room table. And the numbers, whose obfuscation was once the point, are now everywhere. These are no longer games about exploring, expanding, exploiting and exterminating. They're about adjacency bonuses.</p><p>Which is fine to a point; the formula has been shaken up because it needed to be, I'm not questioning that. Innovation is good! But I had such high hopes for <em>Endless Legend 2</em>, given how much I loved its predecessor, so I've been bummed to see it fall into the same pothole as so many other big games in this space lately.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't know if things will always be like this, or whether they're just a consequence of the game launching perhaps a little too early into Early Access (I’ve played an early release of this build, which goes on sale on September 22). In 6-12 months’ time, who knows: Amplitude might add more factions and story options to the point where things feel more fleshed out and hang together a bit more elegantly.</p><p>Until then, though, I'm left looking at a game that promised so much, but has slipped on the same ol' banana peels, and also maybe launched a bit too soon. It'll take some time, and work, before I want to spend another whole week with it.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/arma-trans-platoon"><h3>Arma Can Be A Boys Club, But This Trans Women-Only Platoon Aims To Change That</h3></a><p>'It’s a community that is made for the trans community...

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I do like to play co-op games. Luckily for me, there’s enough of us kicking around in TSA towers that we’re able to generally find someone of a similar mind to play a game with. If you’re a Nintendo Switch owner, you’re probably pretty used to the odd spot of co-op too, and that’s about to get better as today marks the launch of two of the greatest co-op puzzle adventures of all time, appearing for the first time for Nintendo’s handheld hybrid. Those games are the iconic We Were Here and We Were Here Too, the first two games in the We Were Here series. </p>
<p><iframe title="We Were Here &amp; We Were Here Too Launch Trailer I Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUn4X9HajDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frankly, if you’ve got a co-op buddy to call on, I’d tell you to just go and pick them up now, but if not, then here’s a little context in order to get you interested. The We Were Here series has captivated players with its co-op puzzle designs and challenging duos to think outside the box since 2017, when We Were Here launched as a free game that has now been downloaded almost 10 million times. </p>
<p>Since then, the We Were Here series has been enjoyed by more than 20 million players. We Were Here Expeditions: The FriendShip is the latest release and it broke all previous records out of the water by hitting more than 8 million downloads within its first year. The puzzling adventures are playable in any order, although a common narrative thread runs through them.</p>
<p>Communication and lateral thinking are your two biggest weapons in the We Were Here series, and things are made all the more interesting by physically having to activate the in-game walkie-talkie to communicate with your teammate. This leads to all sorts of shenanigans on the way to solving each puzzle, and there’s just such a strong sense of identity and visual design that you can’t help but be drawn ever further into its idisyncratic world. </p>

<p>Players can pre-purchase the third entry of the series, We Were Here Together, on September 25 in the Nintendo eShop. A demo will then also be playable from September 25 to 28 at the Total Mayhem Games booth at Tokyo Game Show. The release of We Were Here Together will follow on October 9.</p>
<p>The We Were Here series, including We Were Here, We Were Here Too, and We Were Here Together, has also undergone significant enhancements. These include a visual overhaul, updated user interface, expanded settings, additional language translations, bug fixes, and cross-platform compatibility with PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. These updates are also making their way to other platforms, with full implementation expected by 9 October 2025.</p>
<p>﻿The We Were Here games will be fully compatible with Nintendo Switch™ and Nintendo Switch™ 2. A Nintendo Switch Online Membership and a headset with a microphone (or a different way to communicate with your partner) will be required to play the We Were Here Series on Nintendo Switch™ and Nintendo Switch 2).</p>

		<p>Sometimes, a game speaks to you before you know anything about it. Absolum, the latest collaboration between DotEmu, Supamonks and Guard Crush, captures your attention with every single glance thanks to its incredible visual design, but it’s fair to say that being beautiful is not its only trick. Excited Rogue ’em up fans can get a new glimpse of the hard-hitting combat and exploration in the latest gameplay trailer, stoking the fires of excitement even further.</p>
<p><iframe title="Absolum | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3zhPXKrv3M?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For anyone that grew up on games like Golden Axe, Streets of Rage and Final Fight, Absolum will immediately hit home, as you stroll from left to right dealing out as much damage as possible against a host of horrible monsters and their evil accomplices. This isn’t quite your dad’s beat ’em up though, as Absolum straps on a modern Roguelike structure, making the way that you progress, improve and evolve an ever-shifting experience as you search for the perfect run.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game earlier in the year – when I say we, I mean me – and I came away thoroughly impressed with the beautiful visuals and the exceptional combat. That’s hardly surprising when you think that DotEmu and Guard Crush are just coming off the success of games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-platforming-perfection/">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>. </p>


<p>Looking back, I said, “On early impressions alone, Guard Crush have crafted something truly special with Absolum. It looks and sounds incredible, and the Roguelike action is made all the more tantalising by discovering new areas and hideous enemies to fight. I can’t wait to see more.” After this new trailer, that’s truer than ever, and there’s not all that long to wait now, with Absolum set to release on October 9th for PC, Switch and PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 as well. </p>
