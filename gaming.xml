            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/06/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-30-to-26/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As we approach the midway point of our Most Wanted Games of 2025 list, there’s a suitably odd mish-mash of genres, new and old IP, and styles of game. From the turn-based RPG of Clair Obscur, to Borderlands 4’s looter shooter, and then onward to the Telltale successor studio’s superhero-infused Dispatch, there’s some great variety here.</p>
<h2>30 – Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBA</em></p>
<p>JRPGs are in a really good place right now, but who says you have to be a Japanese studio or developer to make a game in this style? French studio Sandfall Interactive has taken inspiration from this subgenre, belndingit with a Belle Epoque France fantasy world to create the turn-based RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dLBUD08_3A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-preview-a-poignant-and-painterly-rpg/">Poignant and painterly</a>, as I described it for our Gamescom preview, the game sees you follow yet another doomed expedition as they venture out to try and stop the Paintress from literally just ending the lives of people of a certain age. It will lean in on the tried and true turn-based RPG combat, with a few invigorating twists mixed in, such as an active QTE element and Persona-like menus fanning out from characters. This could be a real treat for fans of the genre.</p>

<h2>29 – Borderlands 4</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the planet Kairos, a world that’s dominated by a ruthless dictator known as the Timekeeper, with an army of synthetic followers known as the Order. You, of course, will play as a Vault Hunter searching for mythical alien treasures in a race against time against the Timekeeper to uncover it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official First Look" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/26vY2GMfYTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You pretty much know what to expect from Borderlands 4, with the procedurally generated loot pushing you on through each battle and mission, and a humour-filled script that will thankfully tone down the toilet humour of Borderlands 3. We’re yet to really be introduced to the Vault Hunters that will lead this adventure, but the gameplay first look showed an impressive sense of scale and slick snippets of action.</p>
<h2>28 – Dispatch</h2>
<p><em>PC, Consoles – 2025</em></p>
<p>Coming from the minds behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tales-from-the-borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-wolf-among-us">The Wolf Among Us</a>, and with a cast that features Aaron Paul, Laura Bailey and Jeffrey Wright, Dispatch is a narrative adventure that’s well worth paying attention to.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DISPATCH | Official Reveal Trailer - Extended Cut (HD)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbERWU5bc50?feature=oembed" width="780" height="439" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Casting you as a de-suited Robert Roberston, formerly known as Mecha Man, this is a superhero workplace comedy that sees him adapt to life without powers. He still has a role to play in the community, but as a part of the dispatch centre team, charged with rehabilitating ex-supervillains as they go straight. Between the narrative moments, you’ll also have to manage those heroes, sending them out to answer calls, managing their particular skills and helping to unlock their full potential.</p>
<h2>27 – Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC</em></p>
<p>The early 2000s and PS2 era is proving to be a fertile source for modern remakes, and Konami is the latest to try to get in on the action with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. Having been rumoured for years, this MGS3 remake was confirmed back in 2023, with 2024 giving us a couple of additional glimpses of cutscenes and story.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - Official Trailer #2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sk6VdMoAgTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Very little is really known about the remake, how much the gameplay is being tweaked and modernised, but you can see from the cutscene-heavy trailers that the game does look pretty fab with Unreal Engine 5 powering it, and they’ve kept a lot of that Kojima tone.</p>
<h2>26 – The Sinking City 2</h2>
<p>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</p>
<p>After all the trials and tribulations that Frogwares went through with the first game, it’s great to see The Sinking City 2 coming from Frogwares. This one’s a little bit different, though, with the team diving in on a full horror experience.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Sinking City 2 | World Premiere Trailer (PC, PS5, Xbox Series)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLIOZg9NzUU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Taking us to 1920s Arkham – the Lovecraft one, not the Batman one – there’s still plenty of cosmic horror here, and you’re still trawling through a flooded city, but the detective elements of the first game have been toned down a lot. Combat and exploration will be the main focus now, the city and world you can explore will be smaller, and the team is aiming to have a much stronger visual horror as well.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since we’ve heard an update on this one – Frogwares has its roots as a Ukrainian studio, so there’s some real hardships that they’ve faced this past few years – but we hope to hear and see more on this soon if they’re to hit their 2025 release target.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-9-million-units/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-9-million-units.1074630/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-9-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Japanese publisher and developer CAPCOM <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1876175498398822673" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the Resident Evil 4 remake has sold over nine million units since its debut in late March 2023. It is no doubt a remarkable result, especially when considering that the game is essentially the same as the 2005 classic from a content standpoint.</p>
<p>The first three million units <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-surpass-3-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were sold</a>&nbsp;<span>just two days after launch. The fourth million mark&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was passed</a>&nbsp;in early April 2023, while the fifth&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was reached</a> in late July 2023. CAPCOM provided the next sales update around the game's first anniversary, when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-over-7-million-units-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that&nbsp;</span>the Resident Evil 4 remake had sold over seven million copies.</p>
<p>The game was well received overall by critics, too, though our own Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn't quite love it</a> (but still gave it an 8.5 out of 10):</p>
<p><em>Now, I have to say, while the tone of the last few paragraphs has been a bit negative, whether we’re talking about the original or the remake, Resident Evil 4 is still a very good game. I may be a bit disappointed by the scope and ambition of Capcom’s reimagining, but RE4 is still one of the most inventive and engaging action-horror games ever made, and this is a competent, technically-impressive new version of the game. The village battle may be largely the same, but it still gets your blood pumping. Same goes for the cabin defense sequence, your showdown with the village chief, or your first encounter with a Regenerator. The Resident Evil 4 remake is still a fun, bombastic dose of mayhem, I just feel like it had the potential to be even better. It also suffers from the fact that Resident Evil Village was, in some ways, the bigger, crazier take on RE4 that this remake could have been.</em></p>
<p>2025 might be a big year for the franchise, at least when it comes to announcements. Resident Evil 9 is expected to be unveiled, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rumor-resident-evil-9-reportedly-launching-in-second-half-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potentially with a late 2025 launch window</a>, and there are already rumors that the atmosphere will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired by Resident Evil 4</a> while also having two 'unkillable stalkers' possibly inspired by Resident Evil 3's Nemesis. The playable characters are rumored to be two of the most iconic protagonists in the series: Jill Valentine (Resident Evil 1, Resident Evil 3, Resident Evil 5) and Leon Kennedy (Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 6).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k23-servers-officially-closed-down-today/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For many, this doesn't come as a surprise. WWE 2K23 was removed from all storefronts on November 1, 2024. It's now been taken one step further, with all online functionality for the title being removed. This means that anyone who was hoping to scrap against their friends in some online matches will no longer be able to do so. Instead, you will now have to resort to purchasing the latest game in the franchise, WWE 2K24. This title was only released in March 2024, and with an economic crisis and games being relatively pricey, people have to pick and choose which games they're picking up and when.</p>
<p>For a fair amount of players, WWE 2K23 losing online functionality won't affect them whatsoever. However, for those who haven't had the chance or funds to pick up the latest game in the franchise, it does make the franchise inaccessible. Compared to previous titles, this game didn't even have long in terms of online functionality, as it lasted less than two years before all of the servers were pulled.</p>
<p>Thus far, 2K hasn't given a reason as to why WWE 2K23's servers have closed down, just the broad statement that they were shutting down when announcing that the game was equally being pulled from storefronts in November. The message reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>WWE 2K23 is getting its final takedown. As of January 6, 2025 the servers will be discontinued. This includes all online functions, such as online matches and Community Creations. You will no longer be able to access any online game mode after this point. However, if you already own the game you will be able to continue to play offline modes.</em></p>
<p>Whether they will announce why this has happened is uncertain, as they commonly shut down servers for their old sports games, such as NBA 2K23 also being delisted from digital storefronts in December, 2024. However, some fans were expecting that 2K would push the date back and give fans more time with WWE 2K23. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.</p>
<p>Now, the only game in the WWE franchise that has online functionality is <a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k24-launch-roster-vince-mcmahon-brock-lesnar/">WWE 2K24</a>. If you want to purchase this game, the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1001-PPSA16306_00-WWE2K24CROSSGEN0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standard edition</a> of the title will set you back around $69.99. There are also many different editions and bundles you can get, which can set you back up to a whopping $139.99, depending on what edition of the game you get. However, the most expensive version of the game does come in a bundle with NBA 2K25 and TopSpin 2K25. These games have recently been on sale for the festive period, but the sale is soon ending, meaning those who want to get their hands on the new wrestling game will have to pay top price for it.</p>
<p>Will you miss WWE 2K23?</p>

		<p>WWE 2K23’s servers have now been shut down, with 2K sunsetting all online functionality for the wrestling game. This means, currently, the only WWE game with online functionality is WWE 2K24, which was released in March 2024. WWE 2K23 was released in March 2023, meaning the online functions of the game lasted less than two years. The game had already been removed from digital storefronts on November 1st, 2024.</p>

<p>In its announcement about the WWE 2K23 server closures, 2K wrote, <em>“WWE 2K23 is getting its final takedown. As of January 6, 2025 the servers will be discontinued.This includes all online functions, such as online matches and Community Creations. You will no longer be able to access any online game mode after this point, however if you already own the game you will be able to continue to play offline modes.”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/29/wwe-2k23-review/">WWE 2K23 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our WWE 2K23 review, Adrian said, <em>“As a wrestling fan, I want to create five-star classic matches, with back-and-forth action, near falls, and iconic moments, but ultimately WWE 2K23 cannot facilitate that. Messy and overly complicated controls hamper those efforts, but it’s 2K’s obsession with players winning matches that ensure this professional wrestling game misses the point entirely.”</em></p>

<p>This server shutdown follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/01/nba-2k23-has-now-been-delisted/">NBA 2K23’s servers</a> being taken offline on December 31st, 2024, after being delisted from digital storefronts at the end of November. This is standard practice for 2K, as the company turns off servers it’s big sports games only a couple of years after release to focus on the latest titles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-assassins-creed-in-any-order/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong> is one of the most legendary franchises in gaming history, with a series stretching back over fifteen years. It’s an iconic, open-world collection that boasts ambitious adventures, immersive stories, and memorable characters. But, given that there are dozens of games in the series, we’re asking (and answering) an all-important question: ‘Can you play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed/">Assassin’s Creed</a> in any order?’</p>



<p>Some die-hard fans might have their ideal chronology, but in this guide, we’re looking on a more general scale. If you’re wondering what order to play Assassin’s Creed in, look no further than this guide.</p>



<p>Perhaps you can use it to get an idea of the size of the franchise ahead of the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows on February 14.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-many-assassin-s-creed-games-are-there">How Many Assassin’s Creed Games Are There?</h2>



<p>It’s a rich and storied franchise that can be traced back to 2007. It’s a little-known fact, but <em>Assassin’s Creed’s</em> origins rest with <em><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/prince-of-persia/">Prince of Persia</a></em>. It was later revealed that 2007’s <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> title, which kicked off the franchise, was an experiment, with the project being twisted from the failed development of a<em> Prince of Persia</em> game. </p>



<p>In total, there are <strong>13</strong> major <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games and several more spin-off titles that were typically released on handheld consoles and mobile devices. It’s a franchise that has taken players from Ancient Greece to Victorian London, and with each new release, the lore gets richer, deeper, and more immersive.</p>



<p>With that in mind, can you play<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>in any order?</p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-games-planned/">Ubisoft Has 11 Assassin’s Creed Games Planned</a></strong></h6>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-assassin-s-creed-in-any-order">Can You Play Assassin’s Creed in Any Order?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Technically, no restrictions are blocking you from playing<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>in whatever order you so desire, but some barricades might make the experience a little confusing.</p>



<p>For instance, if you wanted to soak up the entire timeline in order of release, you’d start with <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> (2007) and end with <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage </em>(2023). But, if you wanted to play the series in chronological order, you’d start with <em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em> (2018) and end with <em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em> (2015). </p>



<p>With the most recent releases, Ubisoft pivoted to an RPG-based model, with each game more or less being a standalone title with only a few concepts and aspects connecting them. For instance, Assassin’s Creed Origins (2017), Assassin’s Creed Odyssey (2018), and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (2020) can all be experienced as standalone games but there is an underlying story that connects them.</p>



<p>It’s not as jarring an experience as if you were to play the older games as standalone titles, though. For example,<em> Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood</em> (2010) was a direct sequel to <em>Assassin’s Creed II</em> (2009). The former game starts in the exact scenes where the latter game ends, so if you’ve not played<em> Assassin’s Creed II</em>, <em>Brotherhood </em>will be disorienting until you’ve managed to catch up on the story.</p>

<h2 id="h-does-that-answer-your-question">Does That Answer Your Question?</h2>



<p>If you’ve been wondering what order to play<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> in, we hope that’s cleared things up. There are a few ways to soak up the franchise, but ultimately, it’s up to you in which order you play the games. Realistically, if you were to play them in order of release, you’d be neck-deep in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games for several hundred hours.</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s best to start with the most recent titles and track backwards if you want to learn about the origins of the series and what it all means. You can also skip some games if you don’t feel like they’d interest you. It’s your journey, after all. There might not be any one ‘best Assassin’s Creed order’.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-dead-island-3-coming-out/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-dead-island-3-coming-out-everything-we-know.1074468/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-dead-island-3-coming-out/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was almost ten years between Dead Island 2 being revealed and it being released – and fans are hoping that history doesn’t repeat itself. During the closing scenes of Dead Island 2, there are suggestions made that point to a follow-up title being delivered, but we need to dig into that idea to see the truth in it.</p>



<p>Is Dead Island 3 coming out? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-long-until-dead-island-3-is-released">How Long Until Dead Island 3 Is Released?</h2>



<p>Dambuster Studios, the developer that finally created Dead Island 2 in all its zombie-slaying glory, is reportedly ‘prepared for Dead Island 3.’ In <a href="https://gamerant.com/dead-island-2-release-sequel-threequel-when-dambuster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview with Game Rant</a>, one developer at the studio revealed that the team has ‘set the stage’ for an eventual release of Dead Island 3, given how the second game closes out. </p>



<p>It’s very open-ended – but don’t worry, I won’t spoil it here.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that the ending – and how it was laid out – would facilitate an expansive sequel, but is Dambuster Studios truly committed to delivering it? Are we going to have history repeat itself, seeing Dead Island 3 announced and then put on a back burner for ten years?</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Dead Island 2 suffered so greatly because it kept changing hands. If it stays with Dambuster Studios – which it should – then there’s almost no doubt that Dead Island 3 will come out at some point in the next few years.</p>



<p>Dead Island 2 was an overwhelming success, with many post-apocalyptic gamers being all too eager to get their hands on a game that they’d waited a decade for. It secured <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-2-1m-sales-zombies/">over one million sales</a> in a relatively short time – just a few days. It went on to remain successful, with Dambuster releasing a string of expansions and content drops that kept the player base fully engaged for many months to follow.</p>



<p>But what about a sequel?</p>



<p>Ultimately, to answer the question, ‘Is Dead Island 3 coming out,’ we’ll have to say that we honestly don’t know – but we can wait and hope that something is revealed in a year or two, perhaps. </p>

<h2>How To Redeem Infinity Nikki Codes</h2>
<p>To redeem Infinity Nikki codes, you need to have access to your Pear-Pal. You get this once you have met Dada Florawish Stylist's Guild. This is very early on in the story, so you'll find this area quickly. Once you've done that, there will be a gear icon below the Pear-Pal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the Gear, and it will open the Settings menu.</li>
<li>Select 'Other'</li>
<li>There will be a Redeem Code box</li>
<li>Click on it and enter your code</li>
<li>Press 'Apply'</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your code has been entered correctly, you will get the rewards from the code. It will give you a notification about the items you've been given for using the code. There may be a message telling you that the code is incorrect or expired. As we said earlier, the codes are time-sensitive, and it's possible that the codes have now expired, and you will no longer be able to get rewards for them. Check out the expired codes below to see if the one you tried to enter is on the list.</p>

			<p>2024, what a year. It has seen the utter decimation of thousands of jobs, the failures of countless "Triple-A" games and a few <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skull-and-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Quadruple-A" games</a>, and a general downturn in the games industry. My favourite genres - strategy and simulation - haven't had a great year, with few marquee titles. Even the stalwart of the simulation genre, Football Manager, <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-delayed-until-march-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was delayed</a> in a move that made 2024 the break from the annual saga that started in 2003 (for the best, in my opinion) - and a number on my <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most anticipated</a> list did not see a release, with one cancellation.</p>
<p>We can't be talking about games that haven't even come out yet; we need to be talking about Strategy and Simulation games that have been released, so let's dive into Wccftech's Best Strategy and Simulation Games of 2024. As always, games that aren't released cannot be used on this list, so there are no early-access titles, nor can remasters.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC/Expansion</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adventure</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2024-hop-skip-jump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platformer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-multiplayer-games-of-2024-with-or-against-friends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiplayer</a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-sports-racing-games-of-2024-switching-gears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports &amp; Racing</a>.</em></p>

<h2>Homeworld 3 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/homeworld-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.5/10</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Strategy (Real-Time Strategy).&nbsp; <strong>Platform:</strong> PC.</p>
<p>It's most certainly the biggest name on this list. Homeworld 3 is one I first got hands-on with back in 2022. It had a delay, but it finally got a release in 2024, which was successful. While there were a few issues at launch, Homeworld 3 was and is a great game that returns you to the world and gameplay of the classic titles.</p>
<p>Here's what I said in the summary of my review of Homeworld 3:</p>
<p><em>Homeworld 3 marks a successful return to a long-revered series. Bringing back the successful space strategy series, but improving the combat by a large amount with a more tactical approach, Blackbird Interactive has successfully made their mark. With exceptional tactical combat, made all the more important by the fact that everything carries over, and one bad mistake could cripple you much further down the line. The additional War Games mode only enhances this, making for a very engaging title.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Frostpunk 2 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-2-day-after-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9/10</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Simulation.&nbsp; <strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PlayStation, Xbox.</p>
<p>Frostpunk 2 is a game I was very much looking forward to, being on my most anticipated list. When I got hands-on with it in previews, I was even more interested before I finally got to review it upon release. My summary back then was:</p>
<p><em>Frostpunk is an excellent looking, excellent sounding, and great playing organic growth and succession from the original. Spreading further along the wasteland, you have to balance more as you deal with politics, resources, factions, and ever more challenges, often including settling and building in new areas. Still a challenge, but more approachable, this is yet another city builder that will shine out amongst others.</em></p>
<p>I stick by this. Frostpunk 2 is an excellent game that firmly expanded on the original while keeping what made it great. The move from the single core to creating districts made perfect sense. Expanding the world map elements, creating outposts, and more added a whole new level to the game. This is one I recommend and one I would argue is the best game of the year on this list.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Satisfactory (<a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Simulation. <strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p>
<p>Satisfactory is a monster of a game. Launching first into Early Access back when I was still cuddled up in my safety blanket, nestled with a nice bottle of lukewarm milk, the thirty-year-old me never knew that it would take five and a half years to <a href="https://wccftech.com/satisfactory-finally-leaves-early-access-on-september-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully release</a>, but even before release, it would sell 5.5 million copies.</p>
<p>Yet here we are, and it's well deserved. In a genre that rarely reaches such wide reaches, Satisfactory turned building a factory - albeit one on an alien planet where you also have to survive - into something millions wanted to buy and play and an average daily player base that would make most "AAA" games envious.</p>
<p>There's not much I can say about this game that you don't already know because you play it or you've looked and decided you aren't interested. The level of detail, as complex as it is, is made so easy to get into. The creativity is excellent. The gameplay is enjoyable and addictive. Satisfactory has it all, and its success reflects that.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ara-History-Untold-Review-01-Header-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Ara: History Untold (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ara-history-untold-all-nothing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.5/10</a>)</h2>

<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Turn-based Strategy (4x). <strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p>
<p>Ashes of the Singularity developer Oxide Games has finally produced another game after their debut title. While their first game is mostly remembered for being an early DirectX 12/Asynchronous Compute <a href="https://wccftech.com/ashes-of-the-singularity-escalation-updated-benchmark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benchmark</a>, Ara: History Untold, which Xbox Game Studios published, is very much focused on the gameplay experience. It's also turn-based, whereas Ashes was a real-time strategy game. Here's what I had to say about Ara in the review:</p>
<p><em>I must admit, when not writing this review, my brain kept saying, "I like this, but", and I'd decided that I was leaning towards around a score of six and a half, but putting everything on paper and playing more, I was wrong. Ara: History Untold is a genuinely good 4X strategy game, but it has its issues. If you like the genre, you will like this. If you want a 4X with even more added depth, this will tickle your pleasure zones. I fully intend to play it more.</em></p>
<h2>Community Poll</h2>
<p>Now that the shortlist has been announced, you can vote to determine the community's winner for this category!</p>
<div id="democracy-1386" data-opts="{&quot;ajax_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wccftech.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php&quot;,&quot;pid&quot;:1386,&quot;max_answs&quot;:0,&quot;answs_max_height&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,&quot;anim_speed&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;line_anim_speed&quot;:1500}"><p><strong>Best Strategy/Simulation Game of 2024</strong></p></div>
<h2>Strategy and Simulation Games in 2024, and Honourable Mentions</h2>
<p>I think it's been a slow year for Strategy and Simulation games. There have only been a few marquee titles in Homeworld 3 and Frostpunk 2, but nothing that could let 2024 compete with what is still arguably the best year for the genres in recent memory: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-strategy-games-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm only human, as we all are, so there are some good-looking strategy and simulation games that we haven't played due to time or any other reason. Some such titles are <a href="https://www.songsofconquest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Songs of Conquest</a>, <a href="https://www.planetcoaster.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planet Coaster 2</a>, <a href="https://www.ug1775.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultimate General: American Revolution</a>, and <a href="https://www.f1manager.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 Manager 2024</a>, to name a few. Still, of the others we have played, here are some noteworthy titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic (<a href="https://www.sovietrepublic.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
<li>Empires of the Undergrowth (<a href="https://eotugame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
<li>Diplomacy is Not an Option (<a href="https://www.door407.com/projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
<li>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (<a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>While this has been a slow year, thanks to delays and cancellations, there are positives to look forward to. Games in early access will emerge from it, and new games will be released - likely stalwarts of genres such as Total War and, of course, Football Manager. Roll on the games of 2025!</p>

<p>As Tom reported a little while back, we've had a fair idea what Switch 2 will look like for a while - at least since a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">prototype console shell and internal components surfaced online in late September</a>. But recent weeks have seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/latest-switch-2-leaks-appear-legitimate-according-to-new-report">further images posted</a>, this time by accessory companies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">now taking orders for Switch 2 add-ons</a>, which show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">close estimations for Nintendo's next console</a> in greater detail.</p>

<p>Now we have brand-new images of what's reported to be the new generation of Joy-Con controllers with magnetic Joy-Con attachments and an additional button below Home on the right Joy-Con.</p>
<p>Reportedly originating from China, the Joy-Con shows off its new magnetic attachment as well as revised colour palette which differs from existing Joy-Cons.</p> <div>

<p>If the images are authentic - and right now, there is no proof - it looks like we can also expect enlarged SL and SR buttons, too, and maybe even a mouse-like optical sensor. You can check the photos out yourself in the X post above or in the subreddit thread embedded below:</p>

</span></p><p>If the images are not fake and do indeed originate from a Chinese factory that's manufacturing the new machines (apparently, the Joy-Con has a system serial number that is allegedly validated by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hua4lu/the_leaked_photo_of_the_switch_2_joycon_has_a/">Nintendo's Check Warranty page</a>), it seems increasingly unlikely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo will exceed its self-imposed deadline of 31st March 2025</a> to show off its Switch successor.</p>

            <p>As Amazon's phenomenal TV adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> begins filming its second series, Fallout co-creator Tim Cain has opened up on why he thinks violence sells when it comes to AAA games, particularly RPGs.</p>
<p>Over the New Year, Cain posted a video to YouTube about "why so many AAA RPGs expect and often require the player to do combat" and discussed "whether or not games treat [violence] as the default".</p>

<p>Acknowledging he's had "pushback on similar answers in the past", Cain then summarised his thoughts with: "The TL;DR of it is, companies make games - and, in general, products - that people will buy. That's it".</p>
<p>"It means games that sell the most - and I'm not even talking about review the best, just sell the most - will dictate future games.</p>
<p>"This is <em>obvious</em>. If you have a company and it's trying to make money and there's one game type that sells millions of copies and another one that sells a hundred thousand, which one are you going to do if they both take <em>just</em> as much time and money to develop? This is why I tell people to vote with their dollars," he added.</p>
<p>And people who do choose to vote with their wallets won't just be a "drop in the bucket", Cain insisted. If enough people did the same, "those drops become a storm and companies will listen".</p>
<p>"Action genres tend to sell very well, and by that I mean, action RPGs kinda outsell classic RPGs, even though both of them are violent," he added. "It's also easier to market those sorts of games. When you watch a trailer and you see people actually doing things - jumping, climbing, shooting, punching - it looks like: 'Whoa! Look at all the things you can do in that game' [...] It's hard to show the other things.</p><p>"How do we show that this game has a really good story? How do we show that it has fantastic dialogue? How do you do that in a trailer that may only be 15 or 30 seconds long?" Cain said (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fallout-co-creator-tim-cain-says-violence-will-be-the-default-in-aaa-rpgs-as-long-as-we-keep-buying-it-companies-dont-make-them-because-they-feel-like-it-they-make-them-because-they-sell/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"You have to reduce this wonderful narrative, that's super creative and nuanced that has a huge arc, down to a soundbite. And guess what? It's because most people won't watch more than a few seconds of something!"</p>
<p>As for that aforementioned Amazon Fallout show? Last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-starts-filming-with-walton-goggins-back-in-character">Walton Goggins slipped back into his Ghoulish guise</a> to start filming the second season.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Balatro may have swept the awards this year - including securing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2024-ranked">a place on our 50 best games of 2024</a> list and that of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-readers-top-50-games-of-2024">Eurogamer readers</a> - but developer LocalThunk has taken time to recommend other indie games that caught his eye in 2024.</p>
<p>Taking to X, LocalThunk listed his "very prestigious Golden Thunk Awards", awarding top prize to the "engrossing experience" of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>.</p>

<p>Runners up were Dungeons and Degenerate Gamblers - described as a "beautifully synergistic and strategic deckbuilder", LocalThunk said "people mistakenly wrote this off as a Balatro clone, but this was announced before my game ever was" - Arco, Nova Drift, Ballionaire, and Wrong Organ's exceptional Mouthwashing.</p><p>"I didn't even know this was a horror game when I started playing it at 11pm one fateful night," the developer <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1875284685150142820">said</a>.

			<p>New alleged pictures of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con controller surfaced online today, providing a new look at the new version of the controller launching together with the system.</p>
<p>The new pictures, which were shared on the Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SwordfishAgile3472/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SwordfishAgile3472</a>, showcase the controller's side and back, providing a new look at the simple color scheme and at some of the changes from the current controller, such as bigger shoulder buttons and more. While there is no way to know if the pictures showcase the real controller, it looks legit with its attention to detail and the presence of a serial number, which could put the leaker in some serious trouble with Nintendo.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hu3rte/new_joycon_photos_from_chinese_sns/">New Joy-con Photos from Chinese SNS</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SwordfishAgile3472/">u/SwordfishAgile3472</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/">NintendoSwitch2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>2025 has barely begun, but we still managed to learn plenty of new things regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, even without an official announcement. A few days ago, pictures showcasing the system's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-pictures-leaked-on-the-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motherboard</a> surfaced online, which were <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/">heavily scrutinized</a> in the attempt to determine the process node used for the T239 chip that powers the console. A patent filed by Nintendo earlier this week also seems to confirm the system will indeed support NVIDIA DLSS upscaling, as has been rumored for a good while.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-game-director-thought-remedy-should-aim-to-be-europes-naughty-dog/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alan-wake-2-game-director-thought-remedy-should-aim-to-be-europe%E2%80%99s-naughty-dog.1074276/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-game-director-thought-remedy-should-aim-to-be-europes-naughty-dog/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alan Wake 2 Game Director Kyle Rowley was recently featured in an hour-long video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw0RByccsO4&amp;list=PLZeoUzft8lM_EjUOKaU4GvZDRGoWzfjgI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> on the Behind The Voice YouTube channel.</p>
<p>During the lengthy conversation, the industry veteran (Rowley started as a Q&amp;A tester on Black and White 2 twenty years ago, then worked as a designer on The Outsider, Homefront: The Revolution, and RuneScape before joining Remedy) revealed that he thought the Finnish studio should aim to be the European version of Naughty Dog.</p>
<p><em>When I came to Quantum Break, I was just excited about working on something that had... you know, one of my favorite games at the time was Uncharted, and I knew that we were going to do something that... I remember having a discussion with our lead animator at the time, and I was like, I think that we should be aiming to kind of be like the European version of Naughty Dog. Like, that would be cool if we could kind of get that same level of feel, and that was the type of game that I like to play, and so I was excited about working on it.</em></p>
<p>It's not at all a farfetched comparison. Both studios make action/adventure games with a highly cinematic flair. Of course, while both studios are highly acclaimed, Naughty Dog's games tend to sell a lot more - though to be fair, they also cost a lot more. For comparison, Naughty Dog's most recent game (The Last of Us Part II, which will soon <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-is-out-on-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch on PC</a> in its remastered version) cost $220 million, while Alan Wake 2 cost €70 million, according to Finnish analysts. However, Remedy is also used to make even cheaper games. Control famously only cost €30 million, and the initial budget for the upcoming sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was set at €50 million</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Naughty Dog is stepping a bit into Remedy's comfort zone with its new sci-fi IP, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which was just&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2024. On the other hand, Remedy appears to be following in Naughty Dog's footsteps when it comes to adapting its game IPs to live-action film/TV. Naughty Dog successfully did it (thanks to Sony, of course) with Uncharted and The Last of Us, while Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered with Annapurna</a> to adapt Alan Wake 2 and Control.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/05/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-35-to-31/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-35-to-31.1074264/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/05/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-35-to-31/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Today, we’re rounding off the first 20 games in our Most Wanted of 2025 series, counting down from 35 to 31. There is a good mix of games in the list below from psychological horrors and the fate of some giant robots, to a fresh take on a belove musou franchise. Let’s dig in, shall we?</p>
<h2>35 – The Alters</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – Q1 2025</em></p>
<p>What would it be like to live with yourself? It is a question you may have pondered? Would your copy be exactly like you, or look like you but have a different view of things. Enter The Alters, 11 Bit Studios new psychological survival horror in which that question is answered, though in a very stressful environment that will push anyone to their limits.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLXizxVIu6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You are Jan and Jan and Jan and Jan and, well you get the idea. Jan is a space builder trapped on an alien planet. He wants to get home but to do that he has to survive and restore his ship. It is a job he cannot do alone, but he can create Alters of himself. They are clones but with their own personalities, wants, needs, and stress points. If you don’t manage each individual’s needs or meet their expectations things will get tense, and the Jans will turn on each other. Probably not wise to say something like “Sure, Jan” sarcastically.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/the-alters-demo-pc-xbox-ps5/">The Alters demo</a> is available now.</p>
<h2>34 – Sleight of Hand</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC, Game Pass – TBC</em></p>
<p>Sleight of Hand has one of the best descriptions going for it, with developer RiffRaff Games calling it a third-person card-slinging occult noir stealth sim. What more could you want? You are Lady Luck, an occult detective and former witch, who is taking on one last job. A job that has her meeting her past head on as she is tasked with going to Steeple City and bringing down her former coven.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sleight of Hand Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBHg3xKnYTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The card slinging element comes from one of the core game mechanics, which are Lady Luck’s cards. She has cards imbued with magical abilities that can be used for all sorts, like creating a smokescreen, use smoke based attacks, and set traps. There will be different cards to use, allowing you to customise your deck which in turn determines your playstyle? Will you favour stealth cards or more attack based cards. Sleight of Hand is coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S, and will be on Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<h2>33 – Slay The Spire 2</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Slay The Spire 2 has a lot of expectation behind it after the original was received so well. This is a sequel removing itself from any narrative connection to the first game by being set 1000 years later, introducing a new cast of slayers that are equipped with their own cards, as well as new archetypes to master.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Slay the Spire 2 - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ttVtllHkb4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Slay The Spire 2 will change on every run, and you will have to deal with the foes and challenges that are thrown in front of you with the cards you have. You will need to build and rebuild your decks until you have a set that can master some of the tougher challenges ahead. Slay The Spire 2 is planned for Steam Early Access early this year.</p>
<h2>32 – Transformers: Reactivate</h2>
<p><em>PC, Consoles – TBC</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/09/transformers-reactivate-pc-ps5-xbox/">Transformers: Reactivate was announced for consoles and PC</a>, at the tail end of 2022 during The Game Awards. The game is a 1-4 player action game. It was revealed through a cinematic trailer showing no Transformers in action, but from the point of view of what we assume are fallen Autobots, who have met their match against an enemy called The Legion. This is not about protecting Earth from an invasion, because it has fallen to The Legion already. Instead, it seems this is about resistance.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="TRANSFORMERS: REACTIVATE Official Announce Trailer | The Game Awards" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edBK2ZpYY_0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since the announcement of Transfomers Reactivate there have been precisely zero major updates. First the closed beta for 2023 did not take place, and the game is now being developed in Unreal Engine 5. Maybe, we’ll hear more in 2025 and get a surprise release?</p>
<h2>31 – Dynasty Warriors: Origins</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 17th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is a major refresh for the Dynasty Warriors series, taking it right back to its roots. Players are a nameless warrior that has lost his memories, and is thrust right into China’s Three Kingdom’s period. It is a time of war and strife with the events of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Battle of Chibi taking place.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - Gameplay Features" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C25kV-6Qrs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is not just about taking out thousands of enemies in a matter of minutes using loads of different combos and skills. There is also an RPG side to it. As you complete missions and tasks you will earn XP, which in turn translates to your character rising up the military ranks and earning new skills. You will also build bonds with other characters. There are a lot of new things that even veteran fans of the series will discover, and Dom wrote about them after spending four hours with Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</p>
<p>We went hands on with the game recently, ahead of the demo release, saying that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/22/dynasty-warriors-origins-takes-the-series-back-to-its-roots-to-find-its-future/">Dynasty Warriors Origins takes the series back to its roots to find its future</a>.</p>
<p><em>Another batch done, we’ll see you tomorrow for five more!</em></p>

<p>The esports industry continues to expand at an alarming pace, getting bigger each year with more games being added to the competitive collection. For a game to be considered ‘an esports game’, it simply needs to foster a competitive multiplayer environment – which means <strong>many </strong>games fit the bill.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’re looking at every esports game coming out in 2025. Which are you most excited about?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-esports-games-coming-out-in-2025">All Esports Games Coming Out in 2025</h2>



<p>This list represents every esports game either confirmed to be or <strong>expected </strong>to be launching in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-deadlock">Deadlock</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Valve’s Deadlock is one of the most anticipated esports games out there. It was kept on the DL by Valve for the longest time until it could be contained no more. In 2024, it stormed the charts on Steam, presenting users with a fresh and exciting hero shooter environment that’ll be set to rival Overwatch and Marvel Rivals if it’s one of the esports games coming out in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Gears of War once fostered a solid esports ecosystem, but times changed. There are high expectations that E-Day, an all-new adventure set in the Gears of War universe and a prequel of sorts, will bring back Gears esports once and for all. We don’t know what that’ll look like, but it’ll be good to see if it has a competitive environment if it’s released in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-fortnite-ballistic">Fortnite: Ballistic</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fortnite Ballistic is a first-person competitive shooter built in the heart of the Fortnite platform. It’s everything you know and love from Fortnite intertwined with traditional multiplayer elements from the likes of Counter-Strike and VALORANT. It’s everything you’d expect from an esports game, and it’s expected to release in full, graduating from early access, later in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-fragpunk">FragPunk</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>FragPunk is a brand-new IP from Bad Guitar Studio. It’s a gaudy, colourful five-vs-five hero-based FPS with plenty to offer, and it has impressed users in beta testing. It’s set to be released on March 6, 2025, making it one of the first new esport games releasing in 2025. It has a unique ‘powerup card’ mechanic that keeps gameplay as fresh as possible, which is well-needed in today’s world.</p>



<h3 id="h-virtua-fighter-6">Virtua Fighter 6</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>At The Game Awards 2024, Sega unveiled ‘New Virtua Fighter Project’, which many have dubbed Virtua Fighter 6. It’s the first new game in the series in almost twenty years, and it’ll be a nice addition to the stacked FGC roster. It <strong>could </strong>launch in 2025, but it’s not at all guaranteed. Instead, keep an eye open for Virtua Fighter 5 REVO, a remaster of sorts of the last game, released in 2006.</p>



<h3 id="h-splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Splitgate 2 is expected to be one of the fastest-paced shooters on the market when it drops in 2025. It’s a high-octane, energetic shooter that uses portals to empower players to traverse the map in genius ways, but under the hood, it’s a typical multiplayer title with oodles of esports potential. </p>
