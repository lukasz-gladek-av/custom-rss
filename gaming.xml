                <p dir="ltr">Discord is experimenting with a new age-verification policy that would require users to prove their age to see material Discord considers harmful. The verification process is currently undergoing trial in the United Kingdom and Australia, though Discord didn't say how long the test period will last or when--or if--it will roll out in other countries.</p><p dir="ltr">The age verification process applies to all devices, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discord-comes-to-xbox-for-everyone-today/1100-6507437/" data-ref-id="1100-6507437">Discord on Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discord-on-ps5-how-to-link-accounts/1100-6511123/" data-ref-id="1100-6511123">PlayStation 5</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">When a user tries to interact with material that Discord flags with its sensitive media filter, such as potentially explicit images, or tries to change their sensitive media filter settings, a pop-up appears that tells them to verify their age before they can continue. Discord provides two ways to verify: a face scan using your device's camera or using a mobile device to scan an ID card, such as a driver's license. The process reportedly takes just a few minutes, and you receive a direct message from Discord once it's finished that tells you which age group you're in.</p><p dir="ltr">This system invites privacy concerns, though Discord said in an <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Verify-Age-Group" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FAQ section</a> about the new requirement that the data users provide for verification is not stored by Discord or its face-scan vendor. The face scan option is "on-device," which means the vendor doesn't collect or store biometric data. Age verification for Discord is a one-time thing. After the system places a user in a specific age group, that's where they stay until they choose to re-verify. Discord said users can choose to re-verify their age at any time if they believe the system placed them in the incorrect category or, presumably, once they get older and the category no longer applies.</p><p dir="ltr">If the verification process decides your age category is below the minimum required to have a Discord account, it'll automatically ban you. Banned users will have to file an appeal using Discord's underage appeals process to try reversing the ban.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-builds-for-last-epoch-1-2-tombs-of-the-erased.1166115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/last-epoch-1-2-builds-best<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch 1.2 Tombs of the Erased brings a sentinel rework, Weavers endgame Faction, revamped Monolith of Fate experience, and much more. This is Last Epoch’s biggest update yet and IGN has teamed up with the ARPG experts at Maxroll to prepare detailed guides on all of the new content along with excellent builds for leveling and endgame alike. Before we get to the builds, here’s all the new stuff coming in 1.2:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New 1.2 Tombs of the Erased Content</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/01-new-content-woven-faction-1744819698558.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Woven Faction</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest changes in 1.2 is the new Woven Faction. They provide a deeper endgame experience by adding Woven Echoes to your Monolith of Fate. Begin interacting with them by finding a Cemetery of the Erased on your Echo Web, after completing the mini-boss at the end you can enter the Haven of Silk and speak to Masque to join the faction. Gain ranks with the Woven Faction by completing Woven Echoes to add points to your Weaver Tree then use these points to customize your endgame experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Champions &amp; Mini-bosses</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As you explore the Echo Web, you may also find some fun new surprises in the form of Champions, and new weaver mini-bosses. The Champions are larger, more powerful versions of rares, immediately visible due to their angry red glow. Defeating them is tricky but if you persevere you’re sure to be duly rewarded. There are also several new mini-bosses you can encounter in 1.2, so keep an eye out for a scary-looking boss as you explore the Monolith of Fate.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Set Item Crafting and LP Changes</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch has an in-depth <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/resources/beginner-crafting-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crafting System</a> where you use Affix Shards, Glyphs, and Runes to heavily customize your items. This popular system is straighforward to understand and has a fair bit of depth to master. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1.2, crafting in Last Epoch gets even better. You can break Set items down to obtain crafting shards and then use those to craft set bonuses on your items. This gives you the best of both worlds where you have the power of a set bonus and the flexibility to craft your own gear with the affixes you need. EHG has also made a big change to how you use Unique items with Legendary Potential (LP) to craft Legendary items. In the past, when interacting with the Eternity Cache the modifiers added to your Legendary Items were chosen at random. So if you used a 1LP Unique, you get a Legendary with 1 random affix, if you use a 2LP Unique, you get a Legendary with 2 random affixes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, if you complete a Temporal Sanctum of level 2 or higher you can choose 1 affix to transfer to your Legendary! This means you get to pick what you want when using a 1 LP Unique, if you use an item with 2-4 LP, then you get to pick 1 affix and the remaining modifiers are chosen at random.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Uber Aberroth</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch’s ultimate boss is getting even tougher with 1.2. In addition to the normal version of this encounter, there is a special Uber Aberroth encounter. Very little is known about this foe beyond the fact that he is the most dangerous being in Eterra. Challenge him at your own risk!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1.2 Tombs of the Erased Leveling Builds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Use Maxroll’s leveling builds to cruise through the campaign with ease. Season 2 introduces the ability to switch your Mastery so you can level with the most efficient build for the campaign, then respec your mastery upon reaching the endgame. Here are the best ways to level each of the game’s 5 classes, straight from Last Epoch’s top speed runner Terek!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/primalist-build-1744820944042.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Primalist</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The best way to level a Primalist is by playing Druid. This build has good damage, it’s very cozy as you can use transformations to spam your skills during the campaign, and gets quite tanky thanks to Werebear form.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/mage-build-1744820963651.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Mage</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Spellblade mastery seamlessly weaves blades and spells to decimate foes using Shatter Strike. You are reliant on spells in the early game but once you get Shatter Strike most of your time is spent rotating between Shatter Strike for damage and Mana Strike to recover your resources to continue dealing damage. Don’t be fooled by the Mage’s health, you can easily generate tons of Ward just by hitting enemies.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sentinel-build-1744820980104.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Sentinel</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot off the rework, Sentinel is stronger than ever. The most efficient way to level is by playing Paladin to get easy access to Resistances and Holy Aura for both offensive and defensive bonuses. Crusade your way through the campaign burning enemies in the holy fire of your Judgment!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/acolyte-build-1744820998394.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Acolyte</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As an Acolyte you are a master of the undead and the profane. Embrace your inner darkness and become a Warlock to create rifts in reality which unleash a volley of Chaos Bolt. The Chthonic Fissure skill provides great persistent damage for clearing while your Summoned Infernal Shades melt bosses with their hellish assault.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/rogue-build-1744821018335.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Rogue</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Rogue levels with her trusty Falcon Companion, flying through levels with ease and grace. This Falconer build is easy to scale with great sustain thanks to the Melee Leech affix on gear. With a bit of investment into Health, Regen and Physical Resistance, this Rogue becomes a well-rounded beast of a build.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1.2 Tombs of the Erased Endgame Builds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After you complete the campaign, you enter Last Epoch’s endgame. Maxroll’s Last Epoch team has been extensively testing a wide variety of endgame builds to dominate in the Monolith of Fate. While all of these builds are powerful, you can use Maxroll’s tier lists to see how they compare across different kinds of content.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Heartseeker Marksman</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/heartseeker-marksman-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heartseeker Marksman</a> uses a new skill which seeks enemy targets and triggers a spectacular display of Fire and Cold Projectiles that cover the entire screen. Watch your enemies evaporate as they get blasted by your Attacks and Spells!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The build revolves around dealing Damage with Heartseeker and proccing an insane amount of Dragonfire from Dragonsong. Heartseeker also triggers Burning Dagger for even more craziness. This Marksman has incredible mobility and utility thanks to Shift, Smoke Bomb, Shurikens, and unspecialized Decoy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Fast Clear Speed</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Deals Damage While Moving</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Insane Scaling with Gear and Uniques</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Active Playstyle</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Needs Uniques to Shine</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Survivability Relies on Gear</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Defensive Tools Require Timing</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Judgement Paladin</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/judgement-paladin-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judgement Paladin</a> creates Consecrated Ground with Judgement, to burn enemies with holy fire. Become the Judge and cleanse your foes of impurity, as they hopelessly try to break through your immense defenses. This build is a natural continuation of the Paladin Leveling Build, making it extremely easy to play as your first character of the season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Judgement Paladin deals Fire Spell Damage Over Time with Consecrated Ground and generates Mana with Vengeance. Consecrated Ground also grants massive Healing, since multiple instances can stack on top of each other. Use Holy Aura and Symbols of Hope for great passive buffs. Healing Hands grants Ward and Healing, while acting as your Movement Skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Insane Tankiness</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Exceptional Sustain</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ High Single Target DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing Scaling With Gear and Uniques</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Limited AoE</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Average Clear Speed</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Needs Legendaries To Shine</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Generator/Spender Playstyle</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Warpath Void Knight</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/echo-warpath-void-knight-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warpath Void Knight</a> uses Warpath to wipe the battlefield clean of enemies. Stay spinning to increase your Damage and AoE until Warpath almost covers the whole screen. Unleash the Spin-to-Win playstyle with this build!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Warpath Void Knight specializes into Warrior's Fury to reach amazing levels of Void Melee Damage and Area of Effect. Warpath costs more Mana every second, but thanks to the Void Well Passive and Mana stacking, you can stay spinning for a long time. The Void Well Passive is mandatory when you have Warrior's Fury allocated. Devouring Orb, Anomaly, Symbols of Hope, and Abyssal Echoes grant powerful buffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing AoE</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Extreme Clear Speed</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Very Simple Gameplay</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Excellent Single Target DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Gear Dependent</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Average Tankiness</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Needs Legendaries To Shine</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Requires Mana Investment</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tornado Shaman</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Summon the fury of the storm with this <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/tornado-shaman-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tornado Shaman Guide</a> as you strike down foes from afar. This build invokes Tornados onto the battlefield that rapidly calls Storm Bolts down on enemies in an enormous area. Speed through monoliths and destroy bosses with this outstanding build.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Place down long-lasting Tornados on the battlefield that rapidly cast Storm Bolts thanks to Charged Storm for huge Lightning damage. Gathering Storm allows you to drastically increase the damage of those storm bolts while Summon Spriggan, Warcry, and Maelstrom offer you some amazing offensive and defensive bonuses. Since you are not casting Gathering Storm manually, you can equip an unspecialized Fury Leap for mobility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Insane Tankiness</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Exceptional Sustain</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ High Single Target DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing Scaling With Gear and Uniques</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Limited AoE</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Weaker Defensively While Moving</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Optimal Play Requires Standing Still</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Summon Spriggan Dies Often And Needs To Be Resummoned</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Stygian Coal Lich</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/stygian-coal-lich-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stygian Coal Lich Guide</a> harnesses the power of undeath in the form of Stygian Beams. This Lich transforms into its horrific Reaper Form to unleash a barrage of deadly Necrotic Stygian Beams. Hit your enemies with Rip Blood to empower yourself, and generate Mana and obliterate everything around you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turn Drain Life into a DPS powerhouse thanks to the Stygian Coal Unique Catalyst. Death Seal provides powerful buffs and releases pulsing Waves of Death around you while it's active that kill any enemies near you.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-has-serious-potential-for-old-school-fun<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After more than a decade in the shadows, the Ninja Gaiden series returns with not one but three releases this year: the surprise remaster of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black that’s already out, this fall’s Ninja Gaiden 4, and in between, the 2D action platformer that returns the series to its roots, Ninja Gaiden Ragebound. While the mere existence of this trio is a pleasant surprise, Ragebound is perhaps the biggest shock, as the series hasn’t been two-dimensional since the early ‘90s. It’s also being delivered by a developer (The Game Kitchen) and publisher (Dotemu) who are new to Ninja Gaiden. They aren’t new to pixel art or retro throwbacks, though, and Ragebound appears to be in good hands that have real love for the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you know The Game Kitchen’s Blasphemous series, you’ll know they produce some of the best-looking pixel art today. Even though the Ragebound reveal trailer featured a lot of hand-drawn animation, everything I saw during my playtime was pixel art, from the title screen to cut scenes. I love the sense of depth they create in a forest area with layers of parallax scrolling, while fireflies drift about in the foreground, unconcerned with all the bloodshed happening right in front of them.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sequence-10-00-05-45-08-still002-1744762607029.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">An early boss fight.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of bloodshed, defeated enemies provide a satisfying splatter of pixelated red spray. Some bad guys even have multiple death animations. I also appreciate how, while some enemy corpses will fly offscreen or just burst into goo, others remain littered in your wake. Your own blood will occasionally spill on the background. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For its part, meanwhile, Dotemu published TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, Streets of Rage 4, Metal Slug Tactics, and the upcoming Marvel Cosmic Invasion. This is a team with a track record of reviving dormant game franchises and reinvigorating them with fresh ideas and often dazzling art. That seems to be the case again with Ninja Gaiden Ragebound. It looks like a supercharged 16-bit version of the NES trilogy and adds some gnarly new ninja tricks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One is the Guillotine Boost, which lets you bounce off enemies and projectiles with a spin attack. Not only will it deal damage, it extends your time in the air and therefore will help you cross wide areas with no ground beneath your feet. Game Kitchen has prepared many platforming challenges for you around this technique.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sequence-10-00-10-01-08-still003-1744762662791.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kumori, your demoness buddy.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll notice certain enemies have a glowing aura around them. These you can slash to load your hypercharge attack, which decimates large foes and obstacles with one hit. Hypercharges can be chained together if there are multiple glowing enemies nearby. So in many instances there is a preferable order in which bad guys should be defeated, adding one more layer for you to think about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be clear, Ragebound is a level-based action game, not a Metroidvania. You make your way through each area slashing enemies, platforming, and fighting a boss at the end -- like the large demon bat thing I encountered in one of the first areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mercifully, checkpoints will prevent you from being sent back to the beginning should you be overcome. At the end of a stage you’re scored on your performance from D to S and will receive a summary of your completion time, number of kills, max combo, collectibles you found, and any challenges you completed. Challenges might be things like not taking damage or killing a certain amount of enemies with hypercharged attacks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I want to mention the prologue that sets the scene for Ragebound because it’s awesome, but if you want to avoid any and all story spoilers you may want to skip ahead. *pauses* Okay, cast your mind back to that first cutscene that opened the original Ninja Gaiden back in 1989. Two ninja face each other under a full moon. They dash forward, leap into the air, and clash swords. Back on the ground, after a moment, the red ninja falls, and we learn this was Ryu Hayabusa’s father. Most of us had never seen anything so cinematic in a video game before. This event kicked off Ryu’s quest for revenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the prologue of Ragebound, we play as Ryu’s father in the moments leading up to his duel. It’s so cool! Right from the jump, fans will recognize updated versions of classic tunes, like that which underscored the moment Hayabusa San collapses to the ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When word gets back to Ryu of what happened to his father, he leaves for America and all the events we witnessed in Ninja Gaiden I-III. Back in his village, some kind of portal is opened that sends demons spilling into our world. With Ryu preoccupied, it’s up to one of his pupils, Kenji, to save the village and dispatch this demonic threat. So it would seem the events of Ragebound play out alongside the original game. A literal gaiden, or side story, then. Clever.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s cool to see Ryu's 3D costume rendered in pixel art.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ryu is in one of his 3D Ninja Gaiden outfits here. He’ll obviously be changing into his original blue outfit for his trip to America, but it’s cool to see a 3D costume rendered in pixel art.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many gamers who came up in the ‘80s and early ‘90s still have PTSD from those damn birds that first appeared in level 3-1 of the original Ninja Gaiden. They were kind of an annoying combination of the medusa heads and fleamen from Castlevania. My friends, I regret to inform you: The buzzards are back. Thankfully, they still take just one hit and seem to be more manageable here, at least in the early stages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most interesting new additions to the classic Ninja Gaiden formula is Kumori, a demoness who will become your companion and has some useful tricks of her own. If you happen upon a Demon Altar, Kumori can commune with it and switch to the dark world, where hidden demonic entities are revealed and can be used to navigate environments and open whatever was blocking Kenji’s path. This isn’t a cooperative game, though, so Kenji will remain trapped in the altar while Kumori is galavanting about demon town. She also has special attacks that can help Kenji in combat.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sequence-10-00-15-56-22-still005-1744762535242.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Two heads will make you deader than one.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I already encountered some really cool enemies in my short playtime, like a cyclops that spits giant eyeballs from its gut. I like the way it dissolves into a skeleton, too. In a nice touch, clever moments break up the action, like when a demon leaps out at you but is eaten by a dragon snake thing that comes out of nowhere. These are eye candy moments that could just be amusing, or they might introduce a monster you’ll run into later on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think old school Ninja Gaiden fans are bound to enjoy this return to form. Ragebound has great pixel art, fast-paced platforming action, and new ideas that elevate the source material. I’m looking forward to learning more about Kumori and seeing how her relationship with Kenji develops. From what I’ve played so far, this seems like another winning combination of beloved but neglected IP with passionate indie devs. Ninja Gaiden Ragebound is out this summer.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The last couple of years have seen several well-received Godzilla movies released, and parent company Toho is looking to grow that success beyond the silver screen. The Japanese studio has announced that it will invest $830 million in new games, anime, and other projects based on its IP, including Godzilla console games.</p><p>Toho plans to spend $490 million on content development alone, which will focus on a broad range of media as it pivots toward growing its brand overseas (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-14/-godzilla-studio-toho-to-invest-830-million-in-global-push" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>). In addition to an undefined number of Godzilla console games, the studio will also focus on animation, theme park attractions, and mobile games as part of its brand expansion strategy.</p><p>While Godzilla appeared in numerous video games over the decades, the last couple of years have seen the kaiju king relegated to crossovers and cameos. Games like Fall Guys have offered Godzilla cosmetics to players, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> featured Godzilla as an environmental hazard and enemy as part of its Operation Monarch event.</p><p>Recently, Godzilla has starred in several mobile games--and a turn-based strategy game heavily inspired by Into the Breach in 2022 called Godzilla: Voxel Wars--but the last big game featuring the titan was 2014's Godzilla for the PS4, which was later released in Europe and the US in 2015. That game was met with negative reception upon release, and it has an average critic score of 38 on GameSpot sister site <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/godzilla/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a>.</p><p>"Godzilla commits so many game design sins that they become impossible to count, but the greatest horror of them all is that such giant monsters could be so boring," Kevin VanOrd wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/godzilla-review/1900-6416191/">Godzilla review</a>, scoring the game 3/10.</p><p>While it'll be a long time before Godzilla stomps his way back onto consoles, the cinematic future of the King of the Monsters looks bright. As mentioned above, a sequel to the Oscar-winning Godzilla Minus One is in development, and Legendary Pictures' Monsterverse will see the Godzilla and King Kong franchises team up for a third time in a movie that is scheduled to be released on March 26, 2027.</p>

                <p>Nvidia has been rolling out its RTX 50-Series graphics cards over the past few months, and today marks the arrival of the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti. <strong>Available in 8GB ($379) and 16GB ($429) formats</strong>, early reviews are calling it a solid addition to the Nvidia catalog and worth considering if you’re seeking a versatile mid-range card. Unsurprisingly, the new RTX 5060 Ti is a hot commodity, with retailers already selling out, though new stock is likely to return soon. To help track availability, we’ve put together a short list of major retailers most likely to have the RTX 5060 Ti in stock. Even if the GPU is sold out, be sure to keep checking the links below periodically to see if it's back in stock.</p><h2>Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti Restock Tracker</h2><ul><li><a href="https://howl.link/5fgd1b8nxycoc?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17448205761114?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Best Buy</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3YzAV2V" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=The+GeForce+RTX+5060+Ti+Launches+Today%2C+But+It%27s+Already+Selling+Out+Fast&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-04-16+09%3A19%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-16+10%3A49%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6530910&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgeforce%2Brtx%2B5060%2BTi%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-launches-today-but-its-already-selling-out-fast%2F1100-6530910%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Walmart</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=The+GeForce+RTX+5060+Ti+Launches+Today%2C+But+It%27s+Already+Selling+Out+Fast&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-04-16+09%3A19%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-16+10%3A49%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6530910&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fpromotions.newegg.com%2Fnvidia%2F25-0017%2Findex.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-launches-today-but-its-already-selling-out-fast%2F1100-6530910%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Newegg</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=The+GeForce+RTX+5060+Ti+Launches+Today%2C+But+It%27s+Already+Selling+Out+Fast&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-04-16+09%3A19%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-16+10%3A49%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6530910&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15324736%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.antonline.com%2Fnvidia%2Fgeforce-rtx50&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-launches-today-but-its-already-selling-out-fast%2F1100-6530910%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Antonline</a></li></ul><p>Like other RTX 50-Series GPUS, the RTX 5060 lineup features Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, offering DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, Nvidia Reflex 2 for added responsiveness, and full ray tracing with neural rendering. The end result is faster performance than its predecessor and the ability to upscale lower resolutions to 1440p and 4K resolutions. According to Nvidia, the RTX 5060 Ti offers double the performance of the old RTX 4060 Ti when DLSS 4 is enabled (it's worth noting that the RTX 5060 Ti's performance uplift over the 4060 Ti <em>without</em> DLSS 4 is closer to about 15% faster). You’ll find the GPUs to be much slimmer than the RTX 4060 lineup, too, thanks to AI technology that allows the hardware to hit better benchmarks without requiring the same raw horsepower.</p><p>A variety of 5060 Ti models (including overclocked variants) are available from third parties.

While the RTX 5060 will be less powerful compared to the 5060 Ti, it'll still sport all the beneficial AI-powered frame generation and upscaling thanks to DLSS 4, and will be one of the most affordable RTX 50-Series GPUs..</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/terminator-2d-no-fate-day-one-collector-edition-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6530886/">Retro-Inspired Platformer Terminator 2D: No Fate Is Getting Two Cool Physical Editions</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-bluetooth-controller-is-now-available-for-nintendo-switch/1100-6529695/">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller Is Now Available For Nintendo Switch</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/captain-america-brave-new-world-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6530770/">Captain America: Brave New World 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-optimus-prime-lego-set-restocked-and-20-off-at-amazon/1100-6509331/">Transformers Optimus Prime Lego Set Restocked And 20% Off At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-prime-complete-series-steelbook-edition-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6530836/">Sonic Prime Complete Series Steelbook Edition Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/woot-spring-gaming-sale-save-on-controllers-headsets-and-other-gaming-hardware/2900-6462/">Woot Spring Gaming Sale - Save On Controllers, Headsets, And Other Gaming Hardware</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-is-first-switch-2-game-you-can-preorder-in-the-us/1100-6530662/">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Is First Switch 2 Game You Can Preorder In The US</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-lego-set-gets-rare-discount-snag-the-ornithopter-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6530648/">Dune Lego Set Gets Rare Discount - Snag The Ornithopter For Its Best Price Yet</a></li>   </ul> </div>

		<p>Bloober Team has released the first gameplay trailer for its upcoming survival horror Cronos: The New Dawn, naming this trailer ‘Don’t Let The Merge.’ You can see why from the trailer as enemies can absorb other enemies to become bigger threats, with more powerful attacks and increased speed. The trailer also shows how you will navigate different locations, including some areas where gravity doesn’t have much of a pull.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Official Gameplay Trailer |  DON'T LET THEM MERGE" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZblwGH-C7eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/bloober-team-reveal-cronos-the-new-dawn/">Announced last October</a>, the behind the scenes video explores Cronos: The New Dawn’s setting, a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse. Some of the most notable inspirations include the Dead Space franchise and the movie Twelve Monkeys. The Traveller’s own suit takes its inspiration from older deep sea diving suits, alluding to the theme of diving through time to save people.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is set to launch in 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

But users won’t be able to play games within the app as initially promised. The feature was supposed to arrive in November, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307867/microsoft-google-xbox-game-store-android-purchase-games">but Bond blamed</a> a “temporary administrative stay” for holding it back.</p><p>Once Microsoft officially launches in-app game purchases, you’ll see a “Buy” button on game pages if you already have a form of payment saved. You’ll also be able to preorder games and set them to preinstall in your Xbox, as well as redeem Game Pass Ultimate perks. With this update, Xbox has done a complete reversal, as its app previously let users purchase games without remote play.</p><p>Though remote play will no longer be available in the app, Xbox notes that you can still access it from your mobile browser. Xbox is also bringing remote play to supported Samsung TVs, Amazon Fire TV devices, and Meta Quest headsets. </p><p>A few other updates are coming to Xbox as well, including the ability for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to stream select games they own from Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles, which means they won’t have to download games before they can play. Xbox recently added more titles to its “stream your own game” collection, including <em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</em> and <em>Subnautica 2</em>.</p><p>There’s also a new game hub feature on Xbox that pulls up “relevant information” about a game, such as player stats, achievements, friends currently playing the game, events, and available add-ons.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unfortunately, there is nothing officially announced regarding this matter. We will keep you updated using our social media channel.</p></blockquote><p>I didn’t give up that easy. Instead, I replied with “MENU” as I had done earlier. This had previously provided me with a bot and options to ask different questions about my Xbox account and games. However, this time, I didn’t get a menu. Instead a few minutes later another message from a live service agent popped up in my inbox. </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> At this time, there is no official information available regarding the release or availability of this title. We understand the excitement and interest, but as of now, nothing has been formally announced. We encourage you to keep an eye on Xbox’s official channels, including our website and social media platforms, for any future updates or announcements. As soon as there is confirmed information, it will be shared publicly through those outlets</p></blockquote><p>It seems the bot has been shut down and the live service agents running the account have been told to stop sharing details about a remaster that hasn’t even been announced yet. Anyway, it looks like we all might be playing <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remastered next week on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Game Pass.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bloober-team-showcases-first-look-at-cronos-the-new-dawn-gameplay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After surprising everyone with its better-than-expected remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2</a>, Bloober Team's next project, a brand-new game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-deep-dive-from-bloober-team/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, looks like it's the next survival horror game players should keep their eyes on.</p>
<p>Bloober Team showcased our first honest look at gameplay from Cronos: The New Dawn in a new gameplay trailer, where fans of survival horror titles will see some similarities to popular games in the genre like Dead Space, but that's not to say Cronos: The New Dawn isn't doing anything new.</p>
<p>Like merging, for example. Enemies in Cronos: The New Dawn can 'merge,' meaning your job isn't done once you've shot an enemy dead. You need to burn the body. Otherwise, another enemy will take that dead bit of flesh on the ground and merge with it to make itself even stronger.</p>
<p>Suddenly, you're facing a bigger, badder enemy than you were before. If you keep letting enemies merge with the ones you thought you already took out, you can quickly find yourself in an even more terrifying situation. It's an additional layer of combat that means you'll always have to be on your toes between managing the enemies walking towards you and those you've already put down.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Official Gameplay Trailer |  DON'T LET THEM MERGE" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZblwGH-C7eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a press release, co-director and producer on Cronos: The New Dawn, Jacek Zięba, writes, "<em>Imagine this: a distorted mix of sci-fi, time travel, retro-futuristic dread, and body horror—all set against the gritty backdrop of&nbsp; 80s Poland. What a ride, right? And whatever you do… don't let them merge.</em>"</p>
<p>Co-director and designer Wojciech Piejko adds, "<em>How do you fight them? Fire! Burn the </em><br>
<em>fallen before they merge with living creatures. The merge changes the game, adding a </em><br>
<em>whole new layer of strategy to combat. Push your survival instincts to the max.</em>"</p>
<p>When we get our hands on Cronos, it'll be interesting to see how merging impacts combat, and what else the game has in store for survival horror fans. After all, Bloober Team has declared that it won't be making "<em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bloober-team-claims-its-finished-making-shitty-games/">shitty</a></em>" games anymore.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't have an official release date yet, but we know it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2025. This means it'll be the studio's first new title to test that declaration.</p>

			<p>In today's new The Outer Worlds 2 video published as part of April's IGN First, Obsidian Entertainment revealed that the RPG sequel will feature 'way more expansive worlds' than the original (which is great news, as that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of my pet peeves with The Outer Worlds</a>). In classic Obsidian fashion, they will also be filled with fun stories and cool gear or collectibles to find.</p>
<p>Art Director Daniel Alpert explained:</p>
<p><em>We're definitely going more expansive than the first game. In the first game, we were very confined to smaller hubs and overland areas. Now that we're utilizing Unreal Engine 5, we can have way more expansive worlds. From point A to point B, there is a much larger territory that we can cover, and in between those areas, we have lots of little POIs (points of interest) that we can explore.</em></p>
<p>Game Director Brandon Adler added:</p>
<p><em>One of the very first things that we were targeting when we started The Outer Worlds 2 was to make these big, large, expansive areas. It's what players told us that they wanted the most. Working with Daniel and the other directors, we sat down and came up with a plan to how we were going to go do that. We made sure that we had big open sightlines and that we spent a lot of time and effort on making really cool-looking points of interest at a distance to really draw people and also maybe bring them off the beaten path a little bit. When they're heading over there, we made sure that as you're rounding corners or you're doing things like that, you see little points of interest. Another element that was also really important as we're kind of doing all of this stuff is making sure that it was very interesting when you get there, so we made sure that we blanketed all of our areas with just cool, fun stuff to go do, nice loot to go find, and cool stories to go unfold.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2: A Look at Its Expansive Worlds – IGN First" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fKj1UUIH0a4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Yesterday, IGN also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-outer-worlds-2-lets-you-go-wild-with-rpg-character-building-ign-first" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> an interview that dived into the changes and improvements made to the underlying RPG formula of The Outer Worlds 2. The developers are trying to avoid a situation where by the end of the game, the main character is essentially good at everything. They're also removing respec to make sure that choices truly matter.</p>
<p>Lead systems designer Kyle Koenig said:</p>
<p><em>We would often see characters good at everything, which by the end of the game, minimized your personal experience with your character. We wanted to focus on making each individual level-up and investment really important. There's less confusion on when I should invest in one Skill or the other. If I want to be a player that's all about guns and using medical devices, I know which Skills I really need to care about. By having them separated and not in groupings, it lets characters be more specialized.&nbsp;By removing respec, we really incentivize it to be your experience. It is a part of your experience that no one else had, and I think that's really special about RPGs and something that respec tends to lessen.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will also feature a full-fledged stealth system, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gets-first-gameplay-video-and-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> last week. More info should be coming throughout April, though the big showcase is scheduled to air <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after the Xbox Games Showcase on June 8</a>. The game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

                <p>Fortnite has been advertising heavily during WWE events this year despite the fact that there hasn't been any real WWE presence in the game in a while, leading pretty much everyone to assume a new collab was on the way. And it turns out that assumption was right, as reputable leakers are reporting that Cody Rhodes and The Undertaker will be the next wrestlers to be immortalized as Fortnite skins.</p><p>This isn't one of those not-so-credible "I'm hearing this is might happen sometime in the next few years" leaks like last week's Jack Black and Kingdom Come: Deliverance rumors. No, this leak comes with a release date (Friday) and prices (2800 V-Bucks for the full bundle), and was reported by <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1912508694811595040" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">multiple</a> <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1912511287680004589" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">different</a> sources simultaneously--it's quite credible.</p><p>In addition to the Cody Rhodes and Undertaker outfits, the set will include the Undertaker's urn and the American Nightmare mantle back blings, along with the Cody's Cutlass and Taker's Shovel pickaxes, an American Nightmare wrap, and emotes for both Cody Rhodes and Undertaker. The whole set will be included in a bundle for 2800 V-Bucks, and every item can be purchased separately if you only want a specific item or two. We don't have images for any of this yet--these items <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1912521107078275534" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be decrypted on Thursday afternoon</a>.</p><p>This set represents the third wave of WWE collaborations with Fortnite. The first added John Cena all by his lonesome back in 2022, and then a year later we got Bianca Belair and Becky Lynch as well. The expansion of WWE's roster into Fortnite then paused until this week.</p><p>Fortnite has been overflowing with collaborations in 2025, starting in January with Hatsune Miku and Godzilla x Kong, and continuing with new skins from Kaiju No. 8, Jujutsu Kaisen, James Cameron's Avatar, Mortal Kombat, Cowboy Bebop, Invincible (including a free Dupli-Kate), Tomb Raider, Walking Dead, and Adventure Time--not to mention <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/" data-ref-id="2900-6417">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-best-baseball-players-in-the-world-might-be-hitting-the-fortnite-shop-soon/1100-6529993/" data-ref-id="1100-6529993">Shohei Ohtani</a>, and Clix joining the Icon Series. All this--plus these new WWE skins and a rumored Star Wars season on the horizon in May--make it seem as if these collabs are not slowing down even a little bit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-unveils-limited-edition-doom-the-dark-ages-controllers-and-console-wrap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
In anticipation of Doom: The Dark Ages imminent arrival, Microsoft has unveiled a selection of limited edition Xbox accessories, including a wireless controller sporting the sleek, blood-spattered hues of the Doom Slayer.
</p>
<p>
Starting with the controller, its body, buttons, and directional pad are all chest plate green, while its right thumbstick has been coloured red to match the Doom Slayer's augmented nipple - or "chest port" as Microsoft insists on calling it. That's alongside "silver-plated sheathing" for the grippy bits, and "3D silver helmet spikes" surrounding the Xbox guide button.
</p>
<p>
It's a pretty nifty looking thing, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-wireless-controller-doom-the-dark-ages-limited-edition/8mzbmmcjzqc0#footnotes-uidfbe7">costs £74.99/$79.99 USD</a> - which includes the Doom Slayer Executioner Skin DLC for Doom: The Dark Ages. It's available to purchase exclusively from the Microsoft Store until 18th April, after which it'll be making its way to other retailers.

<p>
Fans of the Xbox Elite Series 2 have their own option, with Microsoft also announcing a Doom: The Dark Ages variant of its premium controller. This one's a little more subdued, featuring a black body, maroon buttons and sticks, plus a final nosebleed flourish. Sure the giant red Mark of the Slayer in the middle looks a bit naff, but you can't have everything. This one <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-doom-the-dark-ages-limited-edition/8mzbmmcjzqkt">costs £179.99/$199.99</a> and is available from 25th April - although you can pre-order it now.
</p>
<p>
And finally, the Mark of the Slayer returns for a limited edition Xbox Series X wrap designed to resemble a sort of crumbling, blood-spattered stone obelisk. It also includes some eye-catching innards, scrawled with "unspeakable inscriptions and symbols from the deepest levels of Hell". It's compatibile with disc and all-digital Series X consoles and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-series-x-wrap-doom-the-dark-ages/8mzbmmcjzqbx">costs £49.99/54.99 USD</a>. Both the Doom: The Dark Ages wrap and Elite Series 2 controller are exclusive to the Microsoft Store. And if any of these takes your fancy, you'll <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/16/doom-the-dark-ages-accessories-controller-console-wrap/">find more details here</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Doom: The Dark Ages itself, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-gets-release-date-confirmed-will-make-you-feel-like-an-iron-tank-rather-than-the-fighter-jet-acrobatics-of-doom-eternal">launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 15th May</a>. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hands-on-with-doom-the-dark-ages-reveals-another-reinvention-but-one-that-feels-less-cleanly-defined">looking promising too</a>, with Eurogamer's Robert Purchase calling it a "bold reimagining [and] a brave departure" earlier this year.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-curator-review-realism</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-real-museum-worker%E2%80%99s-take-on-two-point-museum.1166007/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-curator-review-realism<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m not a rollercoaster tycoon or a football manager but I do work in a museum, so, naturally, the recent game <a href="https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-review-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Two Point Museum</em></a> grabbed my attention. It’s a tumultuous time for my field: I’m in the UK, where the arts are still recovering from the impact of covid, after struggling with dwindling funding during 14 years of successive Conservative governments. The recently elected Labour government are yet to turn the taps back on, so budget cuts and job losses are rife in organisations across the country.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there is the seemingly never-ending culture war. Museums find themselves in the middle. The right hates us for being too “woke” and wasting public money. The left (more reasonably) criticise issues such as the colonial roots of many collections or unethical sponsorship deals, such as those with fossil fuel companies. Meanwhile across the world, Donald Trump recently issued an executive order targeting “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/30/smithsonian-institution-trump-executive-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-American ideology</a>” within the Smithsonian, museums face strict government censorship in China, voices advocating for Palestine are silenced almost everywhere, and no one seems to have enough money.&nbsp;</p><p>Understandably then, at many museums and arts organisations, relationships between workers and management can be strained. Management face financial and political pressures and have to find ways to keep things going, keeping funding bodies and trustees happy in the process. Workers feel taken for granted, always asked to do more with less, and worry that their job might be at risk whenever there is a new round of cuts. In my own workplace I’m a union rep, so these are issues that I experience first-hand.</p><p>With all of that in mind, why not recreate the experience at home? For… fun?</p><p>Thankfully, <em>Two Point Museum</em> is genuinely very engaging, quickly dragging you into its rewarding gameplay loop as you grow your museum collection and obsess over how to arrange it. I’m enjoying my time with the game, even as it brushes up against real-life issues. But I wondered if, given my real-life experience, could I run my museum better than my actual museum directors? Could I create a workers’ paradise and decolonise my collection while balancing the books and drawing in the paying public?</p><p>The short answer is no, because my staff keep getting severely injured while they travel the world taking whatever objects they like home with them.</p><p>For the purposes of this piece, I’m going to focus on the game’s “pre-history” museum. The game starts you here, and it’s one of the more realistic venues, modelled on the type of natural history museum found across the Western world and full of displays of dinosaur skeletons, fossils and other artefacts. Certainly it’s a little closer to reality than the game’s “supernatural” museum, where you rip ghosts from the “netherworld” and imprison them for the entertainment of the viewing public. There’s an unfortunate echo of the “human zoos” of the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2023/maura-philippines-smithsonian-brain-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> there</a>, where colonised peoples were put on display for White audiences in Europe and North America. (In <em>Two Point Museum</em>, your ghosts simply leave if they decide they no longer like their accommodations, terrorising visitors on the way out.)</p><p>Staffing was my first concern. For obvious reasons, the game streamlines museum jobs, leaving you with Experts, Assistants, Janitors and Security Guards. My own real-world job – writing, editing and producing what’s referred to within the industry as the interpretation materials (labels, leaflets, audio guides, that sort of thing) – is reduced to purchasing readymade Info Stands, which feels a little insulting. Experts are a combination of curator, conservator and tour guide, with the added bonus of leading Expeditions to secure objects for your museum.&nbsp;</p><p>Once I’ve hired some staff, I need some actual stuff to go on display. Typically, a museum begins with an existing collection, rather than going out finding things one at a time. The British Museum started with Sir Hans Sloane, who amassed a collection of over 70,000 objects including books, artworks, and natural history specimens. All of this was bequeathed to King George II on Sloane’s death. In the US, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City was built around the collections of people such as Henry Gurdon Marquand and Luigi Palma di Cesnola. Given the time period, these museums are often intrinsically linked to colonialism.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at the British Museum, there are high profile examples of objects that were straightforwardly looted, such as the Benin Bronzes, seized during an attack by British Forces on Benin City. Then there are cases such as the Parthenon Sculptures, often referred to as the Elgin Marbles. These were legally acquired by Lord Elgin in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century; however, he was dealing with the Ottoman Empire, which ruled over Greece at the time, and Greece would like the sculptures back. </p><p>In the UK, it is illegal for the British Museum and other National Museums (those funded directly by the government, rather than an intermediary funding body) to remove objects from their collections outside of very limited circumstances. This means such a return would require a change in the law, which is possible but would be difficult and slow to achieve. (There is also easily identifiable hypocrisy in this area of law, as it is perfectly legal to return artwork stolen by the Nazis during World War Two, as the Tate gallery did in March this year.)&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Two Point Museum</em>, the Expedition mechanic carries its own echoes of the colonial era. At my direction, my team of Experts are constantly Indiana Jonesing it around the world in the museum helicopter (we don’t have one of those at my work). Or, for a real-world example, they follow in the footsteps of former US President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1909, Roosevelt led an expedition through East Africa to ‘hunt specimens’ (i.e., kill animals) for the Smithsonian and the American Museum of Natural History. His team killed or trapped over 11,000 animals; regarding this number, Roosevelt <a href="https://www.arcsinfo.org/news-events/entry/2222/teddy-roosevelt-shot-this-lion-107-years-ago-the-world-is-about-to-see-it-again" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that “I can be condemned only if the existence of the National Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, and all similar zoological institutions are to be condemned.”</p><p>Along with dinosaur bones and fossilised insects, at one point an Expedition returned a frozen caveman. For fairly obvious reasons, human remains are another area of controversy in museum collections. It sounds grotesque, but it’s fairly commonplace; if you’ve ever been to see a display of Egyptian mummies, you were looking at human remains. Thankfully, this is an area where communities are able to reclaim from British museum collections (some remains are a little more recent than ancient Egypt), and museums today are much more considerate in how such things are displayed, if they are displayed at all.&nbsp;</p><p>I immediately put my caveman on display. Without making Expeditions, the game would be unplayable, and as that ethical bridge had already been crossed, why not continue? I’ve since read that apparently this caveman isn’t dead, and if you don’t maintain a cold environment, he unfreezes and runs amok in your museum (which I’m inclined to let happen, as it sounds funny).&nbsp;</p><p>Having compromised my ethics with the collection, perhaps there was more luck to be had with the staff and administration of the museum.&nbsp;</p><p>Hiring is a never-ending process in this game: As the museum grows, you need more staff across all roles. You might think that this is extremely obvious, but compared to reality it’s maybe even more unrealistic than the helicopter. In my video game museum, I hire people whenever I need them and, somehow, the money doesn’t seem to run out. The few times I’ve been low on funds, the speedy progression of in-game time means that entry fees and donations allow the bank balance to bounce back.</p><p>This also enables me to increase salaries whenever necessary. As staff gain experience, they expect a raise. Back in the real world, union reps spend long periods of time negotiating with management to achieve annual raises for staff, with the possibility of industrial action if we’re unhappy with the offer on the table. In the game, my team exist at my whim, and they should consider themselves lucky that I am a kind and benevolent leader.&nbsp;</p><p>I do everything in my power to look after my in-game team. As well as regular raises, I’ve built them a generous staff room, with free snacks and coffee (I even remembered to add a window, once I remembered I could). They receive regular training to aid their professional development. They’re even provided with trips to a medical spa resort, which I can’t say I’ve ever been offered by my employer. That said, I have also never gotten a tropical illness or been bitten by a poisonous snake in the line of duty. But surely they knew the risks when they signed up? Isn’t this what I pay them for?</p><p>But even with all of this, I can’t make them happy. I have a current objective to achieve 75% staff happiness, and no matter what I try, that number is stuck in the 60s. I increase everyone’s wages, I add more amenities to the staff room, I provide ample training opportunities. I even tell them when to go on breaks, as they don’t seem able to make these decisions for themselves. Even so, that 75% remains unachieved.</p><p>So, it seems I’ve become another bad manager, a leader who is out of touch with their staff and whose professional ethics are practically non-existent. But eventually, through my own efforts or just time and luck, I feel confident I’ll hit that 75% and move on with the game. It’s a remarkably stress-free experience, which is part of why I enjoy it.&nbsp;</p><p>I also enjoy my actual job, which is a luxury not everyone has, even if that is decidedly not stress-free. Where the game is simple and streamlined, the real thing is messy and complex. But this complexity is part of the reward, when you get a chance to dig in and really do the work, dealing with thorny issues from history and trying to figure out how to present them to the public. I ultimately wouldn’t trade my in-game role as the boss for the real thing.</p><p><em>Tom Emery is a curator and writer living in Manchester, UK</em>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/steel-ball-run-jojos-bizarre-adventure"><h3>Steel Ball Run Is The Best JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure Part</h3></a><p>The Real Man’s World is a moment that’ll stick with me forever</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-pitt-hbo"><h3>The Pitt&nbsp;Isn’t&nbsp;Just Another Anxiety-Inducing Medical Drama</h3></a><p>In between instilling an appreciation for medical personnel, it’ll have you fujoshiing out</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/carlo-acutis-gamer-saint"><h3>The Politics, Theology, And Hype Behind The First Gamer Saint</h3></a><p>Teenager Carlo Acutis, set to be canonized at the end of this month, will be the Catholic Church's first millennial saint</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Perhaps some surprising character cameos or the ability to remix tracks and share them with friends? 15 minutes is more than enough time to talk about a few new features, explain some online details, and show off some new gameplay.</p><p>What I don’t expect will be included in tomorrow’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-moo-moo-meadows-cow-meme-switch-2-1851774370&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-moo-moo-meadows-cow-meme-switch-2-1851774370"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a></span> video event is an apology or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036">new explanation</a></span> for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262">$80 price tag</a></span>, which has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-mario-kart-world-nintendo-treehouse-live-1851774530?_gl=1*1pwhwei*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDgxNzM1OC4zMDQuMS4xNzQ0ODIwMzAyLjIwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-mario-kart-world-nintendo-treehouse-live-1851774530?_gl=1*1pwhwei*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDgxNzM1OC4zMDQuMS4xNzQ0ODIwMzAyLjIwLjAuMA..">upset many fans online</a></span>. I also don’t expect Nintendo to announce a new, lower price. Maybe it’ll confirm that all future updates and DLC will be free to try to make the price a better value, but I don’t see Nintendo turning the ship around now. The kart racer is due out on the same day as the Switch 2, June 5.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/next-project-in-frostpunk-universe-set-for-2027-release-and-11-bit-studios-is-working-on-a-new-ip-as-well<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> developer 11 bit Studios has begun work on "the next project set in the Frostpunk universe", which it plans to launch "as early as 2027". </p>
<p>Eurogamer recently heard word of this new project from 11 bit CEO Przemysław Marszał, who was talking to me about the history of the studio, and about its future. Today, 11 bit has now confirmed the project in its latest <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-boldly-invests-in-new-titles/">financial results</a>.</p>
<p>With two games released in the Frostpunk series already, and the series' recent second entry still on wobbly ground with the community - Steam reactions are currently "mixed" - I asked Marszał whether the series had, for the moment, run its course, or whether there was a future for it.</p>
<p>Marszał replied: "We totally believe in Frostpunk. We believe in that IP. We totally believe in that fantasy. I don't want to spoil it but I can tell you that in about two weeks, you will hear about something, so it's really soon. We totally believe in the IP and we will definitely work on the IP more."</p>

<figcaption>11 bit acknowledges that there's a lot of work still to do on Frostpunk 2.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAqJIRw9RHE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>He added: "On the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> front, we are doing a lot of work right now. The patch is coming, the DLCs are coming, etc. We see the problems with the game, we know the strengths of the game, and we are working on that game. But that's not only it. Frostpunk is definitely one of our key IPs, key games, and we love the IP so, yeah, we will work on that more."</p>
<p>Incidentally, while we are still waiting for a release date more specific than "summer 2025" for the console versions of Frostpunk 2, I'd be surprised if the upcoming teased announcement was for it - not least because Marszał separately said during our conversation that "the console version is releasing very soon".</p>
<p>But this new Frostpunk game - could it be an expansion? - is not the only new project the Polish studio is currently working on. "We've started working on two other things," Marszał said. "One thing is connected to Frostpunk and one thing is something new. We totally believe we should do new things."</p>

<p>Frostpunk 2 was released last September and arrived to glittering critical reviews, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frostpunk-2-review-a-sequel-of-consequence">my Eurogamer Frostpunk 2 review</a> included, but it struggled - and continues to struggle - to convince fans. "It is a mixed release for us," said Marszał. "We have a very good game, we have really awesome reviews from the press; then on the other hand, a lot of players aren't satisfied. There's a disconnection here. Then on the other hand, we had really awesome sales at the beginning with that game, but now the question is if those sales will be long-term, especially with the mixed reviews we have right now. We understand that it's a lot of work, still."</p>
<p>The mixed reaction to Frostpunk 2 highlighted a difficult second half of 2024 for 11 bit Studios which, at the end of the year, announced it had cancelled a full-scale game, Project 8, which it had been working on for several years. It's a game not much has been known about until now, but I have seen a video of it in action and spoken at length to Marszał about it. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-developers-cancelled-project-8-revealed-a-risky-project-that-would-have-been-a-big-departure-for-the-studio">I can tell you all about Project 8</a> in a separate article.</p>
