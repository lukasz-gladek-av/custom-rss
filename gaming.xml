<p>In September 2024, Nicholas Prosper gunned down his mother and sister and stabbed his younger brother to death at their home in Luton in the United Kingdom. Today, the 19-year-old appeared in Luton Crown Court for sentencing, admitting in front of the room that he had planned the killings for several months and desired to extend his heinous goal by slaughtering schoolchildren.</p>



<p>In details obtained by the BBC, Prosper revealed a disturbing obsession with Clementine, a young female character from The Walking Dead games pieced together by Telltale. He insisted that his goal was to ‘join her in death’ and that he had been ‘chosen’ by her for this ‘mission’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-friday-the-13th">Friday the 13th</h2>



<p>Nicholas Prosper brutally murdered his family at their home in the United Kingdom, and if he weren’t apprehended by police two hours later, a reprehensible scene could have played out.</p>



<p>Prosper’s full plan was to venture into his old primary (elementary) school on Friday the 13th while dressed in a ‘distinctive outfit’ and wielding a shotgun he’d obtained illegally. Reportedly, he wanted to ‘execute’ as many as 30 children and had researched past massacres online.</p>



<p>In his defence, his barrister had stressed that Prosper was perhaps tainted by an internet ‘wormhole’ that caused something ‘very wrong’ to happen with the teenager’s psyche.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cn8ld834398t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The BBC</a> published exclusive details about the case, explaining how Prosper revealed to a prison nurse that he intended to kill himself after the shooting and that his ultimate desire was to ‘go to Clementine and join her’.</p>



<p>He was referring to a major character in Telltale’s The Walking Dead games, who appeared in the first title in 2012 as a young child before evolving into a hardened survivor.</p>



<p>Prosper posted a video online after murdering his family, in which he explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am the chosen one; chosen by Clementine. I am guided as Christians are guided by Jesus Christ.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also uploaded videos ahead of the crime, revealing his ‘distinctive’ outfit and wielding a plank of wood in place of the shotgun he’d eventually use.</p>



<p>The judge presiding over the case will pass sentencing on Wednesday.</p>

		<p>Sony has formed a brand new first party studio to develop new PlayStation games, with this new studio called Dark Outlaw Games. The studio is being headed by Jason Blundell, who spent much of his career at Activision working on Call of Duty games from Call of Duty 3 to Black Ops 4 moving up to game director in the process. Blundell left Treyarch in 2020, formed Deviation Games in 2021, left Deviation Games in 2022, with the studio shuttering in 2024.</p>
<p>In an interview with Jeff Gertsmann, Jason said,<em> “It’s such a privilege to be able to do it with Sony as a new first-party studio. Sony doesn’t set up first-party studios all the time. To have that privilege is humbling, it’s really nice. I’m really excited.”</em></p>


<p>Dark Outlaw Games has been working on a new project, but no details have been released about what that game is going to be. With Jason Blundell’s vast experience with Call of Duty, it would not be surprising if this would be a first person shooter or some kind of action game. We will have to see what the game is when Sony and Dark Outlaw Games are ready to reveal details. There is no release window that we can even begin to guess for when this game will be coming out.</p>

Tarkir: Dragonstorm returns to Magic’s own plane of Tarkir, and we’ve got an exclusive first look at a five cards that I expect we’ll be seeing a lot of at the draft table next month. (The expansion is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGk3W?object_uuid=b7479dde-baec-43cd-99b5-321a9dfc140a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">available to preorder</a> now on Amazon).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the gallery below to see all five cards</strong>, and read on for a word from Wizards of the Coast about their design and the set as a whole.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering - 5 New Cards from Tarkir: Dragonstorm</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These five cards are what’s referred to as a “cycle,” with all of them sharing some common design ground spread across each of Magic’s colors. In this case, all five are cheap, common-rarity creatures with an ability tied to one of Tarkir’s three-color clans, and another that allows you to turn mana into a color from that clan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Three-color limited environments need quite a bit of mana fixing, at all rarities” explains Wizards of the Coast Senior Game Designer Adam Prosak. “We wanted lots of decks to be able to access mana fixing, so we created quite a few designs dedicated to helping solve mana issues. In particular, these creatures allow you to play to the board while developing your mana at the same time - many other designs (such as tapped lands) only make mana and you tend to fall behind in order to fix your mana.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Preorder MTG Tarkir: Dragonstorm Cards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Senior Worldbuilding Designer Lauren Bond says that while that mechanical side came first with this particular cycle, the team often relies on common cards as a place to showcase the world of a set - in this case, how these clans are different from the last time players saw them. “The passionate action-oriented monks of the Jeskai, the Whispers using Temur magic, Nagas in the Sultai as protectors (and avengers) of the jungle, Mardu military prowess including supporting roles (and that dragons can come in many shapes and sizes!), and Abzan clerics regrowing the lost kin trees.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One criticism of some recent Magic sets has been an overreliance on tropes or thematic gimmicks, even while revisiting previous planes, which makes Dragonstorm standout in its comparatively straightforward return to Tarkir. Senior Worldbuilding Art Director Forrest Schehl says that feedback like that is important to WOTC, but that “top-level pitch for Tarkir was established well before the release of Murders at Karlov Manor” and the sets that followed, and didn’t change after them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We wanted to combine Dragons and Clans in a way that hadn’t been seen on Tarkir in the same set and the Dragonstorms that were a defining feature of the plane were going to play a big role in shaping how we approached this ‘return-to’. The pressure to get it right was something Lauren and I felt from day one, we always wanted to build the next chapter of this beloved plane with authenticity and substance.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-tarkir-dragonstorm-where-to-buy"><u>Tarkir: Dragonstorm is up for preorder now</u></a>, with the set scheduled for release in both paper and digitally on April 11 and in-store prerelease events kicking off on April 4. Read on for the full interview with Wizards of the Coast’s Adam Prosak, Lauren Bond, and Forrest Schehl:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/tarkir-3-1742273567820.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: This card cycle seems laser targeted at being much-needed glue for Limited - what were the goals these cards needed to achieve?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Adam Prosak, Senior Game Designer: </strong>Three-color limited environments need quite a bit of mana fixing, at all rarities. We wanted lots of decks to be able to access mana fixing, so we created quite a few designs dedicated to helping solve mana issues. In particular, these creatures allow you to play to the board while developing your mana at the same time - many other designs (such as tapped lands) only make mana and you tend to fall behind in order to fix your mana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>They also strike me as “lore glue,” if you will, with each providing some insight into their clans. Was that an explicit part of their role in the set?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Lauren Bond, Senior Worldbuilding Designer: </strong>While the mechanics of these cards came first, as worldbuilders we often look to common cards (especially cycles) as a place to showcase key elements of setting as players will see them frequently in drafts. This cycle being anchored in the “returning color” of each clan was an opportunity to show how that color manifests in the new version of the clan. The passionate action-oriented monks of the Jeskai, the Whispers using Temur magic, Nagas in the Sultai as protectors (and avengers) of the jungle, Mardu military prowess including supporting roles (and that dragons can come in many shapes and sizes!), and Abzan clerics regrowing the lost kin trees. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Three-color sets aren’t made very often, can you talk about some of the challenges of doing them and how you tried to address those in Dragonstorm?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>AP:</strong> By their nature, three-color cards go into fewer decks than their monocolor (or two color) counterparts. They are often exciting, as long as they aren’t overdone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Building a sealed/draft environment is the biggest challenge – most constructed formats easily allow for three colors, so it’s not too challenging for three color cards to find a home. On the other hand, we have to provide enough mana fixing to allow players to play their three color cards, without making it so plentiful that there every deck can play all five colors easily.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/tarkir-1-1742273567820.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This will be the first time since 2023's Lost Caverns of Ixalan that a Standard set has returned to an existing plane without some sort of thematic twist like Aetherdrift or Murders at Karlov Manor, and the rest of 2025’s line-up means it will be the last time a set does so for roughly another year after that at least. With that in mind, is there an added pressure here to do justice to what fans are expecting of both Tarkir and a “classic” Magic setting in general? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Forrest Schehl, Senior Worldbuilding Art Director: </strong>Fan feedback is super important to us and is something we take into consideration during early development of every new set we make. That being said, the top-level pitch for Tarkir was established well before the release of Murders at Karlov Manor and remained the same throughout development. We wanted to combine Dragons and Clans in a way that hadn’t been seen on Tarkir in the same set and the Dragonstorms that were a defining feature of the plane were going to play a big role in shaping how we approached this “return-to”. The pressure to get it right was something Lauren and I felt from day one, we always wanted to build the next chapter of this beloved plane with authenticity and substance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Lastly, while it’s one that was previously revealed, I have to ask about </strong><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/123/stormscale-scion" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Stormscale Scion</strong></u></a><strong> - a card that is mocking the </strong><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/storm-scale-throne-of-eldraine-through-strixhaven-part-1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Storm Scale</strong></u></a><strong> itself! People have had a lot of fun talking about this card and the unexpected return of Storm to Standard, was that a hard decision to make? Is there a bit of an enticing challenge to returning to “risky” mechanics like that, Affinity, or Phyrexian Mana in recent years? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>AP:</strong> I find that making new cards for existing mechanics is often easier than making new mechanics. With existing mechanics, we are able to learn some lessons about what worked well and what pitfalls to avoid. With the Stormscale Scion, we found that the card is fun and powerful even with a few copies, so we leaned into that rather than some of the other storm cards that win you the game, but only if you’ve cast lots of spells.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

                <p>Anyone who has played an online game has probably encountered a bot at some point that may have negatively impacted their gaming experience. To help address gaming's bot problem, Razer and OpenAI founder Sam Altman's company World have <a href="https://press.razer.com/company-news/razer-and-world-team-up-to-combat-third-party-bots-in-online-games-in-the-age-of-ai-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teamed up</a> to create what's called "Razer ID verified by World AI."</p><p>It's a new single sign-on (SSO) proof-of-human system that verifies if a player is a human or a bot. If it all goes to plan, it will create a situation where anyone using a Razer ID account will be verified as a human, which could in turn help bolster "trust and security in the digital space," Razer said.</p><p>"Fair play starts with real players, and Razer ID's ability to integrate into games to enable 'human-only' gameplay modes is key to fostering fair competition and a more trusted gaming environment," the company stated.</p><p>Numerous games are negatively impacted by bots, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-hit-with-thousands-of-negative-steam-reviews-protesting-bot-issues/1100-6523926/" data-ref-id="1100-6523926">including Team Fortress 2</a>. Steps have been taken to address the issues, but on some level, the problems persist in that game and others. </p><p>Players need a verified <a href="https://world.org/faqs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">World ID account</a> for all of this, and that involves scanning their passport or visiting an <a href="https://world.org/find-orb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Orb location in the real world</a> to have your faced scanned to create a unique iris code.</p><p>The SSO will come to life first in the futuristic blockchain video game Tokyo Beast. The game utilizes NFTs, which makes it a prime candidate for potential bot spam. Take a look at the video below to learn more about how the new system will work.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ficNZwDYy8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ficNZwDYy8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Razer chief corporate officer Wei-Pin Choo said, "To foster fair competition, developers must be able to build trusted, human-only game experiences that keep AI bots out."</p><p>World, which was founded by Altman and Alex Blania, is a technology company that anonymously confirms a person's identity while claiming to ensure their privacy.</p>

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 was a colossal hit for Larian Studios, but with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">Larian walking away from the franchise</a>, toy juggernaut Hasbro is picking up the sword and shield and journeying on. Hasbro, which also owns all things Dungeons and Dragons, announced recently that the future of Baldur's Gate will be announced fairly soon, but not even a hint of what's to come.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Hasbro digital games SVP Dan Ayoub confirmed during this week's Game Developers Conference that there are plans for Baldur's Gate and that there's a lot of interest in the potential of the franchise.</p><p>"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that," he said. Making sure games like Baldur's Gate remain relevant aligns with what Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-magic-the-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons-video-games-are-on-the-way/1100-6527911/" data-ref-id="1100-6527911">back in November</a> of last year.</p><p>At the time, Cocks stated that there will be more Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons video games on the way. Could this also mean Baldur's Gate 4 included in the grand scheme of things? Ayoub certainly feels that it's inevitable, but nothing is in the works yet.</p><p>"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he continued. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach. We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p>The final patch for Baldur's Gate 3 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-is-now-live-will-test-cross-play-and-split-screen-co-op/1100-6529081/" data-ref-id="1100-6529081">arrived in January</a> and included--finally--cross-play and 12 new subclasses. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/631744/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>brings the franchise to the shores of Japan. After almost 20 years and 13 mainline games, <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> — the series about using flashy gadgets and techniques to murder your enemies undetected — has finally been set in a place famous for assassins who use flashy gadgets and techniques to murder their enemies undetected. I don’t know why Ubisoft waited so long. But I do know Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds">in</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283677/ubisoft-nft-game-champions-tactics-grimoria-chronicles-sequence">dire</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314843/keepin-it-all-in-the-family">need</a> of a hit, and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is poised to be one.</p><p>Ubisoft isn’t out to reinvent the formula with <em>Shadows</em>. In fact, there’s nothing mechanically (or even narratively) that separates this game from its predecessor, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23906187/assassins-creed-mirage-review-ubisoft"><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> <em>Mirage</em></a>. It’s just moved the game to a new location, with new characters and storylines. The strength of the game comes from whether Ubisoft can make those things pop.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155451/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-trailer-ubisoft"><em>Shadows</em> revives the dual protagonist system</a> introduced with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/23/9602584/assassins-creed-syndicate-review"><em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em></a>. To start the game, you play as Naoe, a young woman from Iga, a province of medieval Japan known for its shinobi. After her village is destroyed and her father is murdered, Naoe swears revenge on the shadowy cabal of masked individuals responsible. Her quest for vengeance brings her into contact with Yasuke, a former enslaved man searching for his place in life as a samurai in the service of Japan’s premier warlord of the time, Oda Nobunaga. </p><p>After about the first 10 hours of the game, which are focused on Naoe, players are allowed to swap freely between Naoe and Yasuke and their wildly different styles of gameplay. Naoe is the stealth character; she’s quick and light on her feet, able to scale buildings with the use of her grappling hook and assassinate her enemies from the shadows (heh) with her hidden blade. Yasuke is the bruiser, able to take a beating and dish one out in turn with massive heavy weapons like the naginata, long katana, and musket-style firearms known as teppo.</p><p>Ubisoft did a good job of tuning both character’s skills and abilities such that both have elements that make them appealing to play. I really liked how Yasuke and Naoe, in addition to being engaging characters with narratives I enjoyed watching develop, are suited for specific jobs and my moment-to-moment moods. If I’m short on patience or I know I’m going up against elite enemies with chunky health bars, I’ll barrel them over with Yasuke, teppo blazing. But if I don’t feel like knock-down, drag-out fights or I’m after a tasty bit of treasure well guarded by a swarm of enemies, that’s a job for Naoe, who can get in and out without rousing any alarm.</p><p>But just because Yasuke and Naoe have their own strengths doesn’t mean they can’t play to their weaknesses. It was just as satisfying, if not more so, to make the burly Yasuke pop out of a bush to stealthily stab a guy (although, with him, it’s less of a light stab and more like an impalement) or have Naoe hold her own against the tough bosses. I had a very hearty laugh when I made Yasuke do his first leap of faith, a well-known <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> staple that has characters trust-fall from high-up observation points into bales of hay or other soft landings.</p><p>For both characters, combat is a simple, standard affair, wherein players can string together light or heavy attacks interspersed with special abilities specific to their character or weapon. In particular, I was surprised by how brutal Yasuke’s combat was. In trying out the naginata for the first time, I was shocked by the violence of his finisher that has him stomp on his enemy’s head, as though running him through the chest the moment before wasn’t enough to get the job done. It was a level of goriness I associate more with <em>Mortal Kombat</em> than <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. </p><p>There was another jarring moment very early in the game that highlighted the tension between <em>Shadows</em> as a product designed to make money and an artistic endeavor. Within seconds of starting the game, it presented a gallery of assassins from previous titles. I thought each entry would play a cutscene that would summarize the game’s story. Instead, selecting any of the entries kicked me out of <em>Shadows</em> and into the PlayStation Store, where I was prompted to buy the game I wanted to learn about. (Ostensibly, if you own the game, selecting its entry would launch it.) I thought it was a bad omen, setting the tone for a game stuffed with the kind of nickel-and-dime live-service bullshit that Ubisoft is known for.</p><p>But with <em>Shadows</em>, I finally <em>get</em> the franchise. I’ve never liked open-world games. With few exceptions, I find them tedious and overwhelming, especially Ubisoft’s particular flavor of them that are littered with side quests and activities that are little more than busywork. <em>Shadows</em> is similarly constructed. It’s the same kind of gameplay in the same kind of open world — with a map so cluttered with <em>things </em>that looking at it made me anxious.</p><p>Yet, I didn’t mind any of that. Partly, it’s the narrative: I find Yasuke and Naoe’s banter to be sweet and funny, and their story of learning to work together makes for a perfectly fine <em>Odd Couple</em>-style narrative. But even that’s not enough. It’s the world. </p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/20/17033024/assassins-creed-origins-discovery-tour-educational-mode-release">with previous <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games</a>, Ubisoft has invested time into recreating this era of Japan with exacting detail. Locations are rendered from their real-life counterparts and given codex entries that delve into their stories with a historian’s level of specificity. Quests that touch on cultural elements, such as the tea ceremony, are similarly reconstructed with the same level of gravity. The locations and events are not treated as mere set dressing, but as living, breathing entities invested with the same weight and respect as they are in real life. When you encounter the first torii gate, the game warns you to respect what the structure represents by not climbing all over it, and it feels good honoring that request. That level of care is why, 35 hours in, I haven’t grown tired of what is, on pixel, unforgivable tedium. </p><p>I enjoyed traversing the way-too-big map, finding all the little activities I could get into while on my way to the bigger story quests. I was thrilled every time the seasons changed and I got to see the land transform. Every bit of scenery is rendered with such detail that I felt transported to an era of Japan that, despite being covered to death in media, nevertheless remains endlessly fascinating. I was enthralled by the game’s deep and detailed codex that covered everything from the history of the era and its notable figures to the minutia of daily life as a Japanese peasant. Sure, popping out and killing ninjas is great, and I’m genuinely interested in how Yasuke and Naoe achieve their goals. But more than anything, I wanna visit the top of Mount Hiei and learn about the warrior monks of its Enryakuji Temple. We all watched <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24138469/shogun-finale-review-war-toranaga-explained-episode"><em>Shōgun</em></a> deservedly <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/shogun-wins-best-television-series-drama-2025-golden-globes-1235225689/">carry away all the awards</a>. Playing <em>Shadows</em> felt like experiencing that show all over again. </p><p><sub><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>launches on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on March 20th.</sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a> is just not having a very good time on PC. The game only launched on Steam just last week, where it was quickly discovered that, oh dear, there are a lot of issues. Just a quick look at the game's reviews will let you in on its myriad of problems, but one of the biggest ones that's cropped up is an issue where <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1340990/discussions/0/828204828240984227/">save files are being completely wiped</a>, obviously quite an annoying bug especially if you've put a lot of time into the game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Yesterday, developer Koei Tecmo shared an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1340990/announcements/detail/616535451664123019">update post on Steam</a> noting that they are aware of the reported save data bug, and that they're "looking into" what's causing the problem. That's all well and good, but they did at least offer a couple of potential temporary solutions to the problem. In one part it could be down to your computer's documents folder being set to file sharing. Turning it off might help, but Koei doesn't guarantee anything. There's also a support page that has more specific details on this particular fix you can check out <a href="https://support.koeitecmo.info/hc/en-us/articles/23580170503193--Steam-Cannot-save-load">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Steam post also includes a way to retrieve your save data by heading to a specific folder on your computer, where you can rename the BACKUP.BIN file to SAVEDATA.BIN to hopefully get it back, but I'll let you read the post rather than explain here and have you complaining at me in the comments that I broke your computer somehow.
</p>
<p>
Steam's Cloud save function might also be able to restore your save, but Koei Tecmo notes that if you're asked which save file to keep, you should rename your local save data and store it somewhere else before using the Cloud data.
</p>
<p>
A proper patch for all of Rise of the Ronin's issues <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1340990/view/507322442554803882">was promised when it launched on PC last week</a>, which is supposedly coming "soon", though it might still be worth holding off on jumping back in until that update arrives.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/which-character-is-best-in-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-yasuke-vs-naoe.1138143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-assassins-creed-shadows-character-naoe-yasuke/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows offers a dual-protagonist system that presents the player with freedom of choice. Do you want to be the heavy-set warrior, Yasuke, or do you want to be the lithe and agile shinboi, Naoe? Both characters have unique abilities and loadouts, but which of them can be considered <strong>the best character </strong>in Assassin’s Creed Shadows to play as?</p>



<p>Read on to understand these characters and learn which of them is the best protagonist in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-yasuke-vs-naoe-which-character-is-best">Yasuke vs Naoe – Which Character is Best?</h2>



<p>It’s mostly a subjective debate when it comes to determining which of the two Assassin’s Creed Shadows protagonists is the best.</p>



<p>If you prefer decimating your enemies with heavy attacks, you’ll probably pick Yasuke. If you’re more of a stealthy player who relies on shadows and subterfuge to achieve your goals, you’ll prefer Naoe.</p>



<p>Here are the advantages and disadvantages of both characters in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p><strong>Yasuke</strong></p>



<p>Advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>High health pool</li>



<li>Incredibly powerful attacks</li>



<li>Can use a bow and teppo (gun)</li>



<li>Can easily dispatch even the toughest enemies</li>
</ul>



<p>Disadvantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Very slow, cumbersome parkour abilities</li>



<li>Tougher to remain hidden, almost impossible in some circumstances</li>



<li>No eagle vision or hidden blade</li>



<li>Attacks are typically slower and require more planning</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Naoe</strong></p>



<p>Advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Very fast and a fantastic parkour artist</li>



<li>Uses shinobi tools like smoke grenades, grapple hooks, and distraction mechanics to go unseen</li>



<li>Uses a wide range of melee weapons, most of which are designed around speed</li>



<li>Can assassinate enemies and use eagle vision to spot and mark enemies</li>
</ul>



<p>Disadvantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Low health pool that is a challenge against tough enemies</li>



<li>Limited ranged weapons; can only use Kunai and Shuriken</li>



<li>Less physically dominating and won’t scare enemies as easily</li>
</ul>



<p>In general, I think that Assassin’s Creed fans will gravitate much more readily to Naoe, who represents the creed and what the series stands for. In truth, you’ll be splitting your time between both. However, after around 30 hours in the game at the time of writing, I can honestly and openly say that I’ve preferred my time spent with Naoe.</p>



<p>She’s much faster and more agile, and her parkour abilities are the best the franchise has ever seen. Her skillset makes her incredibly fluid, and the stealth factor with Naoe is off the charts. The only time I actively switch to Yasuke is if I’ve tried to win a fight with Naoe and have lost – if that’s the case, I bring in the hulking samurai to tackle the tougher enemies.</p>



<p>From a cosmetic perspective, I also enjoy Naoe’s outfits more. They’re better suited to the assassin lifestyle, but that’s not to take away from Yasuke’s incredible armour sets.</p>



<p>That’s which character I think is best in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but feel free to let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

            <p>
Fans of developer Argonaut's warmly remembered 3D platformer Croc: Legend of the Gobbos are in for a blast of nostalgia; after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90s-platformer-remaster-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-has-been-delayed-into-next-year">bit of a delay</a>, its previously announced remaster has been given a release date, and is launching for PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch on 2nd April.
</p>
<p>
Croc: Legend of the Gobbos, for the uninitiated (or young), launched for the original PlayStation in 1997, taking players - in the guise of the titular crocodile - on a journey through Gobbo Valley in a bid to free their friends from the evil magician Baron Dante. The resulting adventure wasn't <em>exactly</em> a classic of the genre, but it certainly had fans.
</p>
<p>
And now, Argonaut - which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90s-platformer-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-is-being-remastered-by-resurrected-argonaut-games">resurrected last year</a>, 20 years after its original closure - is revisiting Croc's first outing with a nostalgia-tweaking update. It promises "vibrant high-definition graphics, a modern control and camera system, and refined gameplay mechanics" as players venture across "beautifully recrafted" levels.

That's alongside the addition of a Crocipedia - a "painstakingly curated" digital museum charting the original game's development through design documents, concept art, animation tests, pre-release music tracks, and interviews with developers past and present.
</p>
<p>
If all that's filled you with the giddy warmth of memories past, Croc: Legend of the Gobbos launches digitally for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos">PC via GOG</a> on 2nd April, where it'll cost $29.99 USD.

		<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is sticking with the action RPG gameplay where gear and loot are a key part of your progression through the game. Weapons and gear come in various types and apply to different gameplay styles, but a basic tanto isn’t going to be anywhere near as good as a legendary tanto, and comes without perks.</p>
<p>Alongside levelling up and gaining Mastery points, you’ll need to look out for legendary chests and more. Here’s what to look for to get the best gear and loot in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>.</p>

<li><strong><a href="#section2">How to find legendary gear and legendary chests in AC Shadows</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section3">Levelling up weapons and gear in AC Shadows</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section1">Assassin’s Creed Shadows loot tiers and perks explained</h2>
<p>Shadows has a loot system that uses the familiar common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary item tiers. The higher the tier, the more powerful the piece of equipment, generally speaking, though if you’re particularly lucky and get a good drop, an epic item could be more powerful than a legendary one.</p>


<p>Uncommon items and up come with a perk that can make a big difference, like increaseing armour when health is full, or boosting your damage per adrenaline chunk filled, whilst rare items and better can also be inscribed with another perk of your choice at the forge in your hideout.</p>



<p>Generally speaking the most consistently powerful gear you can count on finding is legendary gear. The stats are betters, the perks are better, and they probably look cooler too. The most consistent way to get it is by opening legendary chests.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to find legendary chests, but most reliably they are found in castles. To open a castle’s legendary chest you first need to defeat all the Samurai Daisho in that castle which can be a little time consuming, but you’ll also find a bunch of resources which you can later use to upgrade your equipment and earn Mastery points, so it’s time well spent!</p>
<p>You can also find legendary chests out in the world, and there are a few things to look out for. First, if you see some soldiers threatening a civilian and kill said soldiers, the civilian will reward you with your choice of either a scout support or some world information. The world information can sometimes give you information about a legendary chest nearby, or a kofun, which is a cave to explore with a legendary chest at the end.</p>
<p>You can also get locations for these chests in kakuregas, which are like outposts where you can fast travel to and restock your equipment. You can get radiant missions from here as well as areas to search for nearby content, such as legendary chests and castles.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Levelling up weapons and gear in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>
<p>Remember to pick up as many resources as possible as you play, as on top of the loot’s tier system, they also have levels. Once you’ve built a forge at your hideout you’ll be able to upgrade your gear’s level to ensure it’s still useful after you’ve levelled up a bit. When you upgrade the forge you’ll also be able to inscribe another perk onto rare or better equipment, giving you another modifier of your choice. These perks can be very useful and can be unlocked by completing certain challenges in-game, such as a certain amount of assassinations, as well as be rewards for completing certain quests.</p>
<p>One of the earlier legendary items I found was a tanto for Naoe that, after using a weak point attack (by holding R1 until charged) against a vulnerable enemy, would trigger another vulnerable state afterwards, allowing me to use another weakpoint attack and deal even more damage. As she’s a character that’s much more focused on speed, a skill like this was very useful, so I’ve focused on upgrading it ever since. Once you find an item with a trait that works well for your playstyle, you can keep upgrading it like this until you find a replacement that works even better, or that is so good that it changes how you play.</p>
<hr>
<p>There you have it. Looting in Assassin’s Creed Shadows comes with the standard item tiers, but you need to keep a look our for Legendary chests to find the best gear, and then keep on top of upgrades to all your weapons and items.</p>

		<p>With the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, you get to play as not one, but two characters whilst assassin-ing your way around feudal Japan. Joining forces to thwart another evil plot, Naoe and Yasuke are both very different in just about every way, from their backgrounds and motivations to combat style, tools, and weaponry. As you switch between the two of them at will, you’ll need to adjust your playstyle to account for their strengths and weaknesses, and depending on your preferred playstyle you might wonder, can you play Assassin’s Creed Shadows only as Naoe or Yasuke?</p>
<h2>In this guide</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#section1">Who are Naoe and Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section2">Who is better in AC Shadows: Naoe or Yasuke?</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section3">Can I play as just one character in AC Shadows?</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Naoe – the sneaky Ninja Assassin</h3>
<p>Naoe is a trained shinobi who is out for revenge in typical Assassin’s Creed fashion, which means she’s both stealthy and sneaky, and your go-to for anything involving either of those two things. In addition to being small, quick, and not wearing clunky, loud armour, she also has a grappling hook to help reach rooftops and vantage points, and a set of tools – kunai, shurikens, bells, and smoke bombs. Naturally this combination of things makes her ideal for sneaking into a castle and methodically assassinating every poor guard who happens to be on duty.</p>
<p>She’s not useless in combat either. She doesn’t deal huge amounts of damage and might have a bit of a tough time taking out the implausibly giant guards, but she is capable provided you make full use of parrying and posture attacks on vulnerable enemies. She can equip two of a katana, a kusarigama, and a tanto/hidden blade combo to fight with and will need to be light on her feet to ensure she doesn’t get boxed in by enemies. The kusarigama will help with that, as its upgrades give improved crowd control.</p>



<h3>Yasuke – The towering Samurai</h3>
<p>Yasuke, meanwhile, is an actual samurai. And by actual, I mean he is based on a historical figure. The slave of a Portuguese Jesuit before Lord Oda Nobunaga took an interest in him, he became the first black samurai in history.</p>

<p>Yasuke is built for combat. In addition to being head and shoulders above most other people in the game, he can absorb much more damage than Naoe can, thanks to his full suit of samurai armour, and carries more rations to quickly restore health. He can choose between a long katana, a naginata, a kanabo, a yumi bow, and a teppo, which is a shotgun-like rifle.</p>
<p>Yasuke doesn’t have any tools, not even a grappling hook, and if you want a ranged weapon you’ll have to use one of your two weapon slots for a bow or teppo. The bow itself can be silent, but guards tend to find it a bit suspicious to see a giant pointing a bow at them. Yasuke’s biggest weakness is how profoundly un-sneaky he is – when he moves he makes more noise than Naoe, as he’s wearing a lot of armour, he climbs much more slowly, and when attempting a leap of faith he bounces right out of the haystack, though still without taking damage thankfully. However, Yasuke doesn’t need any of this. Stealth? He just wades into a camp and fights everyone at once. Climbing? Please, Yasuke can literally sprint through closed gates, breaking them into pieces.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Who is better in AC Shadows: Naoe or Yasuke?</h2>
<p>As fun as Yasuke is to play as, rushing right into the thick of the action and battering enemies, his impressive lack of stealth does make Naoe the better fit for the stealthy assassin fantasy of the Assassin’s Creed series. Naoe is the better all-rounder.&nbsp;She can climb quickly, do the leap of faith, attack from range with her tools, and she has a wrist blade so she can assassinate properly as well, whereas Yasuke can only do “his own type of assassination” which usually involves a beheading and lots of noise. More importantly, Naoe can handle herself in a fight far better than Yasuke can handle stealth. It still won’t be easy when you’re fighting off half a castle as her, but at least she can drop a smoke bomb and run away to hide again.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Can I play as just one character in AC Shadows?</h2>
<p>The game is clearly designed to necessitate the use of both characters, as Naoe and Yasuke both have important roles through the game’s story, but if you have a favourite, then you can largely stick to playing as just one or the other.</p>
<p>You can switch at any time when in the open world, and major story missions are broken up with decision points to let you choose which character to play as for the next section, so you can simply pick to play as your favourite of the two at those points. The one sticking point is when you need to talk to specific NPCs as a particular character, forcing you to switch for at least a short time.</p>

As previously announced during February’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-showcase-perks-stadium-freja-aqua-season-15-1851761489&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-showcase-perks-stadium-freja-aqua-season-15-1851761489"><em>Overwatch 2 </em>Spotlight stream</a></span>, Blizzard is releasing five new skins and other cosmetics based on Le Sserafim, four of which are for heroes who weren’t part of the original event.</p><p>While the last collaboration dressed Tracer, D.Va, Brigitte, Kiriko, and Sombra up as if they were going to a Le Sserafim concert, this time around the participating heroes—Illari, Ashe, Mercy, Juno, and, once again, D.Va—have gotten full makeovers as if they were K-Pop idols themselves. (D.Va is <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s Korean hero, so if any hero is going to share the spotlight a second time, it makes sense that it would be her.) Each hero looks pretty different from their base designs thanks to some elaborate hairdos and coloring, so we’ll see how well their in-game silhouettes match up to what players are used to. Click through to see all five.</p><p>The event also included an animated music video featuring all five heroes set to Le Sserafim’s song “So Cynical (Badum)” from the group’s new album <em>Hot</em> released on March 14, which you can watch below.</p><p>Blizzard is trying to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-perks-stadium-season-15-spotlight-preview-1851761919&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-perks-stadium-season-15-spotlight-preview-1851761919">revamp <em>Overwatch 2 </em>right now</a></span> with big changes like the Perks system that allows you to customize your hero’s kit throughout a match, and the upcoming Stadium mode. It might not be enough to bring back the players it’s lost, but it’s been nice to see the company loosening the reins on players after years of trying to dictate how <em>Overwatch 2 </em>was played.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
