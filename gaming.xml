<figure><a title="September Direct" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9cf6e645c0d4e/september-direct.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's marketing for the Switch and Switch 2 is going absolutely <em>nuts</em> in 2025. We had a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Partner Showcase</a> in July, an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">a Kirby blowout</a> in August, and now we're getting a full-fat, juicy Direct in September. Crikey!</p>
<p>Naturally, questions linger regarding the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, but the nature of this Direct means that we could be getting a whole bunch of new surprises for the remainder of 2025 and the start of 2026. At least we won't be seeing any <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>, though, eh? Well, probably not.</p>
<p>Mario himself is also celebrating his 40th anniversary this week, with the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> having launched on 13th September 1985 in Japan. Surely Nintendo will want to acknowledge this in the Direct, but honestly, who knows?</p>
<p>We've got a lot to ponder here, so let's find out what Team NL is expecting in the upcoming showcase...</p>

<h2>Brewing up a surprise? - Alana Hagues, deputy editor</h2>
<figure><a title="Hades" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1571b8bab15ab/hades.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Supergiant Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a>. I've asked for this a few times this year, and realistically, I think this is the place it will show up the most. It was in two earlier Directs, and with a Switch 2 Edition also coming, I think a big headliner showcase like this is the way forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades II</a>'s release date also seems like a good shout, but good lord, do <em>not</em> shadow drop, give us a little bit of a breather. I can't deal with two sequels to two of my favourite games back-to-back.</p>
<p>For Mario's anniversary... geez, it sure would be nice to get a special edition Switch 2 or something. But, realistically, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a> on Switch Online and <em>maybe</em> an update to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">3D All-Stars</a>. You know, that excellent sequel that's missing from the package</p>
<p>And, one final Wild Card for you Jim: <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Princ</a><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">e</a>. Give it to us! <em>Please</em>.</p>
<p>I will leave the Big Beyond to our big ol' Samus fan below.</p>
<h2>(Un)known (un)knowns - Gavin Lane, editor</h2>
<figure><a title="Hotel Barcelona" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/34b650949f582/hotel-barcelona.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Cult Games Limited</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Dates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII</a> are fairly safe bets; there are various other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-all-confirmed-games-and-release-dates#q4-2025">stragglers with vague '2025' dates</a>, too. There's still potential for more big news from Microsoft (Call of Duty is coming to Switch, remember?). And I'd love to see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/hotel_barcelona">Hotel Barcelona</a> announced for Switch 2.</p>
<p>What I'm hoping for is <em>new</em> info, though. Games and dates and details we didn't know about before. We've got "roughly 60 minutes" here, but every minute taken up with known knowns (hi, Pok√©mon) will be a hit on our collective Excit-o-meters. After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-switch-2-needed-a-partner-showcase-with-pep-this-wasnt-it">July's underwhelming Partner Showcase</a>, Nintendo needs to bring out the big guns.</p>
<p>The fact that we're not getting a Mario-specific Direct suggests that we're not going to see <em>loads</em> of Mario material. But, you can be sure there'll be a section devoted to the 40th anniversary, so I'll double down on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/what-we-expect-from-nintendo-for-super-mario-bros-40th-anniversary">my <strong>Mario Maker 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</strong> prediction</a>.</p>
<p>If they <em>really</em> want to make this Direct cook, however, Nintendo should finish with a tease for the next big Mario game. I'd argue they need that level of pep to supercharge things and signal their biggest games for 2026...but it's a coin toss. With Donkey Kong Bananza on the system, maybe they'd want to keep the platforming focus on <em>that</em> for the holidays? But I'd have said the same thing about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> and Mario Kart. Hey, it's 60 minutes - plenty of time that needs filling with games old and new.</p>
<p>Though please, Mr. Sakurai, let's not fill it with a 25-minute deep-dive explaining the alpha effects behind Kirby's star trail, hmm?</p>
<h2>When Evil lurks - Ollie Reynolds, staff writer</h2>
<figure><a title="RE4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8e621cf8d92a1/re4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's time to get some <strong>Resident Evil</strong> on the Switch 2, right? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rumour-resident-evil-requiem-could-be-heading-to-the-switch-2">Rumours have circulated</a> that not only is Capcom planning to launch <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Requiem</a> on Nintendo's new console, but also the entire RE Engine catalogue. I'd love to see all of them, of course, but if I had to pick just one, then it would be <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>. With the franchise's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/capcom-launches-resident-evil-30th-anniversary-website">30th anniversary</a> on the horizon, I suspect Capcom will want to take advantage of the Switch 2's early momentum.</p>
<p>We're definitely due a launch date for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and I'm still pretty convinced we'll see it at the start of December. I'm happy to be proven wrong, mind you! Otherwise, like Gavin, I'm very keen to see some brand-new games. Ports are great, but they'll only get you so far.</p>
<p>Is it too early for <strong>Pikmin 5</strong>? How about a new <strong>Animal Crossing</strong>? Lots of possibilities, and I'm honestly just excited to see what Nintendo has up its sleeve.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-finals-season-8-out-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embark-studios-launches-season-8-for-the-finals-bringing-new-destruction-elements-weapons-and-more.1293738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Embark Studios has revealed and launched Season 8 for The Finals, bringing new enhancements to the in-game destruction that helped make the game popular in the first place, two new weapons that players have been waiting for, and more.</p>



<p>Season 8, titled Game Time, adds what Embark Studios is calling "<em>Smooth Destruction</em>" to The Finals. Per a press release from Embark Studios, you'll now see elements in-game like "<em>cranes cutting through buildings and suspended structures reacting more realistically with massive impact</em>."</p>



<p>The two new weapons coming to The Finals in Season 8 are a P90 SMG for the Medium class and a BFR Revolver for the Heavy class. The P90 is especially significant for The Finals, since it's the first SMG being introduced to the Medium class, and will likely have a major impact on the game's meta.</p>



<p>Embark Studios also debuted a new trailer for Season 8 of The Finals, showing off the new destruction elements and the new weapons. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Other quality-of-life improvements in Season 8 include the addition of an instant replay that show what your opponent saw during an intense moment, the arrival of mouse and keyboard controls for players on consoles, and a new match recap landing page that is meant to give you more detailed and easy-to-read stats from your previous match.</p>



<p>And of course, there will also be a new battle pass for players to work through in Season 8 with a slew of cosmetics to grab, including a few new cosmetic areas that can help you stand out even more when jumping into the arena.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-27-inch-smart-monitor-with-free-live-tv-channels-is-nearly-50-off-a-practically-free-tv-replacement-2000624483</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung‚Äôs M5 Series FHD smart monitor is on sale over at Amazon. There are two different size models. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4020/">The 27-inch is normally $280, but after a 46% discount it comes to just $150.</a> The 32-inch has come down from $300 by 27% to just $220. Those prices are for the black option. You can also choose a sleek all-white version. The price and discount for that one are the same as the black for the 32-inch. However, the 27-inch white model is onl;y down to $230 which is notably $10 more than the 32-inch is going for. So unless space is that much of a concern, there‚Äôs really no good reason to choose the 27-inch white over the 32-inch white.</p>
<p>As a smart monitor, this display is equipped with a full Samsung TV interface which you can stream movies and shows to. You can even get live TV channels at no extra cost. Essentially it‚Äôs a small HD TV that you can also control with a mouse and keyboard. It does also come with a remote.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4020/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Samsung M5 smart monitor has embedded productivity apps including the full Microsoft 365 suite. You can bypass needing a PC by just accessing Word, PowerPoint, or Excel on the monitor directly.</p>
<p>The display is fully adjustable on a swivel and tilt stand so you can always have it position optimally depending on where you‚Äôre sitting and where you have it set up.</p>



<h2>Samsung Gaming Hub</h2>
<p>A real selling point is Gaming Hub. This is Samsung‚Äôs built-in interface to stream popular video game titles right to your TV, or rather in this case, right to your monitor. It doesn‚Äôt even require an Xbox consoles ‚Äî just get yourself a controller and subscription to Xbox Game Pass and you‚Äôll be ready to play. Nothing to download either. All the titles can be streamed from the cloud.</p>
<p>As a subscriber to Xbox Game Pass, you‚Äôll gain access to hundreds of awesome games ranging from indie darlings like <em>Celeste</em>&nbsp;to giant AAA hits like the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>. Or pop on over into a new <em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>server with some friends. The long-awaited <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>is finally here and yes, it too is on Game Pass. New titles arrive to the service every month and you will gain access to even more games as it includes an EA Play membership.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4020/">Grab you Samsung M5 smart monitor for as low as $150 for a limited time over at Amazon.</a></p>

                <p>Activision has confirmed that, in fact, some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 skins will carry forward to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Black Ops 7</a>--but they're limited to a handful of Black Ops 6 Zombies skins.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, Activision originally announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-carry-forward-returns-for-black-ops-7-but-with-limitations/1100-6534013/" data-ref-id="1100-6534013">Black Ops 7 would support the Carry Forward program</a> and allow players to bring their Black Ops 6 skins to Black Ops 7. However, Activision later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">canceled these plans</a> and confirmed that most skins--including ones people paid money for--are not carrying forward.</p><p>Now, Activision has confirmed that the four main quest operator skin rewards earned in Black Ops 6 will be available to use in Black Ops 7 at launch. The New Orders prestige level 1,000 operator skin from Black Ops 6 will also be available for the operator Samuels at launch for Black Ops 7.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>Heads up, Zombies players: any of the 4 Main Quest Operator Skin rewards earned in Black Ops 6 will be available in Black Ops 7 at launch!</p><p>And for the truly dedicated, the "New Orders" Prestige Level 1000 Operator Skin reward will also be available for Samuels on day one. ü§ù <a href="https://t.co/sJMXkR2SXX" rel="nofollow  ">pic.twitter.com/sJMXkR2SXX</a></p></div>  ‚Äî Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1965567095145684994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2025</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>Another Black Ops 6 item that carries forward to Black Ops 7 is the Guild Override camo skin, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-call-of-dutys-new-gun-that-dynamically-changes-as-you-shoot/1100-6534475/" data-ref-id="1100-6534475">available right now in Black Ops 6</a> for people who preorder Black Ops 7. When Black Ops 7 releases in November, this skin will be available in that game.</p><p>When Activision canceled the Carry Forward program for Black Ops 7, the company said "Black Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting." Many took this to mean Activision was reacting to the online discussion about Call of Duty's wacky and weird skins, but the company never said as much. </p><p>While most guns, skins, and operators from Black Ops 6 will not carry forward to Black Ops 7, double XP tokens and GobbleGums for Zombies will indeed carry forward. Also worth noting is that these changes only apply to Black Ops 7--your Black Ops 6 content will still carry forward to Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">everyone will be able to try the game during the multiplayer beta in early October.</a></p>

According to Packwood, developers at the event were telling him about the need to make games on faster development cycles‚Äîtargeting only one or two years of work instead of half a decade. Many developers we've heard from in the last year have echoed that sentiment, but the piece still proved controversial on social media.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why? According to Packwood, developers are doing this by using generative AI to create code snippets, concept art, and other assets in order to "quickly iterate" on ideas. "AI is the games industry's dirty little open secret," Packwood wrote, saying many he spoke with at Gamescom were "coy" about the topic, dreading backlash like the kind faced by 11 Bit Studios after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/11-bit-apologizes-for-not-disclosing-gen-ai-use-in-the-alters">AI-generated assets</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were found in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Alters</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Packwood cruised downriver to argue that because AI is "already in widespread use" in the game industry, then it's "absurd" for developers to "live in fear forever," I was still back upstream trying to understand how generating code snippets, concept art, or other assets could speed up production. The logic implies that what's slowing down game development is the speed of making assets included in the game like code, 3D models, text, audio, etc. If that's the problem, then generative AI spitting out assets would be a solution.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/frost-giant-boss-tim-morten-claims-generative-ai-can-help-devs-realize-their-grand-vision-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Frost Giant boss Tim Morten claims generative AI can help devs realize their 'grand vision'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But is that the actual problem?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I decided to put it to the test with emails to developers, publishers, and industry experts at companies ranging from Tencent, to Hooded Horse, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nearstudios-pivot-to-kickstarter-is-a-sign-of-a-new-industry-trend">NEARstudios</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and beyond‚Äîall asking one not-so-easy question: "what do you think is the number one reason games are taking longer to make?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Their answers point in a different direction: one that centers the difficult-to-measure </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>quality </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">of games rather than the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>quantity </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">of assets used to make them.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="More assets doesn't equal more fun">More assets doesn't equal more fun</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The number one reason games are taking longer to make is that the quality bar has risen dramatically. Players today expect fun and engaging gameplay, cutting-edge visuals, memorable narrative and characters, and the ability to play whenever and wherever they want."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's what Tencent Games Strategy and Compliance vice president Yongyi Zhu offered up in response to our hip-fired developer survey. So, if you're a large studio making games in a familiar genre, it takes a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>lot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of work to meet player expectations, let alone exceed them.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/video-games-have-a-serious-crediting-problem-but-unions-can-help" target="_self" data-discover="true">Video games have a serious crediting problem, but unions can help</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Virtuos managing director of game division Christophe Gandon echoed this sentiment. "As the games industry matures, projects grow in complexity as players increasingly demand better quality, immersion, and satisfaction in game length and value. Developers strive to meet or exceed these expectations."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhu and Unity Engine senior vice president of product Adam Smith both pointed out that smaller teams making more experimental titles can move way faster. Smith nodded to Aggro Crab and Landfall's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/how-co-op-climbing-hit-peak-achieved-2-million-sales-for-less-than-200-000-">viral climbing game </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/how-co-op-climbing-hit-peak-achieved-2-million-sales-for-less-than-200-000-">Peak</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a key example. "Many larger studios tie up resources in costly infrastructure before they can focus on making games, leading to higher costs and longer cycles," said Smith.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The vicious cycle of photorealism">The vicious cycle of photorealism</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Smith's point about "costly infrastructure" and the efficiencies of small teams made us eager to hear from NEARstudios CEO Heather Cerlan, a veteran technical artist from the world of large triple-A games. To her, the longer developer cycles are a consequence of tying the quality of games to photorealistic art direction.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For the last 10 to 15 years games grew in scope and became more and more photorealistic. Hardware and tools were coming to market that technically made this feasible," she said. "Developers were excited about the tech and were eager to use them and showcase the work made with those tools."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/undisputed-developer-steel-city-interactive-opens-leamington-studio" target="_self" data-discover="true">Undisputed developer Steel City Interactive opens Leamington studio</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But just because those tools made photorealism "feasible" didn't mean it made them easy to use. Cerlan and her peers knew that. But plenty of "executives and decision-makers" didn't... and they were the ones approving &nbsp;ever-skyrocketing budgets. Photorealistic games required complex tools, complex tools required specialists in numbers that ballooned team sizes. Bigger teams meant worse communication.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Worse communication meant unexpected tech problems that took time to address. Unexpected tech problems created performance optimization problems, and before you know it your game studio is spending time chasing frame rate bugs than iterating on "core gameplay" and other elements that "95 percent of players don't care about."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[Then] when the game finally launches publicly, there's frame rate drops and bugs that frustrate players and they lose confidence," Cerlan concluded. "This problem is making it so that they couldn't innovate in areas where players wanted innovation. The industry is now facing a reckoning, and I believe this issue of 'more, bigger, prettier' is a major factor as to why everyone in video games is suffering right now and why everything feels soulless."</span></p><p>Image via NEARstudios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cerlan's tool-oriented thinking casts a glaring light on the idea of better games emerging from a process where the asset machine is just cranked up to maximum speed. But photorealism isn't the only reason a game may take years in development‚Äîwhat happens when developers report that spending more time in the shop is key to making a high quality game?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Can longer development cycles actually work?">Can longer development cycles actually work?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">riding high after 7 years of development</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we really should have been more prepared for developers to praise longer production timelines. Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender and Riot Games senior game producer Patrick Miller flipped the script on us, each referencing the sky-high quality of player expectations for new games. "Players definitely have high expectations of quality and content for new games.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Extra time in development can fundamentally improve a game's reception on release," said Bender. "I couldn‚Äôt say how this factor weighs against all the others involved, but we are frequently in the position of encouraging developers to take all the time they need to get things fully ready before release.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Even for an Early Access release that often means a lot of delay to ensure things are in great shape before anyone starts paying money for the game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bender's response echoes what Cerlan mentioned about players being let down by bugs and frame drops when playing triple-A games‚Äîbut the difference might be about what kind of expectations you're being measured against. Promise visual perfection, and every inadvertent T-pose damns you to the pits of Tartarus. Promise hours of emergent gameplay, and players will shrug off frame drops or hitches.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile Miller said the nearly ten years of work on Riot Games' League of Legends-themed fighting game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2XKO</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (previously known as "Project L") was vital to make sure the game isn't KO'd in round one. Calling himself "optimistic" on the topic of long development cycles, he said it's important for developers to "take the time to better understand the game we should be making and the players we're making it for."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Miller said that in his many, many years working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2XKO</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> he saw the team go through "countless cycles" of building, testing, and refining the game's direction. "Each time we do this, the team learns something important that shifts our direction slightly," he said. "These longer cycles aren't necessarily about having more room to fix bugs or build more content, they're about giving the team more runway to solve problems at a reasonable pace instead of overloading them, so that the path to shipping and post-launch support are smoother."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The stakes are all the more higher for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2XKO</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> because it's a fighting game‚Äîa genre defined by standout games with thirty years of mistakes and successes built into their DNA. "It takes a lot of time and effort to unpack the 30+ years of lessons that the veteran studios have learned," said Miller.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I often remind my teammates that it took seven Tekken games (and two Tekken Tag games) to get to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tekken 8</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I'm glad we didn't ship any of the 'Project Ls' we were making before we got to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2XKO</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Generative AI's princess is still in another castle">Generative AI's princess is still in another castle</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Can generative AI solve any of the problems described above? Probably not‚Äîat least not under Packwood's framing. Even when new technology can streamline processes and improve efficiency, "the time saved is often reinvested in enhancing or creating more content," Gandon explained to Game Developer.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The insights from Cerlan, Smith, and Zhu suggest that maybe smaller teams are the key to producing games at a faster clip‚Äîbut that could lead to a world where "core" teams </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-deprofessionalization-is-bad-for-video-games">shrink to smaller and smaller proportions</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> while underpaid contractors and external development studios fill in the gaps.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The solutions to extra-long development cycles don't seem to be about tool choice or team size. Cerlan told us that she founded NEARStudios to "enable smaller teams to feel empowered to innovate, who could make strategic choices on fidelity and let go of those misinformed expectations that I believed were holding back video games."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Scratch out the word "smaller," and that thinking can work up and down the game industry if the right people are given the right shot.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p>Mega Malamar has been announced for Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A and Eurogamer couldn't be happier to see its favourite Pok√©mon get a glow up.</p>
<p>Mega Evolution refers to when a Pok√©mon undergoes a temporary transformation to increase its power and alter its appearance. In the case of Malamar, its head tentacles have twisted together to resemble a brain and it now has spiked shoulderpads. Unlike its traditional form, Mega Malamar also has longer tentacles and a thinner body, all of which have a beautiful rainbow glow.</p>

<p>Best of all, however, is how Mega Evolution greatly increases Malamar's hypnotic powers. Perfect for this Dark and Psychic-type squid! If it chooses to, Mega Malamar can rewrite a person's memories and personality, turning them into a whole new (better) person. We're sure Mega Malamar would never use these powers for evil or self-promotion though. The official Pok√©mon website and social media accounts are Malamar-themed, because everyone just wanted to celebrate its special day. Just watch Mega Malamar's debut video to see people celebrate the joy of Malamar out of their own free will.</p>

<p>Malamar was already highly notable in the Pok√©mon universe thanks to the unique evolution requirement you need to meet. Unlike all of those other Pok√©mon evolutions where you simply stare at the screen, evolving Inkay into Malamar requires turning your whole console upside down. What other Pok√©mon asks you to put your mind to such good use? I'm sure we can all agree that this, combined with its cool Mega Evolution look, proves Malamar is truly everyone's best friend.</p><p>Mega Malamar is the fourth new Mega Evolution to be announced for Legends: Z-A, with the reveal of Mega <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-dragonite-debuts-in-fresh-look-at-pokemon-legends-z-a">Dragonite</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-goes-full-survival-horror-with-a-resident-evil-style-spoof-to-reveal-its-latest-mega-evolution">Victreebel</a> and Hawlucha coming before it. Since the release of Legends: Z-A is drawing close, we'll hopefully get a look at more new Mega Evolutions in the coming month. (But none of them will be as awesome as Malamar.) We've taken a look at all of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-new-mega-evolutions">new Mega Evolutions</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-returning">every returning Pok√©mon</a> in Legends: Z-A if you want to get an early start on planning your team. Though six Malamars will work for any occasion!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced another Mega Evolution form for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and this time, it's the turn of topsy-turvy squid Malamar.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks, the publisher, along with developer Game Freak, has been drip-feeding new Mega Evolution announcements, including a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-victreebel-revealed-pokemon-legends-za" rel="nofollow">surprisingly effective horror reveal</a> for Mega Victreebel and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-hawlucha-pokemon-legends-z-a" rel="nofollow">rather touching wrestling match</a> between Mega Hawlucha and Machamp.</p>

<p>Today's reveal shows off the Mega Evolved form of the Dark/Psychic-type Malamar, which is itself the evolved form of the rather adorable Inkay. As you'd probably imagine for a 'mon that looked rather sinister in its original incarnation, Mega Malamar has a sleek, dark appearance that's just a touch unsettling as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-malamar-close-up.jpg?itok=UBAXi1x0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-malamar-close-up.jpg?itok=YzlEldPd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>'s latest Mega Evolution is the positively weird-looking Mega Malamar.</figcaption></figure><p>Mega Malamar's debut trailer is perhaps a little less strange or extravagant than its predecessors, although a preceding video did show people professing their love for the Pokemon after presumably being hypnotized by its powers.</p>

<p>In today's trailer, we get to see Mega Malamar face off against both Charizard and Dragonite, and it makes short work of them thanks to its aforementioned hypnotic abilities. The trailer concludes with Malamar seemingly hypnotizing its trainer as well, leading to them waking up on a bench surrounded by Malamars.</p>

<p>Naturally, Mega Malamar will be appearing in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which will be the second game in what can now be considered the overarching&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>sub-series.</p>

<p>The game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">due to launch on October 16th</a>, will take place entirely in the city of Lumiose in the Kalos region, and it'll see players helping to oversee an urban redevelopment plan while also taking part in a city-wide battle tournament.</p>




<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>when it launches on October 16th for both Switch 2 and Switch, and if you want to know how the game's shaping up, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pokemon-legends-z-preview-another-reason-to-get-switch-2" rel="nofollow">check out our preview here</a>.</p>

            <p>Hola, big Steam update alert, featuring some stuff you might already have tried in beta and a crap tonne of other stuff you might not have. Either way, it's all in the hands of the masses now, so worth being aware of. Yes, "removed a setting from music settings that wasn't hooked up to anything" is a change you need to know about, don't question me!</p>
<p>You can find the full notes for this latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/500583527919651039?l=english">Steam update here</a>, and I advise you whip out your best Sunday Papers pipe and slippers when you do, because there are bullet points for days. In the meantime here's a quick rundown that you can safely consume without old man tobacco and weird indoor shoes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A couple of this update's headliners are things Valve made sure to draw attention to when they were in beta testing. Most noteworthy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/praise-the-kiryu-steams-latest-client-beta-update-will-finally-let-you-sort-like-a-dragons-and-yakuza-into-the-right-order">the ability to set custom sort names for games in your library</a>, which means you can put all of the entries in series like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/yakuza">Yakuza/Like A Dragon</a> into the correct order, rather than the default alphabetical one that's all wrong. You can set custom artwork for games too, if you'd rather stare at a lewdly tasteful fanart header whenever you fire up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum">The Lord of the Rings: Gollum</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you'll find the wider store pages Gabe Newell and co were <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/532106189043925405?l=english">shouting about mid-August</a>. Other bits which've caught my eye as not having been paraded around as much while they were in beta include the addition of an accessibility settings menu to desktop mode, with options like high contrast, reduced motion settings, and interface scale controls. I assume the last one may involve bigger fonts.</p><p>The performance monitoring bit of the Steam overlay has gotten a fair few changes, with the ability to keep track of your CPU's temperature when playing something incredibly hardware intensive like, er, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>, being the main one. "On Windows this requires a kernel mode driver, and there is an option to disable if you don't want that," Valve write of this hot new feature. "The driver is only installed and running when performance monitor is visible at full CPU detail levels and only if you don't disable the driver in the in-game settings."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the fixes department Valve have dealt with "a case where Xbox and PlayStation controllers could be duplicated when Steam input is enabled". Given the wording, I assume they had to get Inspector Clouseau in to suss out the cause of that multiplying device mystery. Then, there's that removed music settings setting, which I kind of wish they'd left in place since it was apparently just chilling doing nothing. Oh, and macOS 11 has officially been put on "end of life alert" ahead of support for it being ditched on October 15th, so maybe look at switching if that's what you're running.</p>
<p>Right, now go get your Assassin's Creeds in the right order, on the double, chop chop, other phrases which mean speed up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is kicking off back-to-school season with an offer on a Meta Quest 3 VR bundle that‚Äôs hard to pass up:<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4029/"> It is $499, but included is the headset, Batman: Arkham Shadow game, and three months of Meta Horizon+ trial</a>. Normally, you‚Äôd pay almost as much for the headset alone so getting all this extra content included in a bundle is a valuable bargain.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4029/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Improved Resolution</h2>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 offers nearly a 30% resolution increase over old models with much sharper images and a <strong>stunning 4K Infinite display</strong> that makes all the details pop. That is to say that everything that you view in the virtual world looks sharp and real and your gaming and exploratory experience looks incredibly real. The graphics enhancement helps you perceive every last detail and adds depth to your experience.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages is that the Meta Quest 3 is cable-free: There is <strong>no fumbling with cables</strong> or clamping it to a separate screen, and that gives you the freedom to move, play games, exercise and travel within virtual environments without restriction. This untethered method makes VR more natural and enjoyable to experience, and keeps you engaged without being restricted by cords.</p>



<p>Powered by the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor, this headset has<strong> double the graphical processing power of its predecessors</strong>. This means scorching load times and smooth next-generation graphics that render gaming smooth and life-like. The 8GB RAM (33% more than before) helps to manage sharper visuals and quick response so you get the best out of it without any lag.</p>
<p>The headset also includes mixed reality features that overlay virtual objects over your real world: Dual RGB color cameras capture full-color, high-definition passthrough photos and enable you to co-interact with digital objects as well as your own physical world. This feature offers new ways of experiencing and exploring both worlds simultaneously.</p>
<p>Battery life has also been extended with the capacity to<strong> supply more than two hours of uninterrupted gameplay</strong>. This enables you to dive into prolonged sessions, recharge less frequently, and pick up where you left off.</p>
<p><strong>With 512GB storage</strong>, this Meta Quest 3 bundle gives you plenty of space to download games, applications and content without worrying about running out of space. And, with the Batman experience and Meta Horizon+ subscription thrown in, you gain access to even more content, so you have a full VR experience right from the start.</p>

                <p>Mega Evolutions are making their grand return in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, and after seeing how Dragonite, Victreebel, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-makes-hawlucha-look-like-the-ultimate-luchador/1100-6534339/">Hawlucha</a> will look once they've undergone this power-up, it looks like Malamar is also getting an upgrade. So far, Nintendo and The Pokemon Company have released Mega Evolution reveal videos that put an interesting spin on the world of Pokemon, and just like the Victreebel Mega Evolution, this satirical news broadcast is a reminder of just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-goes-full-blair-witch-project-to-reveal-a-brand-new-mega-evolution/1100-6534163/">how frightening the world would be if Pokemon were real</a>.</p><p>In the video, Mega Malar uses its hypnotic abilities on the citizens of Lumiose City, explaining why there has been a boom in popularity for it. Mega Malamar is also slimmed down in comparison to its base form, as this Dark- and Psychic-type Pokemon gets a big boost to its mental powers. Does psychic power burn a lot of calories? <em>Maybe</em>, according to pseudo-science.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HxSr_6RiiY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4HxSr_6RiiY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Malamar‚Äôs brain has become enlarged as a result of Mega Evolution," its official Pokedex entry reads. "Greatly enhanced psychic power overflows from its body, emitting a bright glow. Mega Malamar views others--even Pok√©mon Trainers--as its pawns. If it disagrees with an order given to it by a Trainer, it will sometimes respond by hypnotizing them, making this an incredibly difficult Pokemon to interact with.</p><p>Ahead of its release on October 16 for Switch 2 and Switch, Pokemon fans in Mexico can also attend a special event for the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-celebrates-upcoming-launch-with-lucha-libre-showdown/1100-6534371/">that will feature live lucha libre wrestling</a>. The new Pokemon game will also be putting a spin on the established norms of the franchise <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-shakes-up-pokemons-combat-for-the-first-time-in-decades/1100-6533977/">by introducing real-time battles</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-four-player-battles/1100-6534031/">free-for-all showdowns</a> for up to four players, and with a lengthy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-confirmed-for-september-12/1100-6534609/" data-ref-id="1100-6534609">Nintendo Direct scheduled for September 12</a>, we could see more footage of the game in action.</p>

FromSoftware has unveiled its new Deep of Night mode for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, ahead of its release tomorrow, 11th September.
</p>
<p>
As revealed last week, this mode adds extra challenge to the multiplayer spin-off game. The world of Limveld will be full of deadlier enemies and Nightlords won't be selectable, as in the main game. Instead, players will traverse multiple depths, with escalating difficulty and challenges.
</p>
<p>
Players will have access to stronger weapons, gained by defeating more powerful variants of enemies and minibosses. However, some of these will have detrimental effects as well as bonuses, so strategy will be required. A new load of relics will also be available, in addition to expanded slots.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-update-brings-new-challenges-and-a-welcome-live-service-twist">Everdark Sovereigns</a> - the more difficult alternative Nightlords - may also appear to ruin your run.
</p>
<p>
In short, this feels like the sort of mode Nightreign players have been craving! And it's further evidence of FromSoftware continuing to evolve its formula further post-release, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-duo-mode-is-finally-on-the-way-with-release-date-confirmed">addition of a two player mode</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The Little Nightmares series has become a favourite amongst fans of grotesque horrors. The puzzle platformer has that grim and grimy aesthetic, with that unnerving need to constantly hide from the unnervingly large and terrible inhabitants of these worlds. While you had an AI-controlled partner through Little Nightmares 2, and can continue to play solo in its upcoming sequel, Little Nightmares 3 will finally let you share these horrors with another person.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares III ‚Äì You're in for a Ride | Pre-Order Trailer - Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6zYcE_Rl_kU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I asked Little Nightmares III Producer Coralie Feniello about taking this jump, and how co-op can share out and maybe reduce the horror. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something we thought about at the beginning,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúwould it be as scary playing co-op? I think it‚Äôs just a different atmosphere, a different vibe, but it‚Äôs not like removing the fear from what I‚Äôve seen. Sometimes people tend to just have a lot of empathy together and to just feel the fear from the other one, so it‚Äôs kind of a balance at the end. But it is quite different because sometimes you will laugh, sometimes you will have fear. When you play alone ‚Äì I mean, single player ‚Äì you will keep a bit more immersed in the atmosphere, like the sound will be kicking in more and things like that.‚Äù</p>


<p>There‚Äôs a pair of new characters found within Little Nightmares 3, as Low with his beaked mask, cape and bow, and Alone with her tufts or red hair, green jumpsuit and wrench journey through the Nowhere and a spread of different realms found within. Once again, their journey will be told wordlessly, but as Coralie said, ‚ÄúMore is not always better. We wanted to tell a lot of things to everyone, and then we realised that it‚Äôs not working like that in speechless stories. We want to tell very impactful story points at different points of the game and then all the complexity of that all goes in the environment. We do know that fans tend to have a lot of theories and so they will enjoy and see what‚Äôs going on in the environments, but everyone should have something at the end.‚Äù</p>


<p>Our hands-on came while playing through a section known as Carnivale, which is dark and depressing for more reasons than just the lashing rain that‚Äôs pouring down as we visit. The first thing that surprises, as we find ourselves washed up on a sea shore at the start of the demo, is that we‚Äôre not bound together by a shared screen space. With co-op being exclusively online, Little Nightmares 3 avoids that co-op game conundrum of whether to allow for split screen or keep characters together within view of the screen, and so instead lets you both meander and view the world entirely independent of one another. It‚Äôs an interesting choice that does allow for more freedom when exploring the scenes presented to you.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs also one of the reasons why we are online co-op and not couch,‚Äù Coralie revealed, ‚Äúbecause we didn‚Äôt want it at all to have a split screen. In Little Nightmares, each room is, I would say, like a frame [‚Ä¶] each room comes from craftsmanship and each room has a lot of details and we do want each room to be seen in full screen. I think that‚Äôs super important with the camera view.‚Äù</p>
<p>It doesn‚Äôt take long to reach the carnival itself, with hunched over visitors to the carnival having little real interest in you ‚Äì&nbsp;they‚Äôre far more concerned with having what looks like an absolutely fantastic time! Sure, they‚Äôre tightly wrapped up in coats to withstand the rain, and the crowds are a bit thick to get anywhere all that quickly, but there‚Äôs plenty of greasy looking food, all these lit up tents to visit, rides to spin around on, tubs for apple bobbing ‚Äì&nbsp;try not to drown, though! ‚Äì and the odd pinata to smack with a stick. Sure, it might not actually be a pinata, and really just be the upended corpse of a former guest, but when you‚Äôre blindfolded, what‚Äôs the difference? I guess there‚Äôs fewer sweets that come out‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs all delightfully dark and twisted.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the almost incidental fun and games that I could engage with as well, playing as Low with the bow and arrow. There were plenty of balloons to target and pop with a quick auto-aimed arrow shot, but then there was also a pop-up target carnival game that I spent a good few minutes trying to best. Surprise surprise, it was rigged so that even just hitting three targets in time needed frame-perfect precision, though Coralie claimed that it‚Äôs technically possible to win‚Ä¶</p>
<p>But Alone isn‚Äôt left out from these interactions. Coralie said, ‚ÄúIt depends on the chapters! I think from the Necropolis to the first one, you find things things to break on the ground that got a bit more, like pottery and things like that. So that‚Äôs kind of fun as well. But yeah, I think the long distance off Low makes it a bit more satisfying on the side for an environmental stuff, but also Alone gets to open secret doors. At some points when you have some hidden collectables, it‚Äôs usually behind secret walls that Alone can break.‚Äù</p>
<p>Journeying through this together, there‚Äôs some classic two-player puzzles to work through. You‚Äôll have to collaborate to push and pull heavy objects; one player will have to boost the other up and over to reach a switch or movable object; one person pulls a lever to move a platform for the other, with a second lever or new path that they can later access. It‚Äôs familiar on a pure gameplay level, but wrapping it up in that grimy Little Nightmares aesthetic and having the ability to explore independently gives it a distinctive feel and tone.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs accentuated in moments where combat comes to the fore. In many situations, your only option is to sneak as quietly as possible and hide, the much larger beings of this world keen to hunt down the pointy white little Nomes and other small people as quickly as possible. But there are moments of combat as well, bringing the bow and wrench to the fore. You still need to work in tandem to get through these moments, as creepy animated dolls spring to life and come after you. Low can get in the first strike, a crack shot to knock off their head, but the body keeps on coming, needing you to lure it away so that Alone can finish the job by whacking the noggin into the floor once and for all. It‚Äôs satisfying, and I‚Äôm keen to see how other enemies and combat moments come together.</p>
<p>It was a key point for the team to build around, Coralie said: ‚ÄúEarlier Little Nightmares games already had some little combat with pipes and stuff that you find in the environment. Here, we really wanted to use the cooperation to be able to bring that to the players and also bring some gameplay that will be time dependent ‚Äì basically, you need to do something and the other one has to do something kind of at the same time.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSomething that we‚Äôve seen with the play is that for a lot of players, it‚Äôs way harder to play in multiplayer than in single player for that, because you could mess up in single player, but the AI will not, and if you are in multiplayer, both of you can mess up, so it‚Äôs like twice the risk of not being able to do it! But that‚Äôs really fun to see, I think.‚Äù</p>

<p>This is still thoroughly Little Nightmares, keeping so much of the tone and feel of the first two games, from the dank visuals to the trial and error sometimes needed to figure your way past deadly monstrosities. Sharing this with another person does change that in that always enjoyable fashion. You‚Äôre joking and wise-cracking as you go, conferring to figure out puzzles, taking turns to apologise for messing up a particular encounter. For me, it does lighten the horror a bit, but if that‚Äôs what you demand from Little Nightmares then, well, you don‚Äôt have to play together‚Ä¶</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Little Nightmares</em> has really earned a reputation for itself as one of the premier spooky sort-of-platformers out there. It's garnered <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/little-nightmares-2" rel="nofollow">lots of acclaim through word of mouth</a>, and that's paid off. According to Bandai Namco, it's sold 20 million units across the franchise.</p>

<p>However, this time around, things are a little different. After <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-thq-nordic-has-bought-little-nightmares-developer" rel="nofollow">Tarsier Studios was acquired by Embracer</a>, the franchise stayed with Bandai Namco. Now Supermassive Games of <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/dark-pictures-anthology" rel="nofollow"><em>Dark Pictures</em> fame</a> is helming development for <em>Little Nightmares III</em>.</p>

<p>Another big change here is the shift toward co-operative play. While not strictly required, single-player gameplay still slots in an AI to control the opposite character. In other words, teamwork is essential in this game‚Äîand in some cases, detrimental to its fun.</p>



<h2>Low and Alone in the Middle of Nowhere</h2>

<p><em>Little Nightmares III</em> stars two children named Low and Alone, and they're lost in a surreal world called the Nowhere. This space exists between dreams and reality, and they're trapped in the Spiral, which comprises of multiple dystopian worlds.</p>

<p>In my demo at PAX West, we played through the Carnevale level. I controlled Alone, the girl who wields a giant wrench like a club. A colleague played as Low, who uses a bow and arrow.</p>

<p>Almost every puzzle we ran into required some form of teamwork. Practically every crate needs both players to push or pull them, and defeating enemies requires a coordinated one-two punch, starting with an arrow to the head.</p>

<p>It fosters this sense of desperation and dependency in the player. You know you're not strong or able enough to escape this spooky place alone, and you need your companion if you want to have any chance to survive.</p>

<p>Overall, Supermassive did a good job of making the Carnevale feel unnaturally spooky and otherworldly. The oppressive rain creates a dreary atmosphere, and honestly, carnivals at night are already pretty unsettling. Add an army of creepy-moving puppets and giant, mangled hunchback types, and you've got yourself a perfect vibe for Halloween month.</p>



<h2>Co-Op Brings Worries</h2>

<p>While the overall vibe and atmosphere set the mood well, I found myself pretty quickly taken out of it at various times throughout our play session.</p>

<p>Some of the puzzles felt a bit too obtuse for us to figure out, which left us re-exploring the space over and over again until we realized the solution. And it wasn't that we overlooked the next step; we both found signals to be unclear, and they didn't quite telegraph what the solution was.</p>

<p>Other puzzles required skulking around monsters a very specific way using stealth. The windows for running from one place to the next felt just a little too tight for how slow the characters move while crouching. Even worse, figuring out the solution to these segments often means getting a little further than you did last time, scrambling to figure out what's next, and hopefully hiding before you're caught.</p>

<p>When one player is seen, it's a pretty immediate game over. There's no leeway to avoid capture, and then you're reset to the latest checkpoint. Honestly, the co-op aspect only made this more frustrating, as now you're both replaying the same thing and hoping the other doesn't reset the sequence.</p>

<p>I'm all for immersion and letting players discover the world, but when the punishment for the slightest error is constant retrials, the cycle tends to get wearisome.</p>

<p>Granted, part of this is a skill issue, which I'll readily own up to. I've also never played the previous games in the series. The Carnevale sequence we played occurs partway through the game, so I'd like to hope that by the time you naturally get there with your co-op partner, you'll both understand the gameplay and signals better. As a vertical slice with no context, I found it to be appropriately atmospheric but obtuse to the point of frustration.</p>



<h2><em>Little Nightmares III</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>With such a focus on co-operative play, I do find it odd that there's no split-screen or same-screen option for in-person co-op. This feels like a great opportunity to spend time together in the same space, and facilitating an online session through Discord or something feels like it gets in the way of the magic.</p>

<p>Even worse, I feel like playing the game solo wouldn't capture the same essence, considering how the core gameplay works. Waiting on an AI partner to do its part feels like it could come off a little hollow, but I'm just speculating.</p>

<p>Still, I think if you're looking for a spooky game for the Halloween season, <em>Little Nightmares III</em> is shaping up to be a decent option, if not for its atmosphere alone. It feels properly haunted and eerie thanks to the oppressive nature of the enemies and the dark, dreary presentation. I just hope the puzzle work and stealth sections feel better as the gameplay naturally ramps up from a fresh start.</p>

        <p>A wide variety of newly added playable characters!</p><p>Supports online rankings and various achievements!</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>Control the character with an 8-way lever and two buttons (shot, bomb).</p><p><strong>Character Selection</strong></p><p>Players select one of several characters with different normal attacks, shikigami attacks, special attacks, and movement speeds.</p><p>You can also choose between the first and second types of attack, which have different performance for each character, allowing for a variety of attack methods.</p><p>You can also play with two players. (Supports remote play together! Challenge with shikigami users from around the world!)</p><p>Each character has their own backstory, and a story demo is inserted immediately after starting play and before and after the start of the stage.</p><p>In addition, when playing with two players, the story and scenario change depending on the combination of characters selected.</p><p><strong>Various Attacks</strong></p><p>There are three types of attacks: normal attacks, shikigami attacks, and special attacks.</p><ul><li><strong>Normal Attacks</strong> (Shots)<ul><li>A rapid-firing attack. Since it can attack a relatively wide area, you can ensure your own safety by focusing on this in battle.</li><li>Also, when the Tension Bonus System is at its maximum, it becomes a high tension attack, and the firing speed and power increase.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Shikigami Attack</strong><ul><li>In exchange for a slower movement speed during the attack, this attack automatically collects the coins that appear.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Special Attack</strong><ul><li>A so-called bomb.

The points you get with a normal attack increase, and the number of coins that appear increases even more with a Shikigami attack.</p><p><strong>High Tension MAX System</strong></p><p>Equipped with a new function that satisfies your insatiable passion for shooting games!</p><p>A system that consumes one special attack to activate. There is a short period of invincibility when activated. A red gauge will be displayed at the top edge of the screen for a certain period of time, and until it runs out, ‚ÄúT.B.S. judgment will always be 8 times (‚âí always in a high-tension shot state)‚Äù and ‚Äúthe amount of coins appearing will be 1.5 times.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Watch a trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch‚Ñ¢„ÄéÂºèÁ•û„ÅÆÂüé‚Ö¢„Äè„Éó„É≠„É¢„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥„Éì„Éá„Ç™" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zK96jI2sdOI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/castle-of-shikigami-3-coming-to-switch-in-late-april-2026-in-japan]]></content:encoded>

                <p>United States Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced that the National Institutes of Health are looking into a range of issues as it relates to what may contribute to gun violence in the United States. He also cited video games as a possible cause of real-world violence.</p><p>"The firearms question is a complex question, and it's not an easy question," he said in response to a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/watch-kennedy-says-nih-is-studying-possible-causes-of-u-s-gun-violence" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">question from PBS</a> about if the government is looking into mental health when it comes to gun violence.</p><p>He called out a variety of factors that could contribute to an uptick in real-world violence, including "dependence on psychiatric drugs," along with video games and social media. "We are initiating studies now that look at the correlation and the potential connection between over-medicating our kids and this violence." He did not elaborate on video games, however.</p><p>This comes not long after RFK Jr. appeared in a tense Washington hearing in which senators questioned him about <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-tense-hearing-rfk-jr-challenged-on-vaccine-views-and-trust-in-health-agencies" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">his views on vaccines and numerous other claims</a> he has made over the years. Many have called for his resignation, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/rfk-jrs-family-members-call-for-his-resignation-say-he-is-a-threat-to-americans-health" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">including his own family members</a>, while <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5483021-hhs-employees-call-for-rfk-resignation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some CDC staff walked out in protest.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH-AXTo3Am8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qH-AXTo3Am8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><strong>What some studies have already found</strong></h2><p>For years, people have maintained there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/professor-it-s-clear-playing-violent-games-increases-aggressive-behavior/1100-6417754/" data-ref-id="1100-6417754">absolutely a connection between violent video games and increases in aggressive behavior</a>. A <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6790614/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2019 study from Tobias Greitemeyer</a>, a Department of Psychology professor a the University of Innsbruck in Austria, suggested that time spent playing violent video games "increases aggression in the player." The research also suggested that "violent video game play also affects individuals with whom the player is connected."</p><p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34801150/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Another study</a> found that, "Exposure to violent media, especially violent video games, may cause desensitization to real-life violence." <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10354552/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">One further study</a> found that video game violence "should be considered a risk factor for aggression, as in other violent media, as it provides a social reinforcement of aggressive behavior and observational learning of aggressive models."</p><p>A study from Oxford discovered <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2019-02-13-violent-video-games-found-not-be-associated-adolescent-aggression" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">no link</a> between aggressive behavior in teenagers and the amount of time they spent playing violent video games. "Our findings suggest that researcher biases might have influenced previous studies on this topic, and have distorted our understanding of the effects of video games," co-author Dr Netta Weinstein from Cardiff University said.</p><p>This study came after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/violent-video-games-dont-lead-to-increases-in-viol/1100-6422421/" data-ref-id="1100-6422421">years of published, vetted research</a> that showed there is no connection between violent video games and increase in violent crimes.</p><h2><strong>What has Trump said about video games?</strong></h2><p>RFK Jr.'s boss, US president Donald Trump, has previously spoken out about violence in video games.</p><p>"We must stop the glorification of violence in our society," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trump-blames-video-games-for-mass-shootings-indust/1100-6468929/" data-ref-id="1100-6468929">the president said in 2019 following mass shootings in America</a>. "This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace. It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence. We must stop or substantially reduce this, and it has to begin immediately."</p><p>The Entertainment Software Association (ESA), which lobbies on behalf of the video game industry and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/if-this-new-video-game-loot-box-bill-becomes-law-i/1100-6456767/" data-ref-id="1100-6456767">seeks to avoid government regulation</a>, said "numerous scientific studies have established that there is no causal connection between video games and violence."</p><h2><strong>This has been a talking point for some time</strong></h2><p>The debate about violent video games and what effect there may or may not be on real-world violence has been going on for decades. Some may recall how then US Senator <a href="https://youtu.be/d3GTJOZLaPY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hillary Clinton said in 2005</a> violent video games are a major problem and studies have shown they are bad for children. She also said violent video games should be regulated like alcohol and tobacco.</p><p>"Violent video games increase aggressive behavior as much as lead exposure decreases children's IQ scores," Clinton said. "We need to treat violent video games the way we treat tobacco, alcohol, and pornography. We know these products are damaging to children and we ned to give parents the tools to keep them out of kids' hands."</p><h2>RFK Jr. is, or was, invested in video games</h2><p>In 2024, RFK Jr. revealed that he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/21/rfk-jr-says-he-invested-24000-in-gamestop-amid-re-.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">invested $24,000 into GameStop</a> as a means to show support for retail investors over institutional investors following the 2021 GameStop short-squeeze situation. RFK Jr. said he invested in GameStop after Keith Gill AKA Roaring Kitty resurfaced in May 2024--when GameStop's shares were trading around $17--and reignited the GameStop stock phenomenon. After Roaring Kitty began posting again, GameStop's stock price surged, and the stock price remains above $23. We don't know if RFK Jr. still holds a position in GameStop.</p>
