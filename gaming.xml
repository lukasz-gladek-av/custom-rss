			<p>Recently, GeForce NOW has had several updates, adding more games to the list that can be played via GeForce NOW. Today, World of Warcraft add-ons are now available through a partnership with CurseForge on the cloud. Members of GeForce NOW can access 25 of the top add-ons used by <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/what-to-do-before-the-war-within-pre-patch-update-in-world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft players</a>, with the add-ons preinstalled for their gaming session. Those who plan on getting stuck into World of Warcraft: The War Within can gain early access to the expansion if you buy the Epic Edition of The War Within from 22 August, which fully releases on 26 August.</p>
<p>Ultimate and Priority members can choose which add-ons they want to enable and customize. This includes Day Pass members. From today, these add-ons are available to GeForce NOW members and won't require a CurseForge account to install. While only 25 of the top add-ons are available at the moment, Nvidia and CurseForge are working on adding more over time.</p>
<p>The player's settings and customizations are saved between each streaming session, so they do not need to be configured again between sessions. In addition, all CurseForge mods that are available will be consistently updated so that you don't have to spend time updating for each patch.</p>
<p>Those who want to use the add-ons available via CurseForge can use them for the Retail version of World of Warcraft and World of Warcraft Cataclysm Classic. For those who want to know how to add the add-ons to their game using GeForce NOW, Nvidia has released a <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5567" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> explaining everything you need to do to get them to work in your game and how to enable them.</p>
<p>For a chance to be featured on GeForce NOW's social media, players are asked to upload screenshots of their mod configurations with the hashtag # ModsonGFN to show off all of the CurseForge add-ons they are using.</p>
<p>In addition to mods now being available for World of Warcraft players by utilizing GeForce NOW, new games have also been added to GeForce NOW, with some real hits now available through the streaming service.</p>
<p>The following games are now available through GeForce NOW if you own them on the specific platforms listed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level Zero: Extraction (Steam)</li>
<li>shapez 2 (Steam)</li>
<li>Car Manufacture (Steam)</li>
<li>Psychonauts (Steam)</li>
<li>Psychonauts (Steam, Xbox, PC Game Pass)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, this week is the last week you can get a GeForce NOW membership for either one month or six months for Ultimate and Priority at a 50% discount in GeForce NOW's summer sale.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ark-publisher-announces-open-universe-space-sandbox-for-the-stars.953973/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ark-publisher-space-sandbox-for-the-stars<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ark: Survival Evolved&nbsp;</em>publisher Snail Games has announced&nbsp;<em>For the Stars</em>, an "open universe" space sandbox game that looks to be gunning for a certain rival's crown.</p>
<p>In a press release, Snail Games says&nbsp;<em>For the Stars&nbsp;</em>will take place in an "ambitious persistent multiplayer universe" in which you can establish your own outposts, conquer hostile biomes, and forge alliances with other players.</p>
<p>You'll also discover "the secrets of alien civilizations", seek out "rare and exotic creatures", and harness resources you gather from the planets you explore. Is this <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/no-mans-sky">sounding familiar</a>?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/for-the-stars-announcement-desert-planet.jpg?itok=cl9jrGu7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/for-the-stars-announcement-desert-planet.jpg?itok=Nm_hQVEj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>For the Stars&nbsp;</em>promises space thrills galore on PC and consoles.</figcaption></figure><p>In fairness to Snail Games, taking on&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>isn't an easy task, especially when Hello Games' initially-maligned space sim has received a bevy of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update">updates and tweaks</a> since its launch.</p>
<p>However, game director Primus Majda says that his team has "a lot of experience" with survival games and that he and his team "are gamers first and foremost", so they know what they're building with&nbsp;<em>For the Stars</em>.</p>
<p>Majda goes on to say that his idea with&nbsp;<em>For the Stars&nbsp;</em>was to create a game with sandbox survival gameplay, but with "the impact of a 4X galaxy civilization game". That's an impressive boast, but it remains to be seen whether Majda and his team can pull it off.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>For the Stars&nbsp;</em>sounds like your cup of tea, you can check out the announcement trailer, which also features Majda going into a little more detail about what you can expect from the game, right here.</p>

<p><em>For the Stars&nbsp;</em>will feature diverse biomes to explore, as well as "advanced construction" that lets you build all kinds of facilities on the planets you discover.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to unlocking new tech as you progress, customizing your spacecraft to your liking, and engaging in "dynamic combat" against both hostile alien creatures and enemy players.</p>
<p>Right now,&nbsp;<em>For the Stars&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date or even a release window, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1415230/For_The_Stars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">wishlist the game on Steam right here</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It's not the first time the 2K launcher has created problems for a game, either. In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-midnight-suns-performance-can-get-boosted-by-disabling-the-2k-launcher/1100-6510061/" data-ref-id="1100-6510061">Marvel's Midnight Suns players on Steam figured out that disabling the launcher solved some performance issues</a> related to frame rate. Needless to say, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1esesqi/2k_launcher_has_been_removed_from_civ_6_and_will/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Civilization subreddit</a> regarding the news.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-leaks-ahead-of-summer-game-fest/1100-6524018/" data-ref-id="1100-6524018">Civilization VII was officially unveiled at Summer Game Fest</a> a couple of months ago. The strategy game will arrive next year at the same time on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. Take-Two originally revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/firaxis-confirms-new-civilization-game-xcoms-jake-solomon-leaving-the-studio/1100-6511626/" data-ref-id="1100-6511626">Firaxis was working on a new entry in the Civilization franchise in early 2023</a>. At that time, XCOM's Jake Solomon left the developer after directing Midnight Suns.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Civilization VI released back in 2016.

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440900/Conan_Exiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conan Exiles</a> is getting a huge update that introduces fully-voiced companions. The new update, Age of Heroes, is the third season of expansive updates to the game. While they are adding this update, it won't be available for players until October.</p>
<p>The first half of the massive update will arrive in October. This update adds a new type of companion that players can recruit and accompany on their adventures in this sandbox survival game. These companions will be fully voiced, adding an extra level of immersion to Conan Exiles in the Age of Heroes update.</p>
<p>There are two fully-voiced companions that you can choose from in this update. They are Freya, the Aesir Warrior, and Liu Fei, the Khitan Sorcerer. Both companions come with a story that players can explore and learn more about as they journey. In addition, the companions' abilities are shaped by what happens throughout their journey and the player's decisions.</p>
<p>While the player can choose from only two companions, more are planned for future updates.</p>
<p>In addition to companions being added to Conan Exiles through the Age of Heroes update, a major change is coming to chapter one of the Age of Heroes season. The Living Settlements update transforms thralls into living, animated inhabitants of the player's base.</p>
<p>This means they will go around the base while performing basic tasks, emoting, and tending to their needs, such as food and sleep. However, if their home is threatened, they will also strive to defend it.</p>
<p>In addition to these two major updates in the first chapter of the Conan Exiles Age of Heroes update, there will be plenty of bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p>While the Age of Heroes season has only two major updates listed, plenty more are planned, with minor updates occurring between major updates. These minor updates will add new events to the game and focus on tweaking it to make it more accessible to the player base.</p>
<p>One of the main changes <a href="https://wccftech.com/conan-exiles-dev-talks-age-of-war-chapter-3-additions-promises-support-for-as-long-as-there-are-players/">Funcom</a> has made to Conan Exiles is getting rid of the Battle Pass. Instead, the items from the Battle Pass are being redistributed across the game, with the Bazaar Shop still remaining.</p>
<p>There is no definitive date for the Age of Heroes update at the moment; other than that, it will arrive on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Xbox Game Pass in October 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-lord-of-the-rings-prototypes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Embracer Group, the holding company that currently owns the rights to&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>in the gaming world, has announced that it's currently prototyping several games set in Middle-earth.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q1-april-june-2024-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-828-million/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest financial report</a>, which covers the first quarter of 2024 (from April to June), Embracer says that it's "actively testing and prototyping multiple new game concepts" that take place "within the Middle-earth world".</p>
<p>Embracer goes on to say that these projects will explore "a wide range of immersive and authentic gameplay" and that they'll take "an honest and tactical approach to world-building and authentic storytelling".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-middle-earth-embracer.jpg?itok=n_Rs3eNK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-middle-earth-embracer.jpg?itok=jhKQKNnP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>games could be on the way soon.</figcaption></figure><p>If any of these prototypes come to fruition, then more&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>games could be on the way. With games like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-gameplay-announce-pc-consoles">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em></a>&nbsp;on the way, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lord-of-rings-return-to-moria-steam-xbox-release-date">recently-revealed Steam and Xbox release</a> of&nbsp;<em>Return to Moria</em>,&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>has a pretty stacked plate in the gaming world.</p>
<p>Of course, Embracer doesn't go into detail regarding any of these prototypes, nor does it name the studios developing them. Since the projects are prototypes, it's entirely possible none of them will ever see the light of day, but hey, at least more&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>games could be coming!</p>
<h2>Embracer Group's sales are down overall</h2>
<p>It's been a bit of a punishing quarter for Embracer on the whole. According to the financial report, the company's net sales are down 24%, with PC and console games being the hardest-hit outside of the Entertainment and Services category.</p>
<p>CEO Lars Wingefors puts this down to "a lower release activity" for the quarter, pointing to upcoming releases like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-mickey-rebrushed-release-date"><i>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</i></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-10-release-date"><em>Satisfactory</em></a>, and more content for&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2&nbsp;</em>as chances for the company to turn its fortunes around.</p>

<p>Embracer's total headcount has also dropped from 12,069 last year to 10,844 this year, showing the brutal results of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter">company's restructuring program</a> (which is supposed to have concluded, although the project cancellations tell a different story).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-dlc-saves-fromsoftware-parent-company-from-cyberattack-losses/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The parent company of FromSoftware released an <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym6/161906/00.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings report</a> today revealing that Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC saved them after incurring “extraordinary losses” from the recent cyberattack.</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/390795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameBiz</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/fromsoftwares-parent-company-reports-major-growth-despite-serious-losses-from-cyberattack-with-elden-ring-dlc-powerfully-driving-its-whole-game-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Kadokawa’s sales increased by 11.9% year on year, operating profit rose by 84.5% year on year, and ordinary profit saw a 26.2% year-on-year increase. However, the company experienced an unfortunate <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kadokawa-group-hack-fromsoftware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cyberattack</a> in June, resulting in a loss of “approximately 2,000 million yen” (around $13 million). This cyberattack led to a 10.1% decrease in net profit for FromSoftware’s parent company.</p>



<p>The results in the gaming segment “were driven powerfully by the strong domestic sales” of Elden Ring’s DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, which also helped in the repeat sales for the base game. The net sales for the gaming segment were up by 80.2% yearly, with operating profit up by 108.1% year-on-year. It is worth noting that this number only consists of sales till June 30, and Shadow of the Erdtree was released on June 21; the actual number could be way higher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you look at the records Shadow of the Erdtree managed to accomplish, it’s no surprise that the Elden Ring DLC saved FromSoftware’s parent company. The DLC sold over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 million copies within the first 3 days</a>, became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-highest-rated-dlc-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-rated DLC of all time</a> and more. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-2k-launcher-civ-6</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-7-to-ditch-2k-launcher-alongside-civ-6.953904/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-2k-launcher-civ-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K has announced that the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>won't use its proprietary launcher, and what's more, said launcher has also been removed from <i>Civilization 6&nbsp;</i>on PC.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1esesqi/2k_launcher_has_been_removed_from_civ_6_and_will/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Reddit post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>subreddit, community manager Sarah Engel confirmed that the launcher "has been removed from&nbsp;<em>Civ 6&nbsp;</em>and will not be implemented for&nbsp;<em>Civ 7</em>".</p>
<p>The launcher won't appear when you boot up&nbsp;<em>Civ 6&nbsp;</em>on Steam, although if you're playing on the Epic Games Store, you'll still see it for a while. Engel says there are plans in place to remove the launcher on the Epic version of the game "in the near future".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-2k-launcher-civ-6.jpg?itok=YAkRnYyy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-2k-launcher-civ-6.jpg?itok=Mxr5-SUi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The 2K Launcher won't bother you when you're launching&nbsp;<em>Civilization 6&nbsp;</em>anymore.</figcaption></figure><p>No reason was given for the launcher's removal, either in Engels' post or in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/289070/view/4362384695881028068" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the&nbsp;<em>Civ 6&nbsp;</em>Steam page</a> that also announces the change.</p>
<p>However, a quick look through the comments on the Reddit post shows that the launcher wasn't exactly popular with players, with commenters describing it variously as "less than worthless", "useless", and "a chore". Ouch.</p>
<p>Amusingly enough, the fact that&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>on PC won't use the 2K Launcher is near enough the first bit of news we've had about the game for some time. It's due for a Gamescom reveal next week, though, so we'll learn more about how&nbsp;<em>Civ 7&nbsp;</em>will actually play then.</p>
<p>What we do know is that&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>will continue the series' tradition of combining historical events (and an increasingly liberal interpretation thereof as games progress) with deep strategy. Hopefully, it'll also let you amass an arsenal of nukes as Gandhi again.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Steam page</a> for the game is being pretty coy as well, which you'd expect from a game that hasn't had its first gameplay reveal yet.</p>
<p>In any case, stay tuned for more information on&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>&nbsp;and everything else 2K-related. If you want to check out&nbsp;<em>Civilization 6</em>&nbsp;on Steam, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289070/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VI/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">you can do so here</a>, and don't forget to check out our article on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/best-civilization-vi-mods">the best <em>Civilization 6&nbsp;</em>mods</a> to make your experience even more fun.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week there was some minor Discourse about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dead-rising-remaster-no-longer-gives-you-points-for-erotica-creepshots-because-its-not-required-or-appropriate">the removal of the Erotica photography tag from the Dead Rising remaster</a>. Some readers characterised this as a familiar species of cultural hypocrisy regarding video games - emphasising violence is A-OK, but for the love of god, don't mention sex. Good news, those people: Dread XP's latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> signing The Lacerator has both. It casts you as hirsute 1980s porn star Max - surname not given in press release, but presumably something like Jackin' or Girth - who has been abducted by a large scary individual called the Lacerator.</p><!--more-->
<p>The Lacerator is as good at Lacerating as Max is at shagging. If he catches you trying to leave his sordid, trap-filled hideout, he'll try to chop your appendages off. Losing a limb isn't game-over, however: it just seals off certain routes and approaches, forcing you to improvise. It's the basis for a schlocky, Manhunt-adjacent escape room experience, which seemingly offers <em>at least</em> four ways around any given obstacle.</p>

<p>There's no release date yet, but there is a pre-alpha demo. I've just had a quick go, and while I have yet to meet the Lacerator - a roaming nemesis in the tradition of, well, Nemesis from Resident Evil - I am already in need of a new left arm, thanks to a guillotine surprise I really should have anticipated. The branching possibilities of dismemberment aside, The Lacerator feels like an old school survival horror with authentically tanky handling. You can play from a modern, over-the-shoulder perspective, but the true connoisseur/sicko will of course prefer the game's fixed perspectives.</p>
<p>So far, the game's static camera composition feels pleasantly unhinging. There's always a blindspot to worry about, always the monstrous murmuration of something unseen, always the suspicion of an item or terrain puzzle component tucked away in some feculent background surface. You also have an inventory to manage, with consumables including bandages (which restore health, but not limbs) and lockpicks. Given the requisite bodily accessories, Max can punch and kick both the Lacerator and other, maddened prisoners. There are also a few weapons to unearth, such as a pistol.</p>
<p>It's all wrapped in soiled PS1 textures and skin-crawling VHS crackle. There's a choice of graphics options, ranging from "Fucked Up" to "Sexy", but The Lacerator always looks like it's been chiselled off the bottom of a toilet seat. See for yourself via <a href="https://fromtheabyss.itch.io/the-lacerator">Itch</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2339330/The_Lacerator/">Steam</a>. It's the work of Brazilian studio Games From The Abyss, whose other creations include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2485080/Death_Elevator/">Death Elevator</a> - a one-hit-kill FPS in which time slows down when you're in danger.</p>
<p>The delicate question you are probably entertaining is: does the dismemberment extend to any actual, you know, members, and what role might Max's... professional fixture play in his escape? DreadXP aren't saying, and I am not going to speculate because I am a coward. If you like the cut of The Lacerator's gibs, I suspect you'll also enjoy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-top-down-indie-horror-game-is-all-about-escaping-monsters-who-have-half-eaten-you-already">Endoparasitic</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EimYM1xxBys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay overview</a> released today, developer Sad Cat Studios revealed over 13 minutes of footage from Replaced, its anticipated sci-fi platformer.</p>



<p>Today’s overview shows meticulous camerawork that features dynamic reactions to your gameplay, such as “focusing your attention on what matters.” It also teases that players will need to “hide, fight, and even talk yourself out of danger.” </p>



<p>The devs also mention that the combat is “inspired by the Batman Arkham series.” It will focus on countering and reaction, and the game includes “multiple difficulty settings.” </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Replaced: 13-Minute Gameplay Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EimYM1xxBys?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Today’s gameplay overview closes with some details on the free roam aspect of Replaced. The game allows players to explore some open-ended locations “at certain points in the story.”</p>



<p>Replaced does not have a concrete release date at this time. Just yesterday, developer Sad Cat Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/replaced-delayed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed the Replaced launch</a> until sometime in 2025. </p>



<p>Sad Cat Studios did not break down the exact issues. However, the devs cited that “we need more time to ensure we meet the high standards we’ve set for ourselves.” They also want to “meet the expectations of our fans.”</p>



<p>The anticipated 2.5D cyberpunk platformer Replaced will be available on PC via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store. It’s also coming to Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, and it will join the Game Pass. </p>

                <p>You don't need a lot of space to enjoy virtual reality gaming, but a good chair certainly can elevate the experience. That's where Roto is aiming to make a mark, as it recently unveiled what it calls the first gaming chair designed specifically for Meta Quest headsets. Made in partnership with Meta, the Roto VR Explorer is designed to take advantage of the "look and turn" technology in Quest VR headsets.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L23jW5mh5sg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L23jW5mh5sg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a nutshell, this allows you to move around a VR environment more seamlessly, a feature that does work well considering that the Quest headsets are wireless. The downside here is that the system doesn't work too smoothly if you're seated, and flicking the analogue stick for quick turns can be jarring. With the Roto VR Explorer chair, you've got a secure seat with 360-degree movement, allowing you to quickly move around environments without having to worry about accidentally booting a pet.</p><p>The other cool feature is that the chair has a built-in rumble pack, allowing it to sync with a dongle connected to your headset, register actions, and send a jolt from the base through your entire body. Roto says the gaming chair is compatible with over 400 games and apps from the Meta Quest store, and for build quality, it has back supports, adjustable seat height, a footrest, cable management, and a high-quality leather finish. It even has a modular design that supports a range of accessories, if you own them.</p><p>Ideally, this should make navigation in games feel far smoother, although the chair will have a hefty price tag of $800. For VR enthusiasts, this could be a good investment for comfy gaming sessions, especially with games like Assassin's Creed Nexus, Synapse, or the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-story-trailer-pits-bat-against-rat/1100-6524019/" data-ref-id="1100-6524019">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>. Preorders are now open on Roto's website, and the chair is scheduled to start shipping out in October.</p><p>If you've been looking to dive into virtual reality, the Meta Quest 3 is arguably the best consumer-grade VR headset on the market right now. It has plenty of power, the controllers are comfortable, and the experience of wireless VR gaming is very fun, especially with games like Beat Saber and Arizona Sunshine 2. There aren't any deals right now, but you can get the entry-level <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3 with 128GB of storage capacity</a> for $500.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/ranked-four-tiny-screens-to-power-your-tiny-alt-ctrl-dreams<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Are you in the mood for a tiny writeup of a tiny talk about tiny screens at AMAZE Sheffield? Then it's your lucky day, because that's precisely what alternative controller game designer Julia Makivic rustled up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Running a through a list of some of her favorite and most despised tiny screens during a fleeting Hyper Talk, Makivic sought to pass on some wisdom to other developers fascinated by the prospect of building video games that incorporate bitesized displays. She explains that tiny screens have become a "huge part" of her process, and that's pretty damn neat.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also incredibly frustrating at times, because they weren't designed with video games in mind. "They were designed to maybe display readings from a sensor or other information about the board itself," she explains. "So my whole journey has been trying to adapt these annoying little screens to do what I want them to do–even though they weren't designed for that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, as ranked by Makivic on a bespoke ten-point scale from 'most annoying' at one to 'least annoying' at 10, here are a bunch of tiny screens you might eventually come to cherish or loathe.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ardunio MEGA + Adafruit HX8357 (6/10)">Ardunio MEGA + Adafruit HX8357 (6/10)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The first project I ever did used the Adafruit library with the HX8357 screen on the Arduino Mega and I would rate this a solid 6/10 experience. It's actually really big for a tiny screen. It's like five inches," says Makivic. "But it doesn't work with transparencies. That's annoying. For sprites and also when it renders images, it renders them line by line rather than the whole image at once. [...] That's not good for practicality. It also has too many pins. Neither SPI or I2C&nbsp;protocols require that many pins."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Picographics + Pico Display Pack /Tufty 2040 (3/10)">Picographics + Pico Display Pack /Tufty 2040 (3/10)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The next one is the Picographics library with the Pico display. If anyone here is a fan of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/">Pimoroni website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for microcontrollers you know what I'm talking about. If not, it's a little niche. This experience inspired the whole entire talk because the Pimoroni website is so friendly and cute [...] you think 'wow it must be easy to display a JPEG on this thing.' No," Makivic says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They use this JPEG coding library where you have to have a particular format of JPEG. But they don't tell you what the format is or how to define it. All I know is that when I use JPEGs from ProStudioPaint it likes them but when I use JPEGs from Photoshop it gets mad. That's okay because Adobe is evil so maybe they're right about that."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Adafruit GFX Bitmaps - ST7789 (5/10)">Adafruit GFX Bitmaps - ST7789 (5/10)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The next one is Adafruit GFX and Bitmaps on the ST7789. Solid 5/10. I liked that the ST7789s are kind of small. They're cute. They are pricey though, but come in round shapes too, which is cool. Also Adafruit–it has good documentation. They will tell you to do what you need to do in order to get the thing you want to do. Excellent. That's a huge plus," continues Makivic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But, one thing you do have to use with these screens is bitmaps. I had to learn what fucking bitmaps were in order to do this. So a bitmap is an array that represents an image. Each value in the array represents a particular pixel in the image. So you have to break that bitmap into a grid and then see when you're going to use that part of the bitmap in a game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's cool to manipulate an image on that kind of pixel level. But there might also be an easier way of doing this–I don't know. And just like all of these other screens, bitmaps cannot be transparent. So your white background has to match your game background, and that's just a huge hassle for everyone. Also, I need to know the size, width, and height of the bitmap. I had to do math in order to do this–which like, why? It also gets mad when you try to use too many bitmaps at the same time."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="ESP32 + ILI9341, ST7789, GC9A01 (8/10)">ESP32 + ILI9341, ST7789, GC9A01 (8/10)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Finally, I would like to move onto the best one. We've left the dark ages where you can't use transparency and entered the modern world where you can use transparency on images. I'm using the ESP32 microcontroller with various screens including the ILI9341, ST7789, GC9A01," says Makivic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Honestly, it has been great. It's so easy to use and I recommend it. The only downside is that you kind of have to leave the beginner pool and jump into the intermediate pool. ESP32 is maybe not as intuitive, but it's also really not that bad. And I get to use the GC9A01 screen which is very cheap and also circular."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/keyword/amaze-sheffield">Click here for more AMAZE Sheffield coverage</a></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>
The Plucky Squire, one of Eurogamer's most anticipated games of the year, will launch for PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch and Xbox Series X/S on 17th September, publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> has announced. 
</p>
<p>
It'll also be a day one launch via PlayStation Plus, for anyone signed up to Sony's subscription service.
</p>
<p>
An innovative 2D and 3D platformer based in and around the pages of a picture book, The Plucky Squire is the first project from All Possible Futures, the indie development studio set up by former Pokémon artist James Turner.

<p>
I got the chance to watch a demo of The Plucky Squire last year at Gamescom 2023 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-newscast-ftc-microsoft-acquisition-done-deal-1-1">came away rather besotted</a>. Chris Tapsell then went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/my-first-hands-on-with-the-plucky-squire-was-one-of-the-most-joyful-experiences-in-ages">hands-on at Summer Game Fest back in June</a>, and dubbed it one of his "most joyful experiences in ages".
</p>
<p>
A mix of 2D and 3D platformers, adventure games, side-scrollers and more, The Plucky Squire follows the exploits of young storybook hero Jot as he leaps in and out of its pages.
</p>
<p>
"The Plucky Squire is joyful and delightful and inventive, but it's also a game that's been made with indisputable care," Chris wrote. "The kind of care that quite literally leaps out of the page."

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-and-delay-revealed.953808/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>release date, but it's landing a little later than you might have expected.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1823949533128036374" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>officially launches across PC and consoles on February 11th, which the studio admits is a "long wait". The game was previously slated to arrive sometime this year.</p>
<p>Despite the extra wait time, Warhorse says there's plenty of stuff on the way to whet your appetite for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, including gameplay footage, a collector's edition, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay-party.jpg?itok=tXb-ZZM2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay-party.jpg?itok=Y_X5LJzQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fear not, revellers, for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has a release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Warhorse PR manager&nbsp;Tobias Stolz-Zwilling <a href="https://x.com/T0_8I/status/1823951710206722306" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a>&nbsp;the dev team was "this close" to releasing in 2024, but eventually made the decision that it needed "a tiny bit more time". He also echoes the studio's excitement with regards to what's coming up for&nbsp;<em>Deliverance 2</em>.</p>
<p>First up, a showcase demonstrating over 20 minutes of gameplay will air at this year's Gamescom, which is due to start later this month. Following that, the collector's edition of the game will be revealed at some point, and previews from various content creators and press outlets will also begin to appear.</p>
<p>In short, even though<i>&nbsp;Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</i>has technically been delayed, there should still be plenty to keep you busy between now and its February release date, however far off that date currently seems.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's the sequel to 2017's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-six-million">hugely popular medieval RPG</a>&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, the sequel will also revolve around protagonist Henry of Skalitz, and this time he's "caught in a gripping tale of revenge, betrayal, and discovery". Sounds like an average day in 15th-century Bohemia to me.</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on February 11th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
