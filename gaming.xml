            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A live-action <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> movie is in the works. Hasbro Entertainment has partnered with Legendary Pictures to produce an official feature film of the acclaimed card game. In addition, they will help produce television shows based on the property.</p>

<h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Movie Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Hasbro and Legendary will be focusing on producing a live-action <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> film. Given that <em>Magic</em> is Hasbro's $1 billion brand with over thirty years of rich characters, settings, and stories to adapt, there is plenty of source material ripe for adaptation.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-aetherdrift-insect.jpg?itok=82qh4RAN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-aetherdrift-insect.jpg?itok=BGBWz_VE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Once the feature film has led the charge, the two companies will help produce live-action television shows and other content as the universe of the property expands.</p>

<p>Legendary Pictures has a solid track record producing film and television for beloved brands. They're the studio behind the "Monsterverse" which adapted Toho's <em>Godzilla</em> monsters into blockbuster feature films alongside the Apple TV series, <em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em>. A second success is producing the two live-action <em>Dune</em> movies and the spin-off show <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> for the Max streaming service.</p>

<p>This approach is similar to another brand that Hasbro tried to expand: <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. After producing the critically well-received but commercially underwhelming <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em>, they had plans for spin-off shows, one of which was being produced by Joe Manganiello.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><br>
&nbsp;Mary Parent, Legendary’s Chairman of Worldwide Production, said, “We pride ourselves on being thoughtful caretakers of singular, beloved IP, and no property better fits that description than Magic: The Gathering. Alongside the fantastic Hasbro team, we look forward to creating a multimedia universe that thrills longstanding fans and creates a broad wave of new ones.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hasbro and Legendary attempting to make a<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> movie may be the next chapter in companies trying to adapt the brand. It is a dense, imaginative world full of interdimensional wizards, evil dragons, demonic crime syndicates, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aetherdrift-commander-living-energy-review-and-upgrades" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">high-octane racing competitions</a>. Netflix announced an animated adaptation in 2019, but that project was quietly <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-netflix-series-is-officially-canceled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">canceled</a>.</p>

According to <a href="https://status.playstation.com/">Sony’s PSN status page</a>, account management, gaming and social, PlayStation Video, PlayStation Store, and the PlayStation Direct website are all dealing with issues.</p><p>For gaming specifically, Sony says that “you might have difficulty launching games, apps, or network features.” A colleague wasn’t able to load their purchased digital games or see their friends, trophies, or even their online status on their PS5. Sony is vowing to fix the problems “as soon as possible.”</p><p>Sony’s status website says the issues started at 7PM ET, but user reports started spiking <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network/">on Downdetector</a> at about an hour earlier at around 6PM ET. As I write this, there are less than 70,000 reports of problems on Downdetector, though the volume of reports seems to be dropping. An r/PlayStation thread about the outage has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1ik8p8k/is_psn_down_nothing_is_working/?sort=new">more than 1,600 comments</a>.</p><p>Sony didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><div><p>PSN had an outage that lasted for around eight hours back <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/30/24258989/ps5-ps4-playstation-network-down-outage-offline">in October</a>.

We are currently investigating the issue and working to restore service, so please be patient.” It’s an especially unfortunate time for the network to go down with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1887911802853327236&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1887911802853327236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last free <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>beta test weekend</a></span> currently underway. </p><p>There’s no information yet on what the cause of the outage is, how many people are affected, or when the service might come back online. While some service disruptions can last for just a few hours, others could go on for much longer, with spotty connection quality even as the network comes back online. The PlayStation status page <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://status.playstation.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently lists</a></span> all online services as being down. </p><p>And so far this certainly seems to be one of the bigger outages PSN has suffered of late. Players started reporting getting disconnected shortly after 6:00 p.m. ET and so far there’s no sign of anyone being able to get back on. The outage also appears to be worldwide, rather than being isolated to certain countries or continents. </p><p>The nightmare scenario for Sony would be a malicious hack or some deeper problem that causes the outage to persist for days or even weeks. That’s been unheard of in the modern era, but that’s what happened back in the infamous 2011 PlayStation Network outage. So far at least, there’s no sign that something on that scale is happening again. Hopefully, the system comes back online shortly. I, for one, was supposed to be spending tonight with my buds in <em>Rocket League</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s not just you. The PlayStation Network is down for everyone.  </p>



<p>Outages began appearing around 6pm ET, according to multiple reports. A visit to the official PlayStation <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">status page shows</a> that all services are down, including the PlayStation Store, gaming,  account management, and more.</p>



<p>As of writing there is no official word from PlayStation regarding the outage. Nor is there any idea as to when service will be restored.</p>



<p>Based on a preliminary check, it appears to be only PlayStation Network suffering issues. Other major online services such as Xbox Live, Nintendo Online, and Steam appear to be working as expected. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to provide updates as they become available.</p>

<p>Earlier today, M80 dominated Team Liquid in the group stage of the Six Invitational 2025 tournament. This super-sized event boasts a $3 million prize pool and is one of the most important tournaments in the annual esports calendar, so it comes as no surprise that emotions can run wild.</p>



<p>Following the 2 – 1 win over Team Liquid, M80’s Shaun ‘Gunnar’ Pottorff blew up behind the scenes, with the moments after the victory just about being captured by M80’s social team. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-doesn-t-matter-what-team-i-m-on">‘It Doesn’t Matter What Team I’m On’</h2>



<p>Gunnar has been around the block against Team Liquid. The comments he made following M80’s win in the group stage of this year’s Six Invitational were backed up by cold, hard numbers. In recent years, Gunnar has taken down Team Liquid while being a part of three separate rosters.</p>



<p>He did it with Soniqs, then against with beastcoast, and now with M80.</p>



<div><article><p><span>After our WIN vs LIQUID 

➞ Take a look INSIDE the ARENA! 🏟 </span></p></article></div>







<p>In 2024, Gunnar and beastcoast stormed to success at the BLAST Manchester Major, securing the organisation’s first major win. That victory included the brutal knocking out of Team Liquid. Beastcoat eliminated the Brazilian squad without dropping a map, before going on to beat Team BDS 3 – 2 in the grand final.</p>



<p>Gunnar had sharp words for Team Liquid following today’s win:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You can’t beat me! You guys just can’t beat me. It doesn’t matter what team I’m on.</p>



<p>That’s three different teams – you can’t beat me.</p>



<p>Three different teams, three different rosters, same f***ing results, bro.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>M80 picked up the former beastcoast roster following the disbanding of the team in the run-up to the Six Invitational 2025. Thus far in the tournament, M80 has performed pretty well, and at the time of writing, the team sat in second place in the group, just a few points behind G2 Esports, the favourite to win the event.</p>



<p>This weekend, the Six Invitational will depart the group stage and enter the playoffs bracket, with the bottom teams in each group being effectively eliminated from the running.</p>

            <p>
It's been over 14 years since developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a>' fondly remembered alternate history shooter series drew to a close with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resistance-3">Resistance 3</a>, but it turns out fans might have seen a fourth mainline entry if the studio had got its way. Outgoing Insomniac boss has revealed the studio pitched a "wonderful concept" for Resistance 4 - but Sony ultimately said no.
</p>
<p>
Price - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-studio-boss-ted-price-announces-retirement-from-games-industry">announced his retirement last month</a> after more than 30 years at Insomniac - was speaking to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZWKbHKCUkpw">Kinda Funny Gamescast</a>. When asked if he had a favourite pitch the studio had made over the years - a "one that got away" - Price dropped the Resistance 4 bombshell.
</p>
<p>
"We did pitch that one," he revealed, "and it was a wonderful concept... It was the result of a lot of Insomniac team members being passionate about extending the story further... I do believe that Resistance has set up a really cool alternate history base where anything can happen with the Chimera and where they go and what their origins are. We spent a lot of time working on backstory and brainstorming on where we could take this in the future."

<p>
Unfortunately, Sony couldn't be convinced, with Price citing "timing and market opportunity" as the reason the project didn't progress beyond its pitch. Exactly when all this happened is unclear based on Price's comments, but a glance through the archives reveals he told Eurogamer the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniac-not-slated-to-do-resistance-4">studio was "not slated" to do Resistance 4</a> all the way back in 2011. A year later and Price was ready to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniac-confirms-it-wont-make-more-resistance-games">draw a line under the series in considerably more definitive terms</a>, saying, "We won't be making any more Resistances."
</p>
<p>
And while that's proven to be the case so far, Price revealed to Kinda Funny he'd love to see a Resistance revival, calling the series, "Near and dear to my heart."
</p>
<p>
"When you work on a franchise for a long time," he explained, "it's nice to have a chance to move onto something else. And at the same time, it's also nice to be able to come back to it. So fortunately, because [Insomniac is] part of Sony and Sony owns the intellectual property to Resistance, we will always have that opportunity to revisit Resistance."
</p>
<p>
But while fans may be disappointed to hear about the Resistance 4 that almost was, Price remains philosophical. "I do strongly believe there's a reason everything happens," he told Kinda Funny, "and when I look back at the games that we've made - the ones that were received well, the ones that weren't received well, the ones we didn't get to make - all of those have led us to where we are today. Which is an amazing relationship with Marvel and working on games we are truly excited about."
</p>
<p>
Insomniac's next game is Wolverine, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game">teased back in 2021</a> and is still without a release window. "We've announced Wolverine, and we'd love to talk more about Wolverine," the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">studio said earlier this year</a>, "but we have to be like Logan today, and remain very stoic until it's time to pop the claws down the road. As much as we have pent up excitement, we've got to hold on to it. So that's about as much as we could say about our upcoming projects today."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-so-few-people-were-aware-of-kingdom-come-director%E2%80%99s-gamergate-past.1103775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-kingdom-come-deliverance-gamergate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Whether you consider it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/awards/520012/first-2025-goty-contender-kingdom-come-deliverance-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a GOTY contender</a> or not, we’ve certainly got our first big game of the year in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, an open-world RPG that goes for it despite the inevitable jank that comes with such immense scale. This week, many were surprised to learn that the game’s director, Warhorse Studios founder Daniel Vávra, was a big supporter of the first Gamergate movement. This felt like <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-owes-its-popularity-to-realism-and-conserv-1823420208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common knowledge</a> back when the original <em>Kingdom Come</em> (kingdom) came out, but years later, that crucial context has faded into a footnote. What happened? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>We’re joined by special guest Rowan Zeoli of <a href="https://www.rascal.news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rascal</a>, an independent, reader-supported, worker-owned outlet for journalism about tabletop roleplaying games not unlike Aftermath. The site is celebrating one year of life on the increasingly tumultuous planet Earth with <a href="https://www.rascal.news/rascal-celebrates-its-first-birthday-with-a-pledge-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a subscription drive</a>, so we ask Rowan how things are going (pretty well!) and then dig into a harrowingly powerful piece she recently wrote about <a href="https://aftermath.site/fight-for-america-j6-rascal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roleplaying the January 6 insurrection</a> in a Brooklyn warehouse. What can we learn from living out these moments in a controlled, game-like environment? And why don’t wargames recreate modern history more often?</p><p>Then we discuss <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> and its director’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3lhcer4oo322q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support of the original Gamergate movement</a>, which everybody seems to have forgotten about. Why, though? And what does it mean for a sequel that&nbsp; seems at least somewhat interested in exploring more diverse stories – despite the objections of an audience that’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-developer-is-fed-up-of-being-dragged-into-the-culture-war-it-seems-like-someone-is-always-trying-to-brand-us-somehow-and-we-are-just-trying-to-make-a-cool-videogame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partially turned on it</a> for that very reason? Finally, at listeners’ request, Nathan gives everyone a special pre-release preview of a passage from <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-stream-big-book-nathan-grayson-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his book</a> (<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preorder now</a>!), and he’s not nervous about it at all.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can grow this humble website into a vast kingdom that will deliver you from the horrors of the modern internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The new <em>Kingdom Come</em> kind of goes back on that idea of [an almost entirely white cast] and says “Actually we are gonna have characters of other backgrounds and from other places, and we’re going to engage in these ways that – at least based on the reviews I’ve read – sound kind of interesting and nuanced.”</p><p><strong>Rowan: </strong>They turned woke!</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>So it feels like the director of this studio is one thing, and some of the people working for the studio are another thing, and you’ve got people at the studio being like “Man, we <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-developer-is-fed-up-of-being-dragged-into-the-culture-war-it-seems-like-someone-is-always-trying-to-brand-us-somehow-and-we-are-just-trying-to-make-a-cool-videogame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t want anything to do with all this culture war shit</a>. We just want people to like our game and play it on its own terms.” And this is the funniest part: Back in the day, the Gamergater types were like “Yeah, this game is doing whites only! We love that shit!” And now that the series has added other people of different backgrounds into the series, they’ve turned on it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rowan:</strong> The leopards would never eat my face, though!</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I know, right? So then you have some of the other developers disavowing the culture war and asking why people are doing this to them. Well, because you’re working with a guy who set a lot of this stuff in motion [and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3lhceupzapc2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kept behaving that way</a> in the intervening period]. How can you be surprised?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>It’s been confusing to me. People are writing about it and talking about it in a way that makes me feel a little bit crazy, where I’m like “Doesn’t everybody remember what happened before?” And because I’m broken inside, I want to leave space for the idea that times have changed and maybe the guy has changed. Nathan tells me the guy has not changed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, if you look at his posts, it doesn’t seem like he’s changed substantially.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> But it seems like the game itself [is fine]. I remember that was the controversy with the game the first time, too: There are things in the game that are probably good and interesting. It’s not a wholesale write off.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Definitely not. That’s the dilemma that I think a lot of people who are more left-leaning are facing. You have this context around how the game was made and who made it, and then the game itself is not the horrible polemic you’d expect it to be. It’s more nuanced than that. And of course, as with any video game of this scale, it was made by hundreds of people – many of whom probably do not share that director’s opinions. But they also did choose to work at that studio.</p><p><strong>Rowan: </strong>Do you guys have this issue in video games? In tabletop games, there’s a real lack of institutional memory. Like even maybe the people writing about this game just have no idea.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Yeah, everybody keeps getting laid off, which certainly doesn’t help.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Times have also changed. When the first <em>Kingdom Come</em> came out [in 2018], a lot of the conversation around games was still happening on websites and blogs and stuff. YouTube was definitely a presence, but it was a little more nascent. Now that dynamic has totally flipped. Now most of the conversation is happening on YouTube and Twitch and Discord, and video game websites are becoming more and more dinosaur-like by the day.</p><p>So I think part of it is probably the age of the audience and the demographics of who was present for that first conversation [about the original <em>Kingdom Come</em>], and the other part is just where it’s all happening – how much more diffuse it is. That means, especially with websites closing down and people getting laid off, that there’s really no institutional memory whatsoever. So even people who’d want to know about this and who’d care about this are not finding out, at least until the very last second.</p><p><strong>Rowan:</strong> I feel like tabletop journalism is about 15 years behind video game journalism, because I’m like “Ah yes, I know exactly what you’re talking about. It’s gonna take us a decade to figure out.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, exactly. And even then, so much of it is cyclical. So many of the conversations happen again and again and again, and nobody fully figures it out.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/trump-tariff-china-ugreen-max5c-noise-canceling-headphones"><h3>These Headphones Were A Great Deal When I Bought Them</h3></a><p>The Ugreen Max5c were an absolute steal when I got them for about $35 dollars, but I have no clue how long that'll be true.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esa-iicon-e3"><h3>Vowels Are Back As ESA Announces New Conference</h3></a><p>The Interactive Innovation Conference will focus on where games connect to other industries</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Take-Two stocks have reached an all-time high after reconfirming that GTA 6 will be releasing fall 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1887983768201298182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">videotechuk_</a> on X, after CEO Strauss Zelnick reaffirmed a fall 2025 release date for GTA 6 at their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent earnings call,</a> Take-Two’s stocks started climbing, creating a new record today. Take-Two Interactive Software’s stock opened at $198, reached a high of almost $213, and closed at $208.77.&nbsp;The company’s confidence has reassured investors. </p>



<p>GTA 6 is the most anticipated release in the gaming industry, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-power-launch-date-competing-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many publishers</a> do not want to release their games close to Rockstar’s new instalment. Players were worried, as no news about the game had been revealed since the trailer in December 2023. The community speculated that a delay could be imminent. However, since the game was announced, the developers have stayed strong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-2025-release-promoted-rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the 2025 release window</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the CEO of Take-Two recently made a statement, players hope Rockstar will provide more information soon to get them even more excited about Fall 2025. It would be exciting to see some new gameplay and glimpse all the fresh innovations Rockstar may have implemented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same earnings call, Take-Two’s CEO spoke about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-plans-to-support-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo’s upcoming console, Switch 2</a>. However, it wasn’t confirmed whether their upcoming games, like Grand Theft Auto 6 and Borderlands 4, will be released on the platform. Also, NBA 2K25’s player spending <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-says-nba-2k25-surpassed-player-spending-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“greatly surpassed” expectations</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's the year 2000 all over again, because I've just spent the past week playing <em>The Sims</em>, a game that could have had a resurgent zeitgeist moment if only EA, the infamous game publisher, had put enough effort in.</p>
<p>A few days ago, EA re-released two of its most legendary games: <em>The Sims</em> and <em>The Sims 2</em>. Dubbed the "The Legacy Collection," these could not even be called remasters. EA just put the original games on Steam with some minor patches to make them a little more likely to work on some modern machines.</p>
<p>The emphasis of that sentence should be on the word "some." Forums and Reddit threads were flooded with players saying the game either wouldn't launch at all, crashed shortly after launch, or had debilitating graphical issues. (Patches have been happening, but there's work to be done yet.)</p>
<p>Further, the releases lack basic features that are standard for virtually all Steam releases now, like achievements or Steam Cloud support.</p>
<p>It took me a bit of time to get it working myself, but I got there, and my time with the game has reminded me of two things. First, <em>The Sims</em> is a unique experience that is worthy of its lofty legacy. Second, <em>The Sims</em> deserved better than this lackluster re-release.</p>
<h2>EA didn’t meet its own standard</h2>
<p>Look, it's fine to re-release a game without remastering it. I'm actually glad to see the game's original assets as they always were—it's deeply nostalgic, and there's always a tinge of sadness when a remaster overwrites the work of the original artists. That's not a concern here.</p>
<p>But if you're going to re-release a game on Steam in 2025, there are minimum expectations—especially from a company with the resources of EA, and even more so for a game that is this important and beloved.</p>
<p>The game needs to reliably run on modern machines, and it needs to support basic platform features like cloud saves or achievements. It's not much to ask, and it's not what we got.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The Steam forums for the game are filled with people saying it's lazy that EA didn't include Steam Cloud support because implementing that is ostensibly as simple as picking a folder and checking a box.</p>
<p>I spoke with two different professional game developers this week who have previously published games on Steam, and I brought up the issue of Steam Cloud and achievement support. As they tell it, it turns out it's not nearly as simple as those players in the forums believe—but it still should have been within EA's capabilities, even with a crunched schedule.</p>
<p>Yes, it's sometimes possible to get it working at a basic level within a couple of hours, provided you're already using the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/api">Steamworks API</a>. But even in that circumstance, the way a game's saves work might require additional work to protect against lost data or frequent problems with conflicts.</p>
<p>Given that the game doesn't support achievements or really anything else you'd expect, it's possible EA didn't use the Steamworks API at all. (Doing that would have been hours of additional work.)</p>

      Sadly, this is not the sort of computer bug players are encountering.

<p>I'm not giving EA a pass, though. Four years ago, EA put out the <em>Command &amp; Conquer Remastered Collection</em>, a 4K upscale remaster of the original C&amp;C games. The release featured a unified binary for the classic games, sprites and textures that were upscaled to higher resolutions, quality of life improvements, and yes, many of the Steam bells and whistles that include achievements. I'm not saying that the remaster was flawless, but it exhibited significantly more care and effort than <em>The Sims</em> re-release.</p>
<p>I love <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>. I played a lot of it when I was younger. But even a longtime <em>C&amp;C</em> fan like myself can easily acknowledge that its importance in gaming history (as well as its popularity and revenue potential) pale in comparison to <em>The Sims</em>.</p>
<p>If EA could do all that for <em>C&amp;C,</em> it's all the more perplexing that it didn't bother with a 25th-anniversary re-release of <em>The Sims</em>.</p>

<h2>Single-player games, meet publicly traded companies</h2>
<p>While we don't have much insight into all the inner workings of EA, there are hints as to why this sort of thing is happening. For one thing, anyone who has worked for a giant corporation like this knows it's all too easy for the objective to be passed down from above at the last minute, leaving no time or resources to see it through adequately.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But it might run deeper than that. To put it simply, publicly traded publishers like EA can't seem to satisfy investors with single-purchase, single-player games. The emphasis on single-player releases has been decreasing for a long time, and it's markedly less just five years after the release of the <em>C&amp;C</em> remaster.</p>
<p>Take the recent comments from EA CEO Andrew Wilson's post-earnings call, for example. <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/electronic-arts-ceo-andrew-wilson-argues-that-the-future-of-single-player-games-is-a-live-service-hybrid/">Wilson noted</a> that the big-budget, single-player RPG <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-the-choices-you-make-while-saving-the-world/"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a> failed to meet sales expectations—even though it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-launch-beats-jedi-survivor-to-makes-it-eas-biggest-ever-single-player-game-on-steam">apparently</a> one of EA's most successful single-player Steam releases ever.</p>
<p>"In order to break out beyond the core audience, games need to directly connect to the evolving demands of players who increasingly seek shared-world features and deeper engagement alongside high-quality narratives in this beloved category," he explained, suggesting that games need to be multiplayer games-as-a-service to be successful in this market.</p>
<p>Ironically, though, the single-player RPG <em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</em> launched around the same time he made those comments, and that game's developer said it made its money back in <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/days-after-ea-ceo-suggests-players-crave-live-service-guff-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-boss-says-their-single-player-rpg-made-all-its-money-back-in-one-day/">a single day of sales</a>. It's currently one of the top-trending games on Twitch, too.</p>
<p>It's possible that <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> director Swen Vincke <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-boss-blasts-publisher-greed-behind-layoffs">hit the nail on the head</a> when he suggested at the Game Developers Conference last year that a particular approach to pursuing quarterly profits runs counter to the practice of making good games.</p>
<p>"I've been fighting publishers my entire life, and I keep on seeing the same, same, same mistakes over and over and over," he said. "It's always the quarterly profits. The only thing that matters are the numbers."</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1770834130852315517">Later on X</a>, he clarified who he was pointing a finger at: "This message was for those who try to double their revenue year after year. You don't have to do that. Build more slowly and make your aim improving the state of the art, not squeezing out the last drop."</p>
<p>In light of Wilson's comments, it's a fair guess that EA might not have put in much effort on <em>The Sims</em> re-releases simply because of a belief that single-player games that aren't "shared world experiences" just aren't worth the resources anymore, given the company's need to satisfy shareholders with perpetual revenue growth.</p>

        <div>
          
          
<h2>Despite all this, <em>The Sims</em> is worth a look</h2>
<p>It's telling that in a market with too many options, I still put the effort in to get the game working, and I spent multiple evenings this week immersed in the lives of my sims.</p>
<p>Even after 25 years, this game is unique. It has the emergent wackiness of something like <em>RimWorld</em> or <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, but it has a fast-acting, addictive hook and is easy to learn. There have been other games besides <em>The Sims</em> that are highly productive engines for original player stories, but few have achieved these heights while remaining accessible to virtually everyone.</p>
<p>Like so many of the best games, it's hard to stop playing once you start. There's always one more task you want to complete—or you're about to walk away when something hilariously unexpected happens.</p>
<p>The problems I had getting <em>The Sims</em> to run aren't that much worse than what I surely experienced on my PC back in 2002—it's just that the standards are a lot higher now.</p>
<p>I've gotten $20 out of value out of the purchase, despite my gripes. But it's not just about my experience. More broadly, <em>The Sims</em> deserved better. It could have had a moment back in the cultural zeitgeist, with tens of thousands of Twitch viewers.</p>
<h2>Missed opportunities</h2>
<p>The moment seems perfect: The world is stressful, so people want nostalgia. Cozy games are ascendant. Sandbox designs are making a comeback. <em>The Sims</em> slots smoothly into all of that.</p>
<p>But go to those Twitch streams, and you'll see a lot of complaining about how the game didn't really get everything it deserved and a sentiment that whatever moment EA was hoping for was undermined by this lack of commitment.</p>
<p>Instead, the cozy game du jour on Twitch is the <em>Animal Crossing</em>-like <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, a former Apple Arcade exclusive that made its way to Steam recently. To be clear, I'm not knocking <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>; it's a great game for fans of the modern cozy genre, and I'm delighted to see an indie studio seeing so much success.</p>

<p>The takeaway is that we can't look to big publishers like EA to follow through on delivering quality single-player experiences anymore. It's the indies that'll carry that forward.</p>
<p>It's just a bummer for fans that <em>The Sims</em> couldn't have the revival moment it should have gotten.</p>

The card match was streamed online and the winner would receive a very rare gold Mickey card worth between $10,000 and $20,000. The winner would also move on to the Top 4 and have a chance to make it into the first <em>Lorcana</em> world tournament, so this was a big moment and a lot of people were watching. </p><h2 id="h175748"><a id=""></a>What happened during the event</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2369924180&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2369924180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In the third and final round of the match</a></span>, Lentini “quested” with a magic broom card, gaining a point towards victory. Then he played Goat Merlin, a card that grants you a victory point for simply playing it. And then he went to banish his broom card to his discard pile because that card has an ability that lets you destroy it when you play another character and you then draw a card. That’s when his opponent, Fusade, complained and asked for a judge to step in. </p><p>Fusade’s argument was that Lentini had missed his chance to trigger the broom’s ability when he grabbed Goat Merlin’s point and moved on. If you’ve played <em>Lorcana </em>even casually you’ll know that is, uh, bullshit. In fact, in the official rules, simultaneous triggers can be handled in any order as long as you are clear with the other player. A longtime judge and <em>Lorcana </em>expert confirmed that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Mfpt3QNIsgc?t=305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Mfpt3QNIsgc?t=305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no rule was broken in a video with <em>Lorcana </em>content creator Joe “Speci” Curley</a></span>. In fact, as pointed out in that same video, Lentini did something very similar earlier in that same match which wasn’t flagged by the judge or Fusade. </p><p>That didn’t matter, however, because during the match the judge incorrectly sided with Fusade and made Lentini put his broom back on the board, not letting him discard it to gain a draw. This ended up costing Lentini the match and a chance to qualify for the world tournament. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DisneyLorcana/status/1885969386676379884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DisneyLorcana/status/1885969386676379884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fusade then made it to the final match</a></span> and lost, but still qualified for the world final. The loss also cost Lentini the gold Mickey Mouse card. </p><figure id="" data-id="00dc597abb4ec73f0a6ca9baa072dc44" data-recommend-id="image://00dc597abb4ec73f0a6ca9baa072dc44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Ravensburger / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="00dc597abb4ec73f0a6ca9baa072dc44" data-recommend-id="image://00dc597abb4ec73f0a6ca9baa072dc44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Lorcana/comments/1ifuxed/as_someone_who_just_finished_the_dlc_the_cheating/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Lorcana/comments/1ifuxed/as_someone_who_just_finished_the_dlc_the_cheating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">There was a lot of outrage and backlash</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/cheating-accusations-mar-the-first-disney-lorcana-challenge-in-oceania/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/cheating-accusations-mar-the-first-disney-lorcana-challenge-in-oceania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over the decision</a></span>.

Eventually, the company behind <em>Lorcana</em>, Ravensburger, stepped in and announced that it was investigating the incident. And while the investigation’s full results won’t be made public, it appears there’s a somewhat happy ending.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Lorcana/comments/1ijwufp/jesse_lentini_has_been_awarded_a_gold_mickey/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Lorcana/comments/1ijwufp/jesse_lentini_has_been_awarded_a_gold_mickey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a Discord message from Ravensburger</a></span>, Lentini has received a gold Mickey Mouse card. Meanwhile, in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.disneylorcana.com/en-US/news_/2025_/02_/state-of-play&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.disneylorcana.com/en-US/news_/2025_/02_/state-of-play" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a  blog post</a></span> published Friday listing the winners who qualified for the world tournament, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/ymokxOvXmPg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/ymokxOvXmPg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fusade is missing</a></span> and has been replaced with a runner-up, Ben Simmons. While it has yet to be confirmed whether Fusade was actually disqualified or just dropped out himself, based on how Ravensburger provided Lentini with a gold Mickey card, I think it’s safe to assume that Fusade was removed from the event.</p><p><em>Lorcana </em>is still a relatively new trading card game compared to <em>Magic </em>and <em>Pokémon</em>, so the community is happy to see this controversial situation be resolved in a mostly satisfactory way. The hope is that this is an indicator that Ravensburger is serious about protecting the game and the quality of its future events. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/trump-tariff-china-ugreen-max5c-noise-canceling-headphones<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are certain areas where Chinese companies currently dominate: amplifiers, affordable earbuds and in-ear monitors. So when I saw a <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/ugreen-max5c-25-nc-headphone-review.58627/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forum post</a> and multiple YouTubers recommended a sub $50 bluetooth headset, I posted about it online. A few people bought them and told me “man, these are pretty good,” so I bought them to mess around. The wisdom was right; they’re well-built, sound solid, and were a great deal when I bought them–before Trump announced his massive China tariffs.</p><p>I should stress for anyone reading this later that this is being written in the early parts of Donald Trump’s second term. We do not know the full impact of how his continued trade war with China is going to work practically, although one element of it<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605483/shein-temu-amazon-trump-tariffs-de-minimis-exemption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> was the removal of the de minimis rule for goods under $800</a> that helped the import of inexpensive Chinese goods to flourish. Previously, inexpensive goods were exempt from existing tariffs and close inspection, and the removal of this rule means that not only are consumers hit with the new tariffs, but existing ones as well.</p><p>The framing of these tariffs has overwhelmingly been to state that this is a direct attack on vendors of cheap goods like Temu and SHEIN, as well as imports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/drugs-fentanyl-shipping/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of fentanyl</a>.The last point is a little reactionary, and I am skeptical that the changes being proposed will do much to lessen the flow of fentanyl. And while I agree SHEIN sucks a lot, so does most clothing now, the framing undersells the significance of Chinese goods, including goods that are well made.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607282/trump-china-tariffs-dhl-shipment-import-duty-fees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fees on importing Chinese goods</a> are probably going to go up. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607080/qwertykeys-halts-us-shipments-tariff-china" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some companies halted shipments in moments of uncertainty</a>; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607475/china-tariffs-shipping-fees-charges-delays-ups-usps-fedex-dhl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delays and new charges are happening</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606489/usps-reverses-china-hong-kong-parcel-decision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USPS briefly halted then backtracked on accepting packages from China</a>. Even if you agree with the idea of stopping the de minimis rule or buying less frivolous stuff, <a href="https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Final-de-minimis-report-Oxford-Economics-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">none of this seems particularly well-implemented</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>The pads are fairly comfortable but I tend to sweat through anything that isn't velour. These headphones are no exception.</figcaption></figure><p>This brings us to the Ugreen Max5c headphones, which I got for about $35. You may know <a href="https://www.ugreen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ugreen</a> because they make competitive and solidly built USB-C charging cables, power chargers and power banks. They've also been expanding into other fields like Network Attached Storage (for laymen: a big box you shove hard drives into to store stuff and run a Plex server), although I have not tested them against offerings like QNAP, Synology or Terramaster.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ugreen Max5c is not listed publicly on Ugreen’s English-facing site and is currently unavailable on Amazon, but it is available on their Aliexpress store. This is not uncommon with Chinese companies, and if you dig around the official Aliexpress store you’ll find a lot of items they don’t promote as much here, like wireless earbuds and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604094/ugreen-finder-slim-thin-wallet-card-tracker-rechargeable-apple-find-my-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple AirTag clones</a>. Ugreen also has models other than the Max5c, like the Max5 Hybrid and Studio Max 2, although I have not read any reviews of either of those.</p><p>The first thing you notice when you hold the Ugreen Max5c is that it’s shockingly well built for the money. Like a lot of Ugreen’s products, trim and finish are what I would expect from a much more expensive product, although the buttons themselves are a little clicky when they’re on your head. The cups are on the smaller side but fit comfortably on my head. The headset has both a partial lateral swivel and a hinge that allows you to fold them and put them in your bag. I dislike pleather or leather earcups personally, as I run pretty hot as a general rule. While these are no exception, I found them fairly comfortable as far as these things go. I would love the ability to swap the cups out for something aftermarket, because pads always disintegrate, but anything involving noise canceling requires a good seal, which can make that a tricky proposition.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>It's hard to have a problem with these headphones, but I don't like relying on an app as a general rule, and wished Ugreen had more specific EQing options.</figcaption></figure><p>The stock equalization for the Max5c is distractingly bassy, which is not uncommon when designing headphones for a mass market. Switching the tuning requires you to download a <a href="https://www.ugreen.com/pages/ugreen-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companion app</a> from Ugreen and switch to one of the many presets. I found that “Jazz” and “Classic” tended to tame the bass into something far more transparent and clear. The app is slightly fiddly and annoying to use, and the ability to do any of this without adding clutter to my phone would have been preferential. The ability to have a parametric or graphic EQ would also have been a nice touch, but as it stands you need to use an external app to do that, which I don’t because I am a basic iPhone user. Apps like <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Equalizer APO</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pittvandewitt.wavelet&amp;hl=en_US&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wavelet</a> for Android are a good way to address this. The good people at Audio Science Review, where I first heard about these headphones, actually <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/ugreen-max5c-25-nc-headphone-review.58627/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have a good preset that should work with those apps</a>.</p><p>My ability to assess just how good these headphones are is limited by several factors. The first is that I was not able to test the headphone with the advertised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAC_(codec)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LDAC codec</a> because this is one noteworthy area where Apple refuses to treat people like adults. Though it is possible to use LDAC on a Windows PC with annoying workarounds, the ability to turn the LDAC feature on in the headset requires you to enable it in the <em>Android version </em>of the app. It’s understandable that Ugreen does not want to implement a codec you can’t use with an iPhone on the iPhone app, but this and the lack of tuning made it difficult for me to give a full assessment on mobile. The other issue is that I don’t have a measurement rig like a B&amp;K 5128 – a big fake head that not only measures how headphones sound but how they behave on the head. Maybe one day if Aftermath gets serious money I’ll be able to get one of those, but for now I’m going on the measurements of others and how they sound to my own ears.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The buttons are fine, the mic is nothing to write home about although I don't expect much for $35 dollars. Wired connections can only be done via USB-C. </figcaption></figure><p>But to be honest, I’m not sure how rigorous I need to be given that these things sound pretty fantastic for about $35. For that money, what do you expect? It’s impressive that a pair of headphones has noise canceling at all at this price and even more impressive that it performs decently there. The app features four distinct levels of noise canceling, one of which is an awareness mode that worked ok, although I’ve definitely heard better. These are not perfect headphones, but they might be close to perfect $35 headphones.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="UGREEN HiTune Max5C Active Noise Cancellation Headphone Review" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/48c69Pkor7Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A pretty comprehensive video of the Max5C from AndyAudioVault.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Max5c features an under-explained game mode, but I assume this helps with latency. The mic quality is a little distant but performs OK for the money. I still dream that someday a company will start making mic quality a bullet point and implement something like the freakishly good array mic from the Valve Index. The battery life is advertised at 75 hours with ANC off and 45 hours with it on, and while I haven’t run it through a full charge yet, it seems to last a long time.</p><p>Though it has its quirks, the Ugreen Max5C is an incredible value for the money, or at least it was when I bought it. After I got the notification that it had entered the country and passed customs, USPS <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606489/usps-reverses-china-hong-kong-parcel-decision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enacted and then rescinded a freeze on packages coming from China</a>, one of many moves recently that seems to have been shot off with little thought of the cascading effects on consumers and businesses in America. That same day I got multiple panicked emails from tea suppliers I’d ordered from in the past, pleading patience as everyone figures out how any of this shit is supposed to work.

Price seems hopeful that, one way or another, the series might still come back someday. </p><p><em>“Resistance 3</em> was intended to end that chapter of the <em>Resistance </em>franchise with the way that we ended with [recurring protagonist Joseph] Capelli and closed a lot of loops on various story items, and we wanted to do that so we would have more options in the future whether we were to go ahead with more <em>Resistance</em> games or take another turn,” Price said this week. “When you work on a franchise for a long time, it’s nice to have a chance to move on to something else and at the same time it’s also nice to be able to come back to it. Fortunately, because we’re part of Sony and Sony owns the intellectual property to <em>Resistance, </em>we will always have that opportunity to revisit <em>Resistance</em> and if it works out again, as a fan I’m going to be pretty excited.”<br></p><p>At this point, many fans would probably settle for a simple remaster of the existing trilogy for modern platforms. Since the games released on PS3, the only way to play them on PS5 remains through cloud streaming as part of the PlayStation Plus Premium subscription tier. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Sling your mind back to last October and you might remember PUBG Studios (yes, that PUBG) unveiling a new 5v5 PvP shooter featuring 'shared real-time line of sight'. Well, it's back, it's got a proper name now, and there's a demo on the way.
</p>
<p>
When we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-studio-unveils-top-down-pvp-shooter-project-arc-with-real-time-shared-line-of-sight">last saw PUBG Studios' new title</a>, it was going by the name of Project ARC and being described as a "realistic and fast-paced top-down shooting experience inspired by PUBG: Battlegrounds". Four months - and doubtless some arcane process involving an awful lot of Post-It notes - later, it's been renamed to PUBG: Blindspot.
</p>
<p>
What we have here is a 5v5 top-down tactical shooter where teams are either charged with hacking or defending a hidden crypt each game. The hacking team must blow up the walls surrounding the crypt to gain access and install a Decrypter device, while the defending team tries to stop them. But why, you might be asking yourself, is it called Blindspot?
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="PUBG: BLINDSPOT | Official Steam Next Fest Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3jP7p9DAKKI?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Well that, I assume, brings us back to the aforementioned shared line of sight, with enemies vanishing and reappearing across the map depending what individual teammates can see - a system intended to add a further tactical wrinkle through "immediate, non-verbal cooperation". Chuck in characters with their own preferred weapons and distinctive gadgets, alongside the promise of "skill-based, thrilling" gunfights, and that's all the basics covered.
</p>
<p>
PUBG: Blindspot doesn't have a release date yet, but if the brisk run-down above has left you in anyway intrigued, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3446700/PUBG_BLINDSPOT_Demo/">demo will be available from 21st February</a> as part of Steam Next Fest. It'll feature 10 unique characters with their own signature weapons and special tools, three team deathmatch maps, and four demolition mission maps, giving players a "chance to experience what [the team has] been cooking up so far".
</p>
<p>
In semi-related news, PUBG creator Brendan Greene last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-creator-announces-three-game-plan-one-of-which-has-a-demo-that-you-can-play-today">revealed an "ambitious" three-project plan</a> for his PlayerUnknown Productions studio. This included a  single-player open-world "emergent" survival game known as Prologue: Go Wayback, an "immersive" tech demo titled Preface: Undiscovered World, and the still-mysterious Project Artemis.

However, Insomniac during that time chose to create the third-person co-op shooter game Fuse instead in order to avoid franchise fatigue.

<p>Insomniac Games wanted to develop Resistance 4, but PlayStation turned it down. That’s according to soon-to-be president of Insomniac Games Ted Price.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZWKbHKCUkpw?t=1311s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kinda Funny Games</a>, Price was asked about a favorite game of his that was pitched but never greenlit.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’ll share one,” Price said after a brief pause. “Resistance 4.”</p>



<p>He continued: “We did pitch that one and it was a wonderful concept, and, it just, in terms of timing and market opportunity, didn’t work out. But it was the result of a lot of Insomniac  team members being passionate about extending the story further because I do believe that Resistance has set up a really cool alternate history base where anything can happen with the Chimera and where they go and what their origins are.”</p>



<p>Price said that they spent a lot of time working on backstory and brainstorming on where the series could go in the future.</p>



<p>“Personally, I love this franchise,” he said.  “I was fortunate enough to be creative director on the first two Resistances. And I will remember many, many moments—good and bad—when it comes to development that taught us all a lot about how we can elevate ourselves under some pretty difficult situations.”</p>



<p>Resistance, which first debuted with 2006’s Resistance: Fall of Man, hasn’t seen a mainline game since 2011’s Resistance 3. Price said that there’s no answer to the question of if the studio will ever develop another Resistance game, but it’s something he hopes will happen in the future.</p>

                <p>Grand Theft Auto parent company Take-Two's stock price is soaring this week following the company's recent earnings report on February 6. Why is the share value surging? It's often hard to know what makes a stock price move in the market, but there are some strong signals for what might be causing it this time.</p><p>Starting with the numbers, Take-Two's stock price is currently trading above $210 per share, which is about $35 higher than where it was when markets closed on Thursday. That's a gigantic gain for a single day, and it helped propel Take-Two's stock price to the highest value in the company's history.</p><p>Take-Two's previous high of around $210 per share came in 2021 during the pandemic, when many entertainment companies saw huge gains due to stay-at-home orders. For a historical comparison, when GTA V was released in September 2013, Take-Two stock was trading at around $17 per share. Anyone who bought back then, or earlier, and still holds Take-Two shares today is doing quite well.</p><p>On Thursday, Take-Two made a couple major announcements. First, management confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> remains <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">on track for release in Fall 2025, though management said it cannot rule out a delay later on</a>. Perhaps the more notable piece of news that may have contributed to the stock-price growth was that Take-Two significantly beat Wall Street's earnings expectations, which investors are seemingly responding positively to.</p><p>Take-Two lost 71 cents per share during the latest quarter for a total net loss of $125.2 million for the period. But <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/take-two-interactive-software-inc-q3-loss-increases-beats-estimates" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">analysts expected Take-Two to lose about 90 cents per share</a>, meaning Take-Two's performance, while in the red overall for the period, was far better than what many expected. This, coupled with the announcement that GTA 6 remains on track, may help explain why Take-Two stock is exploding. As always, though, there are never any clear answers for why a stock moves in a particular direction.</p><p>Every Rockstar Games release in the past decade has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">delayed beyond its originally announced date</a>, so some continue to believe GTA 6 might get pushed to 2026. Some are theorizing that GTA 6 was actually already delayed but only internally given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publishers-reportedly-waiting-for-gta-6-release-date-before-setting-their-own-2025-dates/1100-6528325/" data-ref-id="1100-6528325">reports of missed deadlines</a>. Only time will tell if GTA 6 makes it out on time, so keep checking back with GameSpot for more.</p><p>Reacting to the long wait for GTA 6, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said, "We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs." He added: "I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organization is super excited."</p><p>GTA VI has extremely big shoes to fill, as GTA V has sold more than 210 million units, propelling the entire series to 440 million copies sold. One company believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">GTA VI can sell 40 million units and drive $3 billion in revenue during its first year alone.</a></p><p>Whenever it's ready, GTA VI will be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Take-Two is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-hints-at-plans-to-support-switch-2/1100-6529308/" data-ref-id="1100-6529308">likely to bring some of its games to Switch 2</a>, but no one should expect GTA 6 to be among them.</p>

<p>There is going to be a major update coming to Balatro sometime in the future. What’s included in that update, however, is currently unknown, and that’s by design.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-07/maker-of-smash-indie-hit-balatro-talks-about-what-s-next?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODk1NTUwNCwiZXhwIjoxNzM5NTYwMzA0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUkJVTUxEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.vnpDPy2eO2srUo1cO71bFTutl-JvFojih-o2zs4niu4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, Balatro developer LocalThunk gave a small update on the next update he’s working on. </p>







<p>The update, which he calls a “1.1” update for the game will include new Jokers along with various other features. LocalThunk didn’t want to get into exactly what those features will be because of potential constraints that would put on him such as the ability to “pivot if something new doesn’t work.”</p>



<p>“I think it’s healthier for the game that I keep my cards close to my chest, then give you the best version of whatever this new content update is,” he said.</p>



<h6 id="h-listen-gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">LISTEN: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Still On Track For 2025: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>Despite not wanting to give anything away, he did reveal two changes that will come with the update. The first is a change to the “blue stake” modifier while the second is a change to the Matador Joker—Earn $8 if played hand triggers the Boss Blind ability. As far as what those changes will involve, that wasn’t said. Details on that, along with everything else players can expect, will come closer to its release.</p>



<p>The update is expected to arrive sometime this year.</p>

          <p>There are only two licensed professional sports games included in Wikipedia's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_notable_for_negative_reception">List of video games notable for negative reception</a>." Do not be fooled, however: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_2K20">WWE 2K20</a></em> and <em>eFootball 2022</em> are just the outliers, arriving so poorly crafted as to cause notable outcry and an actual change to development plans. Most licensed professional sports games come out yearly, whether fully baked, notably improved, or not, and fans who have few other options to play with their favorite intellectual property learn to make do with them.</p>
<p>Not so with fans of <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/">Football Manager</a>, a series that can be traced back in some form to 1992 that has released a game almost every year, minus one ownership shift in the early 2000s. Sports Interactive, the company behind the franchise, <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1">released a statement on Thursday</a> (in British time) that says that "following extensive internal discussions and careful consideration," <em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>is canceled. The game was "too far away from the standards you deserve," so they are focusing on the 2026 version.</p>
<h2>Trying not to make “the same bloody game every year”</h2>

</a></h2>
<p><em>Football Manager 2025&nbsp;</em>was already delayed twice and is now quite late—as we are now midway into the European football (or what Americans call soccer) season. The game was intended to be a major overhaul.</p>
<p>Miles Jacobson, head of developer Sports Interactive, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fm25-is-not-a-continuation-of-fm24-the-big-football-manager-interview">told Eurogamer last fall</a> that the 2025 version was the "first chapter in the new book of <em>Football Manager.</em>" Lots of existing modes would be tossed out, including international management and "touchline shouts," or phrases you can yell or calmly administer to your team during the matches you don't actually control. The game was moving from a proprietary engine to Unity. The team reimagined and redesigned more than 500 screens full of data. Perhaps most importantly, 2025 was the year the franchise landed the official license for the Premier League.</p>
<p>With all that, there have been a lot of scope changes. "I've de-scoped something today," Jacobson told Eurogamer in September, "that at the time of the [June] dev blog was still in scope. And we re-scoped something last week, and we up-scoped something last week—it's a very fluid process!" The reason for these changes? "It's our ambition," Jacobson said then. "I know that some people will find that difficult to believe because, 'Oh, they only work on iterations, they're making the same bloody game every year.'"</p>
