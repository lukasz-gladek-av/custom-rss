            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released three new Game Boy titles for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, and they're all part of the console's original launch lineup from way back in 1989.</p>
<p>Since Game Boy games first started making their way to the service <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-titles-are-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online">back in February last year</a>, several titles from the illustrious handheld's library have been added to the service, but these three have been specially selected to commemorate the Game Boy's 35th birthday.</p>
<p>The first is, of course, none other than&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Land</em>, an iconic (if somewhat strange)&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>platformer that features not only sidescrolling platforming, but also&nbsp;<em>R-Type</em>-style shooter stages.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-land-nintendo-switch-online-game-boy.jpg?itok=_XR2QWAT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-land-nintendo-switch-online-game-boy.jpg?itok=XEnqAVqG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm surprised&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Land&nbsp;</em>hasn't been a part of Nintendo Switch Online until now.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</em>, the followup to the original&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Land&nbsp;</em>(and the game in which we were first introduced to Wario), has been available on Nintendo Switch Online since February last year, but the first game hasn't been available on the service until now.</p>
<p>The second game will be familiar if you've ever played&nbsp;<em>Breakout</em>. It's&nbsp;<em>Alleyway</em>, a pretty unashamed&nbsp;<em>Breakout&nbsp;</em>clone co-developed by Nintendo and Intelligent Systems, the studio that would go on to develop&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>WarioWare</em>, among many others.</p>
<p>Finally, Nintendo Switch Online now plays host to&nbsp;<em>Baseball</em>, another one of the Game Boy's launch titles and a pretty modest interpretation of the great sport. Hey, we're in the early days of handheld gaming here!</p>
<p>You can check out the aforementioned games in action right here via the latest Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy trailer.</p>

<p>These games join a lineup that also includes not only games like&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Land 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-zelda-july">Capcom's <em>The&nbsp;Legend of Zelda: Oracle&nbsp;</em>games</a>, but also NES titles like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-march-games-are-kid-icarus-and-star-tropics"><em>Kid Icarus&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>StarTropics</em></a>, along with SNES games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-june-2023">like&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em></a>.</p>
<p>Picking up the extra Expansion Pack addon also grants access to a range of games from the N64, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy Advance lineups, as well as the chance to play DLC for&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>at no extra cost.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more on all things Nintendo Switch Online.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wayfinders">Wayfinder</a>, currently a free-to-play RPG developed by Airship Syndicate, is undergoing a pretty drastic change in its upcoming Echoes patch. Right now it's a live-service game with microtransactions, but soon it'll continue as a paid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with no in-game monetisation. And that's alongside promised tweaks to how progression works, too. Huh. It's often you see paid games go <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play,</a> but this is an unexpected switcheroo.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For "existing Steam Founders" Wayfinder's Echoes update will be playable on May 31st, but will officially launch on June 11th. The update itself will remove all in-game monetisation and everything previously purchasable will be earnable through play: characters, weapons, armour sets. There won't be an online requirement, either, so no need for online accounts. And Wayfinder will be priced at $24.99 - that's including all present and future early access stuff - with that price increasing once it leaves early access.</p>
<p>To bring it more inline with a paid-for RPG, Airship are revamping its "core systems". Randomised weapon drops, armour with variable stats, an easier process for collecting characters. A talent system. Four difficulty levels. A new open world area that's "three times larger than before". And more, apparently. Seems like a ploy to make it a lot more inline with your Diablos and Destinys, where you're all chasing those 'god rolls'. Like me, for instance, who wants to get this revolver in Destiny that has a mixture of two excellent perks and is willing to spend countless hours doing the same instance over and over. It is worrying.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/wayfinder-2024-roadmap.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Airship Syndicate</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All of this comes at a strained time for Airship, as they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warframe-devs-lay-off-publishing-team-no-longer-involved-with-wayfinder">parted with Digital Extremes</a> a few months ago and were transferred full ownership of the game. Not to mention that Wayfinder's reviews <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wayfinders-developers-apologise-for-rough-launch-as-it-receives-mostly-negative-reviews-on-steam">haven't gone down all that well</a> on Steam, with criticism levelled at its monetisation and bugginess.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mmo-ish-rpg-wayfinder-is-full-of-promise-but-i-just-cant-get-excited-about-it">previewed</a> Wayfinder many moons ago now, but I thought it showed some promise. I just don't think it did all that much to stand out, especially when you've lots of other games that do Destiny's schtick well. Or like, well-established <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMORPGs</a> where you'd get a similar-ish experience.</p>
<p>So perhaps, the switch from free-to-play to paid isn't all that unexpected? At the time of writing, Wayfinder sits at 18 concurrent players and this Echoes update really does feel like a last ditch effort to entice <em>anyone</em> to give it a crack. But even with big changes, I worry that most folks wouldn't want to fork out 25 hard-earned dollars on a game that's unlikely to deliver a co-op romp you can't get elsewhere.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wayfinder-upcoming-echoes-update-changes-it-into-a-premium-game-with-offline-option/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Austin-based studio Airship Syndicate (Battle Chasers: Night War, Darksiders Genesis, Ruined King: A League of Legends Story) announced a major shift for its online action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/wayfinder-qa-joe-madureira-unveils-new-mmorpg-lite-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wayfinder</a>. The upcoming Echoes update will change the once free-to-play, online-only game to a premium game with a full-fledged offline option.</p>
<p>Joe Madureira, CEO and Creative Director at Airship Syndicate, stated:</p>
<p><em>To our knowledge, this hasn’t been done before - taking an online-only game fully offline, fundamentally changing all aspects of it. We’re in uncharted territory, and it’s a big risk for Airship to make this change, but it’s one we believe in. We’re incredibly proud of the work our crew has done in such a period of time to make it happen. Our players have loved the world and characters, and with their continued support, we can keep expanding the game in the future.</em></p>
<p>Airship Syndicate President Ryan Stefanelli said:</p>
<p><em>We’ve seen a shift in the industry where players are OK paying for a premium title if it means respect for their time and wallets. It's one we prefer ourselves, frankly, and we believe it’ll make the game much easier for people to enjoy. We hope this major change will entice players to come and see what we’ve built with Wayfinder, allowing us to support it long term.</em></p>
<p>When the Echoes update goes live on May 31st for existing Steam Founders and on June 11 for everyone else on PC, the game will return to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1171690/Wayfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> Early Access with a pricing of $24.99 (expected to increase upon the launch of version 1.0). At the same time, all in-game monetization will be removed, and any items previously available through microtransactions, including characters, weapons, and armor sets, will now be earnable through gameplay.</p>
<p>The Echoes update also introduces new content to Wayfinder, including a new playable character in Grendel, a new open world area three times larger than before, six new hunts, and more.</p>
<p>As for the PlayStation version, the Echoes update will land on Sony's console later this year. When it does, PS4 support will be discontinued, and all PS4 copies will be upgraded to PS5 at no additional fee. Meanwhile, players can continue accessing Wayfinder as they previously did.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Wayfinder will be released on Xbox Series S and X before the end of the year, which is also when the studio plans to exit early access.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/animal-well-tricked-you-into-thinking-it%E2%80%99s-a-metroidvania.871458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24156522/animal-well-metroidvania-not<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="PgONdx">If there is one thing that people who make and play video games love more than video games, it’s labels. People <em>love</em> to label a game, to invent a genre, to categorize and sort and declare some kind of rudimentary ownership. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22417320/best-video-essays-youtube-history">YouTubers have built entire careers</a> around this.</p>
<p id="PnWGBs"><em>Animal Well</em> encourages this thinking. It looks like a Metroidvania — you know, the kind of game where there’s a sprawling 2D map and you run back and forth, finding locked doors and impenetrable thresholds that become trivial once you find the appropriate tchotchke to get past them. I would discourage you from thinking about it this way, though, or telling others that’s what it’s doing. It’s all a ruse. </p>
<p id="boBTUQ">I should probably clear the air here. I’ve got some history with the word “Metroidvania.” The short version? <a href="https://kotaku.com/stop-calling-games-metroidvania-1836051152">I don’t like it</a>. This is purely a semantic distaste, a strongly-held opinion about jargon and what it’s useful for. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24130852/best-metroidvania-games-play-nintendo-switch-steam-playstation-xbox-pc">Actual <em>games</em> in that genre</a>? Love ’em. </p>
<p id="YXzR2Y">Anyway, the first hint that something might be amiss with <em>Animal Well </em>is in how — if it is, in fact, a Metroidvania — it refuses to work like any Metroidvania you’ve seen before. High platforms are not reached by a double jump. Every item has multiple functions. Nothing is particularly obvious. </p>
<p id="29eBrJ">What <em>Animal Well</em> really is, is a collection of puzzles. Puzzles upon puzzles. Puzzles that are very apparent and puzzles that you can walk by dozens of times and not even realize they are present. Its items are puzzles, and using them allows you to try your hand at even more elaborate puzzles. It challenges you to understand the world in front of you, and then it complicates that understanding. </p>
<p id="b2o3YU">I’ve had a couple conversations with friends who don’t love Metroidvanias and love <em>Animal Well</em>, and I’d say this is why. Every screen offers something new to figure out, maybe even more than one. And while “puzzle game” is not the sexiest or particularly evocative genre descriptor, it <em>is</em> describing something that human beings instinctually like to do. We love to solve puzzles. Solving them is how we learn to do most things in life; it’s a skill so fundamental we forget how enmeshed it is in our perception of the world. </p>
<p id="UQ15zE">I think most people who spend any amount of time with <em>Animal Well</em> realizes this on some level. Even if we disagree on the words we use to describe <em>Animal Well</em>, it’s immediately apparent that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24151337/animal-well-review-pc-ps5-switch"><em>figuring out what it is</em></a> is the primary pleasure found in playing it, and whatever labels we affix to it are secondary. </p>
<p id="DHeFde">Let me leave you with one final suggestion, then: Ignore what I’ve just said and don’t call it a puzzle game. Call it a mystery. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nier-veterans-possibly-working-on-new-project-in-series/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nier-veterans-possibly-working-on-new-project-in-series/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>As first reported and translated <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/yosuke-saito-working-on-new-project-with-yoko-taro-and-keiichi-okabe">by Gematsu</a>, Yosuke Saito and other Nier veterans are working on a new project that might be a new installment in the classic series. </p>



<p>The information surfaced after Saito spoke with Famitsu about working on two different projects.</p>



<p>Nier series director Yoko Taro and composer Keiichi Okabe will reportedly join one of Saito’s anticipated projects. Saito simply said that “it might be Nier, it might not be Nier,” reportedly with a laugh. </p>



<p>This only leaves fans to speculate, though it does sound promising, especially with the return of other familiar creatives.</p>



<p>Still, rumors of another Nier game have circulated for some time, so it’s unclear if Nier will actually get another game. Since Saito teases a separate idea for “something that does not yet exist” in Gematsu’s same report, that distinction has Nier fans hopeful. </p>



<p>Saito did add that they will have more to say, “in the not-too-distant future.” The announcement would certainly warrant a larger and wider event.</p>



<p>The recent installment in the series, Nier Reincarnation, launched in 2021 to deeply mixed reviews. However, it was a very different experience as a mobile game, and the IP still has plenty of fans.</p>



<p>Nier publisher Square Enix recently confirmed that its games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/square-enix-new-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be multiplatform</a> moving forward, dividing some fans. It will also reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/square-enix-says-it-will-lose-140-million-on-canceled-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lose $140 million</a> on canceled games.</p>

                <p>Sony has announced that will share its "long-term vision" for the company overall this month, and this includes an update from the PlayStation division. The company said in a <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/a-message-from-hiroki-totoki-a-new-era-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">release</a> that Sony Interactive Entertainment, which is the PlayStation unit of Sony Group, has an "essential role" to play in Sony Group's future.</p><p>The fact that Sony said it will have an update to share this month has led some to believe there could be another PlayStation Showcase in the works. But that is only an unsubstantiated rumor for now. Another possibility is that Sony might conduct a business-focused briefing of some capacity where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-names-two-playstation-ceos-says-ps5-growth-is-likely-over/1100-6523439/" data-ref-id="1100-6523439">SIE's new joint CEOs</a> could discuss their plans for the future.</p><p>Hiroki Totoki was the interim CEO of SIE after the departure of Jim Ryan earlier this year. Totoki is now becoming chairman of SIE going forward, with Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino reporting to him when they become joint CEOs of SIE on June 1.</p><p>In his new role, Nishino has a wide purview and will oversee "technology, products, services, and platform experience." He is also responsible for "third-party publisher and developer relations and commercial operations, including sales and marketing of hardware, services, and peripherals."</p><p>Hulst, meanwhile, is overseeing and leading the SIE Studios business, including PlayStation Studios, Bungie, and Sony's video game TV show and movie division, PlayStation Productions. "He will be responsible for the development, publishing, and business operations of SIE's first-party content as well as IP expansion opportunities through PlayStation Productions," Totoki said.</p><p>As part of Sony's earnings briefing this week, the company reported that PS5 sales have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-names-two-playstation-ceos-says-ps5-growth-is-likely-over/1100-6523439/" data-ref-id="1100-6523439">passed 59 million units, though the platform's growth period may finally be coming to an end</a>. It's also been <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1790464370742349967" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by one analyst</a> that PS5 sales over the past three months were five times higher than Xbox Series X|S sales over the same period.</p><p>In other PlayStation news, Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">Helldivers 2 sold 12 million copies right out of the gate to become PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, dethroning the record set by God of War Ragnarok.</p>

<p>The appointment marks Karademir's return to the studio, having ended a seven-year stint at IO back in 2014.</p>
<p>In the years since, he has been working at Unity, where he held the role of vice president for core engineering, graphics, operations and productions, and RealityOS, where he most recently worked as general manager and chief product officer.</p>

<p>"IOI has always been known for innovation, great gameplay, and immersive worlds, and I am determined to elevate our standards even further."</p>
<p>Abrak added: "Ulas is a tremendous addition to our team, bringing with him invaluable experience, knowledge, and leadership.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/sneg-is-bringing-the-classic-entries-in-close-combat-at-warlords-series-to-steam/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=sneg-is-bringing-the-classic-entries-in-close-combat-at-warlords-series-to-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="261" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">SNEG has announced that they’re bringing the classic games from the <em>Close Combat</em> and <em>Warlords</em> series to Steam. They were (mostly) available already on GOG, but now they’re joining their other SNEG-revived brethren. Also, they’ve <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2916160/Close_Combat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the move today</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false"><em>Close Combat</em> is a series of real-time strategy games that started off in 1996 and were created by Atomic Games. This was about the time that the RTS genre really started taking hold with 1995’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/long-overdue-ea-finally-releases-some-of-its-classic-games-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Command &amp; Conquer</a></em> and <em>Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness</em>. However, the <em>Close Combat </em>games differentiate themselves through their more realistic gameplay.</p> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="true">The five getting re-released all take place during World War 2. It’s all land-based squad tactics with both armor and infantry. What really made the games unique for the time period was the psychological simulation which has your soldiers responding to the horrors of war. Squads could become fatigued and worn out and soldiers incapacitated by trauma.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Close Combat - Announcement Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTAyWNLlqfU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">The five games are <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2916160/Close_Combat/">Close Combat</a></em>, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2916170/Close_Combat_2_A_Bridge_Too_Far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Close Combat 2: A Bridge Too Far</a></em>, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2916180/Close_Combat_3_The_Russian_Front/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Close Combat 3: The Russian Front</a></em>, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2916190/Close_Combat_4_The_Battle_of_the_Bulge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Close Combat 4: The Battle of the Bulge</a></em>, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2916200/Close_Combat_5_Invasion_Normandy__Utah_Beach_to_Cherbourg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Close Combat 5: Invasion: Normandy – Utah Beach to Cherbourg</a></em>. The series has continued right up to 2019</p>
 <p data-characters="536" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true">As I mentioned, most of these are already <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/close_combat_2_a_bridge_too_far" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available on GOG</a>, but the original <em>Close Combat </em>seems to be an exception for some reason. Looking at the executable, it looks like a special wrapper may have been needed for the first game. They were all Windows titles, rather than DOS, with some of them even published by Microsoft. As such, they tend to be more difficult to get running on modern operating systems, though SNEG says they “made every effort to eliminate technical issues, with changes based on fan and community feedback.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Warlords I + II - Announcement Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9nhIJikUriA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true">The other three games are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2916210/Warlords_I__II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Warlords I + II</em> </a>and the separately available <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2916220/Warlords_III_Darklords_Rising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warlords III: Darklords Rising</a></em>. As a departure from <em>Close Combat</em>, these are turn-based games set in Medieval fantasy worlds. In this way, they aren’t too dissimilar from the later <em>Heroes of Might and Magic</em> series.</p>
 <p data-characters="170" data-current-count="170" data-injectable="false">The <em>Warlords </em>games are also currently <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warlords_i_ii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available on GOG</a>, but are making their debut on Steam. Since they are DOS games rather than Windows, they run with a DOSbox wrapper.</p> <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="490" data-injectable="true">I have no personal attachment to any of these games, but I’m always a fan of preservation. The early days of home computers, in particular, are at risk of being forgotten as they become harder to run on modern hardware. It’s great to have companies like SNEG working to make them available wherever possible.</p>
 <p data-characters="46" data-current-count="46" data-injectable="false">All of the above are available on Steam today.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft is utilising AI to assist with identifying harmful content and ensure the gaming community is kept safe when playing games online.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/14/xbox-transparency-report-may-2024/">blog post for its Xbox Transparency Report</a>, the company reiterated its "advancements in promoting player safety" and "commitment to transparency", as well as its "progressive approach to leveraging AI".
</p>
<p>
There are two specific ways in which AI is being used: auto labelling and image pattern matching.
</p>
<figure><div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span> </p>
</div><figcaption>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The former uses AI to identify harmful words or phrases from player reports, allowing community moderators to quickly sort out false reports and focus on the most critical instances.
</p>
<p>
The latter similarly uses image matching techniques to rapidly identify and remove harmful and toxic imagery.
</p>
<p>
The use of AI here follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-releases-new-voice-reporting-feature-to-combat-toxic-in-game-voice-chat">last year's introduction of a new voice reporting feature</a>, which allows Xbox players to capture video clips of in-game voice chat to submit to the Xbox Safety Team for review.

</p>
<p>
Xbox says it has captured 138k voice records since the launch of the feature. When those reports resulted in an enforcement strike, 98 percent of players showed improved behaviour and did not receive further enforcements.
</p>
<p>
Last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-adds-enforcement-strike-system-to-improve-safety-and-transparency">Xbox introduced an enforcement strike system</a>, matching bad behaviour with a strike of appropriate severity. Since launch, 88 percent of players receiving a strike did not receive further enforcement. 

</p>
<p>
It's a positive step, then, with AI reducing the human cost of reviewing toxic content.
</p>
<p>
Still, toxicity and misogyny remain widespread in gaming voice chat. A post from Twitch streamer Taylor Morgan went viral this week due to the harmful abuse she received while playing a match of Riot's Valorant (beware of the language in the clip below).
</p>
<p>
"The suspensions are not enough. Nothing will ever stop these men from acting this way until hardware bans go into play. They should never be able to play the game again," she posted on X, formerly Twitter.
</p>
<p>
In a follow-up post she revealed she received a penalty for leaving the game early.
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I have never made a more desperate plea that what I am about to say right now. <a href="https://twitter.com/riotgames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@riotgames</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/RiotSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RiotSupport</a> I need you guys to fucking do something. I am an incredibly strong person and I have been streaming for a very, very long time. But absolutely nothing prepares you for someone… <a href="https://t.co/Gr77uBsBrT">pic.twitter.com/Gr77uBsBrT</a></p>— TaylorMorgan (@TaylorMorganS_) <a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorMorganS_/status/1789927866865787228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>

<p>
Examples like this highlight there is still a long way to go to improve the safety of playing games online. And while Microsoft's use of AI is seemingly positive, it's worth remembering the company last year laid off its entire AI ethics and society team as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reportedly-set-to-cut-thousands-of-jobs">part of 10,000 job losses across the company</a> (as highlighted at the time by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/13/23638823/microsoft-ethics-society-team-responsible-ai-layoffs">The Verge</a>). Its Office of Responsible AI does remain, however, which published its <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/21/microsofts-framework-for-building-ai-systems-responsibly/">Responsible AI Standard guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Microsoft is certainly pushing the benefits of AI. In November last year it announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-offering-generative-ai-tools-to-its-studios">"multi-year co-development partnership" with Inworld AI</a> to provide Xbox's studios with AI tools such as a design copilot and character runtime engine.

</p>
<p>
Such generative AI tools have, previously, been met with "reverence and rage", as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-games-industrys-response-to-ai-reverence-and-rage">Eurogamer reported from last year's GDC event</a>.

</p>
<p>
More recently, a report by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">Unity claimed that 62 percent of studios are already utilising AI</a>, with animation the top usage.

<p>Sometimes, as was the case with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-global-release-timings">city-builder&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em></a>, certain regions will need to wait until the day after most other regions to play games thanks to the way time zones work, but that's not the case with Ninja Theory's upcoming sequel.</p>
<p>Instead,&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2&nbsp;</em>starts off with an early release on the West Coast of the USA and ends with an evening launch in New Zealand, so everyone will get to check out Senua's latest journey on May 21st.</p>

But the gap is clearly widening. If that 2:1 ratio is accurate, Xbox Series X and S has sold around 29 million units at best, given PS5 has sold 59.3 million so far. For comparison’s sake, Xbox One ended up selling 58 million.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-to-bring-hades-ii-into-dungeons-dragons.871404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/how-to-bring-hades-ii-into-dungeons-dragons<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the Early Access release of Supergiant Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades-ii"><em>Hades II</em></a>, players are going wild. For something <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hades-ii-preview-godlike-first-impression">still in development</a>, the game is packed with compelling content. Furthermore, since most enjoyers of TTRPGs like to take ideas from media as story fuel for their <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> campaign, there's a high chance some players out there want to bring some <em>Hades II</em> to their tables.</p>
<p>In that spirit, allow us to DMs some helpful tips for bringing some of Zagreus and Melinoe's antics into the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG.</p>
<p>First, there are two restrictions I am putting on myself with this list. First and foremost, I will do my best to keep my suggestions to rules and systems found in the official material provided by Wizards of the Coast. This is not meant to discount third-party or homebrew material, but more a matter of discipline. Feasibly, any of these rules should be easy to implement into any campaign with minimal effect on game balance or tone.</p>
<p>Second, I am focusing on translating certain gameplay systems and mechanics to the table, not aesthetic, genre, or narrative elements. If you want a Greek-themed <em>D&amp;D</em> setting with thematically appropriate material, the<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-and-magic-gathering-worlds-collide-in-mythic-odysseys-of-theros">Mythic Odysseys of Theros</a></em> supplement is a great place to start.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-ii-weapon-hall.jpg?itok=q5a-B-1C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-ii-weapon-hall.jpg?itok=Ej7aGh8H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How in the world do we make these work?</figcaption></figure><h2>Bringing <em>Hades II</em> To <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> – Boons and Weapon Aspects</h2>
<p>In <em>Hades II</em>, every time you clear a room of enemies you obtain a random boon from one of the Greek gods. These boons can drastically change your playstyle as you progress. In addition, there are Daedalus Hammers, which can improve your weapons.</p>
<p>How do you bring some of that power and spontaneity to a game like <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>? A TTRPG whose experience can range from one-shot dungeon crawls with close friends to year-long epic campaigns full of drama and explosive setpieces?</p>
<p>First, we'll cover Boons since it's the easiest. In Chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>, there is a section on alternative rewards to treasure and magic items. That section discusses Supernatural Gifts, which come in two forms. Blessings permanently boost a character's stats or give them the benefits of a certain magic item. Charms give players access to more potent abilities but vanish permanently once used several times.</p>
<p>Both of these gifts can be used for Boons. Blessings let players feel stronger than others thanks to going that extra mile, and charms provide a bit of tactical thinking on their end. The section even mentions such gifts can be given to adventurers by the gods either in advance of a perilous quest or as a reward for doing something so spectacular they take notice. Something spectacular as, say Melinoe's dire quest to defeat Chronos, the Titan of Time?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-supernatural-blessings-excerpt.jpg?itok=OgB2m-j2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-supernatural-blessings-excerpt.jpg?itok=BwshrnaO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tired: Giving out magic items. Wired: Giving out Blessings.</figcaption></figure><p>Weapon upgrades on the other hand are trickier. Part of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons'</em> core design is discarding older gear for better ones as you level up and progress through greater challenges. In many respects, you are encouraged not to get attached to a weapon because a +1 weapon may be around the corner.</p>
<p>Once again, Chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> provides an answer. Under Sentient Magic Items, there is a section discussing Artifacts. In the world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, Artifacts are powerful magic items from the ancient past. They are designed to be packed full of unimaginable power well beyond what is readily available.</p>
<p>It also has some handy charts on how to make your own. In addition to having a blacksmith turn your Fighter's regular weapon into a magical +1 weapon, roll once on the Minor Beneficial Properties chart and give it the corresponding benefit. Now that magical sword can cast Dimension Door or protect the wielder from being frighened or charmed. Now it has more personality.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-ii-chaos-challenge-choices.jpg?itok=ci7MLcZt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-ii-chaos-challenge-choices.jpg?itok=XbHtW3Fq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The risks are tricky, but the rewards are so tempting.</figcaption></figure><h2>Bringing <em>Hades II</em> To <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> – Chaos Challenges, Heat Levels, and Training Mirror</h2>
<p>In <em>Hades II</em>, Melinoe can accept challenges from the primordial Chaos. These challenges force the player to fight temporarily with a penalty or restriction. The trade-off is once this challenge is completed, the player gets a major benefit.</p>
<p>A more extreme version of this idea can be found with <em>Hades'</em> Heat Levels. These are optional increases to difficulty. More enemies appear. Enemies have more health. You have to clear every battle within a certain time limit. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Since both Hades and Hades II are roguelikes, a genre all about learning and adapting to increasingly daunting challenges and rotating benefits, these systems work wonderfully. If you die, you can take fewer risks on your next run.</p>
<p>They're also the trickiest idea to bring to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. For the most part, the DM dictates the difficulty of a campaign, and character death is due to either bad luck or poor player decisions.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a way to bring these challenges to a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> campaign. Introduce these challenges as an optional gimmick of a dungeon the players need to traverse or a scripted section. Keep the timetables short. The duration of a dungeon crawl at least; an in-game day at most.</p>

As part of the challenge, the player is given a magic item they must bring to the end of the dungeon. Roll on the respective charts and play out how the detriments hinder the party. Use minor effects if you want to inconvenience the group or major effects for something spicier.</p>
<p>For something more active, you can impose penalties on PCs using unique character resources. Inflicting psychic damage on a character if they cast spells above a certain level or using a barbarian rage. If you impose a time limit, introduce force damage after several turns passes in a battle.</p>
<p>But what do you roll for damage? In Chapter 5 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> under Traps, there is a handy chart for adjudicating traps. use the Damage Severity By Level Chart as you see fit. These challenges are essentially activating a trap when certain criteria are met after all.</p>

There are two different avenues for this. One is consulting the Treasure Tables in Chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> and rolling on it for some extra treasure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can consult <em>Xanathar's Guide To Everything's</em> section on rewarding magic items to the party. Go to the Magic Item Ingredients chart, found under Downtime Activities, consult the chart to determine the rarity of an item based on the CR – increased by 1-3 based on the severity of the challenges – then hand the participating players a fitting magic item from the book. For more guidance, consult the section in <em>Xanathar's Guide To Everything</em> on rewarding magic items.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is Zagreus' Mirror of Night. In <em>Hades</em>, this was used to give the player ongoing persistent bonuses they can take on each run.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-zagreus-in-front-of-mirror.jpg?itok=eLB-7Wof 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-zagreus-in-front-of-mirror.jpg?itok=Itfhe5bD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>With enough gold, I should be able to get a bit of an edge.</figcaption></figure><p>This may be the easiest thing to implement into <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. In chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>, the Other Rewards section mentions Training. A player can receive training from an esteemed mentor or master wizard, gaining additional benefits. This ranges from having Inspiration every day for a few days, gaining new skill proficiencies or just getting a new Feat. As for cost, Chapter 6 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> covers training to gain additional levels under Downtime Activities. But the training there can take weeks or months, and leveling up is a much bigger reward than the ones listed. Alternatively, <em>Xanathar's Guide To Everything</em> mentions a mentor would cost 25 gold per workweek.</p>
<p>Have a player invest some gold, have the mentor be a mystical magic mirror, let them build up to a reward over one or two weeks, and you're good to go.</p>
<p>Naturally, these are suggestions for bringing <em>Hades II</em> into <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. House rules and custom material is always an option depending on your table. But for those just starting in this hobby, these suggestions above may help give you that extra creative spark.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/saints-row-2022-million-copies/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to a past employee at Volition, Saints Row (2022) sold around 1.7 million units total before the developer was shut down.</p>



<p>Spotted by Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/bogorad222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@bogorad222</a>, Saints Row’s community and social media manager on LinkedIn revealed that the game sold 1.7 million units.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to Embracer Groups 3rd quarter earnings call for 2022, Saints Row cost more than $100 million to develop. The game originally released for $70, which would have seen the studio gain a profit of 19 million dollars, however, soon after the games release, the sale price of the game was decreased likely in part to its poor reception. </p>



<p>The game received mixed to average reviews by critics and was slammed online by players due to the games mass amount of bugs and quantity. In November 2022, Embracer Group stated that&nbsp;Saints Row&nbsp;“did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized”, but financially “performed in line with management expectations in the quarter.”</p>



<p>In August 2023, one year on from the games release, Embracer Group closed down Volition and moved its Red Faction and Saints Row IP to Plaion.</p>

<p data-characters="260" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>XDefiant</em> is the latest FPS targeting Call of Duty’s crown, but if you don’t own a PC and haven’t upgraded to a next-gen console, will you be able to get in on the action? Unfortunately, for Xbox One and PS4 owners, the news isn’t good. </p> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">After multiple delays, we’re finally on the cusp of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-release-date-and-countdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>XDefiant</em>‘s release</a>, so it’s no surprise that gamers are figuring out when the game releases, and on what platforms it will launch. It should come as no surprise that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/will-xdefiant-be-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> players and next-gen console owners will get to try it, but what about those who haven’t upgraded to a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S yet? </p> <figure data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Last-gen console owners are getting left behind. Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-is-xdefiant-on-ps4" data-injectable="false">Is <em>XDefiant</em> on PS4?</h2> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false"><strong>No, <em>XDefiant</em> is not going to release on PlayStation 4. </strong>The game has not been developed for last-gen consoles, so if you haven’t upgraded to a PS5 yet, the unfortunate news is that you’re out of luck. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Is <em>XDefiant</em> on Xbox One?</h2> <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"><strong>Unfortunately, <em>XDefiant</em> will not be on the Xbox One either. </strong>The game will be released on the Xbox Series X|S, but Ubisoft has decided not to use the last-gen consoles. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Why is <em>XDefiant </em>not on PS4 or Xbox One?</h2> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">When asked by a fan on X, formerly Twitter, Ubisoft explained that the development team wanted “to keep a consistent standard of quality for the game,” which led them to focus on current-gen systems only. </p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">Because current-gen consoles are more powerful than their predecessors, the developer can do much more in terms of graphic fidelity and frames-per-second, which the PS4 and Xbox One couldn’t handle. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Could <em>XDefiant</em> release on PS4 and Xbox One in the future?</h2> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true">Look, we’ll never say never, but it seems very unlikely that this will happen. In my opinion, if you were doing a last-gen console release, you would need to do it at launch, as the longer you wait, the less worthwhile it is. If Ubisoft were to release a version for PS4 and Xbox One in a years time, would it really be worth the effort when most people have already upgraded? It seems unlikely. </p>
 <p data-characters="99" data-current-count="99" data-injectable="false">Instead, the team will likely focus on improving the game and adding new maps, modes, and weapons. </p>

Artwork revealing characters from the under-wraps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-feudal-japan-title-emerges-from-the-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has been posted online, ahead of this evening's big reveal trailer going live. 
</p>
<p>
You'll be able to watch the Assassin's Creed Shadows reveal trailer at 5pm UK time tonight - but ahead of that, artwork which looks set to be used on the game's box cover has appeared on the internet. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft appears to have removed several instances of this image from social media already, inadvertantly confirming its authenticity, but other copies still remain. For those looking to go in completely unspoiled, look away now.

<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows looks to feature two protagonists: a female ninja and a male samurai. 
</p>
<p>
Artwork of the pair shows them posing with a hatchet on a rope and, as you'd expect, a samurai sword. Is one of them wearing the series' iconic hidden blade weapon? It's hard to say for certain. 
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1crz4f3/assassins_creed_shadows_official_game_artwork/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Official Game Artwork</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lift_Off_/">u/Lift_Off_</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
The imagery, posted to reddit, lines up with previously-leaked details of the game - specifically that one of its main characters would be the historical figure of Yasuke, a man of African origin who travelled to Japan and later served the Japanese lord Oda Nobunaga. 
</p>
<p>
This also places the game quite firmly in time - around 1582.
</p>
<p>
As for the female ninja, leaks suggest her name is Naoe, who will have a more traditional Assassin's Creed origin story that pushes her to join the Assassins faction and battle the evil-doer Templars.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed has featured dual protagonists before, of course, such as siblings Jacob and Evie Frye in the Victorian London-set Syndicate - the first major project from Shadows' own talented Ubisoft Quebec team. 
</p>
<p>
The Ancient Egypt-set Origins also had you play as main character Bayek's wife Aya for certain sections - with the suggestion from the game's developers that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-report-into-ubisoft-culture-highlights-reluctance-to-let-you-play-as-a-woman-in-assassins-creed">these had once been intended to be more integral</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft will officially detail Assassin's Creed Shadows later today - join us then for our first look at the game's trailer and plenty of analysis of what's in store.

NieR series producer Yosuke Saito has joined NieR series director Yoko Taro on a new project, along with series composer Keiichi Okabe.
</p>
<p>
Saito revealed the news in an interview with former Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi in the latest Famitsu magazine (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/yosuke-saito-working-on-new-project-with-yoko-taro-and-keiichi-okabe">Gematsu</a>).
</p>
<p>
"I've been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now," said Saito. "I'll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. [Laughs] That's about all I can say for now."

<p>

"I'm doing various things with the idea of creating something that does not yet exist," he continued. "I can't devote my time to that fully, so most of it has been left to the staff, but it's turning into something quite interesting. I'm looking forward to the day we can announce it."
</p>
<p>
The NieR series - published by Square Enix - has proven incredibly popular, specifically the PlatinumGames developed NieR: Automata. In 2021, a remaster of NieR Replicant was released.
</p>
<p>
It's unknown what's next for the NieR series, though some fans believe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yoko-taro-teases-nier-3">Taro was teasing a new game in the series earlier this year</a>. Is that what Saito and Okabe are also working on? We'll have to wait and see.

</p>
<p>
Still, if you're looking for something new to play in a similar vein, there's always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade</a>. Taro and Stellar Blade creative director Hyung-tae Kim discussed their games together, as both share similar themes and gameplay.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-is-superior-to-nier-automata-says-yoko-taro">Taro even said Stellar Blade is superior to NieR: Automata</a> (he's wrong).

            <p>The upcoming Mortal Kombat film sequel has secured itself a release date.</p>
<p>New Line Cinema's Mortal Kombat 2 will arrive in cinemas on 24th October, 2025, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/mortal-kombat-2-companion-weapons-release-dates-1235916567/">Deadline</a> reports. It will also play in Imax.</p>
<p>In response to this news, the film's producer Todd Garner said this somewhat far-off release date was not simply to do with how long the project is in post production. "There are numerous factors that come into play such as competitive releases, the studio's slate, marketing focus, audience availability, etc, etc, as well as availability of Imax screens," <a href="https://twitter.com/Todd_Garner/status/1790545184004116651">Garner</a> wrote on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Mortal Kombat 2 serves as a sequel to 2021's Mortal Kombat, and is again directed by Simon McQuoid. Joining the cast for the upcoming release is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/karl-urban-reportedly-in-line-to-play-johnny-cage-in-mortal-kombat-2">The Boys and Lord of the Rings star Karl Urban</a>, who will play Johnny Cage.</p>
<p>In addition to Urban, Adeline Rudolph - who previously starred in Netflix's The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-adds-another-sabrina-star-this-time-as-kitana">will play Princess Kitana</a>. Meanwhile, fellow Sabrina alum Tati Gabrielle is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharteds-tati-gabrielle-set-to-play-jade-in-mortal-kombat-2-film">Kitana's bodyguard, Jade</a>.</p>
<p>This is not Gabrielle's first foray into the video game adaptation scene. She also starred as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-the-uncharted-film-is-the-treasure-ive-been-looking-for">Jo Braddock in 2022's Uncharted film adaptation</a>, and has been cast in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">The Last of Us' second season as Nora</a>, "a military medic struggling to come to terms with the sins of her past".</p>
<p>Eurogamer's former editor in chief Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't overly keen on the first Mortal Kombat film when it came out a few years ago, calling it "boring".</p>
<p>"There's just enough low-rent entertainment to prevent the Mortal Kombat movie from being a complete disaster, but it's tough to recommend when it costs £16 to rent online. A tenner straight to Blu-ray feels like a better fit," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/save-your-gbp16-the-mortal-kombat-movie-is-boring">Eurogamer's Mortal Kombat movie review</a>.</p>

            <p>
Sony shipped five times more PlayStation 5 consoles than Microsoft managed with Xbox Series X/S in the last quarter.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad, who's done some digging after Sony's latest financial report released yesterday.
</p>
<p>
The PS5 shipped 4.5m units in the last quarter, meaning Sony has now sold over 59m PS5 consoles in total. This is roughly equivalent to PS4 at the same point in its lifecycle.

<p>

Microsoft, meanwhile, has seen a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-boosts-microsoft-earnings-but-xbox-console-sales-plummet">31 percent year-on-year drop in Xbox console sales</a>, although specific figures have not been released.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, PS5 sales dropped by 29 percent year-on-year, although console sales are up for the year as a whole.
</p>
<p>
Together it's a sign of slowing console sales across the industry, although overall sales for PlayStation consoles are significantly higher than Xbox Series X/S sales. That's matched by Sony's seeming inability to sell more consoles than the previous generation.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>5. The PlayStation 5 shipped 4.5 million units in the last quarter. According to our estimates, this is almost 5x more than the Xbox Series X|S shipped in the same period. </p><p>(This is a bonus one for the console warriors + my rent is due)</p></div>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1790464370742349967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Again, diversifying income is proving integral. It's why Sony is pushing PC sales, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">Helldivers 2 now the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time</a>. The company hasn't, however, disclosed the latest PlayStation Plus subscription numbers.

</p>
<p>
It's also why Sony is using the metric of play time on PlayStation as an indicator of success. That's increased 15 percent year-on-year, reaching its second highest level ever (the highest since the pandemic).
</p>
<p>
Also announced yesterday were the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">replacements for former PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan</a>. PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst will be in charge of game development, while Hideaki Nishino will oversee hardware.

</p>
<p>
Sales in Sony's games segment increased by 17 percent year-on-year, while operating income increased by 40.2bn yen year-on-year to a 290.2bn yen total.
</p>
<p>
Still, earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">Sony laid off 900 staff</a>, including the closure of its London Studio.

            <p>
The Sims 4 is preparing for a summer of slinky, sexy free and paid updates according to its newly revealed roadmap, starting with a refreshed batch of swimsuits today.
</p>
<p>
There's not a huge amount to report on the free swimsuit refresh - they now come in more colours and varieties to better suit a range of body shapes and sizes - but EA notes it's also updated a few other summer-adjacent clothing items, including the tankini and wrap top, to usher in its season of sauciness.
</p>
<p>
As per the publisher's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OndDCMYcsnk">new roadmap reveal video</a>, the next few steamy months will bring two free "stylish" updates, two destination kits, and one "flirtatious" expansion pack. Specifics are scarce, but we can make a few educated guesses based on EA's clues. The free updates, for instance, are accompanied by the text, "Polished my look for a sultry splash" - suggesting that, alongside today's swimsuit update, we might also be getting further enhancements to nails.

<p>
And as for those destination kits, the visuals accompanying this part of the video - as well as the text, "A little nectar led to a provocative plunge" - seem to be pointing toward kits themed around bars and public pools. The "flirtatious" expansion, however, remains largely mysterious, with the on-screen text - "Made waves, but we WooHoo'd anyway" - revealing little.
</p>
<p>
While we wait for EA to show its hand, Sims 4 players on PC can <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store/addons/the-sims-4-blooming-rooms-kit">head over to the publisher's official store</a> and pick up the plant-themed Blooming Rooms Kit - which normally costs £4.99 - for free until 31st May. This one's all about adding a bit of greenery to your Sims' lives, because what better way to prepare for the sexy summer ahead than with excessive foliage everywhere?

            <p>
American Truck Simulator's determined trundle across the picturesque highways and byways of the United States continues this week with the launch of its latest paid expansion - and 15th explorable state - Nebraska, on 16th May.
</p>
<p>
Nebraska was revealed to be in the works last August, bringing American Truck Simulator's current tally of confirmed explorable states up to 17. Since its release in 2016, the trucking sim has expanded to include California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The arrival of Nebraska this week brings us up to 15 states, and developer SCS has already announced Arkansas and Missouri are on the way.
</p>
<p>
Staying with Nebraska, though, SCS describes it thusly: "Located in the heart of the Great Plains, Nebraska's vast and diverse landscape consists of prairies, rolling hills, and the crucial Platte River. While hauling cargo through the Cornhusker State along historic routes, you will have many opportunities to witness iconic landmarks and truly immerse yourself in the state's spirit, from its pioneer history to the modern energy of cities full of ever-growing industries."

<p>
SCS' digital reimagining of Nebraska includes the cities of Lincoln and Omaha, as well as some of the state's most recognisable landmarks and attractions - with the likes of Scotts Bluff National Monument, McConaughy Lake and the Kingsley Hydroplant, the Archway, and Carhenge so far confirmed. Expect the Nebraska expansion to cost around £9.99 when it launches <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2543810/American_Truck_Simulator__Nebraska/">via Steam</a> on 16th May.
</p>
<p>
In related news, SCS has just released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/270880/view/4167595132252267296?l=english">American Truck Simulator's expansive 1.50 update</a> after a short public beta. This introduces enhanced rendering features - including temporal anti-aliasing support and optimised light computation - as well as a substantial UI overhaul (featuring a flatter, more minimalist design), and the third phase of its ongoing California rework, intended to bring its ageing original state inline with more recent additions.
</p>
<p>
The latter introduces two new cities - San Jose and Modesto - as well as complete reworks of San Francisco, Oakland, Stockton, Santa Cruz, Huron, and Fresno. Major routes - including CA-1, US-101, I-5, CA-99, and US-395 - have also seen major overhauls, as has Yosemite National Park. All this, alongside new lane assistant and tooltips options, is available now.

The next Dead by Daylight chapter will be based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons, with Vecna as the new Killer.
</p>
<p>
News of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-teases-dark-fantasy-era-with-dungeons-dragons-themed-chapter">new chapter was teased last week</a>, but in its anniversary stream today Behaviour unveiled further details.
</p>
<p>
Alongside the new chapter, a new 2v8 mode was announced, as well as an update on spin-off titles, and a tease of a new Castlevania chapter coming later this year.
</p>
<p>
Here's everything shown at the Dead by Daylight eighth anniversary stream.

<h2>Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Castlevania chapters</h2>

<p>
Dungeons &amp; Dragons will form the basis for the next chapter of Dead by Daylight, available now in the Public Test Build and launching properly on 3rd June.
</p>
<p>
As usual, the chapter will include a new Killer, a new Survivor, and a new map.
</p>
<p>
While this may seem like a move away from the horror franchises Dead by Daylight is known for, Dungeons &amp; Dragons provides plenty of dark fantasy and will introduce magic for the first time.
</p>
<p>
The new Killer will be Vecna, a powerful lich and major antagonist in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. He's voiced by Matthew Mercer (Critical Role, Ganondorf in Tears of the Kingdom, Vincent in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth).
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/PR_Screenshot_1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Behaviour</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Vecna will have four spells for players to use. Fly will allow him to traverse maps quickly; with Mage Hand Vecna can hold palettes and lift them back up; Flight of the Damned is a necromancer projectile; and Dispelling Sphere will detect and dispell magical effects.
</p>
<p>
In a further nod to D&amp;D, when Vecna is a Killer special treasure chests will be found around maps. Once opened, a d20 dice roll will take effect to determine what players find: either regular items, or magical items to counter Vecna's spells. Rolling a critical success (20) will provide players with Vecna's cursed items to teleport from lockers or turn invisible, though these items will also injure players. However, rolling a critical fail (1) will result in a nasty surprise - perhaps a mimic chest?
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/PR_Screenshot_4.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Behaviour</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The new Survivor is a two-in-one bard and original creation by Behaviour. Players can choose either an elf female called Aestri Yazar, or a human male called Baermar Uraz. Further, a new map called Forgotten Ruins will include a dungeon, obviously, and plenty of D&amp;D references as part of its extensive underground component.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the stream, Behaviour also teased another new chapter coming to the game this year, based on Konami's Castlevania series. This was just a tease, though further information is expected on 6th August. Presumably, Dracula will be a Killer with one of the Belmonts as a Survivor? Either way, vampires will be a welcome addition to the game.
</p>
<h2>A new 2v8 party game mode</h2>

<p>
A new 2v8 mode will be added to Dead by Daylight by the end of summer. Rather than the usual 1v4 Killer and Survivor matches, this mode will have two Killers working together against eight Survivors.
</p>
<p>
As you may expect, this will fundamentally change how the game is played, so should be considered more of a party mode than ultra competitive. There also won't be hooks, instead downed Survivors will be sent to a cage.
</p>
<p>
Perks will also be removed; instead players choose from specific classes aimed at encouraging teamwork. Killers will also have team powers to promote coordination, though only five will be available: Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Huntress, Nurse. Maps will also be based on these Killers.
</p>
<p>
The mode will be introduced temporarily at first.
</p>
<p>What's more, Behaviour is introducing cross-progression later this summer, meaning players can continue with progress no matter which platform they play on.</p>

<h2>Dead by Daylight spin-offs incoming</h2>

<p>
Behaviour provided updates on three spin-offs, one of which is available immediately for free.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, a new gameplay trailer for The Casting of Frank Stone was shown. This is a narrative horror game from Supermassive (The Quarry, Until Dawn), featuring the usual environmental puzzles, quick-time events, and the ability to shape the script through choices. It's set in 1980 and follows a group of friends creating a film, who uncover the secrets of an infamous serial killer in the process.
</p>
<p>
While no release date has been given, the developer is still aiming for a 2024 release. It will be around five to seven hours long, depending on choices made.

<p>
Secondly, Midwinter Entertainment is working on a new PvE game known as Project T. Players will take the role of trespassers whisked away to the realm of the Entity. It will be a third-person session-based game with guns, trucks, and talismans used against new enemies the Thrall.
</p>
<p>
It remains very early in development, but the Project T Insider Programme is launching to allow for fan input and closed playtests (on PC).

<p>
Lastly, Behaviour is today launching What The Fog, a new two-person co-op roguelite game available for free on PC for those with a Behaviour account for a limited time (and $4.99 afterwards).
</p>
<p>
Like Jumanji, Survivors Claudette and Dwight are sucked into a cursed boardgame to battle against swarms of monsters with 3D gameplay and a cute, chibi art style. And if a player dies, they switch to support view to unleash spells until revived by their partner.

            <p>Bethesda is known for its glitchy releases. In fact, in the run up to Amazon's TV adaptation of Fallout, showrunner Graham Wagner even reminisced about a bug he came across while playing The Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall, stating that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-the-fallout-tv-show-wont-have-bugs-at-least-not-in-season-one">adding 'glitches' into a then-hypothetical second season</a> of the show was "definitely on [his] mind as a concept".</p>
<p>But, even the studio's less recent-releases are still faced with the age-old Bethesda bug problem, and patches haven't been able to sort them. In fact, it seems they have sometimes made them worse</p>
<p>Case in point, we have Fallout 4, which is currently having a resurgence thanks to Amazon's show. A few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-upgrade-launches-to-mixed-response-with-broken-mods-and-bugged-xbox-quality-mode">Bethesda finally released its long-awaited 'next-gen' patch</a> that included the promise of native applications for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, while those on higher-spec PCs would get widescreen and ultra-widescreen support. However, this patch was met with a mixed response, as it broke mods and only one of the game's two graphical options appeared to be working on Xbox Series X and S.</p>

<p>Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-latest-graphical-update-is-here">Bethesda released another patch for Fallout 4</a> across platforms. This, the studio said, would allow players to "manage your control over the game's graphic fidelity or performance" and address a number of other issues players have been experiencing. And while some of these niggles have been fixed, others have not. Oh, and mods are shot again.</p>
<p>A quick scan over on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/377160/discussions/">Steam's Fallout 4 forums</a> show a number of unimpressed players asking Bethesda to please stop updating the game. In a post titled "How bad is the update?", which was started soon after the initial next-gen patch went live but has been constantly added to since, players are reporting mods have once again been broken and other issues haven't been fixed.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSFalloutL/comments/1cre6uj/another_update_has_hit_the_fallout_4_modding/">Another update has hit the Fallout 4 modding community</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Thewaffleofoz/">u/Thewaffleofoz</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSFalloutL/">TrueSFalloutL</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Also as pointed out, most of yesterday's update didn't actually target issues on PC, with consoles being the main focus. Another thread said the Fallout 4 team is still to fix bugs they believe should be "mandatory".</p>
<p>"What with black screen after launch on monitors 144 hz and above? What with weapon debris problem on rtx cards? Those two problems are known from couple years and still isn't official fixed from bethesda. This is a joke," it reads.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Bethesda for comment on how it plans to address mods and other issues in the future.</p> <div>

<p>This current spate of 'next-gen' grievances aside, Fallout 4 has proved popular ever since the TV series released in April. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">topped the PS4 download charts last month</a>, while Fallout generally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-has-more-than-doubled-its-player-counts-on-steam">"more than doubled its concurrent players" on Steam</a> over the weekend of 14th April.</p>

        <p>Decision contains "significant factual errors", Epic Games says.</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>    <div>



            <p>
Fortnite maker Epic Games has said it will fight back against a €1.1m (£968k) fine levied by the Dutch consumer regulator, which has accused the company of "unfair commercial practices aimed at children". 
</p>
<p>
An <a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/acm-imposes-fine-epic-unfair-commercial-practices-aimed-children-fortnite-game">investigation by The Netherlands' Authority for Consumers and Markets</a> (ACM) claims Epic Games "exploited the vulnerabilities of children" through "various design choices for its offerings in its Item Shop". 
</p>
<p>
This included, the ACM says, using ads aimed at encouraging kids to make purchases with slogans such as "get it now", and "misleading" sale countdown timers that gave the impression certain items would be removed from sale before they ultimately were. The ACM states Fortnite therefore violated "requirements of professional diligence".

<p>
In Epic Games' response, shared with Eurogamer, the company says the ACM's decision contains "significant factual errors about how Fortnite and the Item Shop operate" and that "the ACM is mandating changes that would result in a poor experience for players", which it will now appeal. 
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, however, Epic Games says it will make a change so Dutch players under the age of 18 "will not be able to see or purchase items that are in the shop for less than 48 hours, beginning 24th May".
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the ACM's decision, Epic Games noted it had already made a number of recent Item Shop changes, and had recently said it was adding a date to each item in the Item Shop so players could see how long it would be on sale for. This will be visible as of 24th May, and is designed to remove some of the vagueness around how long certain items might be available.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games' statement on the matter goes on to highlight the other child safety features available in the game, such as Cabined Accounts with limited features and no purchase options by default for users under 16, plus other parental controls and spending limits. 
</p>
<p>
While hefty, the ACM's fine is nothing compared to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-maker-epic-games-slapped-by-520m-ftc-fine">eye-opening $520m (£427m) penalty slapped down by the US Federal Trade Commission against Epic Games</a> in December 2022. That similarly related to so-called "dark patterns" meant to encourage spending. Epic Games did not contest that fine, and acknowledged at the time that its game had evolved considerably over time.

            <p>Supergiant has discussed its first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2</a> post-launch patch, which will be released at some point later this month.</p>
<p>While the team delivered smaller hotfixes periodically since Hades 2 was released in early access, this patch will include some more meaty changes, including ones focused on resource gathering and getting around.</p>

</figure>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/">Steam</a>, Supergiant said it didn't want gathering resources to "feel too frustrating" for players, so this will be addressed in some fashion in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The developer also said it has ideas for how to improve Melinoë's dash and sprint. "It's important to us that Melinoë [has] her own distinct style, and for players to be able to navigate her battles and other interactions in a nimble, responsive, expressive way," Supergiant elaborated, perhaps acknowledging at the moment she can feel very similar to control as Zagreus from the first Hades.</p>
<p>We can expect more details on Hades 2's first patch - which will also include other yet-to-be-specified refinements - closer to release. We will keep you posted as soon as we hear more.</p>
<p>After this first patch, the studio said it will probably have "at least" one more patch in the pipeline. Then, it will shift its focus onto its first 'Major Update' for Hades 2. This is still some months away, but Supergiant said it will include new features and content. Also, the team doesn't plan on implementing <em>too </em>many balance changes just yet.</p>
<p>"We really appreciate you playing and taking the time to share your impressions with us," Supergiant closed. "Death to Chronos!"</p>

</figure>
<p>Our Chris Donlan has been hands-on with Supergiant's first-ever sequel, and while it "may feel very comfortable and familiar", he believes Hades 2's "best weapon remains the power of surprise".</p>
<p>"Hades 2 often strikes me as more of the same at the moment, but - two things again! - one: maybe I'm not yet dialled in sufficiently to see the deeper, secret point of the whole thing. And, two: we're right at the start of this journey and it would not surprise me if the game I'm playing today, a game I already love, is not the game I'm playing a year from now," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Eurogamer's Hades 2 review</a>. "And that's quite a thought."</p>

The long-rumoured The Legend of Zelda Lego set based on The Great Deku Tree will feature two different designs, according to the latest leaks.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.bricktastic.nl/lego/lego-77092-zelda-the-great-deku-tree-verschijnt-vermoedelijk-in-september-2024-update/">Bricktastic</a> reports (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-lego-zelda-great-deku-tree-will-be-released-in-september-for-e300-its-claimed/">VGC</a>), the set will be released in September and allow builders to choose between an Ocarina of Time design with green leaves, or a Breath of the Wild design with pink leaves.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the set will come with four minifigures representing Classic Link, Classic Young Link, Breath of the Wild Link and Breath of the Wild Zelda, and will also include shield and ocarina pieces.

<p>

The set will comprise 2500 bricks with a retail price of €299.99.
</p>
<p>
These details are in-line with previous rumours from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/great-deku-tree-lego-set-will-be-released-later-this-year-leaker-suggests">earlier this year</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-lego-zelda-set-seemingly-confirmed-by-copyright-removals">last year</a>.


</p>
<p>
Could we see an official announcement soon? After all, Tears of the Kingdom celebrates its one year anniversary this week.
</p>
<p>
The Zelda set would follow other Nintendo sets, like the previously released Mario sets and Animal Crossing sets. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-super-mario-kart-sets-will-be-ready-to-race-in-2025">Lego Super Mario Kart set</a> will launch next year, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kk-slider-coming-to-new-lego-animal-crossing-sets">K.K.

            <p>
Capcom's Monster Hunter series has now sold over 100m copies.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter: World, released in 2018, is the main driver of this, with sales now totalling over 25m units globally. The game has consecutively sold over 1m units each year since release and is Capcom's highest selling game ever.
</p>
<p>
The company attributes this new series high to the announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-first-look-at-monster-hunter-wilds-coming-in-2025">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> at last year's The Game Awards.

According to Capcom's list of <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html">Platinum Titles</a>, Monster Hunter: World is the company's highest selling game, followed by Monster Hunter Rise.

However, the Resident Evil series remains its best-selling overall. The 2019 Resident Evil 2 remake is the top game in that series with 13.6m units (as of 31st December 2023).
