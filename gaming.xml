			<p>A new version of the amazing Final Fantasy IX Moguri Mod is now available for download, introducing additional visual improvements to the classic JRPG by Square Enix.</p>
<p>The new&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/moguri-mod/install?authuser=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9.0 version</a>, which can be installed via the latest version of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FAlbeoris%2FMemoria%2Freleases%2Fdownload%2Fv2024.08.05%2FMemoria.Patcher.exe&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw2zeEMg28ddZxLiY7sTdlXp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memoria patcher</a>, introduces significant visual improvements to field backgrounds, a full rework of battle backgrounds, a redrawing of many layer edges, improvements for most lights, animated textures upscale on monster and NPCs, some reworked FMVs and many visual bug fixes. In addition, by installing Memoria, it is possible to enjoy a lot of other improvements, such as 60FPS and more in and out of combat, PSX battle interface, new combat modes, including a dynamic mode that makes battles way faster and slightly more challenging, and much more.</p>
<p>Playing Final Fantasy IX on PC with the Moguri Mod is definitely the way to go to enjoy one of the best entries in the series at its best, although this could change in the future with the rumored remake that is said to be in development. According to multiple reports, the remake is going to be e<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/">xtremely faithful to the original</a>, with a lower budget compared to the Final Fantasy VII remake project.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy IX is now available on all current gaming platforms, including smart devices. The Moguri Mod, however, is only compatible with the PC version.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/norland-roadmap-through-november-promises-barons-usurpers-and-walls-oh-my.950943/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/norland-roadmap-august-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Long Jaunt and publisher Hooded Horse have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Norland&nbsp;</em>roadmap for the first part of the game's Early Access release, and there's plenty on the way to keep you occupied.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1857090/view/4363510595761745133" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the game's Steam page</a>,&nbsp;<em>Norland&nbsp;</em>developer Long Jaunt says it's planning to release roadmaps for&nbsp;<em>Norland</em> "every three months", and each roadmap will highlight significant features making their way to the game in the months following the roadmap's release.</p>
<p>For now, the developer says it's working on&nbsp;<em>Norland</em>'s family tree interface and Steam achievements, although the former is "a very complex task", so it could be a while before it appears in the game. In the meantime, several other major features are planned for the next few months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/norland-roadmap-november-2024.jpg?itok=R7_dZjK5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/norland-roadmap-november-2024.jpg?itok=nOOpbcCX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Norland&nbsp;</em>has plenty of new features coming your way in the next few months.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, this month, Long Jaunt is adding lords' graves and the ability to command your troops to attack archers to the game, as well as general optimizations to make your time with&nbsp;<em>Norland&nbsp;</em>just that little bit smoother.</p>
<p>Optimizations continue throughout September, which is also when ranged towers will be added to the game, along with unique guests for your settlement. Finally, in October, you're getting some bigger features in the form of barons and usurpers, as well as city walls and gates to keep your settlement safe.</p>
<p>All of this will happen alongside "bug fixing and quick support throughout the entire period", as well as more stuff that Long Jaunt and Hooded Horse will "reveal soon".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Norland</em>, it's a medieval colony sim with shades of games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rimworld">RimWorld</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings&nbsp;</em>(both of which are, incidentally, mentioned on&nbsp;<em>Norland</em>'s Steam page).</p>
<p>It's your job to steer your colony through political intrigue, war, and other dilemmas, all while tending to the basic needs of your citizens. After <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/norland-delayed-kingdom-sim-manor-lords-publisher">being delayed</a>, the game was released in Early Access back in July, and the devs say the current plan is to keep the game there for "around a year", although this may change depending on "how the design develops with player feedback".</p>
<p><em>Norland&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1857090/Norland/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.</p>

Soh’s upgrade screen is presented as a circle, split up into five segments, and aside from two of them requiring a prerequisite skill to access, you can pick and choose as you wish. This allows you to easily form a preferential playstyle, although some upgrades stand out better than others. Here’s what you need to know.</p><h2 id="h137"><a id=""></a><strong>When are Upgrades for Soh Unlocked?</strong></h2><p><strong>You’ll be able to start upgrading Soh after defeating Batsu</strong>, the fifth boss (arguably sixth if we consider Enri Village) and eleventh stage. You’re likely to recognize this monster as the one who hit you with a cheap shot during a prologue cutscene and took some of your powers. On top of unlocking the Spearman villager and enacting some sweet revenge, Soh’s mask will also appear on the upgrade screen after you’ve slain Batsu. You can distribute any Musubi to unlock Soh’s upgrades from this point on.</p><h2 id="h138"><a id=""></a><strong>The Best Archery Skills to Upgrade</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="16000ae9cf10e1da9d252924b668e339" data-recommend-id="image://16000ae9cf10e1da9d252924b668e339" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some swirly fighty action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some swirly fighty action." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="16000ae9cf10e1da9d252924b668e339" data-recommend-id="image://16000ae9cf10e1da9d252924b668e339" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some swirly fighty action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Whether they’re flying or simply very dangerous, some enemies are a pain to fight with only melee attacks. Leaving them to Archers and eventually other ranged units isn’t always the most dependable solution either. This is what makes Soh’s archery abilities a must-have for anyone playing <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Archery - Allows Soh to use a bow. This is a prerequisite skill to unlock the others, and gaining access to the bow alone results in a monumental advantage.</li><li>Butterfly Shot - Charging the bow before firing will teleport Soh to an enemy that’s hit. Aside from being a great way to follow up on flying enemies, the latter stages feature targets in normally inaccessible areas. Equipping this ability will let you access elusive chests or even some defilement in need of purifying.</li><li>Pinnacle Shot - <strong>Charging the bow before firing will fire an arrow that deals heavy damage to an enemy’s health and resist gauge.</strong> Between the strong knockback on smaller enemies and the heavy damage it inflicts, this is one of my favorite abilities. I highly recommend giving this a chance if you’re having trouble stunning flying or more tanky enemies.</li></ul><h2 id="h139"><a id=""></a><strong>The Best Command Screen Skills to Upgrade</strong></h2><p>I wouldn’t blame you for thinking the Command Screen is a bit rudimentary. Individually managing the villagers can be a chore and a menu just for moving them feels quite bare-bones. Thankfully, most of the abilities in the Command Screen section add some lovely features worth investing in. Two of them strangely don’t have anything to do with the Command Screen, although they’re still both crucial additions to any play style.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Assemble - Every villager can be summoned to the same location. This is purely a quality-of-life upgrade, but it’s very worth it when you’re directing more and more villagers.</li><li>Yoshiro’s Guide - Yoshiro can be ordered to stop or continue moving from the command screen. By default, you can only give this order when you’re physically next to Yoshiro. With how much you can be scrambling during the day, this is a wonderful upgrade for efficiency’s sake.</li><li>Tsuba Guard Slot Increase - <strong>Unlocks an extra Tsuba Guard Slot. An additional slot can be unlocked at a higher Musubi cost.</strong> Being able to juggle up to three Tsuba Guard abilities is a game-changer due to how varied they all are.</li><li>Mazo Talisman Slot Increase - <strong>Unlocks an extra Mazo Talisman Slot. Two more slots can be unlocked at higher Musubi costs.</strong> There are more than 70 of these Talismans to discover, and their buffs cover many different aspects. I suggest upgrading this all the way so you can rock with five talismans.</li></ul><h2 id="h140"><a id=""></a><strong>The Best Dance Attack Skills to Upgrade</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="7b9de012917a49ab0c61c630724f95eb" data-recommend-id="image://7b9de012917a49ab0c61c630724f95eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Picking new forms for Soh." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Picking new forms for Soh." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7b9de012917a49ab0c61c630724f95eb" data-recommend-id="image://7b9de012917a49ab0c61c630724f95eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Picking new forms for Soh." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>The bottom two segments of Soh’s upgrade screen cover two different fighting styles—Oka Dance and Shiden Dance.</strong> The former is the default style you’ve been using since the start that lets you freely move during attacks, while the latter trades off movement for more power. Only one style can be used at a time.<br></p><p>It ultimately comes down to preference when comparing Oka Dance vs Shiden Dance. I enjoyed using the free-flowing nature of the default style throughout my first run in <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, but Shiden is pretty impressive against bosses. The upgrades for both styles simply add a resist gauge-depleting combo ender whenever you hold down the Dance Attack button. This comes down to preference again, although the following felt the most useful:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Oka Form 2 - Soh only has one upward-swinging slash that can hit flying enemies, and this tacks on resist gauge damage too. Shell out the meager five Musubi for this if you hate dealing with Seethe in the air as much as I do.</li><li>Oka Form 4 - While it takes the longest string of attacks to activate and it’s the most chaotic to control, this is another favorite ability of mine. Its long reach makes it ideal for hitting multiple enemies and avoiding attacks.</li><li>Shiden Form 1 - Unlike the Oka Forms, every Shiden Form ability ends in the same attack. I suggest the very first form ability so that you can bring out this powerful move as soon as possible.</li></ul><h2 id="h141"><a id=""></a><strong>The Best of Soh’s Other Abilities to Upgrade</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="24622834e9b10ab65136e939665da28a" data-recommend-id="image://24622834e9b10ab65136e939665da28a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dancy dancy action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dancy dancy action." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="24622834e9b10ab65136e939665da28a" data-recommend-id="image://24622834e9b10ab65136e939665da28a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dancy dancy action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Last, but certainly not least, is what’s considered Soh’s “Other Abilities.” A much better way to describe these is Combat Abilities, since that’s what they all revolve around.

Or, you can take the route I intend to by creating a CQB M4A1 with a shortened barrel for maneuverability! </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/five-things-we-noticed-in-echoes-of-wisdom-traversing-hyrule-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This past week,&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>fans around the world were treated to a closer look at the world of Hyrule with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-hyrule"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> traversing&nbsp;Hyrule trailer</a>. Not only does this appear to be the largest Hyrule we've ever seen in a top-down&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game, but it's filled with small details and characters that bring the game to life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's pretty clear that <i>Echoes of Wisdom</i>&nbsp;is taking inspiration from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild">Breath of the Wild</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, from its vast, open world to its Echoes, Bind, and Reverse Bond abilities. Reviewing the trailer ahead of the&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>&nbsp;release date on September 26, here are five things we noticed that we're excited for.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>1. Bridging the Worlds of 2D and 3D <em>Zelda</em> Games</h2>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>is a series that has been brilliantly translated both to 2D and 3D platforms, from top-down perspectives exploring caves to massive three-dimensional Gleeok battles. Many of the elements of a traditional&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>&nbsp;(combat, exploration, etc.) translate well whether you're approaching them in 2D or 3D, but there are some features that seem solely attributed to one or the other, and this is where&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>can bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Creatures like the Zora are typically only seen in 3D <i>Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</i>games, with some exceptions like <em>Oracle of Ages</em>. The Gerudo also predominantly exist in the 3D&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>universe, with the exception of&nbsp;<em>Four Swords Adventure.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Horse transportation, meanwhile, is a predominantly 3D&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>feature. Horses definitely appear and are even ridable in games like&nbsp;<em>Oracle of Ages</em>, but&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>traversing Hyrule trailer showed us, for the first time, what free-roaming horse riding will be like in a top-down perspective.</p>
<p>This reinforces the possibility that the&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>&nbsp;Hyrule is going to be among the largest we've seen in a 2D&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<h2>2. Locations Abound: The Expanse of Hyrule&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Not only does the&nbsp;<em>Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>traversing Hyrule trailer show us Princess Zelda riding a horse across the vast world, it also shows a variety of unlockable warp points. We don't have the full map as a reference yet, but the small section of the map revealed in the trailer with multiple warp points visible is a hint at just how gigantic these regions are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just from what we've seen so far, we know the following locations include:</p>
<ul><li>Hyrule Castle</li>
<li>Castle Town&nbsp;</li>
<li>Kakariko Village&nbsp;</li>
<li>Gerudo Desert / Oasis</li>
<li>Jabul Waters and its two Zora villages&nbsp;</li>
<li>Eldin Volcano</li>
<li>Goron City&nbsp;</li>
<li>Faron Wetlands</li>
</ul><p>Plus, in one of the side quests that the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>trailer reveals, "Finding the Flying Plant,"&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>mentions other never-before-seen locations like Suthron Village and Suthron Forest. It's possible there will be many Hylian villages sprawled across the world for players to visit during their journey.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>3. Weather &amp; Smoothies: The RPG Elements of <em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em></h2>
<p>Recent&nbsp;<em>Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>games have leaned more heavily into RPG elements, and&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>looks to be&nbsp;no exception. Both&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and <i>Tears of the Kingdom</i>&nbsp;required proper clothing or elixirs in order to tolerate the different weather systems across Hyrule, and that appears to carry over to this title. Though not explicitly revealed, we do see Zelda herself sweating in the desert, looking to be on the brink of heat exhaustion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also know that a traditional Gerudo outfit is available for her to wear, as well as many other clothing items shown in the&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>traversing Hyrule trailer. This Hyrule will have rivers, oceans, deserts, snowy mountaintops, and so much more, so it would make sense to have appropriate clothing for each biome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also know that Business Scrubs will sell smoothies with different effects, like resistance to electricity, fire, and other elements. It wouldn't be wild speculation to think that smoothies could offer some protection from the natural elements while adventuring.</p>

<h2>4. Echoes of Wisdom: Accessorize, Accessorize, Accessorize&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In addition to clothing and weapons, Zelda has access to an assortment of accessories that grant different abilities. We've only been shown a few so far, but the ones we know about include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Zora's Flippers</strong>: Helps you swim faster</li>
<li><strong>Zora Scale</strong>: Helps you dive deeper&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Frog Ring</strong>: Helps you jump higher&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Heart Pin</strong>: Makes hearts appear more often</li>
</ul><p>It appears like you can only equip one accessory at a time, so prioritizing which accessory to have for each challenge will be critical for success.</p>

<h2>5. Reverse Bond &amp; Its Game-Breaking Possibilities&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In addition to creating Echoes, Bind &amp; Reverse Bond are new abilities that can help Zelda traverse the landscape, defeat enemies, and solve puzzles.&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li><strong>Echoes:&nbsp;</strong>Cast a recreation of an enemy or object&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Bind:&nbsp;</strong>Bind Zelda to an&nbsp;object and it will follow her movements. This can be used to unearth buried treasure chests or reposition enemies. You can use Bind on Echoes.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Bond:&nbsp;</strong>Zelda will go where the object goes. Players can cast an Echo, use Bind, and use Reverse Bond, allowing them to climb walls with a spider or fly with a seagull.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>These abilities feel very similar to Ultrahand in&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>&nbsp;in the way that players can use them in infinitely creative and game-breaking ways. Bind and Reverse Bond allow you to tackle challenges in myriad ways, ensuring no two playthroughs will be exactly alike.</p>
<p>As for whoever the final boss may be, I look forward to seeing the different strategies in defeating them as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>&nbsp;will arrive on September 26 with plenty of other mysteries to explore and solve, like what exactly is on the other side of those&nbsp;rifts. <em>Legend of Zelda</em> fans just have a little bit longer to wait before they can uncover for themselves just how vast this latest iteration of Hyrule is.</p>

No one still living embodies Hollywood quite like Cruise, and if anyone was going to jump down from the stadium rafters for a hokey publicity stunt it was going to be the guy who regularly mugs the camera outside theaters to keep the dream of the double-feature matinee alive.  </p><p>After tumbling down from the Stade de France catwalk and taking the stage to officiate the passing of the Olympic torch between Paris and L.A., Cruise put the Olympic flag on a motorcycle and took off into the night. A pre-filmed segment then followed showing Cruise arriving by plane into the U.S. before eventually being spotted by a transformed Hollywood hills sign. The closing ceremony wrapped up with a concert on Venice Beach featuring the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. “Can’t Stop” and “Drop It Like It’s Hot” were played, both of which are now 20 years old. </p><p>Prior to the hand-off ceremony, Cruise was spotted at other matches throughout the Summer Olympics, most noticeably the women’s soccer final where, sporting big, dark aviators, he enthusiastically joined the thunderous applause when Mallory Swanson cemented the U.S. national team’s victory with a beautiful goal in the 57th minute. It was Cruise who got the applause last night, however, with an outpouring of appreciation for his rollercoaster ride to becoming the last major movie star in the world. </p><p>The 2024 Summer Olympics themselves felt at points like an unusual return to the days of everyone tuning into and reacting to the same blockbuster movie, TV show, or sporting event, the type of thing Cruise now seems to have made it his life’s mission to preserve. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I don’t consider myself an achievement hunter. I see the appeal, and I’m excited to watch one of those videos on YouTube of someone achieving one of the rarest trophies in a game, but I don’t want to put in the work myself.

<figure><figcaption>Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure>



<p>Seriously, I’m right there with you. I want to get my hands on Black Myth: Wukong! But if you’re looking to track down and unlock all achievements in Black Myth: Wukong, you must wait until August 20 to play the game.</p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong launches simultaneously on PC and PlayStation 5, but sadly, there’s still no word about the Xbox Series X|S release date. It’s coming; the studio just doesn’t know when.</p>



<hr>



<p>To help you unlock achievements, it’s nice knowing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-open-world-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game is mostly linear</a> so that you won’t have to run far and wide. What do you think? Would Black Myth: Wukong be better as an open-world game or a linear one?</p>

                <p>You can't keep a good slasher IP down for long, as the Halloween film series will be returning in the form of two new games. These new projects--one of which is being developed in Unreal Engine 5--will be made with input from Halloween's original director John Carpenter, and both of them are being produced at Boss Team, the studio behind the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/evil-dead-the-game-review-somewhat-groovy/1900-6417881/" data-ref-id="1900-6417881">Evil Dead: The Video Game</a>.</p><p>"As a huge gamer myself, I'm thrilled to help bring Michael Myers to life again in this game, and my hope is to scare you silly," Carpenter said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halloween-unreal-engine-5-john-carpenter-boss-team-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, adding that he'll be "intimately involved" with the development of the games. Beyond that, Boss Studios is teasing that players will be able to "relive" moments from the film and play as classic characters.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The 20 Best Games Of 2024 (So Far)</p>
      </div>
<p>Classic horror film franchises have been the source material behind several asymmetrical horror games as of late, with notable examples being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/friday-the-13th-the-game-review/1900-6416692/" data-ref-id="1900-6416692">Friday the 13th</a>, Evil Dead, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/" data-ref-id="1900-6418102">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a>. Halloween's first video game was released in 1983 for Atari systems, and since then, the film franchise's iconic slasher Michael Myers has appeared as a DLC character in games like Dead by Daylight and Call of Duty: Ghosts.</p><p>The two Halloween games don't have a release date yet, and development is said to still be in the early stages. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-carpenter-still-wants-to-direct-a-dead-space-movie-cant-stop-playing-fallout-76/1100-6508208/" data-ref-id="1100-6508208">noted gamer John Carpenter</a> is also involved in another video game project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/toxic-commando-is-a-new-horror-shooter-from-the-mind-of-john-carpenter/1100-6514976/" data-ref-id="1100-6514976">Toxic Commando</a>, a team-based shooter set in an original world created by the famous writer and director.</p>

<p>According to a new report <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halloween-unreal-engine-5-john-carpenter-boss-team-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by IGN</a>, Boss Team Games is working on two new titles based on the classic Halloween 1978 film.</p>



<p>One of the games will feature Unreal Engine 5 development and direct input from the original film’s iconic director, John Carpenter. </p>



<p>In IGN’s report, Carpenter says that “as a huge gamer myself, I’m thrilled to help bring Michael Myers to life again in this game, and my hope is to scare you silly.”</p>



<p>Fans my recognize Boss Team Games as the publisher behind Evil Dead: The Game. Saber Interactive announced the game would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/evil-dead-content-stopped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end its content cycle</a> in September 2023.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Boss Team Games’ title in the works with Unreal Engine 5 is still “in early development.” Today’s new report also reveals that players will “relive moments from the film and play as classic characters.” IGN’s report did not offer details on the second game.</p>



<p>Boss Team Games will develop both titles based on the beloved IP alongside Compass International Pictures and Further Front. </p>



<p>Halloween 1978 remains a legendary horror film, and among horror games, Michael Myers did show up in Dead by Daylight. However, that chapter first appeared nearly a decade ago in 2016 as the very first paid DLC.</p>



<p>Most recently, Blumhouse Productions delivered a new trilogy of Halloween films that ignored canon after the original movie.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/exploring-12-sided-studios-jasper-william-cartwright-on-empowering-creators</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exploring-12-sided-studios-jasper-william-cartwright-on-empowering-creators-creative-flexibility.950862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/exploring-12-sided-studios-jasper-william-cartwright-on-empowering-creators<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://12sidedstudios.com/">12 Sided Studios</a> is a new UK-based production studio founded by Jasper William Cartwright, who fans of Actual Plays and TTRPG adjacent content like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6ff64e2-0570-485e-860b-402771d3faf6" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-chat-dimension-20-burrows-end-generational-trauma-and-environmental">Dimension 20</a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9a9913f-42e9-4189-bbde-08061c01a7e8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/matthew-mercer-interview">Critical Role</a>, and 3 Black Halflings would be more than familiar with. This new studio plans to be "the go-to team for production support of promotional, creative shoots, films, and events while also making Actual Play, YouTube, and Twitch content."</p>
<p>Last week we had the chance to sit down with Cartwright to talk more about how 12 Sided Studios came to be, what this could mean for those making nerdy content in the UK, and what this means for current and future productions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our entire ethos and idea is that we want to make high-end nerdy, sci-fi, fantasy content across multiple different platforms"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea behind the creation of 12 Sided Studios came from Cartwright and Chad Pytel, Co-Founder and Executive Producer, around a year ago, but for Cartwright, the desire to become a director has been something he's been thinking about for around 15 years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wouldn't say I'm a control freak, but I like to bring people in who are better at me in a specific thing to do it"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's this desire to have a creative vision, and then work with a talented network of creators to take his vision and "go away and make [his] ideas even better."</p>
<p>As Cartwright and Pytel had been discussing the possibility of creating 12 Sided Studio Cartwright had to admit that it wasn't just a matter of who and where, but also when.</p>

<p>"It came at a time when my own 'brand'," Cartwright explained with raised quotation fingers "which for an English person I find it so horrible trying to promote myself, but where I've started to get a bit of a following and found that especially within the TTRPG industry the doors are starting to open. It felt like a perfect time to bring in a little more structure."</p>
<h2>Creating High-Quality Content Where There's An Audience</h2>
<p>In discussing the important aspects of 12 Sided Studios Cartwright explained "we're trying to bridge the gap between more traditional media, because a lot of us at the studio have experience with the traditional media setup, and bridging the gap into the online creator space."</p>
<p>Not only are they looking to create that gap but another aim is to be flexible in a day and age where IP can transcend a variety of media types. An easy example Cartwright was able to give was of Critical Role's <em>Legends of Vox Machina</em>, that is about to launch it's third season with an adaptation of Critical Role Campaign 2 already on the way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/legends-of-vox-machina-s3-opening-screenshot.jpg?itok=QP-LOvRQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/legends-of-vox-machina-s3-opening-screenshot.jpg?itok=Yx2moJKG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Legends of Vox Machina is an animated retelling of Critical Role's first campaign, available on Amazon Prime</figcaption></figure><p>Cartwright lamented the way that high-quality content not understood by traditional media doesn't get the attention it deserves. "There's no reason that traditional media shouldn't be looking at this space for things like TV and Film."</p>
<p>"When traditional media is looking at a book a lot of the shows and people that we're talking to right now have a bigger following and more of an audience, a more dedicated audience, than maybe that book which has already got a five-movie deal"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The reaction to our announcement and our behind the scenes conversations has been so overwhelmingly positive where we think maybe the sky's the limit here?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"That's where I see 12 Sided Studio being a player in the space," he continued "We see a creator producing the highest quality stories. We want to make sure that they are seen by the big players and make sure that when we make content that the big players can see it and go 'Oh, I can already see how we can turn that into a TV series or a Video Game.'"</p>
<p>In the early days of 12 Sided Studios they don't want to overspecify in any one area but Cartwright acknowledges "as the years roll on we'll get more focused naturally because time and resources are finite."</p>
<h2>Continued Projects And Collaborating With Creators</h2>
<p>Two shows that Cartwright was already producing, 3 Black Halflings and the Rotating Heroes Podcast, will be folded underneath the 12 Sided Studios banner but that's not all that 12 Sided Studios is working on.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/banner-image-for-three-black-halflings.jpg?itok=WdQSbHiN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/banner-image-for-three-black-halflings.jpg?itok=l45dUpaw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"Consistency is key with any kind of content that you put out, but the main reason and benefit of this is that we can improve the content itself." Cartwright explained that with the backing of 12 Sided Studios he was hoping to offer up more for viewers such as creating better value for money via their Patreon in the form of guest appearances, such as a visit to Worldcon later this year, and behind the scenes and other on-screen content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We have some pretty big collaborations upcoming with some well known brands in the TTRPG space"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Cartwright and I spoke he did tease that there were projects that they were working on with a variety of talent that fans of the Actual Play space would be familiar with, as well as a "show that uses all of the dice."</p>
<p>For the different creators that 12 Sided Studios are working with they're also looking to add more shows to the "12 Sided Studios Family." Cartwright explained that with the expertise that he and the other members of 12 Sided Studios have they're able to add more structure and help those who might be at a growth limit on their own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/12-sided-studios-team.jpg?itok=WJPJOGlN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/12-sided-studios-team.jpg?itok=VDn50jgQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The 12 Sided Studios Team; Jasper William Cartwright, Chad Pytel, and Jess Jewell</figcaption></figure><p>An extremely wholesome part of our conversation came from discussing how Cartwright wants to "democratize the creative space and give the keys to the creator" and how sharing knowledge and working together on projects all just ends up creating something bigger and better than they could have created individually.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I haven't had a conversation yet where I've thought, oh actually we can't do that"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cartwright wanted to make sure everyone knew that "if there is anyone out there who is looking for any kind of work, whether it be solely creative, design, production, start to finish branding and marketing we can do it all. I've been talking to some really really amazing people but I'm sure there are so many people I've neglected to reach out to and talk to and unfortunately there's only so many hours in the day."</p>
<h2>Dode, The Mascot Of 12 Sided Studio</h2>
<p>The announcement of 12 Sided Studios came with a <a href="https://x.com/12SidedStudio/status/1816837154091278441">short video on Twitter of a D12 bouncing across a table</a> before triumphantly leaping into the air, sword and shield in hand. Introduced as Dode their mascot I asked about his creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're trying to rep all of the other dice, we have a show we're pitching out that uses all the dice. Even the d4 are going to get repped"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cartwright remaked the creation of Dode was a very funny story. Talking with their designer they had corporate designs and late on a Saturday night Cartwright received a text simple saying "Hey, what if we had a lil guy?"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/12-sided-studios-dode-announcement-trailer.jpg?itok=sq3waqV6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/12-sided-studios-dode-announcement-trailer.jpg?itok=A309_6b0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While small I've been informed that Dode is in fact a CR 2 Barbarian</figcaption></figure><p>Not sure of the idea Cartwright rejected the idea believing that "[12 Sided Studio] needs to be taken somewhat seriously". Shortly after a he was shown an early sketch and he immediately thought "Oh my god, it's perfect! There was no doubt in my mind that this is it."</p>
<p>"Dode represents so well who we are as a company. He's a little bit silly, he's adorable but also I just think it showcases what we do and who we are."</p>
<p>We continued to joke about the number of d20 based logos out in the Actual Play space and that with Dode it sets 12 Sided Studios across. Famously being the damage dice for Barbarians in Dungeons &amp; Dragons Cartwright even explained "That's the big damage die, we like that one. That's also part of the reason why we canonically decided that he is a Barbarian."</p>
<p>Cartwright joked that "if anyone wants to make a Dode stat sheet that they can, he's a barbarian. Probably CR 2, maybe, he's pretty small but he's scrappy and has got a lot of hit points."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/24216389/psvr2-pc-adapter-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The biggest problem with Sony’s PSVR 2 virtual reality headset <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183482/psvr-2-regret">is the dearth of games</a>. I’d hoped Sony’s PC adapter would change that. The chance to play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22167726/half-life-alyx-valve-vr-game-of-the-year-2020"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a>, the best VR game made yet, seemed like reason enough for existing owners to justify <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D92XQL22?tag=theverge02-20">the $60 adapter purchase</a>. </p><p>But I can’t currently recommend Sony’s PC adapter. If I had purchased it with my own money, rather than borrowing one from Sony, I’d have asked for a refund long before now.</p><p>It’s a shame, because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23601368/sony-playstation-ps-vr2-review-virtual-reality">the $550 PSVR 2</a> is still a good headset, with image quality that arguably beats <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23906313/meta-quest-3-review-vr-mixed-reality-headset">the newer $500 Meta Quest 3</a>. Playing <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> inside Sony’s headset isn’t just more vibrant thanks to the richer colors of its OLED screen; it’s more thrilling, too, with the panel’s true blacks making me feel the terror of its darker corridors. The Quest 3 experience looks incredibly washed out by comparison. </p><div><figcaption><em>This room feels downright chilling inside the PSVR 2.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But what really scared me in <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> was the damned <em>glitch</em>. How — when I lift my pistol to deal with an unspeakable horror — I’d often find my hand had become detached from my body, stuck in place, two feet above the ground.</p><p>I’ve spent eight hours troubleshooting this issue and ones like it over the past week, and I’m no closer to a solution. My Quest 3 streams this game almost perfectly from the same PC in the same room, and yet my PSVR 2 struggles even with a hardwired headset cable to help. I see plenty of others reporting the same issues online, yet others report no issues at all.</p><div><figcaption><em>You didn’t... need that hand for anything, right?</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Is it luck? Perhaps, but I suspect it might also have something to do with how Sony cheaped out.</p><p>You probably know that Sony’s headset connects to the PS5 with a single USB-C cable that routes its display signal, power, and data simultaneously. Once upon a time, graphics card manufacturers were planning to standardize on a USB-C port with that same combo — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/17/17583362/virtuallink-vr-headsets-oculus-valve-microsoft-connect-usb-c-cable">they called it VirtualLink</a>, and while the brand didn’t take off, some GPUs did make it out into the wild with a do-it-all USB-C port.</p><p>The PSVR 2 PC Adapter appears to be the same thing. The three-by-three-inch square puck takes USB-A and DisplayPort from your gaming PC and power from a DC barrel jack, combining them into a single USB-C port for your headset on the other end. Find a DisplayPort cable (it doesn’t come with one and doesn’t support HDMI-to-DisplayPort), fire up <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2580190%2FPlayStationVR2_App%2F">the free PlayStation VR2 App on Steam</a>, and suddenly, you have a SteamVR headset capable of displaying any Steam game.</p><p>But the headset is the <em>only</em> thing the PSVR 2 adapter adapts. Sony provides no way to connect the PlayStation VR2’s all-important controllers<em>. </em>They need to connect to your PC over Bluetooth, but Sony does not provide any form of Bluetooth radio for that — and figuring out controller connectivity on my own has been an utter mess.</p><div><p><strong>Other PSVR 2 PC limitations</strong></p><p>I don’t majorly mind that they’re missing, but you should know the PSVR 2 also doesn’t support some of its flagship features on PC:</p><div><ul><li>HDR</li><li>Eye tracking</li><li>Adaptive triggers</li><li>DualSense haptic feedback </li></ul></div><p>Also, the PSVR 2’s tiny sweet spot for perfect lens clarity <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23601368/sony-playstation-ps-vr2-review-virtual-reality#:~:text=Instead%2C%20Tom%2C%20Adi%2C%20and%20I%20have%20a%20different%20annoyance">bugged me as much as ever</a>, and I’m still not pleased with the controllers’ battery life. However, it does still support passthrough video: you can get a look at your real-world surroundings anytime with a tap of a headset button.</p></div><p>First, I tried my desktop’s own built-in Bluetooth. My motherboard shipped with the extremely common Intel AX200 Wi-Fi 6 / Bluetooth 5.2 combo chip, so I figured I had a chance. I made sure its antennas were screwed in tight and turned off Wi-Fi just in case it might interfere. </p><p>The controllers paired quickly! But one of them refused to update unless I physically plugged it into my PC with a USB-C cable first. My blasters in <em>Space Pirate Trainer</em>, a game where I can easily test aiming, were unusually floaty, and soon, one of them started disappearing entirely. The controllers would not stay connected. </p><p>So, I ordered the first Bluetooth adapter on Sony’s <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/">incredibly small compatibility list</a> — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Bluetooth-Receiver-Controller-UB500/dp/B09DMP6T22?tag=theverge02-20">the $15 TP-Link UB500</a>. Sony weirdly writes there that “operation is not guaranteed” with any of its recommended adapters, but at the time, I didn’t take it as a red flag. </p><p>The first thing I learned is that you must <em>disable</em> your motherboard’s onboard Bluetooth if you want to use a dongle. (I learned that from poking around myself because neither Windows nor Sony’s app gave me a clue.) The second thing I learned is you must unpair controllers <em>before</em> you disable your motherboard’s onboard Bluetooth, or else Windows won’t let you pair them again.</p><div><figcaption><em>Don’t forget to disable any Bluetooth adapters you don’t want to use.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>After many, many additional troubleshooting steps, my controllers began to feel responsive. </p><p>But even then — with Sony’s recommended Bluetooth dongle, the latest drivers, plugged into a USB extension cable, with a direct line of sight to my controllers less than five feet away — one of my virtual hands would regularly, repeatedly, and consistently get stuck in midair. It lost positional tracking, meaning I could still rotate my hand, even squeeze the triggers, but not move it anywhere. </p><div><figcaption><em>Video passthrough is nice to have (but I couldn’t get the automated room scan working after many, many attempts).</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Now, I admit that doesn’t entirely sound like a Bluetooth issue, and I could be wrong about that, but here’s why I suspect it might be:</p><div><ul><li>I have no issues with the Quest 3’s controllers in the same space, so I don’t think my room or lighting is interfering with tracking.</li><li>I had no issues with the PSVR 2’s controllers with a Framework 16 laptop and its internal Bluetooth chip (though I did have other issues with that setup). </li><li>When I added the TP-Link adapter to that laptop, my controller started getting stuck.</li><li>The virtual controller gets stuck even if it stays within the field of view of the headset’s cameras, which should help with positional tracking.</li><li>It was always the same controller getting stuck — until I unpaired them and re-paired them. Now it’s the <em>other</em> one. It feels like it’s having trouble fully supporting two at once, which had long been a complaint with standardized Bluetooth wireless tech.</li></ul></div><p>I’m afraid that controller tracking isn’t the only issue I’ve had with PSVR 2 on PC, either. I’ve repeatedly seen the entire experience grind to a halt, on multiple PCs, just by trying to access the SteamVR overlay to change volume or load a different game. I had to remove the headset and force-close things each time. It happened once when I was trying to play <em>Armored Core 6 </em>in SteamVR’s theater environment that gives you a big virtual screen for your flat games, too. </p><p>If it weren’t for that, and how both Sony and Valve require you to use motion controllers to access and navigate SteamVR, maybe I could at least recommend the adapter for non-VR gaming. </p><p>Sony did not answer my questions about why it didn’t choose to offer its own Bluetooth solution or whether there’s another Bluetooth adapter or a validated laptop I should try instead. I offered to let Sony help me troubleshoot over the phone, but the company didn’t take me up on that, either.</p><p>After trying <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-troubleshoot/">every troubleshooting step</a> on Sony’s website and more via PR email, and putting eight hours into this thing without a single good gameplay session, I’ve decided Sony’s PC product simply isn’t ready for my PC. </p><div><p><h3>Agree to continue: PSVR 2 PC Adapter</h3></p><p><em>Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate.</em></p><p>Unlike most dongles, the PlayStation VR2 PC Adapter requires its own app, and here that means one mandatory agreement: <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2F%2Feula%2F2580190_eula_1">the PlayStation VR2 App EULA</a>. </p><p>Additionally, Sony makes you agree to automatically let it collect “limited data” about the PSVR 2 hardware, game errors, “information necessary to detect and investigate malicious, unauthorized or fraudulent activity,” and “information required by applicable law and to demonstrate compliance.” You can optionally let Sony collect “full data” including but not limited to “detailed information about what games you play” and “information about your play area.”</p><p>That’s two mandatory agreements and one optional permission.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to a new report <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/box-office-it-ends-with-us-beats-exectations-borderlands-flops-1236103106/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Variety</a>, the anticipated live-action Borderlands film adaptation earned just $16.5 million globally during its opening weekend.</p>



<p>These earnings fare poorly against the film’s reported budget of $115 million. Variety also mentions that marketing and distribution costs ran another $30 million.</p>



<p>Citing studio sources, Variety mentions that “nearly 60% of production costs for ‘Borderlands’ were covered by international presales.” However, the Borderlands movie still fell behind expectations. </p>

</p></figure>







<p>From Lionsgate and director Eli Roth, the film opened August 9, 2024. It performed best domestically, but it still earned a mere $8.8 million from 3,125 theaters. </p>



<p>Borderlands’ poor opening weekend performance follows a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-borderlands-movie-is-absolutely-hated-by-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">series of negative reviews</a> from critics and fans alike. The day before its premiere, its Rotten Tomatoes score among critics sank to a staggering 0 score. </p>



<p>In February 2024, the studios announced plans for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-cinematic-universe-first-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands cinematic universe</a>. Those plans are likely in serious jeopardy after the first movie fell so far behind expectations at the box office. Some fans and casual viewers still praised the cast, such as Cate Blanchett’s performance.</p>



<p>There are many video game movie adaptations also on the way, based on other IP. Most recently, Story Kitchen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingmakers-movie-deal-already-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced plans</a> to adapt the history-bending game Kingmakers into a movie. It revealed this movie deal before the source material even confirmed a release date.</p>

The project asks players to sit face to face beneath a projector, holding hands and moving in unison to create fluctuating geometric shapes in the space between. There are no win conditions. Instead, the installation hopes to spark meaningful, physical connections that might flourish when players depart the luminescent play space.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The installation was built by New York-based designer and artist Claire Kwong who sought to overcome her own fear of touch. "I'm painfully shy," she told those who attended her Hyper Talk. "I am a little bit touchphobic and I wanted to get over this. People always talk about overcoming your fears by confronting them, and I feel art and games have a unique power to do this. I wanted to challenge people and myself."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Touch, where do you lead?">Touch, where do you lead?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kwong feels "touch" is an under-explored game mechanic. She has developed projects before that made people move, but those experiences never resulted in a tangible, physical interaction. "Society really establishes strong boundaries against touching each other, and for good reason most of the time, right?," she adds. "Touch can be vulnerable and uncomfortable. But at the same time, touch can bring people closer together. Touch can be intimate. Touch leads to more."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When designing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Between</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, she wanted players to touch but admits it was "hard to figure out the mechanics." A flurry of playtests helped her understand what people were willing and unwilling to do. The end result was a project that encourages strangers to hold hands.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Research shows that most people will only touch each other's hands, and not other parts of the body. [...] It's important to design for player consent. People have to be willing to play your game. They have to get comfortable to get unconformable," she continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, Kwong flirted with the idea of doing something quite edgy like projecting onto a bed, but felt that might be pushing players too far. In contrast, asking players to hold hands seemed more safe and socially acceptable but still "transgressive." It meant that when she finally debuted </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Between</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, most people threw themselves into the experience, although there were some who simply touched arms or deployed hover hands to fool the projection.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The level of engagement combined with the fact that some people still sought a workaround convinced Kwong she had found the "right boundary." She also realized something else after watching people play: despite setting out to create a "serious" experience, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Between</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ultimately demanded a certain level of silliness.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I envisioned people looking into each others eyes and falling in love," laughs Kwong. "But you have to be silly to do these things. Touching another person to play this thing is really silly and you have to break the tension."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"People [who played] told me it felt very intimate. Almost romantic or sexual. Some people told me they felt closer to each other after playing the game. Someone even told me they hooked up after playing it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One time I played this game with a stranger and I didn't know whether to feel proud of myself that I felt awkward or awkward that I felt awkward–but then we sat beside the installation and talked for an hour. So making this game was a way for me to connect with other people and ultimately I think it made me less shy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Between</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> helped Kwong realize that video games can encourage players to suspend normal social rules if you can establish a safe, consensual space for play. "When you step into an installation and somebody else does too, you accept this is a game and you can explore boundaries," she adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Between</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, she feels she challenged her own boundaries and created a space for other people to do the same. "Games can expand the possibilities of movement and touch" she says, "and touch can bring people together like nothing else."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/keyword/amaze-sheffield">Click here for more AMAZE Sheffield coverage</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

</div><div>



            <p>Last week, Bethesda released a remastered edition of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom">Doom</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-2">Doom II</a> on Steam, with lots of extra episodes and improvements. One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM__DOOM_II/">the Steam version</a> of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it "a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years." </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This is a massive breach of trust and a shitty thing for [id Software and Zenimax] to do to a community that created the phenomenon they are now monetising," said game designer Jean-Paul LeBreton in <a href="https://cohost.org/vectorpoem/post/7223926-id-software-zenima">a post on cohost</a>. LeBreton is known for his work on the BioShock series as a level designer, plus his more recent work on Psychonauts 2. But he's also a regular <a href="https://jp.itch.io/">creator of Doom mods</a>. He explains the problem with the recent Doom remaster in that post, but let me break it down.</p>
<p>Essentially, there are two avenues to install and play a mod within the new Doom remasters. Firstly, clicking on "Featured mods" will bring you to a curated list of mods that are officially endorsed and correctly credited. Things like <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/new-add-on-sigil-ii-doom">Sigil 2</a> by Romero Games, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvwvRj1bcQY">Harmony</a> by Thomas van der Velden. The second avenue for finding mods is found by clicking "Browse". And it's here where we find the "giant chum-bucket of random shit people have uploaded", says LeBreton. At the time of writing there are over 700 mods available here, browsable with some very basic filters. An upload button also appears in the menu. The issue is that there seems to be very little moderation going on at all.</p>
<p>"[You] can pretty much just... upload whatever files you feel like with it?" says LeBreton. "And put whatever text you want to go with it? And it goes through an approval process of some sort, but given how quickly stuff has gone up in the past couple hours, there's clearly pretty much zero vetting going on..."</p>
<p>Aside from the possible appearance of copyright-protected stuff, or (knock wood) some "hentai-strewn school shooting simulator WAD from 1999", this opens up the basic problem of people taking credit for another's work. </p>
<p>"I don't particularly care about the copyright concerns of Nintendo or whoever, though," says LeBreton. "What I immediately saw and hated was random shithead's names beneath community works, clearly uploaded without anyone's permission."</p>
<p>There is a "report mod" button, but this simply offloads the responsibility for moderating content onto original creators, says LeBreton, which in some cases is impossible in a modding culture that has been going for three decades, as some popular Doom modders have since died. Others may simply not want to play whack-a-mole to ensure their mod is properly credited.</p>
<p>Some mods in this "chum-bucket" will also be simply broken, LeBreton points out. A popular mod called MyHouse.wad is listed in the browser, for example, and it requires capabilities that the remaster does not include. Sure enough, it crashes when you start playing (something of a shame, considering MyHouse.wad is an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/myhousewad-is-an-extraordinary-mod-thats-like-if-doom-was-a-horror-game">extraordinary work of horror</a>). The main gripe remains for this mod too: it has been uploaded not by its original author Steve "Veddge" Nelson but by a user called "MrMysteryMan76", who writes in the description: "This is not my mod. You can find the origional [sic] on the doomseeker website." Some modders are taking to Steam to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2280/discussions/0/4511003584756727240/">ask people not to upload creations</a> without the author's say-so. </p>
<p>If any of LeBreton's own Doom maps and mods become available on the browser, he says that it will be "explicitly" without his permission. I can understand the annoyance. As a Quake mapping dabbler, I'd be miffed if I saw someone uploading my maps for that game with their name as the byline. In my case, they're not revolutionary levels but when you work hard on something, you don't want BilboBorginborf69 to slap his name on your weirdo crypt, even if they've uploaded it out of enthusiasm. </p>
<p>It's not clear how Zenimax will address the issue. The company has a rocky track record with modders. Much of the Bethesda library is open to modding, for instance, and they seem to understand that a lot of good things result from this. At the same time, they have been known to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-sized-fallout-4-mod-fallout-london-has-been-delayed-indefinitely-by-bethesdas-incoming-next-gen-update">break things modders have been working on</a>, and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4-creation-club-launched-not-paid-mods">"paid mods" fiasco</a> some years ago understandably caused mixed emotions among modders. My own feeling is that if your multi-million dollar company is going to use "look at all these mods!" as a marketing point, you could at least do some moderating and ensure those mods creators are credited correctly. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/conan-throwbrien">Conan Throwbrien</a> welcomes its host to the stage with discordant jazz and uncanny colour bars glitches. It feels eerie. Desperate. A crushing inevitability. Four joke topics appear at the bottom of the screen. Ridiculous celebrity kids names. Action figures for news anchors. Diet water sales boom. You cautiously slide that last one over to the microphone. Throwbrien emits a string of chirps, like a flame-crested lyre bird with a wounded voicebox trying to mimic human language. “Have you folks heard about this one…”</p>
<p>There is an implied terror in this seemingly friendly opener. What if they <em>have</em> heard this one? What will Throwbrien do then?</p>

<p>More cards appear. Where to take it now? Banter with the audience? Make a pop-culture reference? Self-deprecate? It’s a choice between how many of which type of dice to roll. Throwbrien tells the joke, then the audience react. Whoever scores closest to 13 wins. If the audience win, they’ll simply sit in silence and stare blankly into Thrownbrien’s soul.</p>
<p>The twist is that one of the audience’s dice is hidden. Throwbrien has some idea of how to work the crowd, but try as he might, he’s yet to fully map the inner workings of the human mind. If the audience don’t laugh, the ratings go down. If the ratings go down, tonight’s special guest might not even show up, and Throwbrien might have to replace them with a cheese grater.</p>
<p>“Next they’ll be introducing flavoured air that you can drink, like a breeze out of a can. Who needs solid food when you can just sip on some freshly harvested atmosphere?”</p>
<p>Scattered rimshots attempt to herald a punchline they can’t quite locate. Throwbrien hears stifled laughter and a few meager claps. He lets his lips contort into the ghost of a smile, but he can’t shake the feeling that he’s forgotten what genuine mirth sounds like.</p>
<p>The discordant jazz rings in his ears sharply, but he knows he’ll hear it anyway, even when sitting alone in silence. It imprinted itself a long time a go. It's been part of him since....when? When did this all start? When does it end? When did this bit even start? Is it time to change topic? Have you folks heard about this one?</p>
<p>You can play Conan Throwbrien for free in your browser on Itch.io <a href="https://spelafort.itch.io/conan-throwbrien">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Disney has provided an update on how its partnership with Epic Games to create games and experiences for Fortnite is coming along, and it's still some time off. In a <a href="https://disneyparksblog.com/disney-experiences/fortnite-announcements-pixar-marvel-star-wars/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Disney said Fortnite's all new "games and entertainment universe" themed around Disney is still "a few years away."</p><p>Disney also reiterated what it's hoping to achieve with this partnership, which saw <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-disney-persistent-universe-tied-to-fortnite-is-in-the-works/1100-6520900/" data-ref-id="1100-6520900">Disney invest a further $1.5 billion into Epic Games</a>. Disney said fans can think of it like "a place where all your favorite Disney characters and worlds converge in one connected universe."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2bRcSIUsE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Yf2bRcSIUsE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In this connected universe inside Fortnite, Disney fans can "watch, play, and even create [their] own adventures."</p><p>It sounds similar to Epic's deal with Lego, which saw Lego invest significant capital into Epic Games to create what would eventually become Lego Fortnite. That game exists as one of multiple distinct games/experiences on Fortnite, alongside titles like Rocket Racing and Fortnite Festival, in addition to the original battle royale game.</p><p>While Disney fans have to wait a while longer for the official Disney/Fortnite experience, Disney villains Maleficent, Cruella de Vil, and Captain Hook are coming to Fortnite this fall. From Pixar, members of The Incredibles are coming to Fortnite, also this fall; and the next set of Star Wars characters and items--IG-11, Moff Gideon, and Grogu back bling--are coming this week.</p><p>From the world of Marvel, a new Marvel-themed Fortnite season called Absolute Doom begins on August 16.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/shadows-of-doubt-release-date-september-26th/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Shadows of Doubt, the sandbox detective game set in a procedural world, will be leaving early access on September 26th. On the same date, Shadows of Doubt will be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, publisher Fireshine Games confirmed. To mark the announcement a brand new trailer, which shows some gameplay, has been released.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadows of Doubt - 1.0 &amp; Release Date Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hz2ovrxAuN0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As part of the launch, Shadows Of Doubt will be getting a major content update, but that will not be revealed until closer to the release date. Fireshine Games has also confirmed that the price of the game will be rising on August 23rd, with it increasing from $19.99 to $24.99. Shadows of Doubt’s description says, <em>“Shadows of Doubt is set in an alternate reality in the hyper-industrialized 1980s. Think like a detective and use a variety of gadgets as a private intelligence investigator, gathering evidence and making money by solving cases, finding and selling information and more. Play your own way in a fully simulated world with hundreds of citizens. Discover, meet and tail individual citizens, each with their own name, job, apartment and daily routine, in unique, procedurally-generated cities. Each case has different culprits, clues and experiences for&nbsp; you to test your investigative skills.”</em></p>
<p>While the city is procedurally generated, every single citizen of it has a full routine from where they live, where they work, and their own names. Any one of those citizens could become a person of interest in the cases you will be investigating as a private investigator. You can fully explore the city and every location within it to look for leads and clues. Some locations will be open to enter freely, while others will require breaking in to gain access. As an investigator, players need to speak to people, tail people, watch through CCTV footage, and even look through rubbish to put details together. Once a case has been built, a suspect can be accused of carrying out the crime.</p>

<p>Shadows of Doubt entered early access in April 2023, and since then the development team at ColePowered Games has been releasing regular updates to address gameplay issues and bugs to make the experience run better.</p>

"I can't say anything about [Polaris]," he said. "What we know is that Geralt will be part of the game, we just don't know how much, and the game won't focus on Geralt.</p><p>"It's not about him this time. We don't know who it's about. I'm excited to find out. I want to know. I have not seen any script yet. I mean, I couldn't tell you if I did. This is the thing, so I could be lying through my teeth. But I'm not. Or am I?"</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/23/untitled-2-1648052443071.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><em><strong>Spoiler Warning: The following paragraphs feature spoilers for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</strong></em></p><p>Only a single teaser image has otherwise been revealed for Polaris, but it was enough to fan the fire of fan theories which believed Ciri would be the next mainline Witcher game's protagonist. What's considered the "true" ending of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, thanks to its story being continued in comics considered canon to CD Projekt Red's universe, sees her become a witcher herself.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-dev-confirms-teaser-is-a-brand-new-witcher-school">The teaser image also showed a medallion of a lynx</a>, and while this is a brand new witcher school not mentioned previously in the books, games, comics, or wherever else, Ciri wore a School of the Cat medallion in the books and its philosophy matches her nimble fighting style.</p><p>The lynx medallion being a combination of this and her wilder School of the Wolf side (as she was raised by its members Geralt, Vesemir, and so on), could make a lot of sense. In fact, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geralt-of-rivia-doug-cockle-theories-witcher-4-polaris-cd-projekt-red">Cockle himself told IGN in December 2023</a> this was "the best theory" he's heard, though <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geralt-of-rivia-voice-actor-doug-cockle-the-witcher-4-remake-sirius">this was before he knew about starring in it himself</a>.</p><p>Geralt being featured in Polaris as a side character perhaps lends itself to this theory too, because just as the final quest of The Witcher 3 sees him give Ciri her sword, it would make sense for her to have a mentor character in some areas of the new game. "Maybe Geralt is the new Vesemir," said marktheshark124 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1eosupo/doug_cockle_geralts_voice_actor_confirms_that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every CD Projekt Red Game In Development</h3></div></output><p>At the very least, the confirmation Geralt is in the game somewhat debunks fan theories for a prequel to the original Witcher saga, taking place decades, if not centuries, earlier when the Witcher schools were at the height of prominence. They, and witchers themselves, are dwindling during the events of the original saga.</p><p>It will likely be a while before more information on Polaris emerges, though <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-polaris-development-cd-projekt">it is the main project being worked on at CD Projekt Red</a>. The developer hasn't revealed anything else, only that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-will-emphasise-freedom-and-intense-gameplay">it will emphasize freedom and "intense gameplay.</a><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-will-emphasise-freedom-and-intense-gameplay">"</a></p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-hero-shooter-deadlock-still-hasnt-been-announced-but-had-16k-steam-concurrent-players-this-weekend<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Deadlock - a game which is yet to actually be announced in any official way, shape or form - had a concurrent player peak of over 16,000 this weekend.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the game's peak is sitting at 16,947 players on Steam, with 4,714 people playing it at this very moment in time. </p>
<p>I tried to install it myself via a little tab on SteamDB just now, but was met with the message: "An error occurred while launching this game: Game configuration unavailable." I was then taken back to the Steam app's main page.</p>

<p>So, what exactly is Deadlock? Well, it's Valve's hero shooter. But, like I said, the Half-Life maker still hasn't confirmed that it even exists, let alone that it is in some form of playable state.</p>
<p>Leaked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/images-leak-of-valves-next-game-and-its-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter">details of Deadlock started appearing earlier this year</a> via images posted to social media, along with a report from long term Valve reporter Tyler McVicker. This report claimed that Deadlock was an Overwatch-style third-person hero shooter, with closed testing taking place.</p>
<p>McVicker described the project as having MOBA and tower defence-inspired elements. It's "like Valorant, Overwatch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> and Team Fortress 2 had a baby," the reporter said in May.</p>

</figure>
<p>Later that same month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-leaked-footage-of-valves-new-game-deadlock">gameplay footage from the shooter (which has a sci-fi setting) also leaked</a>. This particular footage showed off Deadlock's training mode, a number of its hero characters, and the existence of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>-style skyrails players will be able to hook onto and ride around on.</p>
<p>More recently, in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-trademarks-deadlock-the-hero-shooter-it-still-wont-confirm-exists">Valve filed to trademark Deadlock</a>, with the intention to cover a number of categories including (but certainly not limited to) providing online video games and video game education.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we will hear something more concrete and official on Deadlock soon. Eurogamer will keep you posted as soon as we know more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is continuing to make amazing progress and has recently reached an extremely important milestone.</p>
<p>As reported in a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a> on YouTube, the emulator's development team shared two new screenshots on the official Discord which confirm that ShadPS4 is now capable of getting in-game in Bloodborne. More work will obviously be required to actually make the game playable on PC, but still, this is incredible progress, considering the emulator was only capable of booting up the game a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Besides being now capable of getting in-game in Bloodborne, the ShadPS4 emulator can also run Dark Souls Remastered in some capacity, although the game is not in a playable state as it crashes as soon as the character is moved. Again, this bodes very well for Bloodborne, as the PlayStation 4 exclusive is powered by the same engine.</p>

<p>The amazing progress of the ShadPS4 emulator is eventually going to pave the way for a proper Bloodborne remaster, even if Sony never decides to release one. As we reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-visuals/">last week</a>, a modder is already working on it, giving players what the Japanese company doesn't seem interested in.</p>
<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is probably the most promising of all the emulators currently in development. You can download the latest version, which can run smaller, 2D games as of now, by going <a href="https://shadps4.net/">here</a>.</p>

Krafton, the South Korean publisher behind <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> and <em>The Callisto Protocol,</em> <a href="https://press.krafton.com/en-US/KRAFTON-Strengthens-Global-Presence-Through-Strategic-Integration-of-T">announced on Monday</a> that it had acquired the game and its Japanese studio, and is working with Xbox to enable a “smooth transition” to ensure the Tango Gameworks team can “continue developing the <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> IP and explore future projects.”</p><div><p>Microsoft had initially <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">announced in May that it was closing Tango Gameworks</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23715862/redfall-review-xbox-pc"><em>Redfall</em> developer Arkane Austin</a> and <em>Mighty Doom</em> developer Alpha Dog Studios — three studios it inherited after acquiring ZeniMax in 2021. The impending Tango Gameworks closure was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1copkub/hifi_rush_gets_reverse_review_bombed_after/">widely criticized by the gaming community</a> at the time, as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152137/xbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> had won several awards</a> during the 2023–2024 awards season. </p></div><div><p>Being spared from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">Microsoft’s wave</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango">layoffs and studio closures</a> is a fate that Tango Gamesworks shares with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/29/24086822/bob-is-taking-his-toys-and-going-indie"><em>Skylanders</em> developer Toys For Bob</a>, which instead left Microsoft / Activision to become an independent studio earlier this year.</p></div><p>The value of the deal has not been disclosed. <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> was the only Tango IP mentioned in Krafton’s announcement, so it’s unclear if Microsoft is relinquishing the rights to the studio’s other franchises like <em>The Evil Within</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22988247/ghostwire-tokyo-review-ps5-pc"><em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em></a>. We have reached out to Krafton for clarification.
