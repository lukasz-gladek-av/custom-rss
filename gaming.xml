            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-is-available-in-test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-evotinction-and-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA has confirmed several newly released PC games that include day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS 3, the most anticipated of which is undoubtedly Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown.</p>
<p>The third installment in the open world racing series and the first since 2011's Unlimited 2, Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown was announced over four years ago and suffered several delays throughout its development, first from 2022 to 2023 and then from 2023 to 2024. Developed by KT Racing (formerly known as Kylotonn and primarily known for making the WRC games until a couple of years ago), Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown is set to launch on Thursday, September 12.</p>
<p>Its PC system requirements were <a href="https://wccftech.com/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-gets-steam-demo-and-pc-requirements-rtx-4090-needed-for-4k60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> over three months ago and looked pretty demanding, with the 4K@60FPS target requiring a GeForce RTX 4090. We can only hope this was a reference to native rendering; if so, NVIDIA DLSS 3 should be able to provide much higher frame rates.</p>
<p>Another game out this week with NVIDIA DLSS 3 support is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005090/EVOTINCTION/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVOTINCTION</a>. This third-person stealth game puts players into a dystopian sci-fi setting. EVOTINCTION is out this Friday on PlayStation 5 and PC, and the latter version is enhanced with ray traced reflections as well as the aforementioned NVIDIA upscaling and frame generation technology. According to NVIDIA, the combined usage of DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation can boost frame rates by 3.9x on average at 4K resolution and 2.6x on average at 1440p/1080p resolution.</p>
<p>This Friday will also see the debut of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843310/Funko_Fusion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funko Fusion</a>, a funny third-person action game featuring lots of irreverent humor and, of course, NVIDIA DLSS 3 (and DLAA) support. In late August, Evil Raptor and PLAION released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843540/Akimbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Akimbot</a>, an action platformer game that also supports DLSS 3 and DLAA. Lastly, the high-speed on-foot racing game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1273560/DeathSprint_66/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeathSprint 66</a> will launch this Thursday with DLSS Super Resolution support. As a reminder, there are more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">600 games and applications</a> that support NVIDIA RTX technologies.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-sony-boss-says-laid-off-industry-staff-should-just-drive-an-uber.976722/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-sony-boss-chris-deering-comments<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-Sony boss Chris Deering has suggested that those laid off from their jobs in the gaming industry should "drive an Uber" or "go to the beach for a year".</p>
<p>Appearing on writer Simon Parkin's <a href="https://x.com/SimonParkin/status/1833418977944514798" rel="noopener" target="_blank">podcast My Perfect Console</a>, Deering says he doesn't think it's "fair" to say the widespread industry layoffs, which have seen companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">Take-Two</a> affected, are the result of "greed".</p>
<p>He goes on to say that "if the money isn't coming in" from gamers on the games Sony - or any company - is making, then it's "hard to justify spending the money for the next game".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ex-sony-boss-chris-deering-comments-ratchet-and-clank.jpg?itok=fWTe7LwW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ex-sony-boss-chris-deering-comments-ratchet-and-clank.jpg?itok=nzxi_F1B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony Interactive Entertainment reduced its workforce by about 900 employees earlier this year, including cuts to Insomniac and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Deering says it's "probably very painful for the managers" when employees are laid off. Rather tellingly, he doesn't acknowledge that it's also probably pretty painful for the employees themselves.</p>
<p>He then says having skills in game development won't result in a "lifetime of poverty or limitation", and that employees who are laid off should "take a few, figure out how to get through it, drive an Uber or whatever, go off to find a cheap place to live and go to the beach for a year".</p>
<p>Following these comments, Deering says he assumes those who were laid off from Sony "were paid some kind of a decent severance package", and when that package runs out, "well, you know, that's life".</p>
<p>I don't think you need me to tell you why these comments are raising eyebrows right now. At best, Deering comes across as out of touch, and at worst, he comes across as actively callous and unfeeling in the face of thousands upon thousands of job losses.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-i-joel-sony.jpg?itok=1zYwqYEF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-i-joel-sony.jpg?itok=wWmFrLtk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hey, Naughty Dog employees! Did you lose your job this year? Don't worry; just go "drive an Uber"!</figcaption></figure><p>Deering's comments come after several months of brutal job cuts across the industry. At last count, industry layoffs had already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">surpassed those across the entirety of 2023</a>, and that was in June; there have been more since.</p>
<p>Both major companies and indie studios have been affected. Several smaller studios have closed down entirely, and so have bigger studios like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition"><em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer Volition</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report"><em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>developer Piranha Bytes</a> (reportedly, at least).</p>
<p>As you might imagine, this doesn't really feel like the right time for Deering to make the comments he made on Parkin's podcast, but hey - perhaps he'll have a Scrooge-like epiphany sometime soon. We can but hope!</p>

IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review"><u>Star Wars Outlaws review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: "Star Wars Outlaws is a fun intergalactic heist adventure with great exploration, but it’s hindered by simple stealth, repetitive combat, and a few too many bugs at launch." Outlaws isn’t the only game seemingly impacting Ubisoft shares. Free-to-play Call of Duty rival <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/xdefiant"><u>Xdefiant</u></a> also appears to be having a tough time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>AJ Investments, a hedge fund that holds less than 1% in Ubisoft, urged the board of directors to take the company private or sell it to a strategic investor. The group clearly wants to see Guillemot out as CEO, and threatened to gather similarly disgruntled minority shareholders for a “proxy fight” that would brute force a sale if its demands are not met. It also called for further layoffs at the company, despite the brutal state of the video game industry for developers.</p><p>“Ubisoft at current state is mismanaged and shareholders are hostages of Guillemot family members and Tencent who take advantage of them,” the open letter reads. There’s further and somewhat bizarre commentary on pretty much all of Ubisoft’s games, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">the cancelation of free-to-play shooter The Division Heartland</a>, pirate game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a>, which the investment group says “was not a success,” single-player adventure <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> (“was okay but not very impressive as nobody talks about the game anymore”), and ongoing live service multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a>, which the group admits “is doing great.”</p><p>However, franchises such as Rayman, Splinter Cell, For Honor, and Watch Dogs “are sleeping for years.” And on Star Wars Outlaws, it’s “expected to bring good numbers, but recent reviews shows that game was not 100% ready to release, despite the fact that [sic] whole world was waiting for open world game under the Star Wars franchise.” The group pointed to Outlaws’ 76 Metascore and even IGN’s review, “which is quite good rating in our view."</p><p>IGN has asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><p>Ubisoft has yet to comment on Star Wars Outlaws’ commercial performance. Ubisoft has said it enjoyed a “solid” start to its financial year (April to June), and looked forward to a “strong upcoming release slate” with Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin’s Creed Shadows. “We are excited about the future and confident in the sustained progress of our turnaround throughout the year,” Guillemot said at the time.</p><p>The pressure is now on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows"><u>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</u></a>, due out in November, to make a big impact on Ubisoft’s bottom line.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

You assume the role of Stella, who was born on the ship 24 years ago and recently inherited her father’s post as Chief of Security. Dive into the conspiracy behind the incident that threatens to disrupt the Zephyr’s social order and foil its mission.</p><p><em>Between Horizons</em> is a modern 2.5D pixel art adventure that brings a branching narrative into a semi-open world. The team at DigiTales has applied numerous lessons from their first game Lacuna and proven solutions to detective game design problems to maximize player agency in the investigation process—all the while maintaining the tight pacing of a meaningful story that will ask you to reevaluate your moral compass and make increasingly tough decisions as the situation aboard the ship spirals out of control.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Layoffs in the video game industry have been extremely high in 2024, with an estimated 11,500 workers laid off from companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/" data-ref-id="1100-6525488">Bungie</a>, and many others. But now, former Sony executive Chris Deering is coming under fire for claiming that these layoffs are not the result of corporate greed.</p><p>Deering, who is the former President of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, recently appeared on Simon Parkin's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-not-the-result-of-corporate-greed-and-those-affected-should-drive-an-uber-says-ex-sony-president" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer podcast</a>, My Perfect Console. During his conversation with Parkin, Deering shared his perspective about the massive layoffs that are rocking the industry.</p><p>"I don't think it's fair to say that the resulting layoffs have been greed," noted Deering. "If the money isn't coming in from the consumers on the last game, it's going to be hard to justify spending the money for the next game."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY5O8yx_rNw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IY5O8yx_rNw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There is some truth in Deering's comments. The recent failure of Sony's hero shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/" data-ref-id="1100-6526235">Concord</a> means that eight years of development costs are irretrievably lost and the studio behind the game, Firewalk Studios, could potentially face layoffs because of that title's poor reception. Having made his initial point, Deering proceeded to make additional remarks that may not paint him in the best light.</p><p>"I think it's probably very painful for the managers, but I don't think that having skill in this area [of game development] is going to be a lifetime of poverty or limitation," said Deering. "It's still where the action is, and it's like the pandemic but now you're going to have to take a few…figure out how to get through it, drive an Uber or whatever, go off to find a cheap place to live and go to the beach for a year. But keep up with your news and keep up with it, because once you get off the train, it's much harder."</p><p>Suffice to say, driving an Uber or going "to the beach for a year" aren't viable options for everyone, especially skilled professionals who have dedicated themselves to this industry. Executives may be able to more easily weather the turbulence in their careers than the rank-and-file workers, but that doesn't mean they can simply dismiss what everyone else is going through. That's why Deering is currently being roasted on social media. <strong>Warning:</strong> There is some very strong language used in the following posts.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/RetroAli93/status/1833463691070632334" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I had to shake my head with some of the quotes from Chris Deering in this article. some proper boomer shit this one really made me mad. <br>"go off to find a cheap place to live" <br>MOTHERFUCKER THERE ARE NO CHEAP PLACES TO LIVE!!!<br>like seriously, so out of touch! <a href="https://t.co/zQ8LVjxOba" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/zQ8LVjxOba</a></p>  — Harún Ali (@RetroAli93) <a href="https://twitter.com/RetroAli93/status/1833463691070632334?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/IWGB_GW/status/1833456962404557000" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">22000 game devs have been laid off.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-operator-is-a-crime-solving-game-delivered-entirely-with-ui<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771980/The_Operator/">The Operator</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">has players solving complex crimes, but does so indirectly by having you help field agents by combing through databases and analyzing clues using complex software to help them make arrests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer caught up with Bastien Giafferi, the game's creator, to talk about what appealed to them about exploring the role of lab techs and analysts in crime solving, the thought process behind designing the various interfaces for different kinds of analysis tools and databases, and how the story beats would help shape the systems players would use to navigate them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> The Operator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> sees players assisting field agents with investigations into complex crimes. What inspired the creation of this game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Giafferi</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I had the idea for the game while watching The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>X-Files</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for the 10th time… There's this scene where Mulder and Scully find a strange sample in a body and ask a lab technician to analyze it. When the technician gives them the results, he's shocked and asks where they found the sample. At that point, I thought it would have been great to see the action from this person's perspective instead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to have players act as assistants rather than the agents in the field? How did that affect your design for solving crimes in the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think it was just more original. One of the strongest constraints I had was my skill set. I can't do art per se, so I had to do something different. I quickly came up with the idea of doing a UI-only game, and it made sense that the player would be the assistant rather than the actual agent. I really like to use my constraints as a creative tool.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The biggest consequence of this decision is that the player has a better overview of the cases than the agents themselves, so it became clear that there must be a conspiracy somewhere. It also works better because I can present a situation directly to the player, with limited access to a subset of evidence, and ask them to solve a specific problem. It basically turned the game into a puzzle game.</span></p><p>Image via Bureau 81.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into the interface for the game? How did you design the overall look of the game to make players feel like they're working with complex, high-tech investigation systems?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My goal was to mimic a real OS. Since I work on Windows, macOS, and Linux, I took a bit from each. The interface was designed one step at a time, and for each part, I tried to think about how the software would actually work. For instance, with a chemical analysis software, it made sense to have a place somewhere in the FDI where the samples would be stored and an automated system that would take this sample and put it into a very sophisticated machine where you'd have to input settings based on your sample. This would both create gameplay and serve the story. Since immersion was one of my pillars for this game, I really tried to ensure the interface and software would be as credible as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you choose the analysis systems players would use in the game? What ideas went into their design and how they would make evidence-checking more interesting?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I chose the systems based on the ideas I had for each sequence. Most of the time, the ideas for a specific sequence were based on story goals, and they had to be different from the previous ones. I didn't want to use the same system the same way twice.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, in the first case with Agent Andrews, my story goal was to show that the FDI was censoring information, and that it was the first time we worked with HAL and Agent Andrews. The only objective for this sequence was to prove that the accidental fire that cost the life of Mia Cole was not an accident in order to reopen the case. With that in mind, I looked for a way to prove a fire wasn't an accident. The best idea I had was to analyze an ash sample and discover that gasoline was used to start the fire (not much of an accident…). I then created the chemical analyzer just for that use case.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges did you face in making those systems interesting to the player without overwhelming them with options on how to proceed with a case?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I really wanted to make sure the game was accessible to everyone. I didn't want to include gameplay that required complex knowledge. Some things are deliberately difficult and overwhelming, like the bomb defusal, but that serves the story. For the bomb, the goal was to make you feel helpless. It's your first day, you're not even supposed to be there, so of course defusing a bomb is hard without the proper knowledge!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the hardest part was dealing with my own limitations when it came to polishing the game. A lot of the ideas I had were just too complicated to polish. Because of that, I focused first on the mandatory evidence. If a sequence was too easy or just too obvious, I'd obfuscate the evidence a bit or add more easy-to-make evidence to help hide the important parts. Depending on how the information is presented to the players, it's really easy to hide the key information or make something more obvious.</span></p><p>Image via Bureau 81.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges do you face when creating the evidence you give the player in the game? How do you give them enough clues to figure things out without telling them too much?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To be honest, the biggest challenge I faced was my own ability to polish. I had to cut a lot of "flavor" evidence because it was simply too hard to polish. When I started developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Operator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, AI was just starting to get really great results. For a small creator like me, it was a really great tool, allowing me to go much further. But as development progressed, and as ethical concerns around AI rose (especially with the data used for training said AIs), I decided to remove AI-generated content entirely. However, some evidence simply couldn't be replaced without a proper budget (like burnt photos of an apartment, for instance) and had to be cut.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for the "clue distribution," since I knew exactly what the player would know in each sequence and what I wanted them to understand, once I found a gameplay or puzzle for the sequence, I decided what piece of evidence to put there. As for what the players understood, a lot of playtests were done!</span></p><p>Image via Bureau 81.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you walk us through the process of how you design a case for the game with a specific example? Take us from start to finish on how you came up with the concept and how you figured out how to relay the story through narrative moments and evidence.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I started with the plot twists I had in mind and the sequence ideas I really wanted to create. For instance, I knew I wanted a sequence where you help an agent defuse a bomb over the phone (a bit like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">). I then created the story and the characters to combine those sequence ideas and twists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, in the Evidence Room sequence, the story goal was to retrieve hidden evidence from a previous case. It was a good opportunity to create an entirely new interface, as we had to break into the FDI's evidence room to access this evidence. I decided to go for an MSDOS-inspired UI. In terms of gameplay, since the goal was to stray as far as possible from the base UI, I decided to use keyboard-only navigation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For experienced players, it's easy, but for non-technical players, this is the first challenge of the sequence. Every available key is displayed under the window, so even if you're not used to this kind of interface, you can still do a bit of trial and error to understand how it works. It also made sense for this interface to be highly technical, so it's harder to find what we're looking for.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>There is also an overarching storyline contained within the investigation systems themselves. Can you tell us a bit about how you wove the story into the analysis systems in a way that would make players feel clever for finding those "secret" elements?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think it's actually the other way around. I wove the systems into the story. Because the story was laid out first, I knew exactly what I could hide and where so it would seem like an unimportant element. Some players probably noticed those details and figured out some plot twists sooner than they should have, but that's okay. For instance (spoilers), at some point at the beginning of the game, you can ask Mike (your "friend," except that he's not) about his wife, and Mike tries to act like it's a fact, but if you check the database at this point, you'll see that he doesn't have a wife. It's a hidden detail that almost nobody notices, but if you do, you really feel smart.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Beyond Galaxyland launches in two weeks on on 24th September and to give you a taste of the what to expect we have a five minute trailer explaining what you will experience in the game including creature capturing, photography, and turn-based combat.</p>
<p><iframe title="Beyond Galaxyland | Gameplay Overview Trailer | Pre-Order on PC, Playstation, Xbox &amp; Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3_H7SZFDBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Beyond Galaxyland, the main character is Doug, a high schooler, who is transported away from Earth moments before the planet is mysteriously destroyed, and arrives in a galactic zoo called Galaxyland.</p>
<p><em>“I’m a huge fan of classic turn-based RPGs from the mid and late-1990s, and some of my favourites – such as Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VII –have provided me a galaxy’s worth of inspiration when developing Beyond Galaxyland,”&nbsp;</em>said developer Sam Enright<strong>.</strong><em>&nbsp;“I wanted to make a game that felt uniquely cinematic, while being within a familiar genre. I hope when gamers play it they’ll appreciate how Beyond Galaxyland’s pacing will often feel closer to a movie than a videogame. Doug, Boom Boom, and MartyBot’s adventures across and beyond Galaxyland is a very personal tale to me, and I can’t wait for people to experience their intergalactic story!”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Here are those ever so useful key features:</p>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Active turn-based combat: Engage in strategic turn-based battles against a vast range of galactic nemeses, with time-responsive defensive gameplay to minimise damage. Each party member has a range of unique abilities at their disposal, but for an additional tactical advantage, sneakily scan your enemy pre-battle to discover their strengths and weaknesses.</li>
<li>Interplanetary exploration: From the blizzard-swept planes of Arcos to the tropical jungle ravines of Erros, the neon-buzzing cities of Neo to the arid sand dunes of Xalm, explore a cosmic cluster of unique worlds, each with its own quests, environmental puzzles, and out-of-this-world characters.</li>
<li>A classic sci-fi adventure: A semi-open 2.5D adventure-RPG in a classic sci-fi fish-out-of-water tale that pays homage to family-friendly adventure and sci-fi movies. Beyond Galaxyland’s story features laughter, loss, peril and friendship, all dipped in a dazzling layer of neon-tastic pixels.</li>
<li>Epic boss battles: Encounter 25 epic bosses throughout many extraterrestrial travels, including colossal space dragons, flesh eating flowers, and the all-knowing bionic behemoth that is the Nexus Mind.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/towerborne-feels-like-product-of-different-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Side-scrolling Beat 'em ups are a time-honored tradition that most who enjoy video games have spent time with. Whether it be pumping quarters into <em>The Simpsons</em> arcade game, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, or more recently with <em>Castle Crashers </em>(ok, maybe not that recent)<em>&nbsp;</em>or <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>. <em>Towerborne </em>is the next Beat 'em up to hit Steam Early Access but will it live up to hype or fall to monsters?</p>
<p><em>Towerborne </em>is a mission-based multiplayer Beat 'em up where players create their own character, known in-universe, as an Ace. With humanity almost at the edge of extinction by Monsters who roam the world, it's up to the Aces to travel around and push back the threat.</p>
<h2><em>Towerborne </em>Classes And Combos Leave Us Wanting</h2>
<p>There are four available classes to play as in Towerborne; Sentinel, Shadowstriker, Pyroclast and Rockbeaker. While you'll start as a Sentinel, wielding a sword and shield, after the tutorial mission you can shift between each class any time you're not actively in a mission.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towerborne-comboing-goblins.jpg?itok=8tqcPBXy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towerborne-comboing-goblins.jpg?itok=7FgpmPUu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each class fights with a different weapon type, this also dictates the different combat style you'll perform and what your base stats are. The Pyroclast swings their Warclub at a slow speed but deals out heavy attacks, while the Shadowstriker's Dual Daggers are nimble and might deal less damage but are more equipped to dodge out of the way where necessary.</p>
<p>Combos can be performed by triggering a sequence of Light or Heavy attacks in order. There's a bit of trial and error when you first pick up a new weapon style, but I quickly found a number of combos that effectively stunlock most enemies. Once you've used one type of Gauntlet the combos and actions for all others are the same.</p>
<p>On top of standard attacks there are also special attacks for each class, like a swirling fire inferno for the Pyroclast, and equippable pets called Umbra that can also have unique attacks. Early on I was given one that simply fires an energy blast in front of my character.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towerborne-class-select-screen.jpg?itok=erst0gJo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towerborne-class-select-screen.jpg?itok=gCwJDcag 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The character creator is actually quite robust, but I knew as soon as I saw those ears what had to be created​​​​​​</figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately combat is an extremely shallow experience. Moving from one screen to the next you'll perform an easy combo that will leave you free from damage and move on to the next. There are some foes introduced early that have shields that need a single heavy attack to break through or prepare bombs to throw, but don't add much to the experience.</p>
<p>Completing a level you'll pick up new gear and experience that will level up your characters stats, this is where the 'hook' of <em>Towerborne </em>starts to rear its head.</p>
<h2><em>Towerborne </em>Is A Game Of Numbers</h2>
<p>Combat from level to level is a repetitive experience, the loot that you obtain from each of those levels comes in the form of new weapons or protective equipment. Each has a base number associated with the equipment's Gear Level, as well as some kind of percentage modifier on a stat. The modifiers might mean that you get a +4% to your super attack gain, or heal slightly faster.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towerborne-gear-screen.jpg?itok=R_WddyGY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towerborne-gear-screen.jpg?itok=Jn5ZoIeY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can have three of the same helmets, each with very slightly different percentage buffs</figcaption></figure><p>The higher the gear score will generally tell you which levels you might be most equipped to handle, but for every level you beat there will also be two more difficult variants that demand a higher Gear Score to access.</p>
<p>Early Beat 'em up games like <em>The Simpsons</em> might have also had simple combat and no progression but there was story to work through and a challenging experience. With <em>Towerborne </em>there's little to no challenge or depth in combat, and the reward for the lackluster gameplay is loot that slightly increments your abilities to be able to experience more lackluster gameplay.</p>
<h2><em>Towerborne's </em>Biggest Issue Is Its Core Loop</h2>
<p>I was expecting <em>Towerborne </em>to be an average Beat 'em up game but something good for some mindless fun while listening to a podcast or watching a TV show. Unfortunately, the experience I was met with was so shallow it wasn't enjoyable with additional entertainment.</p>
<p>While <em>Towerborne </em>is releasing in Early Access the bland core gameplay loop, built to create near-limitless replayability but with very little incentive, is the largest thing holding it back. Playing the game with friends might offer a more enjoyable experience, it's likely that there are other titles that would be better to spend that shared time in.</p>

                <p>It's been nearly two decades since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/timesplitters-future-perfect-review/1900-6121173/" data-ref-id="1900-6121173">TimeSplitters: Future Perfect</a> closed out the TimeSplitters trilogy. However, fans have recently noted that the title once rated M by the Entertainment Software Rating Board in 2005 currently has a T for Teen rating on the Xbox game store and the PlayStation store. Now, the ESRB has cleared up why the rating has changed even though the content of the game remains the same.</p><p>The ratings change for TimeSplitters: Future Perfect was first noticed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/timesplitters/comments/1f8c2v5/future_perfect_updated_rating/?rdt=47906" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">by a fan on Reddit</a>, and subsequently confirmed by other players as well. The fans on the site also noted that the ESRB still has Future Perfect <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/10853/timesplitters-future-perfect/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">listed as an M-rated game on its official site</a>. According to the ESRB, the reason why the game has a new rating is because the group didn't rate the version that's currently available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. Instead, the International Age Rating Coalition provided the Teen rating for both platforms.</p><p>"Our website lists the original physical/retail releases of the game for GameCube, PS2, and the original Xbox from 2005," said an ESRB spokesperson. "The game was recently re-rated via IARC as part of new releases on modern consoles; the Xbox.com rating was updated to conform to those new ratings. It is a digital version of the original Xbox release that works on Xbox One and Xbox Series consoles. The ESRB.org website is limited to retail releases and reflects the rating assigned for the original, retail release from roughly 20 years ago."</p><p>Presumably this means that IARC's standards for blood, gore, and violence don't line up with the ESRB's, which is why it's no longer an M-rated game for the modern consoles. Perhaps <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-esrb-made-a-song-to-celebrate-turning-30-for-some-reason/1100-6526201/" data-ref-id="1100-6526201">the ESRB should sing another song</a> to clarify that.</p>

      </div>
<p>This time, according to a statement sent by Activision to COD news source <a href="https://x.com/charlieintel/status/1833272473158135915" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>, the plan is for all of the game's modes to have a simultaneous launch. "The team is fully focused on October 25th," the statement reads. "We are excited about all the game has to offer across campaign, multiplayer and Zombies. This year, we made the decision to ensure the community gets to dig in to any and all modes that they want at the same time, so we are back to one massive global launch moment October 25. As such, there is no early-access beat this year for Black Ops 6: just the countdown to launch."</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 just finished up its multiplayer open beta, giving players their first look at the next mainline COD game, including its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/black-ops-6s-action-hero-movement-changes-call-of-duty-for-the-better-with-some-risks/2300-6465070/" data-ref-id="2300-6465070">reworked action-hero movement system</a>. Now fans will have to wait for the global release date to get their hands on Black Ops 6 again.</p><p>Now that Activision is owned by Microsoft, Black Ops 6 will release on Game Pass on day one--though only for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-not-a-day-one-game-pass-release-for-the-new-tier/1100-6524833/" data-ref-id="1100-6524833">certain Game Pass tiers</a>.

            <p>Five years ago, a small team of three people released a really rather special game out into the world, all about anonymously writing and receiving letters, which had also been written by other real people, and offering some words of encouragement to those who need it. This was Kind Words, a fitting name for a game that did so much to lift spirits and create a safe space for anyone going through a hard time.</p>
<p>In the time since Kind Words released five years ago, developer Popcannibal has been working on a sequel. It is called Kind Words 2, and unlike the original game where you were confined to a bedroom, in the sequel, there's a world outside to explore. Those wonderful letters still remain, though.</p>
<p>As for when you can explore that wholesome outside world for yourself? Well, there is not too much longer to wait. Kind Words 2 is coming to Steam next month, on 7th October. You can check out its release date trailer below.</p>

<p>Writing on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2118120/Kind_Words_2_lofi_city_pop/">Steam</a>, Popcannibal co-founder Ziba Scott said Kind Words has been "one of the biggest changes" in their lives over the past five years.</p>
<p>"It's been an amazing trip for Luigi and I to learn how to care for this community we started. And what a joy it has been that the community has cared for us in return," Ziba wrote in a post accompanying Kind Words 2's release date announcement.</p>
<p>"I could go on all sentimental like for a while, but I've got to go fix bugs now to make everything ready for the launch day."</p>
<p>For more on Kind Words, last year Bertie, Eurogamer alum Johnny Chiodini and I all sat down to talk about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-video-games-have-helped-us-with-our-mental-health">video games that have helped us with our mental health</a>. Kind Words was one of these games.</p>
<p>Stay safe out there all, I hope you are doing ok.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m positive that if I were to go looking through one of my closets right now, I’d be unable to earth mine, on which I played games like <em>Power Stone, Project Justice</em>, and <em>Sonic Adventure. </em>Games that for all intents and purposes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-sega-dreamcast-changed-my-life-1786435067&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-sega-dreamcast-changed-my-life-1786435067">taught me that the sky is the limit</a></span> when I was but a wee child.</p><p>The Dreamcast was not the most popular choice of console at the time. No, that honor would go to the PlayStation 2, which is still the best selling console of all time. Stiff competition, y’know? But it was my favorite and it remains an oddity in the console landscape. There will never be another Dreamcast, for good or ill. </p><p>Flash forward 25 years and you’ll still find folks (like me!) who champion the Dreamcast. Its failure was predicated on so many factors that were beyond <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sega-new-trailers-game-awards-crazy-taxis-jet-set-radio-1851082994&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sega-new-trailers-game-awards-crazy-taxis-jet-set-radio-1851082994">Sega</a></span>’s control, but that didn’t stop the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-dreamcast-games-1835926847&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-dreamcast-games-1835926847">Dreamcast from generating bangers and once-in-a-generation games</a></span>, like <em>Jet Set Radio</em>, before its untimely demise.

The Dreamcast doesn’t get this much love often! The collection isn’t particularly eye-popping, but it isn’t an eyesore either, and given the onset of autumn here in a bit, I’m looking for my umpteenth black hoodie to throw into the mix. There’s a little something for everyone here, which feels true to the spirit of the Dreamcast too. Now, it’s time to pay homage to the GOAT by eating shit trying to kick flip on that skate deck.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The early access periods generally began a week before the full launch, offering fans the chance to play through the story so they can hit Multiplayer and Zombies right off the bat.</p><p>But for Black Ops 6, Activision has gone in a different direction. Here's the statement:</p><blockquote>“The team is fully focused on October 25th. We are excited about all the game has to offer across Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies. This year, we made the decision to ensure the community gets to dig in to any and all modes that they want at the same time, so we are back to one massive global launch moment October 25th.

Microsoft acquired Call of Duty as part of its $69 billion buyout of Activision Blizzard last year.</p><p>Black Ops 6 just finished <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-open-beta-gets-significant-changes-for-weekend-2">Beta Weekend 2</a>, and Activision is set to announce changes for the full launch soon.

		<p>Everything is so damn stylish these days. FragPunk, an upcoming free-to-play 5v5 shooter, is almost unerringly so, with blisteringly cool, hyper-stylised art direction, a card-based system that changes how you play each round, and smart and snappy gunplay with an array of weapons to choose from. Interestingly, there’s not only depth beneath that beautiful façade, but there’s also a sense of fun and humour that’s been lacking in our shooters for a long time.</p>
<p><iframe title="FragPunk Gameplay Trailer - Closed Beta in Early October!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hGboaNaiirA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Remember when arena deathmatch games took chances, or even poked fun at themselves a little? Cheat codes in GoldenEye, being turned into a monkey in TimeSplitters, it wasn’t all about K/D ratios and headshot accuracy. Surprisingly, FragPunk rejuvenates the arena shooter by not always taking itself so seriously, and it’s all the better for it.</p>


<p>I should explain the cards. Before the start of each round, you can power up and play a selection of cards from your deck. You earn the currency needed to power them up through playing well across each round, with each card providing boons, modifiers or new abilities with which you can then go and shoot the enemy team in an even more efficient or occasionally, outlandish way.</p>


<p>So there’s cards that will grant you a heal every time you knock an opposing player out, or ones that give you an overpowered shotgun called the Devil’s Breath. Others add in a wonderfully floaty double jump, bringing some height to your headshots, but the ones that stand out the most are what we would term, ‘the silly ones’.</p>
<p>These include, but aren’t limited to, a card that enables Big Head Mode, making it much easier to plant a bullet in an enemies’ noggin, or one that puts a cute and cuddly turtle on your back, protecting you from all incoming rear fire with their shell.<br>
Because there’s new elements being introduced every round – each team can play up to three cards at a time – you have to alter how you’re going to approach the next encounter. Just because you feel empowered with your massive shotgun though doesn’t mean that the enemy hasn’t played something equally powerful, and it already feels like there’s an intriguing push and pull between each team.</p>
<p>There’s currently around 70 cards, but the team hope to add more, with ideas that would take them well past the 100 mark. They’re the true defining difference between FragPunk and the other hero shooters out there, and if they can get the balance right it feels as though this is one shooter that won’t get stale round after round.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s also the characters that you’re playing as, here known as Lancers. There’s ten available in the current build, and each of those we saw and played as in our hands-on were visually unique, heightening the stylish art direction, and boasted a healthy splash of neon-infused colour which fits into the overall punk aesthetic. This is definitely not a shooter that’s shy of standing out.</p>
<p>As a hero shooter each Lancer also has their own individual special abilities, from the fiery Corona whose lethal dash can chew through enemies to lead character Broker and their devestating missile launcher. It’s fair to say though that the leather-clad Axon was my favourite, his special granting him an electric guitar-shaped shotgun that also allows him to powerslide around the level. It doesn’t get much more punk than that. Just as with the cards, there are plans to add more Lancers as development continues, and as an ongoing live service game, it’ll be interesting to see just how far the team can go.</p>

<p>During our hands on playing alongside the game’s lead developer, one of the things that became apparent was the slightly more challenging gunplay than what you might find elsewhere. There’s still a relatively low TTK, but the team has deliberately made the gun handling a little tougher, which not only gives FragPunk it’s own feel, but makes every kill feel more hard won.</p>
<p>FragPunk was an outrageous highlight at Gamescom 2024, and as someone who’s become heavily invested in Overwatch over the past 8 years, this is one that I’m definitely going to be keeping an eye on. You should too, if you’re a PC or Xbox gamer, with an open beta due in October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-stuttering-fix/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Final Fantasy XVI PC demo received a new update introducing fixes for some important issues that will also be applied to the full version of the game.</p>
<p>The demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2515020/view/4617966511042426235?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.02 update</a> addresses the massive stuttering issues that made the demo almost unplayable on certain system configurations. While the experience still isn't entirely stutter-free, as there are still minor stutters here and there in the most demanding scenarios, the new version of the demo is a massive step up over the previous one.</p>
<p>Besides the stuttering issues fix, the new Final Fantasy XVI demo update addresses a variety of other issues, including certain characters not being displayed properly, Screen Space Reflections and Variable Rate Shading settings not applying properly, and screen mode settings not getting saved on certain hardware configurations. All these fixes will be applied to the game's final version, which is launching in just a week, on September 17th.</p>
<p>Now that the most glaring issues seem to have been fixed, the PC version of Final Fantasy XVI is set to be the best way to experience Clive Rosfield's engaging journey in Valisthea. You can learn more about it by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 release.</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XVI heralds in a new standard for Japanese role-playing games and while the RPG components themselves are limited by Square-Enix standards, it's the narrative and gameplay that exceed all expectations. What begins with kingdom-wide subterfuge and destruction ends with a world forever changed and the player, as Clive Rosfield and Ifrit together, are the driving force to see it all through until the end.</em></p>

        <p>They also promise sweeping changes to make rewards better and the UI more approachable</p>

            <p>Following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-layoffs-couldnt-be-avoided-even-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-had-blockbuster-performance-says-report">major layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-3-may-yet-happen-but-destinys-unannounced-payback-spin-off-wont-according-to-reports">project cancellations</a> at Bungie, the company has since announced their plans for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, a game whose future was very much unclear. In their latest <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/new_frontiers">blog post</a>, they've announced that they're taking "Destiny to places it has never been before". This means it'll get two expansions per year, alongside four free major updates. As for what's in these updates, they want to make the game more approachable, give you better loot, and are even toying with the idea of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelikes</a> or survival shooters for future updates.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Destiny 2 game director Tyson Green says that the game's become "too rigid", with expansions that are "formulaic and are over too quickly with little replay value". And in many ways, yes, I agree with him. While I liked new areas or activities being added with say, Shadow Keep, The Witch Queen, and the rest, they were all pretty formulaic. New boss fights against a large moth and/or dribbly guy is it? New weapons is it? New activity to grind to up my power level by +1 every week is it? Everyone would tackle the new stuff in a similar order, then round things off with the inevitable Raid.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The game's last expansion, The Final Shape, was still structured similarly to the rest, but felt like a step forwards. It was a DLC that was a bit weird and spooky and harboured some moments that pushed Destiny into new territory: time attacks where you'd have to outrun dangerous gloop or destroy levitating tablets with laser blasts you'd reflected from enemies. Some scenarios, an absolute nightmare, but hey, I respected the twists.</p>
<p>Green says that they were proud of The Final Shape, but it "dominated all of our development effort". So by releasing two medium-sized expansions every six months, they want to "try new things that challenge your idea of what a Destiny experience can be". Interestingly, he goes on to say that they're actively "prototyping non-linear campaigns, exploration experiences similar to the Dreaming City or Metroidvanias", as well as "roguelikes or survival shooters".</p>
<p>Seasons are changing, too. Instead of three Episodes, Bungie will release four Major Updates per year, one every three months. "Each Expansion will launch alongside a Major Update at the start of a Season, and then a second Major Update will follow three months later to refresh the Core Game with new and reprised content". They'll include new activities, rewards, weekly events, and meta/balance updates - all free.</p>
<p>As evidenced in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxv-m5KVGy4">Liam and I's "Starting Destiny 2 from scratch" video</a>, the game's UI is an absolute trashfire and understanding the game literally requires you to create some dumb spreadsheet. Well, Bungie acknowledges that "you practically need a PhD to decide what to play and how to get the rewards you're looking for", at the very least. From a separate, more in-depth post on <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/theportal">the UI</a>, Bungie's exploring the possibility of replacing the Destination map with a new, cleaner Portal screen. And in other <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/coregame_rewards">rewards related</a> posts, they're looking into quality "tiers" for weapons and greater freedom to <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/coregame_activities">customise challenges</a> with modifiers that'll net you more specific stuff.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/destiny-2-portal-ui.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bungie</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for the next DLC, Bungie have named it "Codename: Apollo" for now and it's described as a nonlinear affair. So, rather than a straight shot campaign, you'll get to choose how you want progress from a number of options. Other than that, though, there isn't much more information.</p>
<p>I'm cautiously excited for these changes, but I'm truly glad that Bungie are going to take Destiny in some different directions. I think it's always been best in, for lack of a better term, funky little packages. Most notably when they introduced a horde mode - I miss it! Or when trace rifles were borked for a while, letting players kill each other in seconds with a quick zap, so they released a game mode that exclusively let people loose with their brokenness. So yeah, give us a strange roguelike mode, embrace the game-breaking stuff, make weird decisions (within reason, I suppose).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sony-ex-president-layoffs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ex-Sony President Chris Deering has said that those affected by the recent industry layoffs should “find a cheap place to live and go to the beach for a year.”</p>



<p>The comments come from the latest <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/chris-deering-former-president-of-sony-computer/id1665581266?i=1000668974022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">My Perfect Console podcast</a>, where host Simon Parkin and Chris Deering talked about the recent widespread industry layoffs.</p>



<p>Speaking on the layoffs, Deering said, “I don’t think its fair to say that the resulting layoffs have been greed. I always tried to minimize the speed in which we added staff because I always knew there would be a cycle, and I didn’t want to end up having the same problems that Sony did at Electronics.”</p>



<p>“Now, of course, there was just recently a big layoff of Sony Studios and in London, but what whole studio setup has been run out of Amsterdam now for a few years, and I don’t know… if the money isn’t coming in from consumers on the last game, it’s going to be hard to justify spending money for the next game. I think it’s probably very painful for the managers, but I don’t think that skill in this area [of game dev] will be a lifetime of poverty or limitation,” he continued.</p>



<p>Deering then went on to say, &nbsp;It’s still where the action is, and it’s like the pandemic but now you’re going to have to take a few…figure out how to get through it, drive an Uber or whatever, go off to find a cheap place to live and go to the beach for a year. But keep up with your news and keep up with it, because once you get off the train, it’s much harder. But I’m optimistic about the future for even people that have recently been laid off.”</p>



<p>So there you have it: If you’ve recently been laid off and don’t have a job, find a cheap place to live and go to the beach for a year. It’s so easy after losing your livelihood. Sigh.</p>



<p>Currently, there are an estimated 12,000 people who have lost their jobs in the gaming industry in 2024 alone, with the industry seeing around 10,500 people lose their jobs in 2023.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[xQc Wants To Fix The Esports Industry With Betting and Co-Streaming]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xqc-fix-esports-betting-costreaming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xqc-wants-to-fix-the-esports-industry-with-betting-and-co-streaming.976596/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xqc-fix-esports-betting-costreaming/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s no big secret that the esports industry has struggled with profitability for the longest time. For several years, this volatile market has ebbed and flowed, with organisations rising and falling as the weight of never really making much money pulls the wider business to and fro.</p>



<p>Recently, superstar streamer Felix ‘xQc’ Lengyel mentioned during a broadcast that he has the perfect formula to fix the esports industry, but in his own words, it’s a bit ‘degen’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-gambling-and-co-streaming">Gambling and Co-Streaming</h2>



<p>During a recent <a href="https://kick.com/xqc/videos/6f488746-2335-4a99-8c9d-a7fc9b7cb13b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q&amp;A stream on Kick</a>, xQc spoke about the esports industry. He was asked what he’d do to help repair the constant instability of the market, to which he immediately agreed that something needed to be done. He pointed out that even before he was a pro player several years ago, the industry was ‘struggling’.</p>



<p>However, his plan to right the ship would prove inflammatory for many millions of esports fans.</p>



<p>On stream, he said that the esports industry needs:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>… watch parties, co-streaming, and through possible live betting with live viewing… Some of these things are at the core, some of the most social things that we as humans do.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Admittedly, Lengyel then went on to admit that he’s not fully knowledgeable about the state of the esports industry these days:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That is the biggest blocker that would loosen up that tight financial hold there is in esports. I could revolutionize if I was at the helm, but then I’m sure there’s a bunch of stuff that I don’t understand as an outsider.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/esports/xqc-lays-out-plans-to-revolutionize-esports-it-involves-lots-of-betting-2893391/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> for the quotes</em></p>



<p>Esports betting makes up around half of the market’s overall revenue, and some of the most prolific partnerships and sponsorships are between esports organisations and esports betting sites. The likes of Counter-Strike, League of Legends, and Dota 2 are massive for the gambling industry, and competitive gaming and wagers go together like peanut butter and jelly.</p>



<p>Co-streaming is also huge. For instance, the Call of Duty League’s official broadcast is often beaten out by co-streams hosted by pro players (or former pro players) like Seth ‘Scump’ Abner. </p>



<p>They’re not the ultimate solution, though – the recent FNCS Global Championship managed to score record-high viewership <strong>without </strong>some of the biggest co-streamers stepping up to broadcast the action.</p>



<p>Over the years, xQc has landed himself in hot water for his incessant promotion of on-stream gambling. His partnership with Kick.com, which is backed by Stake, was as prolific as it was scandalous, going hand-in-hand with a $100 million contract. It’s no surprise that his solution involves gambling, but to be honest, he’s not too far off the mark.</p>

            <p>Activision has confirmed there will be no campaign early access available for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>In recent years, Activision has given those who pre-ordered a Call of Duty game, such as with 2023's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mw3-how-to-get-early-access-modern-warfare-3-9328">Modern Warfare 3</a>, early access to its campaign. However, it is bucking the trend this year.</p>

</figure>
<p>In a statement shared with Eurogamer, an Activision spokesperson stated the Black Ops 6 team is "fully focused on October 25th", and therefore everything will be released in one go.</p>
<p>"We are excited about all the game has to offer across Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies," Activision said. "This year, we made the decision to ensure the community gets to dig in to any and all modes that they want at the same time, so we are back to one massive global launch moment [on] October 25th.</p>
<p>"As such, there is no Early Access beat this year for Black Ops 6, just the countdown to launch."</p>
<p>This will perhaps mean that many players will eschew the campaign altogether, with many still choosing to play Call of Duty exclusively for its multiplayer. What do you think of this move by Activision? Were you looking forward to the chance to play the campaign early, or does this have no effect on you?</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is set to release across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC.

<p>One of the biggest talking points around every League of Legends World Championship is the anthem that’ll accompany said tournament. Every year, the reveal of the LoL Worlds anthem is a make-or-break moment, and historically, some of them have been dramatically popular, pulling in hundreds of millions of listens upon release.</p>



<p>This year, the rumour is that Linkin Park will be behind the League of Legends Worlds anthem, and several clues point to that potentially being true.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-heavy-is-the-crown">Heavy is the Crown</h2>



<p>It was a few days ago that Linkin Park revealed a grand effort to burst back into the music scene in earnest, unveiling a new lead singer in Emily Armstrong and debuting a new song – The Emptiness Machine. The band’s first new album will be titled From Zero, and there’s a song on the track list called ‘Heavy is the Crown’. </p>



<p>That’s where the possibility starts surfacing – that sounds like a song that would represent champions. It could also be a reference to Linkin Park’s previous track, ‘Heavy’, which was one of the last songs released by LP before the tragic passing of former frontman, Chester Bennington.</p>



<p>In a comment on the post that revealed the return of the group, the LoL Esports profile left a ‘crown emoji’ – that’s the second indicator.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was then pointed out that Linkin Park’s ongoing tour will land in London at the O2 Arena on September 24, which is where the League of Legends World Championship will take place between late October and early November.</p>



<p>Historically, the likes of Lil Nas X, NewJeans, Imagine Dragons, and Pvris have performed the LoL Worlds anthem, so Linkin Park has the right profile to bring a huge amount of attention to the tournament based on the track alone.</p>



<p>Do you think Linkin Park would do a good job with a LoL Worlds anthem? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>Ex-<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/scee">Sony Computer Entertainment Europe</a> president Chris Deering does not believe recent layoffs across the games industry have been a result of corporate greed. Instead, workers who have lost their jobs should "drive an Uber" or "go to the beach for a year" until employment settles.</p>
<p>Deering was a guest on games writer <a href="https://www.patreon.com/myperfectconsole">Simon Parkin's podcast My Perfect Console</a>, where the pair discussed games industry layoffs.</p>
<p>"I don't think it's fair to say that the resulting layoffs have been greed," said Deering. "I always tried to minimise the speed with which we added staff because I always knew there would be a cycle and I didn't want to end up having the same problems that Sony did in Electronics."</p>

<p>Deering acknowledged recent layoffs at Sony, including the London Studio, but noted "if the money isn't coming in from the consumers on the last game, it's going to be hard to justify spending the money for the next game".</p>
<p>He continued: "I think it's probably very painful for the managers, but I don't think that having skill in this area [of game dev] is going to be a lifetime of poverty or limitation. It's still where the action is, and it's like the pandemic but now you're going to have to take a few…figure out how to get through it, drive an Uber or whatever, go off to find a cheap place to live and go to the beach for a year. But keep up with your news and keep up with it, because once you get off the train, it's much harder."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Chris Deering, former boss of PlayStation, does not believe the recent, widespread layoffs in the games industry derive from corporate greed, and that affected workers should “drive an Uber” or “go to the beach for a year” until things turn around: <a href="https://t.co/uXUkNTbXQ5">pic.twitter.com/uXUkNTbXQ5</a></p>— Simon Parkin (@SimonParkin) <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonParkin/status/1833418977944514798?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>That said, Deering is "optimistic" about the future for workers who have been laid off. "These things do recover sometimes a lot faster than you might think, when all is very precarious," he said. "I presume people were paid some kind of a decent severance package and by the time that runs out…Well, you know, that's life."</p>
<p>Deering entered the games industry as vice president of international marketing for Atari, before eventually moving to Sony by way of Columbia Pictures. He served as president of SCEE from 1995 to 2005, during which time the company launched the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 consoles.</p>

<p>This was among many other rounds of layoffs across the industry. By May 2024 this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">over 10,000 people in the games industry had been laid off</a>.

<p>Epic Games has revealed that the FNCS 2025 roadmap will feature a massive prize pool worth $8 million. It’s the most preliminary update possible, as at present, we don’t have any idea what the competitive structure for the year ahead will look like. Now that the FNCS 2024 Global Championship has wrapped, we can start looking forward to what comes next.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changes-galore">Changes Galore</h2>



<p>Epic took to social media following the closure of the FNCS 2024 season to reveal some major changes and confirmations for the 2025 season. First, the company confirmed that an $8 million prize pool will be on the line next year and that the format will accommodate Trios – <em>not </em>Duos.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Heard you want a 2025 FNCS announcement?<br>HERE IT IS!</p><p>🔺 Trios<br>🔺 $8,000,000 FNCS Prize Pool<br>🔺 Siphon Trials – a series of tournaments to test versions of Siphon for its return in Competitive</p><p>We’ll have more information on these trials soon, stay tuned and get ready for 2025! <a href="https://t.co/AjTpBElQ3i">pic.twitter.com/AjTpBElQ3i</a></p></div>— Fortnite Competitive (@FNCompetitive) <a href="https://twitter.com/FNCompetitive/status/1832891659383976265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It was also revealed that Siphon Trials are surfacing. This is the mechanic that allows users to secure more health and shields whenever they defeat an enemy. This mechanic will be deployed on a testing basis before it’s introduced to Fortnite’s competitive ecosystem.</p>



<p>Next season is expected to be a big hit for the Fortnite esports scene. The recent FNCS 2024 Global Championship went down as the game’s most popular event in more than five years, drawing in more than 800,000 peak concurrent viewers. It’s a solid representation of the growth of Fortnite’s esports landscape and hopefully, it’s an indication of what’s yet to come.</p>
