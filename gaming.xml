            <p>The director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has claimed he was able to beat the game solo and without relics, that it's very possible to do so, and wants players to have the confidence to try it themselves.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-director-interview-if-he-can-solo-every-boss-so-can-you/">In an interview with CNET</a>, director Junya Ishizaki was asked about how many bosses he had beaten himself, to which he responded: "I can hopefully give you reassurance to know that I have beaten all of the game's bosses. I've seen everything it has to offer, both in multiplayer and as a solo player. So I want you and players to know that this is very possible, and I want you to have the confidence to give it a try yourself. "</p>
<p>In a quick follow up, Ishizaki was asked if he'd solo'd every boss in the game too, to which he confirmed: "Yes. And without relics."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-is-now-easier-for-solo-players">Elden Ring Nightreign was made easier for solo players last week</a>, acting as a salve for those who felt the solo experience was too daunting compared to the difficulty level experienced in groups of three. FromSoftware also announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">duo-mode is in development in response to player feedback</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while many are struggling still and Ishizaki has politely laid out a "Git Gud" to folks, one player has already jazzed up a regular Nightreign run by beating Gaping Jaw with a saxophone controller. This player - Dr. Doot - previously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg3RS_vYxpM">beat Elden Ring with a saxophone without being hit</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-years-agdq-included-someone-speedrunning-elden-ring-bosses-with-a-saxophone">and finished the game on the sax in less than 30 minutes at ADGQ this year</a>.</p> <div>

<p>So what I'm wondering is, when is Ishizaki busting his sax out? If he can't crack it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streamer-missmikkaa-completes-elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-on-a-dance-mat">a DDR mat would also suffice</a>.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign has proven to be a solid success despite its drastic departure from FromSoftware norms,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players"> surpassing 3.5 million players yesterday</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The long-rumored Final Fantasy Tactics remaster could be announced during today's PlayStation State of Play, judging from some recent happenings.</p>
<p>Shortly after the announcement of the new presentation that will air later today, as reported on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-schreier-might-be-teasing-an-upcoming-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-announcement-plus-yasumi-matsuno-retweeted-the-state-of-play-tweet.1206009/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, Yasumi Matsuno, director and writer of the game, retweeted the announcement, suggesting that something he has worked on would be shown during the presentation, later deleting the retweet. In addition, well-known reporter Jason Schreier talked about the game shortly after the announcement of the State of Play on Bluesky, later correcting a user talking about a remake, saying that it is a remaster.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/app.bsky.feed.post/3lqptcfid4c2r" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreicz34dptjn7tp7r33oawxpzgbatmfnsp2gs4kikci4fu3zlx66wrq" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system">
<p lang="en">Remaster</p>
<p>— Jason Schreier (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp?ref_src=embed">@jasonschreier.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3lqptcfid4c2r?ref_src=embed">June 3, 2025 at 7:36 PM</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Final Fantasy Tactics remaster has been rumored for a long time, and there's very little doubt that it is real and coming at some point. The game was originally revealed alongside a slew of other Square Enix projects via a massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-leak-lists-final-fantasy-vii-ix-remake-half-life-2-remastered-mgs2-hd-and-lots-more/">GeForce NOW leak</a>, and every leaked title from the publisher eventually turned out to be real, except for the Final Fantasy IX remake, which has yet to be announced, much like the Final Fantasy Tactics Remaster.</p>
<p>Despite rumors of its development making the rounds for years, we have no idea if the Final Fantasy Tactics remaster will be a simple remaster, or something in the vein of Tactics Ogre Reborn, which introduced a lot of gameplay changes that ultimately make the remaster a more enjoyable experience than the PSP release, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tactics-ogre-reborn-review/">review</a>. Hopefully, it won't take too long to learn more about this, and if one infamous character will end up making every other unit obsolete when he joins Ramza in his quest as he does in the original PlayStation release.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, NVIDIA released a new GeForce Hotfix Display Driver (version 576.66). This hotfix resolves crashing issues in popular games that are already out, such as the football game EA Sports FC 25 and the turn-based JRPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, as well as the upcoming survival MMO-like game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-surprisingly-adds-private-servers-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune Awakening</a>, which will officially launch on June 10 but will be playable starting tomorrow for those who purchased the Deluxe or Ultimate edition.</p>
<p>There are a couple more things in this GeForce Hotfix Display Driver release, as you can read from the official changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dune: Awakening may crash during gameplay [5273568]</li>
<li>EA Sports FC 25 may crash during gameplay [5251937]</li>
<li>[RTX 50 series] Dragons Dogma 2 displays shadow flicker [5252205]</li>
<li>[RTX 50 series] Video playback in a web browser may show brief red/green flash corruption [5241341]</li>
<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may crash [5283401]</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike regular GeForce Game Ready drivers, a GeForce Hotfix Display Driver cannot be downloaded via GeForce Experience or the recently released NVIDIA app. You'll have to get it manually <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5667" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from this support page on NVIDIA's website</a>. Of course, if you're not encountering those issues and/or are not playing those games, you can skip the download. It will be rolled into the next major GeForce Game Ready driver release anyway, which is probably not far off.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 system software update is now available, bringing a small number of improvements to the system.</p>
<p>As a minor update, system software 25.04-11.40.00 doesn't introduce any major new features, focusing on improving message and usability on some screens, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official update notes</a> shared on the PlayStation official website. No other change or improvement is mentioned, so we will have to wait for the next update for the usual<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-update-25-01-10-60-00/"> system stability improvements</a> often implemented in system software updates.</p>
<p>The latest major PlayStation 5 system software update went live back in April, bringing back the beloved PlayStation 30th anniversary UI some months after it went live and was later taken down when the 30th anniversary celebrations ended. The 25.03-11.20.00 also introduced the Audio Focus feature, a feature only available when using headphones that supports broader accessibility and allows players to hear quiet sounds and voice chat more clearly in games. Rounding up the changes and improvements introduced in the latest major update were the usual system software performance and stability improvements.</p>
<p>The new PlayStation 5 system software update 25.04-11.40.00 will be downloaded by the system automatically.&nbsp;<span>You can download the latest system software update&nbsp;<a href="https://pc.ps5.update.playstation.net/update/ps5/official/tJMRE80IbXnE9YuG0jzTXgKEjIMoabr6/image/2025_0529/sys_c81ab2031ccdaec9c83dcb1918d5051e3c6e988a5c6dba135cf238aa944072ed/PS5UPDATE.PUP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here </a>if you want to update it manually</span>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">Oblivion</a> is really a game about the Imperial Watch. Forget all the Mehrunes Dagon stuff and that Hero of Kvatch - the real stars of the show are the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-asks-please-tell-me-your-stupidest-oblivion-remastered-anecdotes-so-far">stupid</a> guards who pop out of the ether to tell you it’s time to pay the fine for your long list of misdeeds or head off to jail.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> modder clearly feels the same way, as they’ve just fleshed out the Imperial Watch and Forestry divisions into joinable factions, via the addition of some new radiant quests and systems. These kinds of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-mods">mods</a> have become a bit of a hobby for the modder in question, ColdTyrant, and I <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remastered-coldtyrant-modder-interview-evil-faction-quests">spoke to them about it</a> pretty recently.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4225?tab=description">The latest project</a> in their ‘Infinitum’ series of faction mods focuses on the Imperial Legion, and it looks like it offers a roleplaying experience I’ve been craving for years. You’re offered the choice by an NPC called Field Officer Leveilleur of becoming one of the potato-faced Imperial guards that patrol Cyrodiil or one of the rangers that help keep the wilderness in check.</p>
<p>The former is the option I’m most interested in, as it means you can earn gold and promotions by completing radiant arrest warrant quests. These task you with hunting down wanted criminals, stopping them in their criminal scummy ways, and demanding they make the infamous decision that’s usually facing your character - come quietly or resist arrest. Hilariously, the wording of what you say to them is exactly the same, so you can properly embrace the memeiness of your new vocation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, folks who choose forestry are tasked with hunting down bandits at randomly selected camps. The mod doesn’t leave it there, also giving you the chance to go a bit bad and abuse your guardly powers. Both branches render you able to impose fines on the regular citizens of Cyrodiil, and if you want, you can extort them for money like a certain Ulrich of Cheydinhal.</p>
<p>ColdTyrant’s created a system to track this, which I’ll let them explain: “If you choose to do this, your Corruption Level will increase by 10 for each illegally-demanded fine, and the game will inform you of your current Corruption level whenever it increases or decreases.</p>
<p>“If you really go out of control, and manage to reach a Corruption Level of 100, you will be permanently expelled from The Imperial Legion. This will remove any pending warrants or bounties, strip you of your ranks, and remove all Imperial Legion Infinitum content from the game, as well as slam you with an extremely heavy bounty.” So yup, another stat to try and max out if you’re a morally ambiguous completionist.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, though, the modder adds that you can gradually get back on the good path by going back to lawfully arresting and bounty hunting. If you want to give the mod a go, you’ll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a> and the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1929890398236774904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According</a> to insider Tom Henderson, Sony might announce a new God of War game later today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/40-minute-playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play live stream</a>. However, this won't be the next installment in the main series; on the other hand, the report says it will be a 2.5D Metroidvania-inspired game set in ancient Greece. Henderson even added that it sounds smaller scale than he previously thought, so don't expect a sizable experience.</p>
<p>Still, it could be an interesting one, not unlike Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. That game was successful among critics (it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned</a> a 9/10 score here on Wccftech) and fans, but it <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sequel-isnt-happening-due-to-low-sales-ubisoft-disbanded-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not sell enough to warrant a sequel.</a> In the case of God of War, it might be a stopgap release while Sony Santa Monica is busy with something else.</p>
<p>As far as we know, they have two main teams, and their next release from Cory Barlog's team is <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-developer-might-be-making-a-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be a new IP, possibly set in a sci-fi universe. Of course, there will eventually be a new mainline God of War game, but it wouldn't be too surprising if it only arrived on PlayStation 6, given the increasingly long development times of a triple-A game.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, there were also <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-remasters-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> that Sony Santa Monica would be remastering the Greek trilogy. It is unclear whether that was indeed true and the announcement has been delayed, or perhaps insiders got slightly misleading information and their sources were referring to this 2.5D Metroidvania spin-off instead. Regardless, we should learn more about it in around twelve hours or so.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the developer is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> with Amazon Prime Video on a live action TV series adaptation of the Norse trilogy. However, production was delayed due to a major change: showrunner Rafe Judkins was <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-starts-from-scratch-with-battlestar-galactica-for-all-mankind-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> by Ronald D. Moore, who is credited for Star Trek: Next Generation, Battlestar Galactica, For All Mankind, and Outlander.</p>

            <p>I currently do not have time to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyber-knights-flashpoint">Cyber Knights: Flashpoint</a>, the game Katherine (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-spiritual-successor-to-invisible-inc-is-finally-here">called </a> a "spiritual successor" to (unbelievably good stealth tactics game) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/invisible-inc">Invisible Inc</a>. So, I'm writing about its release from early access as a sort of vicarious joy substitute. Because, boy, does it tick several big honking megaboxes for me. The idea is that you'll be pulling off cyberpunky heists with a squad of mercs, planning and executing while keeping the future fuzz off your backs. There's also lots of dense <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> multiclassing stuff I'll talk about in a second. Here's a launch trailer.</p>

<p>"A modern tactical RPG with some of our favorite elements: gridless movement, environmental cover, specialized overwatch, initiative manipulation and more," begins the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1021210/Cyber_Knights_Flashpoint/">Steam description</a>. More of this, please. Don't tell me how immersed I'll be in your visceral yet cerebral yet emotional journey that represents a bold evolution of (genre). Tell me about the specific (genre) design you're personally into and are very excited about having shoved into your game. There's more. Customisable weapons. Faction reputation. 40 multiclass combinations. A variety of admirable hairdos. There's even some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> Human Revolution style hacking minigames.</p>
<p>I am chuffed this exists, evidently, although I am just trailer-gawking. For a more sober and detailed take, do read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rally-point-cyber-knights-flashpoint-is-both-worth-playing-and-worth-waiting-for-a-little-longer">Sin's rally point on the game</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The design goal is, I think, to represent stealth as vital, but not the entirety of your tactics. If you're feeling spicy you can hit a job loud, counting on speed and firepower over waiting for the sentry to chase the shiny penny. Almost all gunfights should feature rolling, repositioning, moving towards a target or shooting your way out before reinforcements catch up. Rather than a stealth/combat binary there's room for degrees of both, sometimes simultaneously.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bah! I am already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/battle-prose">managing one party of mercs regularly</a>, but it now seems like I'll need to make room in my life for another.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4010">Glory Holes Of Oblivion</a> is an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> mod that lets you shoot arrows and cast spells through holes in gates, and also allows your enemies to do the same. Cheers <a href="https://www.exresearch.co/">Ex Research</a> for the spot. NexusMods lists Glory Holes Of Oblivion as containing 'adult content'. This is surely because they're not scholars of glassblowing or drawers. More on this in a second. First, here's a good skeleton demonstrating the use of the mod.</p>

<p>Right: etymology time, buckaroos. Whoop whoop. This is a good one, too. The <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/glory%20hole">original meaning </a>of the term 'glory hole' seems to be "a drawer or box where things are heaped together in a disorderly manner". This pleases me because I've spent my entire life just calling them 'stuff drawers". I have one to my right as I'm typing this. It contains: Post-it notes, batteries, guitar picks, a single micro USB cord, Hall's Soothers, some screws, and a small remote for a lamp I'll never use because I only like one of its changeable hues. According to the (single, repeated around the internet a lot, might be therefore be bollocks) source, the use of 'glory' here likely comes from the Scottish 'glaur' - "to make muddy, dirty, defile".</p>
<p>Yes, skeleton. I'll be with you in a second.</p>
<p>For our next glorious fact, you need to pop yourself over to the 1849 book <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Curiosities_of_Glass_Making/OI80AQAAMAAJ">Curiosities of Glass Making (With Details of the Processes and Productions of Ancient and Modern Ornamental Glass Manufacture)</a>. On page 65, you'll find an illustration of today's subject, described as "the mouth of a pot heated by beech-wood, and called the Glory Hole". This was used to reheat large objects following the processing of 'annealing', or slowly cooling to remove internal stresses. According to our first source, this likely comes from a different  'glory' - which had come to suggest a "circle or ring of light" by the 1690s.</p>
<p>As for modernity, its earliest recorded usage is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glory_hole#History">a 1707 court case</a>, with the rise of the glory hole coinciding with the need to be discreet in a society that simply refused to be normal about queer people. Luckily, things are fine now, providing you eat this delicious meal of black mould J.K Rowling has prepared for you like it's the introduction to Resident Evil 7, and ask absolutely no follow up questions.</p>
<p>None of this information is, I imagine, factored into this mod. But this means little to the skeleton, who is still doomed. Lmao.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I need help identifying an Ossic Ring. Whatever an Ossic Ring is, it's related to a serpent goddess and is great at keeping away vermin. Legend holds that you can hear it hissing. I'm not sure if the Ossic Ring is an actual ring, and if so, whether it's a ring for your finger or a ring necklace or a ring design found on something unhelpfully nonringular.</p>
<p>With time running short (I am playing the demo for Bad Viking's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/strange-antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a> on the train), I grab weird knick knacks from my shelves at random and thrust them imperiously at the customer. Perhaps this berringed corpse's hand? No? How about this iron band enclosing a blue crystal tear? I get it wrong three times in a row and my character's brain saturates with Dread. To dispel the Dread, I must play a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle">farkle</a>-style dice game, matching faces to sigils before my soul collapses.

<p>As you may guess from the title, Strange Antiquities is essentially 2022's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/strange-horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a> but you are running a magic antiquarian store rather than a magic garden centre. I haven't played much of Strange Horticulture, but the broad strokes of Strange Antiquities seem identical to those of the verdant puzzler Alice B (RPS in peace) described as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/strange-horticulture-review">"quiet, meticulous, delightful, dark, and beguiling"</a>. Ding the bell and customers materialise from the green streets of Undermere to ask for a particular item - a bony emblem to aid with the hunt, for example, or a Moon Heart to provide solace for a lonely grandmother. You then work out which of your initially unlabelled commodities fits the bill.</p>
<p>First, you look up the name in an illustrated antiquarian's guide. Then you try to find an artefact that has the right shape, texture, material composition, temperature, smell, sound and psychic resonance. Perhaps you also refer to your book of symbols, which is otherwise used when writing labels. According to Alice B, there was a reward in Strange Horticulture for labelling things very precisely, and I imagine the same is true here.</p>
<p>The appeal of Strange Antiquities, for me, is that it cuts against the disposability of so-called magical artefacts in many other games. Today's RPG-flavoured free-to-play or live service offerings especially are larded with eldritch geegaws, frou-frous and doodads that exist to be fed continually into progression systems. They are glittering sequins on the face of a slot machine.</p>
<p>Strange Antiquities wants you to run curious hands over every dusty Ascendant Shard or poundshop Holy Grail and diagnose its aura. There's a patent loveliness to this. Between sales, you'll also investigate the interior of the shop, which is full of locked compartments and peculiar mechanisms. As in Horticulture, there's a wider world to glean from customer requests, troubled dreams, and expeditions to recover artefacts that take place on a paper map.</p>
<p>My chief criticism, I guess, is that the occult elements don't feel very occluded. Yes, you have to figure out the lore, but there's no doubt that everything in stock is a potential Lament Configuration. I think the game would be more engrossing if the objects at your disposal appeared mostly or entirely devoid of supernatural import, and you had to impose and cultivate those associations by striving to fulfil orders. But that would be a very different game. This one will probably be quite enchanting enough if you adored Horticulture. The demo launches on 5th June.

            <p>Oh boy. Remember the AI-voiced Darth Vader NPC Epic recently added to Fortnite? The one that very quickly had to patched because it wouldn't stop <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fortnite-darth-vader-ai-chatbot-why-does-this-exist">saying bad words</a>, and has since become the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-voice-actor-union-takes-fortnites-darth-vader-chatbot-to-court">subject of action</a> from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sag-aftra">SAG-AFTRA</a> union? Well, it'll be getting some AI NPC siblings later this year, with Epic planning to give creators the tools to create their own.</p>
<p>AI Vader, which was created in collaboration with the family of actor James Earl Jones, got its own streamer reaction montage at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjikvaR0i34">State of Unreal showcase</a> during which these upcoming AI NPC tools were announced - one that naturally didn't feature any of the clips of it swearing or saying slurs.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>"As game developers, our job is to entertain players and AI is ultimately a tool to make games more fun and immersive," said Epic's Fortnite ecosystem EVP Saxs Persson, "It enables infinite possibilities for two-way dialogue just like we saw with Darth Vader, and as the next step we want to take what we've learned and share the underlying technology with you."</p>
<p>In practice, players will mess around with a new "Persona Device" to create AI NPCs, picking the type of voice and delivery they want for the character, as well as its "characteristics". This was demoed on stage via an AI NPC taking on the role of "a mysterious cosmic entity named Mr Buttons", tasked with persuading the player to press a big red button with "comedic finesse". It'd have earned surreal points with me was I not a bit preoccupied with the ethics of using AI to voice NPCs.</p>
<p>After all, this is just the latest chapter in the ongoing debate over the ethics of using generative AI for voice acting. The aforementioned SAG-AFTRA and a host of voice actors have opposed it, arguing that it poses a potential threat to human VAs' livelihoods, with the union having called a strike that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-the-nightmare-footage-of-ai-loy-horizon-actor-ashly-burch-shares-her-stance-on-the-whole-debacle">still ongoing</a> as of writing. SAG-AFTRA, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/actors-union-sag-aftra-strike-deal-to-allow-ai-voice-replicas-and-video-game-stars-are-understandably-pissed">drawn some criticism</a> of its own for striking deals with a companies which employ generative AI.</p>
<p>I'd say being sworn at by Darth Vader isn't that immersive. Then again, I struggle to get too hung up on immersion in games that can see you be 360 no-scoped by Mace Windu, who then promptly hits the griddy and gets obliterated by the OP combat skills of Sabrina Carpenter or a sentinent banana. If you want a more nuanced, in-depth view on the genAI in games debate, it's worth checking out Michael Cook's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">Electric Nightmares essay series</a> on the issue.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>British developer Jagex announced a round of layoffs. Community Manager JagexHooli <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1l1fut4/comment/mvkxroe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it earlier this week with the following Reddit comment:</p>
<p><em>Yes, there have unfortunately been job reductions at Jagex. These have been made as part of changes in a company restructure as Jagex puts more emphasis on RuneScape games and community growth. The majority of roles are from non-game dev and non-player facing areas. There are some exceptions within the RS team as part the company's focus on a streamlined development approach.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m sure many of you are concerned about what this means for RuneScape 3. This is not a change in direction from what Mod North has said before – we are still committed to growing this game and investing in it. Our Roadmap won’t change because of these job reductions, and we’ll continue the great path we’ve been on with our content. We will talk to you about this when the time is right.</em></p>
<p><em>What matters most right now are the people affected by this change. The studio’s focus is to support those affected, as is mine. Now is the time we put them first and do everything we can to help them out.</em></p>
<p>At the same time, work on 'Project Zanaris', whose objective was to allow private servers for Old School RuneScape, has been paused. On this note, Jagex <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/pausing-project-zanaris--whats-next?oldschool=1#_ga=2.197087977.499468828.1749024097-1248850839.1749024095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>After careful consideration, we've decided to pause work on Zanaris indefinitely. We're committed to delivering the best possible Old School RuneScape experience. With a renewed focus and continued support from our incredible team, we're excited to keep making OSRS even better for everyone.</em></p>
<p><em>We understand that feelings around the project were mixed, and many of the concerns raised were fair. The truth is, there are other areas of the core Old School experience that deserve more attention right now. While Zanaris was ambitious and innovative, it wouldn't have met expectations until much later in development. Rather than stretch our focus, we want to prioritise the things that matter most to you today.</em></p>
<p>Jagex recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> RuneScape: Dragonwilds, a survival cooperative multiplayer game, on Steam Early Access. According to Steam data, it was purchased by 550K, 789K, or 842K users, depending on the analytics website (VG Insights, Gamalytic, PlayTracker).</p>

A pair of these are Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, which are pretty widely criticized for their relatively poor performance on the Switch. I got to play the newly updated Pokémon Scarlet on the Nintendo Switch 2 for thirty minutes, and the Switch 2 upgrades are <em>incredibly</em> clear. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official Nintendo website</u></a> says the free Switch 2 updates for Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet include: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>“Visuals: Optimized for the Nintendo Switch 2 display and high-resolution TVs for improved image quality.”</li><li>“Frame rate: Improved for smoother movement on Nintendo Switch 2.”</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The vague description definitely put me off at first, but now I know Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet on the Nintendo Switch 2 run in 4K at 60FPS. Or, at least, those are the settings–I didn’t have the equipment to measure if that 60FPS is indeed steady–but by the naked eye, I can still recognize it as markedly improved. As soon as I loaded into the game, on a huge 4K TV, I was stunned by how nice everything looked. No jagged pixelated edges on blades of grass, or even Pokémon, here. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 updates have also increased the number of Pokémon that can appear on screen, and from a further distance. For instance, flying over Casseroya Lake on the Switch 2 was a drastically different experience compared to on the Switch: I saw numerous Pokémon swim along the surface from a distance and didn’t experience any noticeable stuttering once I began to swim. Even when it began to rain, Pokémon Scarlet on the Switch 2 still didn’t struggle even a little. In fact, it continued playing like normal, as if the weather effects were meant to just… work. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even when it began to rain, Pokémon Scarlet on the Switch 2 still didn’t struggle even a little.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The framerate improvements are especially immediately obvious when viewing faraway moving objects, like the windmills by West Province (Area One) - Central, or distant Pokémon and people. I also didn’t experience stalling or glitches when in a raid battle or when Terastalizing. I didn’t get to play online or co-op, however, so we’ve yet to see if the updates improved those aspects (that desperately need it.) </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Visuals are subjective, so there’s only so much I can say to emphasize that the difference is certainly noticeable, but you can watch the comparison video on this page.  I can also report on some favorable loading time comparisons that will let you judge for yourself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These approximate comparisons are between Pokémon Violet running on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch/Nintendo_Switch_Longer_Battery_Release_Date_and_Model_Details"><u>V2 Switch</u></a> (the Monster Hunter Rise special edition, specifically) in 1080p, and Pokémon Scarlet running on a brand new Nintendo Switch 2 in 4K. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Loading from title screen:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Switch: </strong>19 seconds</li><li><strong>Switch 2: </strong>5 seconds </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fast travel from North Province (Area One) to Casseroya Lake:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Switch: </strong>9 seconds</li><li><strong>Switch 2: </strong>4 seconds</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fast travel from Blueberry Academy to Paldea: </strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Switch: </strong>17 seconds </li><li><strong>Switch 2: </strong>5 seconds</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides the fast travel loading time improvements, the menus are also <em>so</em> much snappier. Models in menus load in pretty much immediately, a stark contrast to the agonizing seconds you’d have to wait on the original Switch between trying on clothes in the menu; or hairstyles or accessories in stores. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/03/pokmon-scarlet-and-pokmon-violet-nintendo-switch-2-screenshot-1-1748992124427.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nintendo Switch 2 screenshot.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be completely honest, the performance of these games didn’t prevent me from enjoying them the first time around. I still appreciated the new open-world format, more fleshed-out characters, and never-before-seen new Pokémon friends, lag be damned. I certainly was frustrated enough that I avoided switching out Pokémon because of how <em>long</em> it took, sure, but overall, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were fun for me regardless. However, now that I’ve played it on the Switch 2, the performance and visual issues of the original are certainly less ignorable, and thankfully I never need to play it on an original Switch again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To neatly sum it up, Rebekah Valentine in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review"><u>IGN’s original Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet review</u></a> said: “Let’s talk about the Donphan in the room here: these games run like garbage.”  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/03/pokmon-scarlet-and-pokmon-violet-nintendo-switch-2-screenshot-2-1748992154761.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nintendo Switch 2 screenshot.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This, I’m relieved to say, isn’t the case on the Switch 2. Sure, they’re still not perfect–I did experience <em>one</em> stutter when dashing on Koraidon, and there are still texture issues and texture pop-ins–but the visuals and performance are far from garbage. They’re so much better, in fact, that I’m tempted to say the free Switch 2 updates are closer to a <em>light </em>remaster than just an optimization – even though it really should’ve just run better to begin with. I’m that impressed, but to be fair, I <em>did</em> go in with somewhat low expectations–how much better could a simple update make a game that ran with so many issues in 1080p on the original Switch?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just how well Scarlet runs on the Switch 2 makes me question if this iteration of Pokémon was planned for the Switch 2 all along. The update does this much and is <em>free? Suspicious. </em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Conspiracy theories aside, if the performance of Scarlet and Violet on the original Switch turned you off from playing, it’s absolutely worth giving them another shot on the Switch 2. I’m certainly going to go back and play more of the Indigo Disk DLC with these updates intact. These games are right at home on the Switch 2 and feel like they should have been here all along, and this gives me so much hope for the performance of the Switch 2 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A later this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These were my first impressions from just thirty minutes of hands-on play, so there could certainly be issues I missed or that reveal themselves later, but I encountered <em>significantly </em>less issues in these thirty minutes on the Switch 2 compared to the thirty minutes on the original Switch I spent capturing the comparison footage. You’ll be able to see the differences between the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet Switch versions for yourself once the free updates are out on June 5, alongside the launch of the Switch 2. Simply connect your Switch 2 to the internet and perform a system update to download free updates.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll also begin a mini review update for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on the Switch 2, so look out for that evaluation after playing for longer in the near future! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you do decide to jump into Paldea on the Switch 2, don’t miss our thorough <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet"><u>Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet Guide</u></a>, with a handy <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Walkthrough"><u>Scarlet and Violet golden-path walkthrough</u></a>, a complete <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Pokedex_-_All_Pokemon_in_Scarlet_and_Violet"><u>Scarlet and Violet Pokédex</u></a>, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Casey DeFreitas is a deputy editor on the guides team at IGN who has always loved Pokémon.

The film is coming from Blumhouse, a production company that has made a great number of horror movies in recent years, including Five Nights at Freddy's, Paranormal Activity, The Purge, and Insidious, among many more. James Wan's company, Atomic Monster, is also attached to the project.</p><p>The game studio's director and lead developer, Daniel Knight, said in a press release that the team is "thrilled" to announce the movie is in the works. "We never could’ve imagined the incredible heights this game would reach when it launched five years ago, and we’re so thankful to our amazing community for the lasting impact Phasmophobia has had in the gaming space and beyond," Knight continued. "Working with Blumhouse and Atomic Monster marks an incredible new chapter for the game, and we can’t wait to share more as the project develops."</p><p>Phasmophobia launched as a Steam Early Access game in 2020 and quickly became a hit for friend groups looking for a fun (and terrifying) co-op game during the pandemic. It's gone on to sell more than 22 million copies, and last year debuted on Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p>The next major update for the game is called Chronicle and seeks to overhaul the game's leveling system and in-game rewards.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679031/pokemon-violet-scarlet-switch-2-update-hands-on<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I recently did something sort of unusual: I went to a preview event for a game that’s been out for almost three years.</p><p>I’ve played around 400 hours of <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em>, according to my Nintendo Switch, since it was released in late 2022. It’s safe to say I know the game pretty well. And yet, when I was invited to preview <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em> on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">the Nintendo Switch 2 ahead of the new console’s launch</a>, I gladly took the opportunity to see three-year-old games I already own. I wanted to find out just how much they’d improved.</p><p>I have a high jank tolerance with games — it builds character — but I’m well aware of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23462858/pokemon-violet-scarlet-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>’s shortcomings on the original Switch</a>. There’s lag. The frame rate is… inconsistent. There are online connectivity issues. For a lot of people, performance problems overshadowed what was otherwise a great new generation of <em>Pokémon </em>games. With the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/653010/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-tips-tricks-release-date-price-availability-how-to-buy">release of the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and the accompanying free performance update for <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, that might finally change.</p><p>Starting up the demo of <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> on the Switch 2 at The Pokémon Company International’s office in Bellevue, Washington, I knew immediately where I wanted to go first: Casseroya Lake, sometimes called “Lag Lake,” where the games’ graphical issues are most apparent. On the original Switch, the game <em>really</em> chugs when you’re on the lake; the frame rate takes a dive, and it struggles to render more than a handful of pokémon in your immediate vicinity. Exploring the liveliest open areas and encountering the pokémon that populate them is one of <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>’s biggest strengths, but on the Switch, Casseroya Lake is dull and empty at best and impossible to navigate at worst.</p><p>Playing on the Switch 2, however, Casseroya Lake ran beautifully. There were far more pokémon in view (and I was immediately accosted by a torpedo-like Veluza, same as it ever was), and the lag and stuttering I’d come to expect were nonexistent. I battled that Veluza with no problems. I stumbled upon a Slowpoke outbreak and sent out my Clodsire to auto-battle them — no lag. I found a wild Tera Pokémon and watched the Tera animation play out, looking sharper than I’d ever seen it. (I was playing in docked mode at a station set up by TPCi, so maybe that last one could be credited to the TV. But still.)</p><p>It was the same case everywhere I went during my 30-minute demo: a stable and smooth frame rate, significantly faster load times, and far more pokémon populating the world. The Switch 2 update is not a complete overhaul of the graphics themselves — the grass textures looked just as unremarkable as always to my eye, for example — but it does seem to eliminate the performance issues that have dragged <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em> down for nearly three years. It’s a noticeable improvement in the world, in battle, in Tera raids, and even in menus.</p><p>Is it praiseworthy for a game to simply run well? Maybe not. I don’t pretend to know how games are made on a technical level, or really any level, but I know they’re not <em>easy</em> to make. And I had enough fun with <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> to play for 400 hours without the performance issues bothering me much. But it did feel bittersweet, briefly, to think how much more these games could have shone if they’d run well in the first place. </p><p>Then, in the last five minutes of my demo, as I waded in a different body of water to confirm that it too ran smoothly, I saw it: among the pods of Buizel dotting the shore, a shiny. </p><p>A good portion of my 400 hours in <em>Scarlet</em> were spent shiny hunting, because even though the alternate-color versions of pokémon are not quite as hard to find as they were in previous games, I get excited every time I see one, without fail. It’s the perfect encapsulation of the kind of joy <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> have to offer: exploring a lively area and finding something special. I caught the shiny Buizel despite knowing that it wasn’t my save file and not mine to keep.</p><p>The Switch 2 update is arguably arriving a bit late for my <em>Scarlet</em> save file, depending on how many hours you think are reasonable to spend playing this game. But I also own <em>Violet</em>, and I have played about two hours of that version total. Looking at the shiny Buizel I didn’t get to keep, I realized I was really excited to have a reason to play <em>Violet</em> finally — to rediscover what I liked most about these games, in a state that does them justice.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-the-people-places-and-secrets-of-the-tech-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a huge reveal at this week’s Unreal Fest Orlando, Epic Games and developer CD Projekt Red showcased a technical demonstration of The Witcher 4. Built in Unreal Engine 5 using many of the latest tools and technologies, it offers a window into the future of The Witcher; not just in terms of what Ciri’s saga will (hopefully) look like, but also the people we’ll meet, the places we’ll go, and the general vibe of the game we’ll one day get our hands on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was plenty to see in the 14 minutes of demonstration footage, so we’re here to break it down with the help of CD Projekt Red and Epic Games. Here are the 10 most important things we’ve learned about The Witcher 4 and its new tech demo. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/03/1-1748994597533.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1. The Demo is Not Gameplay</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo we saw was played live on stage by CD Projekt Red’s Cinematic Director, Kajetan Kapuściński. But while Kapuściński was literally moving Ciri around the game world, the studio is keen to emphasise that the demo is not a true slice of the game. While the mountain region, forest, and port town you saw will be part of The Witcher 4, the quest being played and the characters Ciri interacts with may not be featured in the final game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Kapuściński explains to me, this “was a demo that [CD Projekt Red and Epic Games] crafted so both companies can work on some technology that will be powering The Witcher 4 in the future. So it's not gameplay of The Witcher 4, per se.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if it’s not gameplay, what can we learn from it? “It shows our artistic direction and how we would like to approach some things,” Kapuściński explains. And so everything you see – the scope of the world, the density of the foliage, the way Ciri and NPCs react to each other, and how cinematic cutscenes blend with the interactive parts – is CD Project Red’s ambition. It’s how the studio currently envisions the game and what the team is working towards.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But everything you saw is subject to be changed, because that is a snippet of what we have now,” Kapuściński says. In short, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-does-not-fully-represent-the-final-game-cd-projekt-clarifies-visuals-reflect-the-direction-were-taking">this is not a full representation of the final version of The Witcher 4</a>. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/03/2-1748994615376.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Will The Witcher 4 Look Like That?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The visual quality of this tech demo is astonishing, but we’ve been here before. Many people will remember the first footage of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt or Cyberpunk 2077, which turned out to be more ambitious, at least visually, than the final product. In The Witcher 4’s case, it’s especially easy to be skeptical, as this demonstration was running on a regular PlayStation 5 (not even a PS5 Pro!) at 60 frames per second. I asked Wyeth Johnson, Senior Director of Product Strategy at Epic Games, if this quality was genuinely something players could expect to experience on a base PS5. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Oh absolutely. We can't lie here,” he says. “I mean the technology that we're making has to be directly relevant for what players expect, and players across the entire hardware spectrum are asking for amazing 60 frames per second gameplay.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new advancements in Unreal Engine 5.6 are allowing developers to run complex tech more efficiently. As explained in <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/news/unreal-engine-5-6-is-now-available" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an Unreal blog post</a>, “The Hardware Ray Tracing (HWRT) system enhancements are designed to deliver even greater performance for Lumen Global Illumination. By eliminating key CPU bottlenecks, you can author more complex scenes while maintaining a smoother 60 FPS frame rate.” The promise of all this is that the experiences that are currently typically locked behind a 30 frames-per-second ‘Quality’ mode will be available at 60fps – all without requiring new hardware. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The goal that we set at the very beginning, to make this demo and play it live on a standard PlayStation 5 in 60 frames per second, that was a challenge on its own,” says Kapuściński. “And pushing towards that allowed us to achieve these optimizations that allow us to use technology on a bigger scale.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/03/3-1748994636968.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">3. We're Headed North. Very North</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The technical demo takes place in Kovir, a region in the very north of The Continent, the world in which The Witcher takes place. It’s situated north-west of the lands of Redania and Temeria, locations you’ll be familiar with from The Witcher 3. Its mountainous terrain is resource-rich, and so mining is one of the kingdom’s key industries. Kovir is the world’s leading exporter of minerals, and among those minerals is salt; you’ll have noticed that Ciri’s quest in this demonstration is to investigate a salt merchant’s missing cargo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of The Witcher books have waited a long time to visit Kovir, but creating it for a video game is no easy task. As Game Director Sebastian Kalemba explained as part of the demonstration, “So much of The Witcher world is natural, organic, especially Kovir with its dense forests and wild nature.” The Witcher 3 featured some grand woodland environments that remain impressive even 10 years later, but the forest shown in this demo is a league ahead of them. It stretches as far as the eye can see, with detailed pine trees creating a blanket of green through the mountain’s ravine. Both vertically and horizontally, there’s an astonishing amount of foliage detail. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think for the Witcher franchise, the forest is definitely the soul of the game,” says Charles Tremblay, VP of Technology at CD Projekt Red. “And this is something that we were struggling [with] since the beginning of the project. How are we going to make the next generation of foliage?” The answer was Nanite Foliage, a new Unreal technology that has a whole new approach to how assets like leaves, flowers, and pine needles are loaded into the environment. It allows for a much more detailed natural world without the need for constant load times and pop-in – and it was that that has helped CD Project Red work on a seamless forest environment that is so richly detailed. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/03/4-1748994655628.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">4. A Horse Named Kelpie</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">For hundreds of hours we travelled around The Continent on a very beloved steed. But Roach was Geralt’s horse. Ciri needs her own mount, and luckily she has one. Kelpie is a black horse and we can see her in action for the first time in this tech demo. While Kelpie is new to the games, this horse has roots in The Witcher books. Originally belonging to a member of the Guild of Merchants named Hotspurn, Ciri took ownership of Kelpie when he died. Recognised as a magnificent horse wherever she goes, Kelpie’s best trick is that she can be summoned by rubbing a magical bracelet (it’s as if she were written to be a video game horse).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the books, Kelpie is said to be able to jump over seven-foot-tall walls with ease. Anyone who’s played The Witcher 3 will tell you that’s an impossibility with Roach – he’s more likely to disappear and end up on a roof. And so all this begs the question: will Kelpie be easier and more enjoyable to control than Geralt’s old steed? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No offense to Roach, but when you have this jank it can get you out of the immersion, that's for sure,” admits Tremblay. “We want [players] to explore the world with [Kelpie] as a companion and it has to be close to perfection, for sure.” New tech like Unreal’s multi-character motion matching should hopefully ensure riding Kelpie is a smooth experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like so many of The Witcher’s creatures, Kelpie has a mythological connection. In Scottish folklore, a Kelpie is a shape-shifting water spirit that has the ability to disguise itself as a horse when on dry land. Could this name hint at Kelpie also being able to take Ciri across spans of water? We’ll just have to wait and see.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/03/5-1748994679277.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">5. The Quest and The Manticore</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As we’ve established, this showcase is a technical demonstration rather than a slice of the game, and so there’s not really a quest to see, at least not in the game sense of the word. But Kalemba wanted to ensure the demo had a sense of narrative running through it – this is CD Projekt Red, after all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The big challenge was how to make a tech demo, but in a way that we'll also be able to incorporate story and bits and pieces from this world,” he explains. “I love that narrative layer in this entire piece, [it] actually even helps to boost the technical achievements behind the entire demo.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that narrative layer, we see that Ciri has taken on a classic bit of Witcher work. She’s accepted a contract from a salt merchant to find his missing cargo and crew. Unluckily for him, both his salt and men are long gone. Luckily for Ciri, their grisly fate arrived via the blood-soaked jaws of a manticore. And, as we all know, killing monsters is exactly what Witchers are known for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a pleasant surprise to see a manticore in this demo. Production materials that were leaked during the development of The Witcher 3 suggested that manticores were planned to be part of Wild Hunt, but they were cut from the final game. While this tech demonstration is by no means confirmation of anything appearing in The Witcher 4, we at the very least have been able to see one of the beasts rendered in Unreal Engine 5. Hopefully we’ll get to fight it in the final version of the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Including this quest was important to Kalemba. “One of the common denominators between the writing [in the] books and the games is a cocktail of genres. It's a cocktail of experience,” he says. The reveal trailer shown at The Game Awards last year, he explains, was a more “grounded” experience that showed the ugly realities of living in the world of The Witcher. “Here you have this adventurous vibe, you know what I mean?”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/03/6-1748994708913.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Welcome to Valdrest, Population: Over 300</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As Ciri adventures through Kovir, she returns to Valdrest, the port town that’s home to the trader who gave her the salt contract. It’s also home to over 300 other people, thanks to a whole host of tech optimisations and Unreal Engine’s new animation framework. That means larger, more realistic crowds – Novigrad will hopefully feel primitive in comparison. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the town’s population we see men, women, and children, a marketplace full of traders and guards, several dwarves, a few sex workers, entertainers, and a number of different animals, including a tamed bear. Perhaps most impressive is the variety of body types and unique animations on display; it feels like everyone is an individual, something emphasised by unique characteristics, such as a disabled man walking with a crutch, or a mother wrapping her arm around her child. It’s an example of Epic’s metahuman technology bringing ever-increasingly lifelike and varied characters to video games. Something that can also be seen in the way they interact with each other…</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/03/7-1748994730356.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">7. A Responsive, Living World</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The NPCs in Valdrest are interesting for many reasons beyond just their visual variety. As Kalemba explained during the demo, “Notice how responsive the world is. Character actions directly affect what happens around you, sometimes even setting off chain reactions. Everything is working together.” We see this in action as Ciri bumps into a merchant carrying a crate of apples, which causes him to lose balance and drop his fruit all over the floor. The apples, fully rendered with physics, begin to roll down the hill. A nearby chicken, startled by the noise, clucks and flaps away. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also see how NPCs can react to Ciri – upon spotting her, a guard says “Oh bugger, not her again,” and spits at Ciri as she walks past. It’s reactive behaviour like this that helps sell a Witcher’s shadowy reputation. Many people are prejudiced against these mutated monster hunters. “The idea is that there are physical interactions that when you get poked at, you get a reaction to it in a way that feels plausible to you,” says Johnson. “All of these things keep you in the world.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of other cool events we see, such as a man being thrown out of a tavern (apparently for cheating at Gwent – does this mean our beloved card game will be back for another round?). It’s unclear if these behaviours are scripted or dynamic based on schedules or routines à la The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, and when asked, CD Projekt Red would not say what its ambitions were there. But the goal is a living, breathing world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For us, the world words we are creating, it's super important for us to actually make them as vivid and as believable as possible,” says Kapuściński. “Naturally behaving, properly looking NPCs are an important part of it. So yeah, we've proved that with previous games, and we're not aiming any lower than that.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/03/8-1748994748239.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Seamless Cinematics</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Because this is a technical demonstration and not actual gameplay, we didn’t see a lot of “game” – you’ll no doubt have noticed how the camera swung away from Ciri’s conversation with the merchant before any kind of dialogue system and UI could be shown. But what we did see is a vision of how dialogue sequences in The Witcher 4 will begin, and it’s completely seamless. The Witcher 3 featured brief loading screens as it transitioned from the gameplay camera to the cinematic camera, but all that’s gone now thanks to Unreal Engine’s tools. Now, as Ciri approaches the geographic trigger point for a dialogue – in this case, a balustrade – the camera automatically ‘unhooks’ itself from its regular game position behind Ciri and begins to frame the scene as required for the cinematic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt Red first achieved seamless game-to-cinematic transitions in Cyberpunk 2077, where it was vital to maintaining the first-person immersion. While things are a little different here, thanks to the third-person perspective, it’s cool to see the studio’s vision for keeping the experience flowing naturally. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/03/9-1748994763959.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">9. A Small Gift for All Witcher Fans</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Right at the end of the demo, Kalemba said that the demo was going to finish with “a small gift for all Witcher fans.” That gift was a first look at Lan Exeter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it is briefly mentioned by characters in both The Witcher 3 and its expansion, Blood and Wine, this is the first time we are seeing this grand city rendered for a video game. Lan Exeter is a port city in Kovir and the kingdom’s winter capital (there is also a summer capital, called Pont Vanis) that features in Andrzej Sapkowski’s Witcher books. With no pedestrian walkways, the only way to navigate Lan Exeter is via its canal network. Unsurprisingly, the city is essentially a wintry, fantasy Venice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Great Canal that runs through Lan Exeter leads to a number of important places, but the most important of them all is Ensenada Palace; the residence of the King of Kovir and Poviss. On the boat ride to the palace, a visitor would also be able to see the grand homes of many admirals and business magnates. It seems a sure bet that we’ll be visiting at least one or two of those estates when we visit Lan Exeter in The Witcher 4. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/03/10-1748994779998.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">10. The Next Generation of Open World RPGs</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As the demo draws to a close, Kalemba says, “I think what we’re doing together [with Epic Games] is going to bring in a new generation of open world RPGs.” But what exactly does that mean?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For us, story [and] quest is always key,” says Tremblay. “And now with the immersion, we want people to experience this world, but the technology should not be in the way. We want people to feel like they belong to this world, they interact with the world, that they can experience the emotion of the character, feeling that they are connected to the story. With our partnership and all the tools we build and all the technology, I think it'll be yet another level for us going forward.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For us, we don't want to get in the way of artistic vision,” says Johnson. “We want everybody who uses Unreal Engine to come at the tools and the technology unburdened by what they imagine and believe that it can't do. We want [them] to come to the technology with a vision of ‘Here's what we want to achieve. We're going to dream big, and we hope that the engine moves out of our way as efficiently and effectively as possible and allows us to achieve it.’” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

We're now past the rounds of creatures designed for limited, instead seeing cards you may see at places well beyond that - whether at your kitchen table, or in tournament play.</p>

<p>Check out the first part if you want to see what I'm basing my ranking of these cards on, and lets get to it, starting with one of the few uncommons to make it into Part 2.</p>

<h3><span id="cke_bm_1038S">&nbsp;</span>50. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/138/freya-crescent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Freya Crescent">Freya Crescent</a></h3>

<h3>49. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/170/zell-dincht" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zell Dincht">Zell Dincht</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zell-dincht.jpg?itok=-0H_yoow 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zell-dincht.jpg?itok=LmuP83u7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Zell is an odd card for Red, as playing with lands like this is normally green’s area, but this is strong in landfall decks as he lets you play more lands and will bring back lands to keep triggering the landfall effects.</p>

<h3>48. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/2/ultima-origin-of-oblivion" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ultima, Origin of Oblivion">Ultima, Origin of Oblivion</a></h3>

<h3>47. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/232/kuja-genome-sorcerer-trance-kuja-fate-defied" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kuja, Genome Sorcerer">Kuja, Genome Sorcerer</a></h3>

<h3>46. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/16/cyan-vengeful-samurai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cyan, Vengeful Samurai">Cyan, Vengeful Samurai</a>*</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyan-vengeful-samurai.jpg?itok=yof_tdMP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyan-vengeful-samurai.jpg?itok=K5kyXknt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Part of the <em>Final Fantasy 6</em> Commander deck, Cyan here can come down as cheap as 1 mana, and provide a growing double striking body for white inclusive recursion decks.</p>

Sign me up!</p>

<h3>44.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/37/hraesvelgr-of-the-first-brood" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hraesvelgr of the First Brood">Hraesvelgr of the First Brood</a>*</h3>

<h3>43.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/41/rikku-resourceful-guardian" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Rikku, Resourceful Guardian">Rikku, Resourceful Guardian</a>*</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rikku-resourceful-guardian.jpg?itok=fCAvCiQj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rikku-resourceful-guardian.jpg?itok=DkbR7Av2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While stealing counters is very Rikku, her first ability to grant unblockability is much bigger, and synergizes perfectly with Tidus to trigger his abilities in the <em>Final Fantasy 10 </em>Commander Deck.</p>

<h3>42. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/87/locke-treasure-hunter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Locke, Treasure Hunter">Locke, Treasure Hunter</a>*</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/locke-treasure-hunter.jpg?itok=3Cd4lFOp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/locke-treasure-hunter.jpg?itok=H-Gx77ml 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Locke in his <em>Final Fantasy 6 </em>Commander Deck form is a powerful, and evasive attacker who grants you treasure (hi <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/afc/2/prosper-tome-bound" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Prosper, Tome Bound">Prosper</a>!) and card advantage in theft… I mean treasure hunting form.</p>

<h3>41.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/65/yuffie-materia-hunter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Yuffie, Materia Hunter">Yuffie, Materia Hunter</a>*</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yuffie-materia-hunter.jpg?itok=povFY66w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yuffie-materia-hunter.jpg?itok=ZUVB8Wmj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Unlike most Ninja’s, Yuffie doesn’t need ninjutsu for her ability to trigger, instead she can just grab your opponents’ Sol Ring and grab it for yourself, while also moving equipment over to her - something that can be quite nasty with Ninjutsu.</p>

<h3>40.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/76/aerith-last-ancient" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aerith, Last Ancient">Aerith, Last Ancient</a>*</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aerith-last-ancient.jpg?itok=1XvxXteS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aerith-last-ancient.jpg?itok=ov6CaMz0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A lifegain and resurrection commander makes for a somewhat different combination than we often have, and doing it at a decent rate with options makes this Aerith interesting.</p>

<h3>39.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/249/the-wandering-minstrel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Wandering Minstrel">The Wandering Minstrel</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-wandering-minstrel_0.jpg?itok=--Gd-bP0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-wandering-minstrel_0.jpg?itok=kiJZAm4f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Surprisingly not from a Commander deck, Wandering Minstrel seems aimed more at casual and Commander play with letting your tap lands come into play, and rewarding running towns as a potential 5 color commander option.</p>

<h3>38.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/558/seymour-flux" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Seymour Flux">Seymour Flux</a>**</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/seymour-flux.jpg?itok=HLZvhyuu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/seymour-flux.jpg?itok=h2KcICF6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The latest iteration on ‘what if <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/180/phyrexian-arena" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Phyrexian Arena">Phyrexian Arena </a>was a creature’, Seymour Flux grows, but you’ll be relying on it for card advantage mostly, and its 5 mana casting cost is a significant handicap there.</p>

<h3>37. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/54/gogo-master-of-mimicry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gogo, Master of Mimicry">Gogo, Master of Mimicry</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gogo-master-of-mimicry.jpg?itok=almnGPBw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gogo-master-of-mimicry.jpg?itok=a51hd2kL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While unlikely to light up competitive tables, Gogo’s unique ability to mass copy an ability suggests a powerful card in commander and casual formats, while having a decent enough body.</p>

<h3>36. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/57/sabin-master-monk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sabin, Master Monk">Sabin, Master Monk</a>*</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sabin-master-monk.jpg?itok=9DhobXMc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sabin-master-monk.jpg?itok=NOmj5x5u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A powerful, potentially hasty and recurring double striking threat makes Sabin a potential game changer if you can give him some evasion.</p>

<h3>35. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/78/banon-the-returners-leader" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Banon, the Returners’ Leader">Banon, the Returners’ Leader</a>*</h3>

<h3>34. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/64/vincent-vengeful-atoner" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vincent, Vengeful Atoner">Vincent, Vengeful Atoner</a>*</h3>

<h3>33. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/216/cid-timeless-artificer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cid, Timeless Artificer">Cid, Timeless Artificer</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cid-timeless-artificer.jpg?itok=qbJ0Mu5w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cid-timeless-artificer.jpg?itok=-bksDXRd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With 16 different arts, there’s a Cid from each main game here, and as our representative of the relentless ability it is a very interesting and different take on it, that will see casual play aplenty.</p>

<h3>32.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/128/zodiark-umbral-god" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zodiark, Umbral God">Zodiark, Umbral God</a></h3>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy </em>is nearly here, and between the main set and the commander set, we are getting a lot of legendary creatures. In fact, there are over 150 new legendary creatures between the main <em>Final Fantasy </em>set, Commander decks, and the <em>Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy Starter Kit</em>.</p>

<p>With all of that, I undertook the task of ranking all of these creatures, from more obscure characters of games in the 1980s, to characters from the latest Final Fantasy 16. So having decided, and getting approval to do this - how are we going to rate these creatures?</p>

<p>While it is ultimately arbitrary, here is what I was considering when ranking the cards:</p>

<ul><li>Use Scenario: I took into consideration where the cards will be used, for example Commander deck cards are considered in that sense, while uncommons in the main set had more thought put into limited usage.</li>
	<li>Power: How powerful is the card at what it’s trying to do. This encompasses stats, costs, abilities, and everything else like that.</li>
	<li>Novelty: How unique is the card? Especially in cases where cards are rated similarly elsewhere, this factor will favor the card that’s doing something a bit more off the beaten path.</li>
	<li>Legends that are only so on the back end are not included - so <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/119/sidequest:-hunt-the-mark-yiazmat-ultimate-mark" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sidequest: Hunt the Mark"><em>Sidequest: Hunt the Mark</em> /// <em>Yiazmat, Ultimate Mark</em></a> isn't included, nor is the melded form of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/99b/ragnarok-divine-deliverance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ragnarok, Divine Deliverance ">Ragnarok, Divine Deliverance </a>though it is referenced on its constituent cards.</li>
	<li>Additionally, <em>Final Fantasy Through The Ages</em> cards aren't rated because they are overlay reprints and not new cards.</li>
</ul><p>Cards from the <em>Final Fantasy </em>Commander Decks will be noted with an asterisk (*), while the starter deck cards will have have two asterisks (**).</p>

<p>Because there are so many, we've split this list into two parts, and this is Part 1, and it will take us through numbers 161 to 50.</p>

<h3>161&nbsp; <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/236/omega-heartless-evolution" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Omega, Heartless Evolution">Omega, Heartless Evolution</a></h3>

<h3>160. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/3/adelbert-steiner" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Adelbert Steiner">Adelbert Steiner</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/adelbert-steiner.jpg?itok=JvOX40ay 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/adelbert-steiner.jpg?itok=R0CF8G4g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Steiner, it’s sad to say, isn't very good in Magic, as a small life linker with a situational and weak growing ability that leaves it otherwise available to die to 1/1s.</p>

<h3>159. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/33/snow-villiers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Snow Villiers">Snow Villiers</a></h3>

<h3>158. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/226/hope-estheim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hope Estheim">Hope Estheim</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hope-estheim.jpg?itok=fhGsAcxw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hope-estheim.jpg?itok=xiPcFdKv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Hope may wish that he had great power, but being a 2/2 lifelinker for 2 with what is essentially flavor text with the milling outside of specialized decks puts him down here among the worst <em>Final Fantasy</em> legend cards.</p>

<h3>157. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/237/rinoa-heartilly" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Rinoa Heartilly">Rinoa Heartilly</a></h3>

<h3>156. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/20/general-leo-cristophe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="General Leo Cristophe">General Leo Cristophe</a>*</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/general-leo-cristophe.jpg?itok=7R4OMHOL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/general-leo-cristophe.jpg?itok=mUriLzAF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If Leo cost a bit less mana he’d be much higher up on this list, as at 5 mana returning one cheap creature, and growing based on how many creatures you have is just not that good especially given he lacks any protection or evasion.</p>

<h3>155. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/33/alphinaud-leveilleur" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Alphinaud Leveilleur">Alphinaud Leveilleur</a>*</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alphinaud-leveilleur.jpg?itok=9Md5Frac 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alphinaud-leveilleur.jpg?itok=Gu5QgqGK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>4 Mana for Alphinaud is a lot, given what else you can get in card draw there, and the fact it’s only on your second spell each turn combined with a poor size make this a creature you probably leave out of your party, unless you are wanting to make use of its partner.</p>

<h3>154. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/19/gatta-and-luzzu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gatta and Luzzu">Gatta and Luzzu</a>*</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gatta-and-luzzu.jpg?itok=bqof-WAW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gatta-and-luzzu.jpg?itok=DqVZYKDE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>3 Mana is a lot for a combat trick, and while Gatta and Luzzu are a pretty decent combat trick, that cost makes it hard for anyone to consider.</p>

<h3>153. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/129/barret-wallace" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Barret Wallace">Barret Wallace</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/barret-wallace.jpg?itok=aGjhnVqc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/barret-wallace.jpg?itok=lobZp8Dj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Clearly designed for limited, this version of Barret is a decently sized creature with a somewhat useful keyword, and the ability to get some damage through a clogged board.</p>

<h3>152. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/34/stiltzkin-moogle-merchant" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stiltzkin, Moogle Merchant">Stiltzkin, Moogle Merchant</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stilitzkin-moogle-merchant.jpg?itok=F3MH1SbU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stilitzkin-moogle-merchant.jpg?itok=cjbGPeHo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From a pure power level, Stiltzkin probably should be even lower, but the moogle merchant is an interesting donating card that could open up some fun play for people, and isn’t something we see too much of.</p>

<h3>151. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/555/rosa-resolute-white-mage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Rosa. Resolute White Mage">Rosa. Resolute White Mage</a>**</h3>

<h3>150. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/554/beatrix-loyal-general" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Beatrix, Loyal General">Beatrix, Loyal General</a>**</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/beatrix-loyal-general.jpg?itok=EZGTt-eL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/beatrix-loyal-general.jpg?itok=MeC_vUj8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From the <em>Final Fantasy </em>MTG Starter Deck Beatrix lets you skip a whole lot of equip costs but at 6 mana you’re spending a lot for a 4/4 who’s more restricted on that than some other option.</p>

<h3>149. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/21/graha-tia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="G'raha Tia">G'raha Tia</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/graha-tia.jpg?itok=jJ4Jk_Z6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/graha-tia.jpg?itok=oZleVnz3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Somewhat overcosted, this version of G’raha Tia gives flying protection to the color that least needs it, and some mediocre card draw isn’t enough to make up for the fact that it costs 5 mana.</p>

<h3>148. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/83/ultros-obnoxious-octopus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ultros, Obnoxious Octopus">Ultros, Obnoxious Octopus</a></h3>

<h3>147. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/7/ashe-princess-of-dalmasca" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ashe, Princess of Dalmasca">Ashe, Princess of Darkness</a></h3>

<h3>146. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/246/tidus-blitzball-star" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tidus, Blitzball Star">Tidus, Blitzball Star</a></h3>

He’s a bit undersized at the start, but can quickly grow out of it, while removing a blocker each turn.</p>

<h3>145. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/238/rufus-shinra" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Rufus Shinra">Rufus Shinra</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rufus-shinra-and-darkstar.jpg?itok=W9KMcoyb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rufus-shinra-and-darkstar.jpg?itok=b9ImtdUH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It’s an odd thing to take away from Rufus’ actions in destroying the world that he has a dog, but that is what <em>Magic </em>has chosen, so we get here a decently sized critter who can bring a total of 4 power for 3 mana and can keep respawning the dogs from his puppy mill as needed.</p>

<h3>144. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/223/giott-king-of-the-dwarves" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Giott, King of the Dwarves">Giott, King of the Dwarves</a></h3>

<h3>143. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/234/locke-cole" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Locke Cole">Locke Cole</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/locke-cole.jpg?itok=HMOKlcQa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/locke-cole.jpg?itok=xhdYI3Wt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A saboteur looter is pretty good and going to be a limited staple, but I doubt we’ll see this Locke too much outside of that.</p>

His low ranking here is due to his lack of protection against him attacking you, unlike some similar creatures.</p>

<h3>140.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/21/heidegger-shinra-executive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Heidegger, Shinra Executive">Heidegger, Shinra Executive</a>*</h3>

<h3>139.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/9/alisaie-leveilleur" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Alisaie Leveilleur">Alisaie Leveilleur</a>*</h3>

Fortunately, there are plenty of non-human options, in the form of "occult" sims--you know, vampires, werewolves, ghosts, and all that stuff.

The rules are the same for all occult varieties. With two parents of the same occult type, the offspring is guaranteed to also be one of them--two vampire parents equals a vampire baby. With one occult parent and one normal human sim as the other parent, there's a 50% chance of the baby also having that parent's occult life state.</p><p dir="ltr">If parents of two different occult types have a kid, like if a vampire hooked up with a werewolf, the child will have an even chance of being one of the two types. But it won't be both, as the Sims 4 doesn't natively support occult hybrids. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-sims-4-mods/2900-5275/" data-ref-id="2900-5275">there are mods</a> that can help with that.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, let's dive into the details for each specific occult type.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="1__Vampire__Vampires_DLC_">1. Vampire (Vampires DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become a vampire</strong></p><p dir="ltr">You can make your sim a vampire in Create-a-Sim, by having them become pals with a vampire and ask them to turn them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What changes once your sim is a vampire</strong></p><p dir="ltr">When your sim becomes a vampire, their energy and hunger needs are replaced by vampire energy and thirst, and they'll no longer have to use the toilet. Oh, and they'll never age. But it's not all positive, as vampires can die from sun exposure, they get sick if they eat food, and they constantly need to feed their thirst for blood, or they'll go feral and start attacking people randomly.</p><p dir="ltr">Vampires also have a unique skill chart that they can progress through by doing vampire things. Through the skill chart, they can become much more powerful and remove some of the downsides of vampirism, like vulnerability to sunlight, and they'll gain special powers as they improve themselves. But leveling up their vampire skills will require taking some negative perks as well.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The path of the vampire provides an alternate method to reach some of the lifetime aspiration rewards that would otherwise take much longer to earn, like removing the need to sleep or bathe. And vampirism has a major advantage over all other forms of immortality in The Sims 4, because there's a perk that deadens your sim's emotions so they don't get super depressed any time one of their distant relatives dies--which might be pretty often if your sim has lived a long time. And while the thirst is obnoxious, it's very easy to obtain plasma packs and fruit so you don't have to feed on other sims if you don't want to.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The downsides of being a vampire are well known: sunlight will kill them, garlic is poison, they can't sleep in a normal bed, and they have to drink blood all the time. Fortunately, you can mitigate most of the biggest negatives, but the fact that you must take several bad perks along with the good ones as you level up your vampire skills means being a vampire is never smooth sailing.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to cure vampirism</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Sims who have maxed out their Vampire Lore skill will be able to mix the Ultimate Vampire Cure using the mixology skill at any bar. They just have to drink it to return to normal.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="2__Werewolf__Werewolves_DLC_">2. Werewolf (Werewolves DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become a werewolf</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Make one in Create-a-Sim, or have a werewolf bite a sim and turn.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What changes once your sim is a werewolf</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Your sim will become a werewolf, and will transform into its wolf form every full moon. They'll have a new gauge on the needs panel called Fury, which will increase regularly as a result of mood changes or doing werewolf activities--the more fury your werewolf sims have, the more animalistic their behavior will become. As part of this system, all werewolves in The Sims 4 have a temperament that dictates what sorts of things get them riled up.</p><p dir="ltr">Werewolves also have their own unique skill tree that will allow them to level up their abilities and dampen some of the downsides. In addition to the standard skill tree, werewolves can unlock six dormant abilities by doing specific activities. And, naturally, they can form wolf packs that run together--this social group is key to werewolf happiness, as they aren't loners like vampires.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Playing as a werewolf provides some pretty offbeat new options for how to play The Sims 4--one werewolf perk, for example, allows your sim to eat the furniture, and another allows you to quickly travel around by burrowing through the ground. And, like most occult types, once you've maxed out the skill tree, your sim can live forever. They'll still age, but they won't die from being old.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The Fury meter can be pretty obnoxious to keep under control in the early goings, as going into a rampage is really not great for your sim's social standing in the community. But werewolves don't have any mortal vulnerabilities like vampires do. Even so, this is the most esoteric of the occult states, making it the biggest departure from standard Sims 4 gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to cure the werewolf condition</strong></p><p dir="ltr">A sim can turn back into a regular person using the Lunar Epiphany dormant ability, which is unlocked by reading werewolf tomes.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="3__Spellcaster__Realm_of_Magic_DLC_">3. Spellcaster (Realm of Magic DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become a spellcaster</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Using Create-a-Sim, by asking for the Rite of Ascension from one of the sages in the Magic Realm, or by asking another spellcaster sim who is powerful enough.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What changes when your sim is a spellcaster</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Spellcasters will unlock a unique skill tree that they can progress through by using any magical ability, but they'll also have to learn magic powers and alchemical recipes individually. Your sim can do this by practicing each of the three magic types to learn spells, or by experimenting with a cauldron to learn potion recipes. They'll also be able to use magic wands, which will enhance their powers.</p><p dir="ltr">However, using magic will also increase a new spellcaster charge meter--the higher that meter is, the more likely a spell will malfunction and might kill your sim.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Learning spells and potions will unlock all sorts of mundane abilities that will make your sim's life easier, like the ability to repair any broken object in an instant, or duplicate stuff. You could brew a Potion of Plentiful Needs, which fills all your sim's need meters, and then use the copypasto spell to dupe it until you have a lifetime supply of them for your entire extended family. Your sim can also brew a Potion of Immortality, which will prevent them from ever dying of old age, or use a spell to turn a ghost back into a living sim.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">There are no downsides to becoming a spellcaster. Everything about this lifestate is an improvement.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to get rid of your spellcaster status</strong></p><p dir="ltr">You can take the Rite of Dissolution from any of the sages in the Magic Realm to remove your spellcaster status. If your sim then decides to become a spellcaster again later, their power will be at the same level as it was before, but you'll need to reassign the skill tree perks again.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="4__Alien__Get_to_Work_DLC_">4. Alien (Get to Work DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become an alien</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Sims cannot turn into aliens--they have to be made in Create-a-Sim, or born that way. But a sim can use a satellite to goad aliens into abducting them, which sometimes results in an alien pregnancy regardless of your sim's gender. Kids born as a result will always be aliens.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What's different when playing as an alien</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Not much changes with the alien life state compared with the other occult types. Aliens can have blue or purple skin, and can disguise themselves as humans to avoid any awkwardness. There's no skill tree, per se, but aliens have unique abilities, like being able to transmute a metal or crystal into another kind of metal or crystal at random. They also have empathy skills that allow them to understand the feelings of any sim they speak to, and they can also copy their emotional state.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Essentially, playing as an alien sim is like playing as a normal sim but with a couple extra perks. So it's different, but not <em>that</em> different.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">None</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="5__Mermaid__Island_Living_DLC_">5. Mermaid (Island Living DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become a mermaid</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Using Create-a-sim, being born that way, or by eating Mermadic Kelp that you can find in the world or purchase from the aspiration rewards for 500 points.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What changes when your sim is a mermaid</strong></p><p dir="ltr">When a sim becomes a mermaid, they grow a tail. They can still turn back into their normal form with legs when on land, however. They'll also swap the hunger need for the unique hydration need--mermaids have to stay moist, or they will die.</p><p dir="ltr">Mermaids receive a number of inherent abilities, which deplete the hydration meter with each use--you'll need to be careful with them or else your sim will dry themselves out. They can sing various lullabies that inspire specific moods in the sims who hear them. They can talk to fish and dolphins, and they can do evil stuff too, like luring swimmers into the water and then pulling them under, potentially drowning them. They can also control the weather to a small degree.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">If your sim lives in Sulani or another watery world, the mermaid's ability to swim much faster than a normal sim can be a huge boon, and the ability to talk to and become pals with fish is fun.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The hydration meter can be tougher to deal with if you don't live next to the ocean. While baths and showers do help, swimming in pools or using hot tubs (or anything else with chlorinated water) will actually dry your sim out more.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="6__Ghost__Life__amp__Death_DLC_">6. Ghost (Life &amp; Death DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become a ghost</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Die.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What changes when your sim becomes a ghost</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Your sim will no longer be a corporeal being, and will instead become a glowing spirit. This unlocks the Ghost Mastery skill tree, which allows a sim not just to gain new ghostly abilities, but also to choose whether they become a good ghost or a dastardly one. Examples of the bad ghost abilities include haunting household objects, giving other sims nightmares, or cursing them with bad luck. On the friendly side of things, a ghost sim can replenish a living sim's needs, save the life of a sim who just died, or just bless them with good fortune.</p><p dir="ltr">Occult sims who died as a result of their weakness, like a vampire dying to sunlight, will retain their occult abilities in their ghost form.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Since they have no physical presence, ghosts can do a lot of random things normal sims can't, like walking through walls or even other sims--which makes them feel strange, but in a good way. Ghosts can also do jump scares for fun.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">While a ghost can do most things a regular sim can, there are limits--a ghost can't have a kid, for one thing.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to stop being a ghost</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The ghost state is the only occult state that can be cured in multiple different ways. A ghost can be turned back into a living sim using a Book of Life written by an author sim, by cooking ambrosia, or by using the magic spell Dedeathify. A ghost can also pass on and be reincarnated as a new sim by swimming in the waters of Revenwood.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-how-to-capture-creatures/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>You'll do a lot of collecting in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>, including collecting the creatures you discover while roaming the four main planets you visit across the game's story. In some cases, capturing and researching these creatures is essential to your progression in the game.</p>
<p>So, how do you capture creatures? Some of the exact details for each creature change the process slightly, but the rules are mostly the same. This guide will show you how to capture creatures in Revenge of the Savage Planet, so you'll be prepared for anything that has the misfortune of being in your way.</p>
<h2>Revenge Of The Savage Planet - How To Capture Creatures</h2>
<p>Before we get into the how of capturing creatures in Revenge of the Savage Planet, you'll need to make sure you've already collected your whip. Without it, you can't capture anything. You'll also want to make sure that you're not surrounded by plenty of other creatures that will be hostile towards you.</p>
<p>Any interruption means you restart the process, so it's good to single out one creature to capture at a time.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When you have a creature you want to capture in your sights, the very first thing you'll want to do is scan it. Jump into scanning mode, and give it a scan, even if you've already scanned that species. The info box that will appear next to it will remind you of anything you need to be aware of when engaging and trying to capture that creature.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>What you do next will depend on the size of the creature you're trying to capture. Most creatures will require you to stun them in some way, usually by hitting a weak spot with your blaster. Others don't need that kind of preamble. You can just hold your whip button until you're swinging it over your head like a lasso. You'll be able to tell if it can be captured if a small circle appears on the creature, signifying that your whip is locked on.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Once you've locked onto the creature, release your whip and you'll start a small tug-of-war mini-game with the creature. Just keep the whip button held, and so long as you're not interrupted, you'll pull the creature close enough to capture it.</li>
</ul>

            <p>
Tron is a world that I feel constantly surprised by its perseverance in just flat out still being a thing all these years later. And yet, I never feel upset about it given that the vibes of Tron just absolutely rule no matter the context in which they're being delivered, the upcoming Jared Leto led film notwithstanding because of that guy's whole vibe. In terms of what's actually next for the fictitious video game world, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tron-catalyst">Tron: Catalyst</a> from the folks over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bithell-games">Bithell Games</a>, and as it so happens, there's a demo out for it today!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025590/TRON_Catalyst/">available on Steam</a>, apparently makes up the first hour of the game, which certainly sounds like a healthy amount of time to suss out its vibes. In case you missed the announcement on this one, Tron: Catalyst is a top-down, sort of but not quite isometric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game where you play as Exo, a courier whose life gets shaken up by a mysterious package exploding leaving him with unusual abilities.
</p>
<p>
It's set in the Arq <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grid">Grid</a>, a location previously established in Bithell Games' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tron-identity">Tron: Identity</a>, a visual novel set in the Disney-owned universe. Storywise, the Arq Grid is a bit unstable, with glitches causing time to loop, and only Exo can see them. Lots of good stuff to latch onto here, and yes, you do have a Disc to fight with and a Light Cycle to ride around on, everything you'd want from a Tron game is here.
</p>
<p>
If you're not the demo type, one, did you never buy a copy of Official PlayStation Magazine in the 2000s, and, two, that's fine, because it's due out on June 17th, just a couple of weeks away. I'm sure that's enough time to get some distance from the launch of the Switch 2, and Summer Game Fest, and tomorrow's PlayStation showcase, and the millions of other showcases happening in way too short of a timespan.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/state-of-unreal-persona-device-ai-demo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unreal%E2%80%99s-ai-demo-had-no-point.1206234/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/state-of-unreal-persona-device-ai-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During this morning’s State of Unreal presentation, Epic showed a first look at what Executive Vice President Saxs Persson called the “next step” from <em>Fortnite</em>’s recent <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-ai-darth-vader-star-wars-epic-games-sag-aftra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI Darth Vader disaster</a>: tools to create AI-powered NPCs that respond to players’ speech. This was demonstrated by a demo controlled by two guys named Andrew, who played a bad <em>Portal</em> knockoff that we’re all supposed to believe is the future.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="State of Unreal 2025 Official 4K Livestream I Unreal Fest Orlando" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AjikvaR0i34?start=6785&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Using what Epic calls a “Persona Device,” developers can set parameters for an AI character’s knowledge and personality; in this instance, an entity called “Mr. Buttons” that wants to get the player to push a button. The AI draws from “facts” written in natural language. Mr. Buttons is told to “Encourage [the player] to press the button; narrate stories, use poems or songs of entities that discovered new realms by taking a single action while adding comedic commentary.” It’s encouraged to “prioritize playful banter” and “include humor metaphors.” Conversely, it’s told to avoid the phrase “you say” as cover for parroting the players’ words, to not call the player “a player,” and not to swear.</p><figure><figcaption>The "facts" for Mr. Buttons in the Persona Device</figcaption></figure><p>It more or less does all these things. (It does sprinkle a “you say” in there.) Mr. Buttons tries to be grandiose and compellingly evasive, refusing to say precisely what the button does while hyping it up. “Think of the stories we could tell, the realms we could conquer,” it hints. When the Andrews try to leave the area through a door, it pulls them back to the button and gets angry, though never overly so. If you look at this purely as a tech demo, devoid of context or the requirement to be a good piece of writing (because, of course, it isn’t a piece of writing), it’s not unimpressive. It is, at its base level, a clear character with a strong motivation, able to respond to any question the Andrews ask it, all of it created out of what Persson says is “about 20 lines of text in total.”</p><p>But the actual scene that plays out sucks. It’s formless and meandering; the conversation doesn’t build, and Mr. Buttons’ threats and enticements don’t escalate, instead bumping against the confines of its parameters until the Andrews inevitably push the button. Mr. Buttons feels like it’s trying to have the omnipotent, shady vibes of <em>Portal</em>’s GLaDOS, but it can’t attain the wordplay and creativity of that character because it wasn’t written by real human writers. It does reach toward cleverness: at one point, when an Andrew asks what the button does, it says the button is “a gateway to glory, a ticket to transformation, a symphony of–well, you get the idea. It does things.” That <em>sounds</em> funny, right? There’s alliteration, a sense of build, and then a comedic letdown in the form of a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/why-does-everyone-in-netflixs-cowboy-bebop-talk-like-that/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whedon-esque</a> “things.” It has the shape of a line a writer would write and a voice actor would say.&nbsp;</p><p>But any humor in this line is bungled by the stilted, flat delivery; it doesn’t say the line in a funny way, because of course it can’t. Mr. Buttons makes thinking sounds as it processes in ways that don’t make sense for the character. At a couple points in the conversation it mispronounces dramatic bellows of “noooow” and “dooo” in ways that make it clear it’s AI; not in the robotic delivery of Ellen McLain, an intentional choice made by humans, but just because that’s how voice software works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of this is only “good” if you hold it against the standards of what AI can do, something that you, a regular person reading this, have no need to engage in. If I were playing this experience without knowing it was AI, I would think some beginning creators had taken their best shot at writing and voice acting. I’d root for the humans who made it, maybe. But as AI, it’s just… pointless. It’s made an experience there’s no reason to play, its only praise-worthy feature that it made something worse than humans could do without requiring very much active human input. It might be impressive as a 13-year-old’s English class project, given that its parameters demonstrate a firm understanding of character and motivation. But if actual game developers put this in front of me–worse still, if they wanted my money–I’d just think they were lazy hacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Through the demo, Mr. Buttons reassures the Andrews that nothing bad will happen to the audience once they press the button. But something does: they press it, the screen and stage go dark, and then Tim Sweeney appears. Sweeney says, “Well, they pressed the AI button. And it might have been a bad idea, but, like, in truth, there’s no unpressing that button.” Sweeney goes on to say, with <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91336991/openai-anthropic-deepseek-ai-models-environmental-impact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no hint of irony</a>, that “When the world’s on fire, we [at Epic] like to back up and remember our aims as game developers: it’s to make fun games. And AI can help us with this. So we’ve come to see AI as an opportunity to have a multiplying force on human creatives.”&nbsp;</p><p>He calls it “multiplying” with <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-ai-jobs-apocalypse-is-for-the" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no hint of irony</a> either, going on to cite the ability for small teams to make characters and code more easily. This of course also means more people able to make things more easily within Epic’s ecosystem. Epic’s collaborations with Disney and Lego featured heavily in the State of Unreal presentation; an easily-deployed theme park of interactive licensed characters is surely appealing to plenty of brands once the kinks are worked out. The goal, as it’s always been with AI, isn’t to make <em>good</em> stuff, or even <em>better</em> stuff; it’s just to make <em>more.</em></p><p>Sweeney’s right that there’s no unpressing the AI button; companies are going to make these things until the bottom falls out. Epic’s demo is just <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-npcs-nvidia-unity-ubisoft-convai-inworld" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one more</a> uninspiring bit of buzzwordery to add to the pile. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/witcher-4-kelpie"><h3>I Am Going To Do Right By The Witcher 4’s New Horse</h3></a><p>A new horse is too much pressure for me, a noted Witcher failure</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-nightreign-starter-guide"><h3>What You Should Know Before Starting Elden Ring Nightreign</h3></a><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is condensed and fast paced, so here's some tips from our friends at Big Friendly Guide.</p><div><div><p><span><span>Ryan Gilliam</span><span> and </span></span><span><span>Jeffrey Parkin</span></span></p></div><p><span>May 30, 2025</span></p></div></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-parrying-clair-obscur-ea"><h3>It’s Never Too Late To Talk About A Video Game</h3></a><p>It's also never too late to have *obviously correct* opinions about video game mechanics</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/aaa-gaming-veterans-found-two-new-studios-called-giant-skull-and-emptyvessel/">Empty Vessel</a>, the studio founded by former id Software developers and comprised of people who've worked on Doom, The Last of Us, Call of Duty, Borderlands, Uncharted, and more, has just closed out its series A round of funding for its debut project, DEFECT, with&nbsp;<strong>$11 million</strong> total raised from this round.</p>
<p>The additional funds will allow Empty Vessel to expand the team, per a <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/emptyvessel-Expands-DEFECT-Game-Development-with-Series-A-Close">press release</a>, and scale to the point where they can work on bringing DEFECT to consoles, and add support for single-player experiences on top of DEFECT already being a multiplayer-focused game.</p>
<p>When we last heard about DEFECT and Empty Vessel, it was with news that NCSOFT had made "<em>a strategic equity investment</em>" in the studio to help DEFECT get out the door, so it's no surprise that NCSOFT was one of the companies that led this series A round of funding, alongside 1AM Gaming, and Black Phoenix Games.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEFECT | Official Reveal Trailer (Unreal In Engine) | Wishlist Now" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IScUN3ZYeR8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em>It's gratifying to see our developer-first approach resonating with fans and our new long-term partners at NCSOFT alongside our other investors</em>," said chief executive officer at Empty Vessel and game director on DEFECT, Emmanuel Palalic.</p>
<p>"<em>We remain committed to our vision of creating a new genre in the FPS market with DEFECT, and while we are building in a sustainable manner, this new investment will allow us to accelerate our plans for proper single-player support and to expand onto more platforms</em>."</p>
<p>For NCSOFT, the chief executive officer of NC America, and chief operating officer of NC West, Jeonghee 'JJ' Jin added "<em>Empty Vessel's distinct vision for game design, production, and player interaction made us quick believers in their upcoming shooter, DEFECT. We're committed to the evolution and future of this incredible game</em>."</p>
<p>1AM Gaming's managing director, Gregory Milken added "<em>We believe that Empty Vessel is a unique studio working on an amazing game, so we are thrilled to join them as a key investor as they work towards bringing a fresh perspective for first person shooter games with DEFECT</em>."</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Mix Summer Showcase ran over 90 minutes and offered quick looks at dozens of upcoming games. Formerly known as Guerrilla Collective, the showcase is one of many indie events swirling around the orbit of Summer Game Fest, and unlike many of the bigger games getting shown off in the days ahead, some of these have playable demos right now while others are likely getting them in the weeks and months ahead. </p><p>We picked out nine that caught our eye. Some of them were being shown for the first time. Others were previously revealed but had gone under our radar since, or popped up with fresh trailers showing a deeper look at story, world-building, and gameplay. But there were a ton more games worth checking out and wishlisting in the full showcase. You can see all of them for yourself in the video below. </p></div></div><div><p>The most intriguing reveal was a tactical RPG from a small studio called Hypersect led by a former <em>Destiny</em> sandbox gameplay engineer, an <em>Octopath Traveler </em>monster artist, and the composer of <em>Enter the Gungeon</em>. <em>Never’s End</em>’s pitch? <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> collides with city management as you raise an army of possessed warriors to protect the last human settlement from a magical apocalypse. There’s no release date yet but it’s coming to PC and PlayStation. </p></div><div><p> <em>Airframe Ultra</em> looks like <em>Wipeout</em> meets <em>Twisted Metal</em>. It’s got a slick PS1 presentation and a gritty vibe that would fit right at home on a long-lost demo disc. It’s the newest project from<em> Rain World </em>maker Videocult so it will probably be uncompromising in every way. </p></div><div><p>Rig dice to beat evil billionaires at their own deranged games. That’s the basic premise of <em>Dead Finger Dice</em>, a point-and-click roguelike about gambling with ghouls and trying to escape the yacht they’ve imprisoned you on. It’s giving <em>Inscryption</em> meets<em> Cryptmaster</em> if they were made in MS-DOS. A survival horror spin on <em>Balatro</em>? Let’s go. </p></div><div><p>The gardenvania subgrene expands with Beauty Cult’s <em>Nectarmancer</em>, a gorgeous-looking action platformer that doubles as a farming sim. Grow crops and fight in tight 2D spaces as you try to take down The Throne, a mysterious cabal exploiting the world’s resources for its own gain. Here’s the line from the Steam page that sold me: “Use a network of plants and their latent nectarmancy to build up a planet-scale biological research computer to acquire even more nectar.” Yes. Yes I will. </p></div><div><p>At first glance I thought <em>Critterrupters</em> was an<em> Animal Crossing</em> clone but it’s actually more like<em> Pokémon</em>. Go from 3D exploration to 2D turn-based augmented reality battles with a focus on interrupting your opponent’s attack to gain an advantage. There’s over 100  Critter Chips to collect, train, and “puzzle out” with the goal of defeating gym leaders and meeting the creator of the virtual Tamagotchi-based warriors. </p></div><div><p>Motorslice is an atmospheric parkour adventure in which you wall-run and slash your way through a futuristic construction site with the vibe of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> inside a mega city. Think indie, PS2-era <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> with a sword and heavy machinery boss fights. There’s a bit of a Tarkovskian undertone. <em>Prince of Persia</em> is also an influence according to the developers. Should I just keep name-dropping cool stuff?</p></div><div><p>A boomer shooter segment near the end of the showcase included a bunch of experimental first-person shooters, but <em>Moros Protocol</em> has been in production for five years and is the one that stuck out to me. The sci-fi roguelike combines <em>Doom </em>and <em>Dark Souls</em> for a low-poly fever dream that supports co-op. “And yes, you can kick your enemies,” the devs write. </p></div><div><p><em>Nocturne </em>is a story-focused JRPG that uses rhythm gameplay for its combat. <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/chrono-trigger-meets-guitar-hero-was-not-on-my-bingo-card-but-ill-take-it-regardless&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/chrono-trigger-meets-guitar-hero-was-not-on-my-bingo-card-but-ill-take-it-regardless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">likened it to</a></span> “<em>Chrono Trigger</em> meets <em>Guitar Hero</em>.” It might not end up an all-time classic like those, but the pixel art and soundtrack are pretty neat. What’s it about? “Your consciousness was uploaded to a world where a sentient AI has taken control, twisted creatures roam the land, and a vast corruption spreads.” An increasingly relatable predicament!</p></div><div><p><em>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road </em>mixes and matches elements from lots of popular genres, including city builders and arcade-y bullet hell grindfests. The neat thing here is that the city you grow travels around and turns into a weapon itself, unleashing hell in <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style horde mode onslaughts. There’s a closed beta happening later this summer. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
