			<p>If you're going to be a blood-sucker, you at least want to be fashionable when you do it. In a new dev diary released by The Chinese Room and Paradox Interactive, they've teamed up to discuss how fashion plays a part in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. Each clan has its own set of styles that make it easily identifiable when speaking to them or exploring the streets of Seattle.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-character-trailer-shows-off-the-kindred-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/">four base clans</a> of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 each have their own unique style to represent personality, history, and subcultures through their fashion. When creating the fashion in the game, they wanted to make sure that they were offering players "a variety of styles to suit their tastes."&nbsp; Not only did they make sure that there were different outfits for the Protagonist, but they also made sure that the Foley was fairly attributed to the outfit, with the sounds of shoes or the rustling of clothes. For example, "creating a more stealth-like feeling or the aggressive presence that one might expect between Banu Haqim vs Brujah," says Lead Audio Designer Tessa Verplancke.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Additionally, making sure that outfits matter in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, characters are also able to judge their outfits, such as interactions you have with Tolly. This is shown in a brief clip on the <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-fashion-matters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paradox Interactive website</a>.</p>
<p>As the protagonist in this game, clothing matters because of the sound it can make. For example, if you want to feed on the right Blood Resonance, you need to make sure that you're wearing clothes that fit the mood of the person you're approaching.</p>
<p>"Just knowing that the angry sex worker nearby is full of choleric blood and ready for a fight is just step one. Step two is making sure that you're wearing something that will push them over the edge and really make that blood boil. Dressing and acting like a wealthy John could get them talking, but if you approach looking like someone who likes it rough? That might scare them right out of their angry mood, and then all that delicious choleric potential goes away," says Senior Narrative Designer Arone LeBray.</p>
<p>This dev diary is now the 21st diary released by Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room, providing a wealth of information about the importance of character customization and making sure you know how to dress appropriately for the occasion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289674/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-backward-compatibility<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Nintendo’s next console is going to have a kickass library of games to start. Last night, when there was absolutely <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289558/in-case-you-missed-it">nothing else of note happening in the world</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">Nintendo announced that its still-unannounced Switch successor would be backward-compatible with existing Switch games</a>. The announcement is an early sign that Nintendo might be able to avoid the painful transition between consoles and better unify its growing ambitions.</p></div><p>Backward compatibility is not a guarantee of success. The Wii U could play most Wii games, and it still ended up being a failure. But it’s a feature that benefits both consumers and the industry at large. In Nintendo’s case, its inclusion was never a sure thing. While bestselling hardware like the Wii and DS were able to play games from their predecessors, Nintendo often started over from scratch with a new console generation — which meant that players did, too.</p><p>The library of games you had built up over the lifespan of the Nintendo 64 or SNES stayed with that console. This is what has allowed Nintendo to resell <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> across countless devices; if you want to play the classics on the newest console, you usually have no choice but to buy it again. Otherwise, you’re forced to keep a Wii U around in order to enjoy that copy of <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD</em>. It sucks for consumers and it sucks for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23850347/video-game-preservation">video game preservation</a>, given how quickly older titles can become inaccessible.</p><p>Backward compatibility for the Switch is especially notable given what an incredible library it has accumulated. In fact, while the Switch is Nintendo’s second-bestselling piece of hardware, it has sold more games than any other Nintendo platform. During <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">an investor presentation</a>, the company said that the Switch’s “cumulative software sales have reached 1.3061 billion units, setting a new record for a Nintendo gaming platform. More software has been played on Nintendo Switch than on any other Nintendo hardware.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>That’s not a surprise when you think about the games that have come out since 2017: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128015/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a>, and a whole lot of <em>Pokémon</em>. Ironically, the Switch was helped in a way by its lack of backward compatibility; Nintendo was able to keep up a steady stream of releases by putting out a number of Wii U ports. The Switch’s bestselling game is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/1/23941695/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-6-dlc-tracks-release-date-characters">an enhanced version of <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></a>.</p></div><p>The decision to support backward compatibility means that all of those games will immediately be available to anyone who picks up the next console. For existing Switch owners, it imbues their collection with more value; for newcomers, it means they have a huge library to dive into from the jump.</p><div><p>The decision also helps explain why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24185022/nintendo-switch-2024-game-lineup-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Nintendo has barely slowed down with releases, even as the Switch approaches the end of its life</a>. The first-party games that came out in 2024 — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24287092/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112407/princess-peach-showtime-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Princess Peach: Showtime</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> — will likely have a lifespan well beyond the final years of the Switch. That’s also why there are still more big Switch games in the works, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em></a>. Nintendo is even making services that exist beyond a single console, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288201/nintendo-music-streaming-hands-on-impressions">the just-launched Nintendo Music streaming app</a>.</p></div><p>Signs have been pointing to this kind of more unified Nintendo for some time. The company’s account system links together various services and games, and more than a decade ago, Nintendo merged its console and portable game development divisions so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17478950/nintendo-switch-structure-success-shinya-takahashi-interview">that everyone was focused on the Switch</a>. It has created more cohesiveness across the company’s offerings, which has become increasingly important <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">as Nintendo branches out in new directions</a>. This has led to at least one sensible decision that sets up the Switch’s successor for a strong start — now we wait to see what oddball decision will make the new console distinctly “Nintendo.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m having a fun time with it so far, even if it has some glaring annoyances.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196452,195207" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First, the good news: a few hours with <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> (developed by Leikir Studio and published by Dotemu) convinced me it’s a decent strategy RPG that combines the roguelike structure and emphasis on puzzle combat with some new character mechanics that help spice things up a bit. Instead of a linear campaign, you select a squad of fighters, choose a region, and then progress through random map encounters until you get to a boss fight.</p><p>On the battlefield, fighters like Eri, Fio, and Marco each have unique equipment and skills that can be improved and customized throughout a run. Unlike traditional grid-based strategy games, most attacks happen along a straight line from where the character is currently stationed, making positioning, terrain, and elevation key factors in whether a fight goes your way or not. </p><figure id="" data-id="8430624a57c37f35886e60eb191b5235" data-recommend-id="image://8430624a57c37f35886e60eb191b5235" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A GIF shows a synergy combo in Metal Slug Tactics.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Harkening back to <em>Metal Slug</em>’s original 2D side-scrolling shooter incarnations, your characters accrue a bonus called “adrenaline” as they move around the battlefield. It grants additional advantages and buffs, rewarding versatile and aggressive play rather than just sitting back and turtling. Synergy abilities, meanwhile, let nearby allies join in follow-up combo attacks to press the advantage. </p><p>The result is combat that requires you to think on your feet and adapt to the situation at hand instead of devising a strategy ahead of time and just worrying about the execution. Combined with slick, retro pixel art and a solid soundtrack, the overall <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> experience feels tight, rewarding, and well-balanced between thoughtfully teasing out solutions to the combat puzzles at hand and keeping the action moving with quick missions and straightforward objectives.</p><figure id="" data-id="3ff8857c4603aea8aaa1cbdcac163390" data-recommend-id="image://3ff8857c4603aea8aaa1cbdcac163390" data-format="png" data-width="1137" data-height="631" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An upgrade menu screen uses incredibly tiny text.

While the finished <em>Metal Slug Tactics </em>mostly lives up to the gorgeous trailers fans <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-slug-tactics-is-metal-slug-but-with-turn-based-t-1847076096&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-slug-tactics-is-metal-slug-but-with-turn-based-t-1847076096">have been gawking at for years</a></span>, there are some real shortcomings. I’ve been playing on PlayStation 5 (it’s also on Game Pass), where I’ve experienced both a frustrating amount of stuttering on the performance end and, even worse, some really poorly optimized UI and font sizes on the quality-of-life side.</p><p>Most games nowadays feel designed with a PC monitor a couple of feet from your face in mind when it comes to screen layout and the size of features like action menus and text boxes. Even starting at that baseline, however, <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> was particularly painful to try and read and navigate from a living room setup, even when I moved within five feet of my TV. Checking through Steam and various subreddits, I’ve seen complaints specifically about font sizes and readability for the Switch and PC versions cropping up as well.</p><p>Both the shaky performance and miserable UI (I really wish the UI and fonts weren’t such a headache to decipher on console) can probably be fixed with post-launch patches, but the missing polish and strained eyes are hard to ignore. The rest of <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> is a compelling, if not super deep, retro roguelike strategy experience that’s worth checking out for fans of <em>Metal Slug</em> and games like <em>Into the Breach</em> alike—especially if the team behind the game can get the other issues worked out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unlike Valve's Steam controller, which featured uncommon inputs like dual trackpads instead of thumbsticks, Hori's controller features a traditional controller design. It has all the expected face buttons, shoulder bumpers, triggers, a D-pad, and two thumbsticks that are offset like those on Xbox and Nintendo Switch Pro controllers.</p><p dir="ltr">While the Wireless Horipad for Steam looks like a standard controller, it offers a few extra features you won't find on your typical third-party Windows gamepad--for example, the inclusion of the Steam Deck's Options and Quick Access Menu, which lets you call up and navigate Steam's various Big Picture Mode menus.</p><p dir="ltr">The Steam Horipad also has four additional remappable buttons--two on the front and two back paddles--trigger locks with two stop points, and support for gyro controls and turbo mode. Sadly, there is no rumble functionality, and the thumbsticks lack anti-drift Hall Effect sensors that are becoming more common on third-party controllers--but they do feature touch sensitivity, just like the thumbsticks on a Steam Deck.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">As noted above, the Wireless Horipad for Steam works wirelessly on Windows and Steam Deck, with an estimated 12-hour battery life. This mode uses Steam's proprietary SteamInput controller driver to allow for the Steam-specific functionality, but there's also a Windows-only X-Input mode that is usable over a wired USB connection if you want to play non-Steam games on PC. Windows users will also be able to adjust controller settings like thumbstick sensitivity and button mapping using Hori's desktop app.</p><p dir="ltr">The Wireless Horipad for Steam will cost $60 at launch. That puts it in the same price range as the excellent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Charging-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9BDMWWN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a>, which has Hall Effect sticks and supports PC, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24289524/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-pc-ps5-xbox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>At one point in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271682/life-is-strange-double-exposure-preview"><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em></a>’s third episode, Max Caulfield tried to discuss the well-being of a student named Reggie with Loretta, another student on campus. Loretta became somewhat bewildered, asking Max who exactly she was referring to. That was when Max realized, much to her chagrin, that she had gotten the two parallel realities of Loretta mixed up. Turns out, one Loretta has met Reggie, but the other hasn’t. (Don’t ask me which; I can’t remember offhand, either.)</p><p>This moment is emblematic of how rapidly <em>Double Exposure</em> flits between its two universes. There’s the “Living World,” in which her best friend Safi was alive, and the “Dead World” where she wasn’t. Several puzzles in the game follow this trajectory: to circumvent certain obstacles when investigating Safi’s death, Max would tear a massive rift into the other reality to gather information she would otherwise not be privy to or grab some useful object as if pulling off a magician’s hat trick before returning to the first.</p><p>While this gimmick is a nifty mechanic that adds a fascinating dimension to Max’s sleuthing,&nbsp;it can also get confusing and tedious, especially as events are spun off in wildly different directions. Even Max’s fastidious note-taking does little to assuage this frustration. Ultimately, while the power does offer a look into the otherwise unseen facets of Max’s life, it’s also troublesome as a mechanic, at times reducing interactions to fetch quests.</p><p><em>This piece contains spoilers about&nbsp;</em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure, <em>its finale, and the first </em>Life is Strange<em>.</em></p><p>This tedium is why, as Max shuttles back and forth between the two realities with the flourish of a seasoned illusionist, there’s a sense that her inner turmoil is only growing. Her interactions vary between realities, and so do the myriad events that take place, leaving ripples in the way her relationships develop between universes. For instance, Max is close friends with the school’s administrative assistant in one universe but merely acquaintances in another. It’s no wonder she often engages in moments of quietude and self-reflection, such as pondering her decision to bombard a friend with relentless questions or ruminating over the dirty laundry of a disgraced colleague.</p><p>Thus it’s no surprise that as Max starts using her powers more, <em>Double Exposure </em>picks up from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271682/life-is-strange-double-exposure-preview">the largely languid pace of the first two episodes</a>. The melodrama has significantly ramped up from episode two’s astonishing cliffhanger, with major twists hinted at and then audaciously delivered with a sleight of hand. While it’s easy for these to become contrived, and for <em>Double Exposure</em> to lose the emotional core of its tale — that is, the game’s smaller, more tender moments of affection — <em>Double Exposure</em> hardly falters, persisting without drowning in these bombastic reveals.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news is that Max is learning to live with her grief from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up">the first game</a>. Small yet crucial choices, such as retaliating against a self-absorbed colleague by interrupting his class, using her supernatural powers to unravel clues, and even choosing which love interest to kiss (or none at all), paint a portrait of Max’s identity. Then there’s the pivotal scenario in which Max is seemingly confronted with the prospect of making yet another impossible decision but realizing that she can simply choose not to choose at all. <em>Double Exposure</em> is also at its most confident narratively when it’s chronicling her growth, with the game deftly bringing together the grandiose plot twists and the quieter, more intimate scenes with incredible sentiment.</p><p>But the final episode is where <em>Double Exposure</em> seems to run out of space for such ruminations. Episode five is eventually reduced to a series of rooms, with Max simply jogging from one door to the next to rescue the cast from their ghastly predicament. Familiar artifacts from her past life in Arcadia Bay, like the steel chair used by her ex-professor Jefferson, resurface, creating the macabre quality of a strange lucid dream sequence. A massive bowling alley mascot leers menacingly at Max as she struggles to break out of her restraints again. Binders full of photographs — the centerpiece of Jefferson’s twisted portfolio — taunt Max into perusing them once more. It’s a throwback to Max’s meltdown in the final episode of the original <em>Life is Strange</em>, but it felt like such an obligatory nod that it was more repetitive than inventive.</p><p>More disappointing still is that, in its conclusion, <em>Double Exposure</em> has opted to clumsily reconstruct the series — one beloved for exploring the emotional depths of everyday life — into a sci-fi story featuring a cast of troubled superheroic teens. It fails to understand that these powers, like Daniel’s telekinetic abilities in <em>Life is Strange 2,</em> are merely a lens with which to examine the anxieties of life at a heightened level. Without a stronger emotional hook, this development feels like a ham-fisted attempt to expand <em>Life is Strange</em> into an endlessly repeatable formula, set in another cinematic universe. A bigger failure is how Max is being established as the face of this new direction, with the credits announcing that “Max Caulfield Will Return.” </p><p>Perhaps an ending where Max gets a reprieve from the slew of misfortunes that the world seems to enjoy hurling at her is too idealistic. After all, reality can be just as perverse for the rest of us. But the idea that <em>Life is Strange</em> will present Max’s powers as somehow extraordinary feels a bit discordant. This isn’t the conclusion that <em>Double Exposure</em> deserves.</p><p><small><em>All episodes of </em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure<em> are available now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Workers at the French gaming studio Don't Nod--the developers behind Jusant, Life is Strange 1 and 2, and upcoming release Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage--are set to strike this week due to imminent layoffs. The <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/10/dont-nod-call-for-strike-on-friday-november-8th/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">STJV</a> (Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo, "Video Games Workers Union") announced that the picket line will be next to the studio's headquarters in Paris.</p><p>Last week, the union called for a strike due to the 69 jobs at the studio that are at risk. Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert explained that a new initiative was designed for a "reorganization project to ensure the company's long-term future" amid "deteriorating" financial results.</p><p>"Our half-year results for 2024 reflect the economic underperformance of our latest release, despite solid ratings on Metacritic, as well as the accounting impact of the decisions we had to take. The initial performance support measures announced last spring no longer seem sufficient to maintain the company's competitiveness," Guilbert said <a href="https://www.actusnews.com/en/dontnod/pr/2024/10/16/2024-half-year-results" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in a statement</a>.</p><p>"As a result, today we presented a reorganization project to the employee representative bodies, which could set Don't Nod on a new development trajectory," he added. "I am fully conscious of the impact this project may have on all our employees. Securing our company's resources and restoring its ability to perform more in an increasingly competitive and selective industry is extremely necessary."</p><p>STJV pointed out its demands and countered the statement with why the workers are striking and how it can be called off.</p><p>"We demand that management immediately give up on this irresponsible and unfair layoffs plan. We demand that the studio’s workers, who are the most competent people, have an actual say in all decision-making. We demand the presence of Oskar Guilbert in the negotiations, and that he takes full responsibility as CEO," it read. "This layoff plan is absurd, violent, and will not save our company. We therefore call on our colleagues to continue their mobilization with a one-day strike on Friday, November 8."</p><p>Despite having to pause productions of two future releases due to lackluster sales of both Juscant and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, Don't Nod <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-nod-pausing-two-projects-after-jusant-banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-flop/1100-6526667/" data-ref-id="1100-6526667">still has high hopes for Lost Records: Bloom and Rage</a>, out in February.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-spin-off-arcane-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-report-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Both seasons of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> spin-off Arcane cost a total of approximately $250m USD to create and promote, making it the most expensive animated series of all time.</p>
<p>That's according to a new report by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/riot-games-arcane-hollywood-netflix-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-1236196655/">Variety</a>, with sources telling the publication the $250m figure covered production and promotion costs for Arcane's two seasons, comprised of 18 episodes in total. The show's first nine episodes are said to have seen a production cost "north of $80m", while the second set of nine episodes - which will make up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">the show's final season</a> - reportedly had a production cost "approaching" the $100m mark.</p>
<p>Variety claims development costs were pushed up due to "a labour-intensive approach and frequent cost overruns triggered by delayed script deliveries after the second season was put into production with only a fraction of the season written".</p>

<p>In addition, League of Legends developer Riot reportedly spent $60m promoting the first season of the animated spin-off, which released on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> in 2021. Variety says this figure is more than other studios would ordinarily spend to promote a show they weren't distributing.</p><p>When the publication asked Riot about Arcane's price tag, Riot co-founder and chief product officer Marc Merrill said, "We're more than comfortable with the spend it took to deliver a show that was worthy of our players' time." Merrill refrained from confirming or denying whether the reported $250m figure was accurate.</p>
<p>The Riot exec added the company's "ambitions in entertainment haven't changed" since Arcane's release. "We were never intending to operate like a traditional studio with traditional timelines," Merrill said. "What <em>did</em> change as we learned more was our expectations of ourselves: We realised that getting it right takes a lot more time than we'd originally expected, and so we recalibrated our development, output goals and teams with that in mind."</p>
<p>Arcane's second season is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-arcane-season-two-will-launch-in-november-2024">set to air on Netflix, starting 9th November</a>. As for season one, our Chris called it "a thrill, full of welcome colour and life" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-act-1-review-riots-glossy-animated-netflix-series-opens-with-a-striking-if-familiar-bang">Eurogamer's review</a> (which was based on the first four episodes), although he still had a few reservations. Following its debut, Arcane subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-league-of-legends-animated-show-arcane-wins-an-emmy-for-outstanding-animated-program">won the Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As nearly a decade has passed since its release and Sony has yet to revisit the franchise with another game, some indie developers have taken it upon themselves to make their own Bloodborne games. The latest unofficial Bloodborne game in development, Bloodborne: Top Down Arena, gives the title a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-games-like-diablo/2900-4750/" data-ref-id="2900-4750">Diablo-like action-RPG</a> makeover. While the project is far from finished, the game's creator, Maxime Foulquier, has posted a video that shows the gameplay in action.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853835793388953662" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>HUNTERS!

The video features the Hunter fighting a few enemies, and it makes Bloodborne seem well suited for an entire game in this format.</p><p>Foulquier also <a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853834672347758739" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared his belief</a> that Bloodborne: Top Down Arena is different enough from the original Bloodborne to escape a takedown notice from Sony. That's why he doesn't plan to release it on Steam. He also acknowledged that another fan creation, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bloodborne-kart-is-releasing-soon-with-a-new-legally-distinct-name/1100-6522387/" data-ref-id="1100-6522387">Bloodborne Kart</a>, had to be delayed and completely reworked to avoid legal consequences from Sony. However, keeping the Bloodborne name on his own game may only invite Sony's lawyers to go after Foulquier as well.</p><p>Until Sony gets back around to Bloodborne, fan content may be the only way to get anything new. One of the most intriguing fan-made projects is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-graceborne-mod-brings-bloodborne-to-the-lands-between/1100-6524641/" data-ref-id="1100-6524641">Graceborne</a>, an Elden Ring mod that brings elements that originated in From Software's previous title into the developer's current franchise. That title is currently in its alpha stage.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-cs2-ranks-how-to-get-global-elite.1028982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-cs2-ranks-how-to-get-global-elite/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It is no secret that CS2 (Counter-Strike 2) is one of the biggest esports out there. Even after its predecessor, CS:GO, handed the game the torch, Counter-Strike has continued to thrive. But do you know of all the ranks in CS2 competitive?</p>



<p>Here are all the CS2 ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-cs2-ranks">CS2 Ranks</h2>



<p>CS2 ranks fall under a much more complicated system than many other games. To heavily reward players, ranks are not thrown around lightly within the shooter. With 18 ranks as a whole, CS2 has one of the most immersive and impressive ranking systems.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-cs2-ranks">All CS2 Ranks:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Silver 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver 4</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver Elite Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Guardian 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Guardian 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Guardian Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Distinguished Master Guardian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legendary Eagle</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legendary Eagle Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Supreme Master First Class</strong></li>



<li><strong>Global Elite</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While these are the traditional CS2 ranks, the game also has Premiere Mode, which is a more popular ranked system. </p>







<h2 id="h-all-counter-strike-2-premiere-mode-ranks">All Counter-Strike 2 Premiere Mode Ranks</h2>



<p>Premiere mode, unlike regular CS2 ranked, requires players to pick and vote on maps to ban before competing. After winning 10 placements in Premiere, you will be given a rating, which is a bit different from the system in the game’s traditional ranked mode.</p>



<p><strong>Here are all Premiere mode ranks in CS2 compared to the game’s traditional ranks:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1,000 – 7,501 (Gray):</strong> Equivalent to Silver Elite Master</li>



<li><strong>7,502 – 11,831 (Light Blue):</strong> Equivalent to Gold Nova 1 to Gold Nova Master</li>



<li><strong>11,832 – 14,998 (Dark Blue):</strong> Equivalent to Master Guardian to Master Guardian Elite</li>



<li><strong>14,999 – 18,401 (Light Purple):</strong> Equivalent to Distinguished Master Guardian to Legendary Eagle Master</li>



<li><strong>18,402 – 19,999 (Purple):</strong> Equivalent to Supreme Master First Class</li>



<li><strong>20,000+ (Dark Purple):</strong> Equivalent to the Global Elite</li>
</ul>



<p>The Counter-Strike Premiere mode is much more focused on points than it is on actual ranks. Still, though, players should be striving to hit Dark Purple, which is the equivalent to Global Elite in the game’s regular ranking system.</p>



<p>To rank up, simply winning matches will skyrocket you through the ranked system, but beware, the competition will be extremely difficult later on, as CS2 has a much more precise competitive base than other games.</p>



<p>What rank are you in Counter-Strike 2?</p>

The developer has stated the stream will have "something for everyone," including fans of the old Warcraft strategy games. There is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2024-canceled-but-blizzard-has-big-warcraft-plans-in-store/1100-6522953/" data-ref-id="1100-6522953">no BlizzCon this year</a>, so fans are expecting some big announcements normally reserved for Blizzard's annual fan convention to instead be made during the 30th anniversary-stream.</p><p dir="ltr">That certainly makes it seem like Warcraft 2: Remastered will be announced during the livestream, but Blizzard so far has not officially announced the game. It wouldn't be the first classic Blizzard title to receive the remaster treatment, with Blizzard having previously remastered the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-20">StarCraft</a> in 2017 as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-798">Diablo 2</a> in 2021 as Diablo 2: Resurrected.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard also, infamously, remastered one of the most beloved RTS games of all time with 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warcraft-iii-reforged/" data-ref-id="5000-504202">Warcraft 3: Reforged</a>. Often hailed as Blizzard's first "bad game," the remaster for many fans wasn't what was originally promised, and in many ways felt like a step down from the original Warcraft 3. The reception to Warcraft 3: Reforged was so bad that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-expands-refund-requests-for-warcraft-3-re/1100-6473492/" data-ref-id="1100-6473492">Blizzard offered "no-questions asked" refunds</a>, with a later report stating the game was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-3-reforged-a-victim-of-mismanagement-pressure-from-activision-and-budget-cuts-report/1100-6494287/" data-ref-id="1100-6494287">victim of budget cuts and mismanagement</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">There is evidence to suggest Blizzard may be giving Warcraft 3: Reforged a redo as well. A Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-might-be-floating-a-warcraft-3-reforged-relaunch/1100-6510801/" data-ref-id="1100-6510801">survey asking players about a potential Reforged relaunch</a> last year generated headlines. Last month, the game's public test realm servers briefly showed an unannounced 2.0 build before being removed several hours later, but nothing has been officially announced.</p><p dir="ltr">Not content to wait for an official Blizzard remaster, fans have already taken to updating Warcraft 2 for the modern age.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-2-remaster-leaked-rumor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>remaster may have just been leaked ahead of a major celebration for the franchise's 30th anniversary, which is due to take place next week.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gkkzj1/warcraft_2_remastered_internal_alpha_leaked_via/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Redditor Neggy5</a>, a <a href="https://blizztrack.com/view/w2rd?type=versions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new listing on tracking site BlizzTrack</a>, which monitors changes in the backend of the company's Battle.net service, points to the existence of an internal alpha test for something called&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2: Remastered</em>.</p>

<p>All things considered, it's pretty difficult to imagine that this is anything other than a reworked modern version of the seminal 1995 RTS, which was originally titled&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcraft-2-remaster-leak-original-shot.jpg?itok=PEyMoc8Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcraft-2-remaster-leak-original-shot.jpg?itok=Eas5tPeJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A remaster of classic 1995 RTS&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>could be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>The listing gives practically nothing away, as you might imagine, but it does potentially confirm the existence of a remaster that may well be announced during next week's celebration.</p>

<p>According to the Redditor who discovered the listing, an upcoming update for the controversial&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 3: Reforged&nbsp;</em>was also discovered on the BlizzTrack website, so it seems that Blizzard's attempts to redeem that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-3-reforged-developer-update-does-little-to-satisfy-irate-fans">ill-received rework</a> also continue, although the nature of said update hasn't been revealed.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that none of this has officially been confirmed; this could well just be an experimental attempt on Blizzard's part to go through options rather than a confirmation that something concrete is in the works.</p>

<p>Still, the timing of this leak seems pretty serendipitous with the&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>anniversary stream due to air next week, so I wouldn't be surprised if a&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>announcement was officially made at that point.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-blizzard.jpg?itok=ScnB5hX3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-blizzard.jpg?itok=wGY516Vx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blizzard recently released&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>The War Within</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>anniversary stream airs a few months after Blizzard released&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em>, the tenth major expansion for the long-running MMORPG, which launched back in August.</p>

<p>It's also arriving after developers on said MMO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-blizzard-union">formed Blizzard's first wall-to-wall union</a> back in July, which essentially means said union represents the entire studio rather than a single unit within the company.</p>

This stripped-down, 20-card deck version of the game is a masterclass in gacha (gambling) game design, feeding you handfuls of each currency when you first begin playing, teaching you all the gameplay loops they allow, and then—right when it’s all becoming natural—cuts you off, <em>hard</em>. Here, the <em>only</em> way to add new cards to your deck is to engage with systems that endlessly encourage you to spend real-world money within the app, on top of an array of other systems that peter out just before you’re done, unless you fork out. And when it comes to <em>Pokémon</em>, that feels <em>wrong</em>.</p><p>I’m a fool, but not <em>that</em> big of a fool. I get why free-to-play mobile games are designed to encourage their users to spend money. These products are not charities, they’re businesses, and this is a model that has proven to be enormously lucrative. Exploitative, controversial, and in some countries even illegal, but undeniably successful.

Estimated to have brought in $150 billion in its 30 years, it leaves second place <em>Hello Kitty</em> in its wake, with a total of $89 billion. <em>Star Wars</em> sits at less than half, at $70 billion, despite a 20-year head-start. If you want to compare it to the video games world, the next largest property is <em>Mario</em> at a measly $57 billion. There’s a reason this property, primarily focused on children and those who loved it as children, can afford to run <em>TCG Live</em> for free. And, of course, this total was estimated before The Pokémon Company ever dipped its toes in the toxic waters of gacha gaming. What I’m saying is, while any corporation always wants infinitely more money, <em>Pocket</em> isn’t a last-gasp attempt to survive from a struggling business. It’s not an essential move to calm bailing shareholders. It’s just a pure act of astonishing greed aimed at children.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974"><em>Pokémon</em> Fan Calculates How Long It Will Take To Collect Every Card In <em>TCG Pocket</em></a></span></p><p>There’s a version of <em>Pocket</em> that could have existed and would have made sense from The Pokémon Company, co-owned by Nintendo, Creatures Inc., and Game Freak. It’s a stripped-down, <em>Marvel Snap</em>-like card game with an option to pay for a battle pass. And that’s it. It’d make a <em>fortune</em>. As it is, this new app offers a Premium Pass that looked like it was going to be a battle pass equivalent for a rather pricey $10 a month. It’s there. Beyond that, all the other systems could have been powered by in-game actions. It’d be a great solution for an IP aimed at kids, while also loved by adults; like <em>Fortnite</em>, if your kid really gets into it, buy them a Premium Pass to enjoy it even more. Buy yourself one. Go wild.</p><p>Instead, what we really have is an app that’s been built from the ground up to exploit its players, building gambling loops where real-world money can be spent on opening sealed packs in the hope of scoring rare rewards.</p><p> This is no better underlined by the game’s only imposed limit on spending, which it says will prevent players from using more than 750 Poké Gold a day to open packs. That amount of Gold would cost $120 per day. That’s where this app draws the line. And there are no options to add your own personalized spending limits to help protect those prone to overspending or getting hooked—surely the most basic good-faith offering that should be in place. </p><h2 id="h6934"><a id=""></a>From training to draining</h2><figure id="" data-id="8857ee1334e5441e44062a1439a7ff33" data-recommend-id="image://8857ee1334e5441e44062a1439a7ff33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A selection of cards available in Pocket, on a blue background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A selection of cards available in Pocket, on a blue background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8857ee1334e5441e44062a1439a7ff33" data-recommend-id="image://8857ee1334e5441e44062a1439a7ff33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A selection of cards available in Pocket, on a blue background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, there is absolutely and unequivocally a legitimate way to enjoy <em>Pocket</em> without spending any money. The early waterfall of in-game currencies is enough to unlock yourself enough cards to start building rudimentary decks, and the so-called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-guide-how-to-get-cards-1851689908&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-guide-how-to-get-cards-1851689908">Wonder Picks</a></span> and 12-hourly free packs mean you always have a way to gain more. With these, you can take part in the game’s battles against the CPU or other players, and while crude, it’s a reasonably enjoyable game. (It’s impossible not to add that if you’re used to the full version of the TCG, it’s oddly frustrating to have such a repetitive deck, no Stadium cards, and so few Trainers and Tools.) So yes, it is possible to play <em>Pocket</em> for free. It’s just that’s clearly not what’s intended.</p><p>In fact, to even be able to access the battles, you’re <em>forced</em> to go through all of the loops that’ll eventually be suggesting you pay real money. You must go through tutorials that have you opening pack after pack after pack, picking Wonder Picks, and displaying your favorite cards for others before the tab to take part in battles unlocks. Even then, you’re dragged through an unskippable series of tiny tutorials, where with each step you complete you just so happen to be rewarded more of those Pack Hourglasses that reduce the time before you can open another pack.</p><p>You’re then given all these Missions–small tasks to complete of an incidental nature, some triggered by competing in battles–that thrust more hourglasses upon you! You’ve now got over 150! That’s like 12 more packs to open! And woah, opening those packs triggered more missions and you’ve got another 40 hourglasses! Three more packs and a few hourglasses to spare! And don’t forget to Wonder Pick! That one-in-five chance of getting a card you half-want unlocks even more rewards right now! Oh, and what’s this, there’s a new type of CPU battle, where you can win the chance to try to pull a Lapras card! And it rewards you yet another type of hourglass to keep trying! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506">Until it doesn’t!</a></span></p><h2 id="h6935"><a id=""></a>But this is <em>Pokémon</em></h2><p>I keep hearing the voice of the frustrated reader, crying, “Yeah, but it’s a free-to-play app, dumbass. This is what they do.” And I just keep coming back to the same reply: Yeah, but this is <em>Pokémon</em>.</p><p>I think the <em>Fortnite</em> comparison is a useful one, here. <em>Fortnite </em>is indisputably another product aimed at getting parents to pay unfathomable amounts of money to play a free game. It makes billions of dollars a year, despite being even more blatantly open to being played for free, with its in-game currency sold on plastic cards in every grocery store. My son got piles of V-bucks for his recent birthday, and I pay for his Battle Pass. I’m acutely aware of how well it works. And yet, as problematic as so much of it may be, it’s nothing compared to <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em>.</p><p>In <em>Fortnite</em>, there’s nothing on which you can spend real-world money that affords you any advantages. Everything that can be bought is cosmetic, even in the Battle Pass. And that Battle Pass? It lasts 12 weeks (roughly three months) and costs around $9.50. For this, you get regular (cosmetic) rewards for an enormous 200 levels. You get loads, and cannot pay to win.</p><p>In <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em>, real-world money can buy you access to vastly more packs of cards, Wonder Picks, and turns at Events, all of which can give you significant advantages in the battles. The better your cards, the better your decks, and the more you’ll win. And that Premium Pass? It lasts just one month and costs $10. For this, you get a series of tasks that unlock you…11 Pack Hourglasses, eight Wonder Hourglasses, and 29 “Premium Tickets,” that let you buy a bunch of cosmetics. That’s right—11 of the items anyone wants, less than half as many as you’ll be given for completing a rudimentary mission in your opening hours of the game. Completing everything it offers takes a couple of hours, at most, and then it just sits fallow. You also get one extra pack to open a day, which is really what you’re paying for here. You get so little, and you’re paying to win.</p><p>It’s no surprise that <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em> hasn’t even tried to launch in Belgium, where loot boxes are outlawed, and nor in the Netherlands, where a similar law is being sought.</p><h2 id="h6936"><a id=""></a>The Wooloo are gambling</h2><figure id="" data-id="34853f6ea775c4056ba80cd57a73f258" data-recommend-id="image://34853f6ea775c4056ba80cd57a73f258" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Mewtwo pack artwork." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Mewtwo pack artwork." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="34853f6ea775c4056ba80cd57a73f258" data-recommend-id="image://34853f6ea775c4056ba80cd57a73f258" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Mewtwo pack artwork." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a fan of the real-world TCG, I was excited to play this streamlined version, especially after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-marvel-snap-1851653373&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-marvel-snap-1851653373">playing it at Gamescom earlier this year</a></span>. At that preview demo, we weren’t shown any of the gacha elements, and questions about them were responded to with, “We’ll have to get back to you on that.” I said at the time that I feared many more ways to spend Gold other than speeding up pack opening would be revealed by launch, adding, “Gacha plus kids makes me uncomfortable.” But I still let myself hope a bit. It’s <em>Pokémon</em>, right?</p><p>And yes, let’s address the problematic nature of those real-world card packs too. Are they gambling? Very probably, depending on the motivation behind buying them. However, there’s a huge difference for children’s minds in something like a stamina meter that could be refilled with the touch of a button to maintain a feedback loop, and nagging your parent into taking you to the store to buy another $5 pack.</p><p>I feel very sure that in <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em>, The Pokémon Company has made a big error in judgment. While it already is proving enormously successful (with reports of $20 million made in its first week), the reputational harm that I suspect will follow could outweigh it. I foresee mainstream news stories about kids who’ve spent thousands on cards via their parents’ credit cards, alongside the more specialist press reporting on just how grim the pull rates are when you don’t spend money. Already, the man behind the deeply influential <em>Pokémon</em> news site <em>Serebii</em>, Joe Merrick, has tweeted, saying of the current Lapras event, “It took…10 Pikachu, 8 Clefairy, 6 Mankey and 5 Butterfree. A total of 29 packs before I finally got the Lapras. Now to not touch this event again.”</p><p>After this first week of people experiencing <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em>’s initial dopamine rush of endless packs to tear open, and the flow of rewards feeding into satisfying loops, I think we will now see the game’s huge audience collectively hitting the cut-off point, the moment when the dealer suddenly ups his prices now that the drug is in your system. I think it’s going to be reputationally ugly for The Pokémon Company, and I suspect the absolutely god-awful Premium Pass is going to need massive revision ASAP, likely with a heavy dump of apologetic in-game rewards for purchasers (something problematic in itself).</p><p>Yes, once again, this sort of shit is grimly normal in the mobile space, and there’s a vast industry built around the exploitation of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_roller&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_roller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whales</a></span> in free-to-play gacha gaming. Or, let’s call it by its name: gambling. But, yet again, <em>this is Pokémon</em>. It’s Pokémon just undeniably selling gambling to children.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I didn’t have much time to complete such a monumental open-world adventure.

Despite the cost, a heavy dose of nostalgia washed over the community and the open-world western now sits at ‘Very Positive’ on Steam, as of this writing, with thousands of reviews from the community. Of course, like any other game release, you have those posting negative reviews due to the price, boycotting the studio, or are upset because of performance issues. Everyone’s opinion is valid, but take every review with a grain of salt.</p><p>First, let’s start with the positive reviews. There are loads of them, with the clear majority of the many thousands of user reviews left behind being positive. Most of them shout from the rooftops about the game’s stable performance, with plenty of PC-specific graphics settings to tweak the experience. Of course, then you have those proclaiming it’s one of the best stories told in gaming, with the most memorable characters and setpieces. To some extent, they’re not wrong.</p><p>However, even the positive reviews note the price tag associated with the remake. At $50, Rockstar is asking for a lot from long-time fans, especially for such an old port. In fact, the vast majority of negative reviews point towards its price tag as the reason for their review. </p><p>If you’re still considering the recent PC release of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>,

And so all that’s very exciting. And then in certain instances, we’re also doing animation series, or live-action films to augment that and be part of those roadmaps.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That innocuous mention of a new Virtua Fighter has already set tongues wagging within the fighting game community. Virtua Fighter hasn’t seen a mainline release in years, leaving mini-game appearances in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s Yakuza games and the 2021 release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a> to tide fans over. IGN has asked Sega for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter, which includes characters such as Akira Yuki, Pai Chan, and Wolf Hawkfield, is on the hardcore end of the fighting game spectrum, with slower-paced gameplay that challenges players to master its mechanics in order to enjoy success. Virtua Fighter 5, which first released in 2006, is considered one of the greatest fighting games of all time. Could Sega now be ready to release Virtua Fighter 6, nearly 20 years later?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During The Game Awards 2023, Sega announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-golden-axe-and-more-are-in-development-game-awards-2023"><u>new games in the Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi franchises</u></a> alongside the teaser trailer, below. The video shows brief clips of each of the games set to return.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has said its Crazy Taxi reboot, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crazy-taxi-reboot-an-open-world-massively-multiplayer-aaa-game-sega-says">is an open-world, massively multiplayer AAA game</a>. There is no release date yet for the Crazy Taxi reboot or any of the other new games announced at last year's Game Awards. Perhaps we’ll find out more in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Nintendo has shed further insight on its approach to mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>In today's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">Corporate Management Policy Briefing</a>, Nintendo stated that while it would "not rule out the possibility of further mergers and acquisitions", its current "priority is to organically expand the organisation". This is so "new staff members are able to fully learn and understand our creative culture" at Nintendo.</p>
<p>The Mario maker seldom partakes in acquisitions, only making a handful in recent years. In May, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-acquisition-since-2022-and-its-from-embracer">company acquired Shiver Entertainment</a> from Embracer. Shiver is a studio responsible for porting the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> onto Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>This particular deal marked Nintedo's first acquisition since 2022, when it purchased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-buying-animation-studio-it-will-rename-nintendo-pictures">Dynamo Pictures</a> (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-officially-launches-its-nintendo-pictures-animation-studio">subsequently became Nintendo Pictures</a>) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-acquiring-long-time-development-partner-srd">SRD</a>. In 2021, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-buying-luigis-mansion-3-developer-next-level-games">Nintendo purchased Next Level Games</a>, the studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion-3">Luigi's Mansion 3</a>.</p>
<p>That same year, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/05/nintendos_ready_for_acquisitions_when_the_time_is_right">said</a> any acquisitions it makes would be determined by the company's need to keep pace with "rapidly advancing technological innovation". The following year, Nintendo president <a href="https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1489149335203815431">Shuntaro Furukawa</a> stated: "Our brand was built upon products crafted with dedication by our employees, and having a large number of people who don’t possess Nintendo DNA in our group would not be a plus to the company."</p>
<p>Then, last year, Furukawa <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nikkei-shuntaro-furukawa-interview-switch-support-until-early-march-2025-increase-in-in-house-developers-and-thought-process-behind-acquisitions.770663/">explained</a> Nintendo does not "reject the use of M&amp;A (mergers and acquisitions)", adding "if an organisation that does not understand Nintendo's creative approach is brought into the fold, it may not produce the expected results".</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> latest major update, From The Rift, is rewinding time all the way back to early 2019 with a new Launch Royale mode, letting you play the game with the original map, the original selection of Legends, weapons and loot, and original gameplay balance. But that’s not all that this update does.</p>
<p><iframe title="Apex Legends: From the Rift Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ve-pSwKn79I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As a limited time mode, Launch Royale is a step back to the origins of the game, which has evolved and changed an awful lot since 2019 – a time when battle royale still felt rather novel. All of the characters released since then are snuffed back out of existence, you no longer have EVO Armor or Ability Upgrades, and get what many will consider to be a mure pure experience from it.</p>
<p>Old hands will be able to immediately lean back into the early meta of weapons, strategies and drop points, but there’s also some incentives beyond that. Launch Royale Challenges will unlock Legends, earn rewards that include Apex Packs and more.</p>
<p>Beyond that, this season will also see the revival of the original medic and healer character, Lifeline. Outside of Launch Royale, she will sport a new kit that includes teleporting the healing drone direct to allies and dropping a circular healing forcefield.</p>

<p>There’s also Rift Relics that can be retrieved from strange portals, which will feature overpowered weapons and Boost Kits to give you a real leg up in a match, and a new universal, character agnostic melee, the Raptor’s Claw. This can be unlocked through the Void Mercenary Store between now and 7th January,</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-mesh-shaders-4k/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 may support mesh shaders, judging from some recently datamined information that has been shared online this week.</p>
<p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/watertoon.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watertoon</a>, the code of the Nintendo Switch Online playtest, which was held in the past few days for a new unannounced game, reportedly features support for mesh shaders and 4K resolution, neither of them supported by the current console. Considering how the Japanese company's president, Shuntaro Furukawa, confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/">backward compatible</a>, there's a very good chance that these features will be supported by the yet-to-be-revealed console.</p>
<p>Despite&nbsp;<span>it being almost 2025, we are still relying on rumors to learn more about the Nintendo Switch 2, and it seems like this could be going on for a little while longer. According to analysts, a reveal before January is unlikely, as Nintendo wouldn't want the announcement of an upcoming system to impact sales of the current console and its software, which haven't been doing too well</span>&nbsp;in the past quarter.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console is launching next year, but it has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-new-virtua-fighter-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has officially announced that a new&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>game is in the works as part of the company's drive to revive some of its classic franchises.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/why-sega-is-reviving-classics-like-shinobi-and-jet-set-radio-across-games-film-and-tv/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to VGC</a>, Sega transmedia head Justin Scarpone revealed that alongside revivals of franchises like&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>,&nbsp;<em>Golden Axe</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>,&nbsp;which were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2023-recap-check-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals">announced during last year's Game Awards</a>, a new&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>game is also in development, although Scarpone stopped short of revealing further details.</p>

<p>Scarpone also says that "in certain instances", Sega has transmedia projects in development alongside its games, pointing to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>movie</a> as an example, although it's not clear whether&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>is also part of that initiative.</p>

<p>These projects include a reboot of&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>, which Sega says <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo">will be an open-world MMO</a> in contrast to the original game's classic arcade approach to gameplay, as well as reworks of <i>Golden Axe</i>,&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>, <i>Jet Set Radio</i>, and&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage&nbsp;</em>(in the latter case, a reboot distinct from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/streets-of-rage-4">2020's&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a>).</p>

<p>We don't have any kind of inclination regarding what exactly Sega is planning to do with these franchises (beyond the&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>reboot, of course), but we'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>

The game managed to sell a million copies within its first few hours on sale.</p>

<p>The gaming giant has also enjoyed recent success thanks to the release of&nbsp;3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em>, which, much like the aforementioned JRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-million">sold very strongly indeed on its launch day</a>.</p>

Fans love to see crazy story beats, especially when they result in unique fights or new characters. A great example of this is Gohan Black, a fun twist on the diabolical Goku Black. He’s become popular enough that everyone wants to play as him, although that’s easier said than done.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194972" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Lesbian Mafia Anime Might Actually Make You Want To Play Golf" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="135" data-playlist="194972,195064,197298" data-current="194972"><div><p>This Lesbian Mafia Anime Might Actually Make You Want To Play Golf</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194972/194972_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194972/194972_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194972/194972_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194972/194972_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This what-if villain has his own story arc hidden behind a tough fight. It’s not as bad or confusing as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142">getting all of Jiren’s endings</a></span>, but I wouldn’t blame you if you’ve had trouble unlocking it. We’re going to lay out how to encounter him within Episode Battle as well as your options for playing the new villain yourself.</p><h2 id="h6937"><a id=""></a>Who is Gohan Black?</h2><p>Gohan Black is an original character for <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, although I’m sure there exists plenty of fanfics already out there based on the idea. If the name or my brief explanation above didn’t already give it away, <strong>Gohan Black is the product of a what-if story where Zamasu doesn’t switch bodies with Goku, but with his firstborn son instead</strong>.</p><p>Everyone has taken a strong liking to this neat twist and plenty have voiced their preference for Gohan as a villain over his dad. Of course, it’s not just the lore that’s left us all excited. Gohan Black is a surprisingly detailed inclusion for the game. While he does share a moveset with Goku Black, he comes with an exclusive portrait and his own voice acting. There is even more to show on the back end of things.</p><p>Within the story mode he doesn’t seem like a finished character since he only uses basic rush combos and vanish attacks. Data miners have discovered more work went into him than thought as he has voice work for all of his unused supers and skills. He even has a special battle introduction dialogue interaction against Goku, which would only be viewable in a versus mode.</p><p>I have no doubt that this would have been a popular what-if character on their own. It’s thanks to the above aspects, both what’s presented and found within the game’s files, that he’s managed to whip fans into a frenzy about playing him. Before we get to your options for doing that, let’s go over how to fight him in the story mode.</p><h2 id="h6938"><a id=""></a>How to Fight Gohan Black in Episode Battle</h2><figure id="" data-id="f5a533a44c1fce1dcc5334d9eebcd0e5" data-recommend-id="image://f5a533a44c1fce1dcc5334d9eebcd0e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gohan’s Episode Battle map with his Defend Earth from the Frieza Force! mission highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan’s Episode Battle map with his Defend Earth from the Frieza Force! mission highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5a533a44c1fce1dcc5334d9eebcd0e5" data-recommend-id="image://f5a533a44c1fce1dcc5334d9eebcd0e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gohan’s Episode Battle map with his Defend Earth from the Frieza Force! mission highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Gohan Black is only fought through The Strongest Warrior story arc, which can be unlocked in Chapter 5 of Gohan’s Saga.</strong> To be more precise, you’ll need to complete the alternate objective in the “Defend Earth from the Frieza Force”<em> </em>mission, which simply reads as “Defeat the Frieza Force Soldier, then corner Frieza.”</p><p>That doesn’t tell you much, but I was able to clear it the same way most other alternate objectives are cleared: dealing a lot of damage as fast as I could. This can be a challenge since you have to fight against two enemies. I recommend charging your Ki whenever possible to enter the Sparking! Mode, that way you can get them caught in long rush combos and land your Ultimate Blast on them. Using Gohan’s Full Power Charge skill will also save time by instantly filling up your Ki gauge.</p><p>Don’t forget that lowering the difficulty will prevent you from completing an alternate objective. If you’re still having trouble finishing this fast enough, I recommend using a Dragon Orb to give yourself more time. These can be gained from wishes after you’ve summoned a dragon. This is a pretty tough battle, so it’s worth using them here.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparkling-zero-summoning-wishes-shenron-1851672547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparkling-zero-summoning-wishes-shenron-1851672547">Getting To Grips With <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Wish-Granting Dragons</a></span></p><p>Getting through the fight quickly enough will lead you down The Strongest Warrior path, which starts with two more fights against Frieza. Defeating the space tyrant for good will cause Gohan to prioritize training more, leading him to catch the attention of Zamasu. This creates an altered version of the Future Trunks Arc highlighted by Gohan Black.</p><p>You’ll then be able to fight against the character that everyone wants. As mentioned earlier, he refrains from using any supers and just throws out rush combos and vanish attacks. That doesn’t mean he’s a pushover by any stretch of the imagination. Feel free to try out some of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-battle-assist-guide-1851685568&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-battle-assist-guide-1851685568">Battle Assist settings</a></span> or even lower the difficulty if his combos keep melting your health bar. This story arc is a straight shot without any branching paths, so you won’t miss anything by taking it easy.</p><p>There are four more fights for the story after this, including one against Gohan Black in an Ultimate-like transformation that rivals Goku Black’s Rose Form. The last two fights are against Fused Zamasu, who now sports a long bang in front of his face just like Gohan. Beat every mission to unlock The Strongest Warrior achievement and finish this fun alternate scenario.</p><h2 id="h6939"><a id=""></a>How to Play as Gohan Black</h2><figure id="" data-id="89ec992d77795f84b69b1dab9fcac30a" data-recommend-id="image://89ec992d77795f84b69b1dab9fcac30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gohan Black stares at the camera with a grimace during a cutscene." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan Black stares at the camera with a grimace during a cutscene." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89ec992d77795f84b69b1dab9fcac30a" data-recommend-id="image://89ec992d77795f84b69b1dab9fcac30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gohan Black stares at the camera with a grimace during a cutscene." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>If you’re looking to properly add Gohan Black to your roster, I’m sorry to say that currently isn’t an option.</strong> Some want him to be a separate character and others want him to be a special outfit for Goku Black since the two do share the same move set. Unfortunately, <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> doesn’t have any hidden fighters to unlock, nor any unique cosmetics that overhaul a character.</p><p>That’s not to say Gohan Black couldn’t be made available later on down the road. All the unused voice lines and altered visual effects could go to waste if he was made playable as a separate character. Having him be a cosmetic for the character he’s based on would make the most sense. There is a small precedent for a character’s outfit affecting things too, with Android 18 and Goku (Super) having one each that changes one of their super attacks.</p><p>You do have a couple of “less official” methods if you play on PC. <strong>The first is likely what you expect: search online and find a mod that swaps out Goku Black for Gohan Black.</strong> Thanks to so many assets already available in the game, mods for this come off pretty seamlessly. Online opponents will just see regular Goku Black while you will see the edgy what-if character of your dreams.</p><p>The second method is a uniquely bizarre workaround that doesn’t require you to have any mods installed on your end. Modders have realized that if they load in non-playable character models that are already in the game’s files (such as for story or super cutscene purposes) and publish them through the Custom Battles feature, anyone who plays it will be able to use those same models. <strong>That means you can play Gohan Black on PC by searching through the Custom Battle feature and finding one with him in it.</strong></p><p>Gohan Black is arguably the most stable example of the wacky NPCs you can find. This is likely a testament to how “complete” he’s presented as. However, these battles don’t stay up long and are less likely to pop up in the future. Bandai Namco has been very upfront about the fact that those who upload modded Custom Battles <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1851449322375696669&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1851449322375696669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will be banned</a></span>. That shouldn’t threaten anyone playing them, but who knows exactly how they’ll handle this weird situation. I’d recommend looking for mods to be on the safe side. Most of these player-made battles are super difficult and against the strongest fighters in the game anyway.</p><hr><p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> has a big roster filled with different <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640">characters to unlock</a></span>, but it is lacking a few fan-favorites. Which is why it means a lot that so many are calling for an original character like this to be added. We know that the DLC announced so far will include fighters from <em>Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero</em> and Dragon Ball Daima, but that isn’t going to stop anyone from hoping that Gohan Black is made officially playable through an update.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s the full rundown of season 5 episode titles:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Episode 1: The Crawl</li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Episode 2: The Vanishing of [BLURRED]</li><li>Episode 3: The Turnbow Trap</li><li>Episode 4: Sorcerer</li><li>Episode 5: Shock Jock</li><li>Episode 6: Escape From Camazotz</li><li>Episode 7: The Bridge</li><li>Episode 8: The Rightside Up</li></ul><p><em>Stranger Things </em>season 4 released in two parts back in 2022. It expanded the geographic scope of the show by taking Will, Eleven, and Jonathan to California, while still doubling down on the 80s nostalgia, shadowy intrigue, and paranormal phenomena that first made the <em>Goonies</em>-esque kids adventure a hit back in 2016. There wasn’t originally supposed to be a fifth season, but series creators Matt and Ross Duffer later extended the show’s ambitions after it blew up.</p><p>Fans are already pouring over the new episode titles for clues about where the show will head next before ultimately wrapping things up. Since the episode titles seemingly leaked months ago, the confirmation today provides a pretty good idea of whose name is blurred in the episode 2 title, while “The Rightside Up” seems like a fitting note for the show to go out on. </p><p>Of course, in the modern entertainment landscape it’s hard to see any super-popular franchise truly ending. Besides the spin-offs in various stages of planning, I’ll bet there’s always the prospect of a reunion movie down the road. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"It's heartening to see that this bold approach to both story and gameplay is now part of that legacy, expanding the definition of what a mainline entry could be. It may fall short in some respects, but it should be celebrated for its most stunning moments and the characters who embody them. FFXVI succeeds and earns its place within the Final Fantasy pantheon as one of the great entries, and does so on its own terms."</p><hr><h2>Final Fantasy XVI Poster Collection</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4395304-ff16-poster-collection.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395304" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4395304-ff16-poster-collection.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395304"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy 16: poster Collection</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4395304-ff16-poster-collection.jpg"></figure><p>If you're already a fan, you can also check out some extra Final Fantasy 16 content through these deluxe art and poster books. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XVI-Poster-Collection/dp/1646092759?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Final Fantasy 16 Poster Collection book</a> contains 33 large-format and full-color art prints that have been printed on press-varnished card stock, making them ready to frame.
