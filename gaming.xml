            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342952/best-runs-of-agdq-2025-speedrunning-charity-twitch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 has concluded, raising just over $2.5 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Every Games Done Quick event is worth tuning in to either live or later via VODs, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339206/agdq-2025-batman-forever-the-arcade-game">this AGDQ was uniquely fantastic</a>, filled with runs that’ll go down as some of the best GDQ has to offer. Here are some of our favorites: </p><p><h3><em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</em></h3></p><p>The great thing about the speedrunning community is that it’s often not enough to be the fastest runner of a particular game. That’s boring. For Wes, simply running <em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii </em>wasn’t enough to satisfy him. He had to get creative with it, deciding to master playing the game as fast as possible <em>while playing the piano.</em> But how can someone play a video game if both their hands are occupied, you ask? The answer is obvious: by controlling the game with your head and feet. I don’t know what inspires a human to do this kind of thing, and I don’t care. All that matters is that Wes put the depth of human ability (and multitasking) on display, and it was brain-breaking to watch.</p><p><h3><em>Elden Ring</em> bonus showcase</h3></p><p>Speaking of incredible human talent, how about playing <em>Elden Ring</em> — a game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24183692/hidetaka-miyazaki-interview-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty">known for its punishing difficulty</a> — with a saxophone. I was looking forward to this run all week, and Dr. Doot did not disappoint, but not for the reason I expected. It’s one thing to beat the likes of Malenia, Blade of Miquella with a specially programmed aerophone. But nothing could have prepared me for every input, from landing an attack to using consumables, sounding a hilarious “doot” noise. I cried laughing it was so funny. </p><p><h3><em>Super Metroid</em></h3></p><p><em>Super Metroid</em> is a GDQ staple, often anchoring the event’s last day in a week’s worth of programming. But lately, GDQ has gotten away from featuring a mere run of the game to instead showcase all the work the <em>Super Metroid</em> modding community has put into keeping this game from 1994 fresh and interesting. This four-way race of <em>Super Metroid</em> included a map randomizer, meaning the game’s normal layout had been shuffled around and put together in an all-new configuration.</p><p>Map randomizers for a <em>Metroid </em>game are uniquely dangerous because all of the abilities you need to progress are no longer laid out in a logical fashion. Samus might run into the fiery pits of Lower Norfair long before finding the heat-shielding Varia suit. And with the map randomized, it’s now way harder (and takes way longer) to find where the suit is. Now add an element of competition, and you’ve got one of the finest races in AGDQ history.</p><p><h3><em>Crazy Taxi</em> with live backing band</h3></p><p>It used to be that if you wanted to avoid DMCA strikes for playing a game on Twitch with licensed music, you just turned the music off. But AGDQ has come up with a novel way to get around this old problem. For this run of<em> Crazy Taxi</em>, every song was played by a cover band that transformed AGDQ from a speedrunning video game event into an impromptu punk rock show — mini-mosh pit and all — and it ruled. I’m not gonna share any details. Just go watch it for yourself.</p><p>GDQ is a uniquely special event for more reasons than featuring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24194234/summer-games-done-quick-2024-recap-peanut-butter-the-dog">cool, creative, or crazy-ass runs</a>. In a world where cowardly corporations have decided <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338471/meta-hate-speech-hateful-conduct-policy-moderation">it’s okay to call women and LGBTQ+ people slurs</a>, and one where gamers have a unique reputation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104799/gamergate-2024-sweet-baby-inc-diversity">for being awful to each other</a> for differences beyond our control, Games Done Quick has been very vocal in its support of marginalized people. Whether it be its diverse programming with <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/site/framefatales">Frame Fatales</a> or <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/site/blackinaflash">Black in a Flash</a> or the mere fact that every other donation featured a message of “Trans Rights,” which was enthusiastically read aloud and enthusiastically cheered by the live crowd.</p><p>Games Done Quick has been a shining example of how intentionally curated communities can foster acceptance and be a source of joy and goodness in a climate that needs it, and AGDQ 2025 was one of the best.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Historically speaking, video game movies often fail to do well at the box office, and even bigger hits like the <em>Resident Evil</em> films routinely do better outside the United States and Canada.

The first to pull off that feat was <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> in 2023. </p><p>Even reaching $100 million domestically has traditionally been a struggle for video game films.

It’s not the first time and it likely won’t be the last.</p><p>But hey, at least the <em>Sonic </em>movies are interesting films with their own identities and featuring some wonderful performances by folks like Jim Carrey and Ben Schwartz. I’ll watch the <em>Sonic </em>movies again. I’d rather eat sand than watch the <em>Super Mario Bros </em>movie again.

Those include four new tower maps—Alpine Ridge, Sinking Spire, Bluff, and Mesa—as well as more map variety overall to make exploring more rewarding and “less boring.”</p><p>Uniques will also get buffed to make rare loot more useful when found at lower levels and retain its power over the course of playing. And when it comes to pinnacle content, players will now get up to six respawn attempts when fighting the Arbiter of Ash boss, depending on the difficulty level. A number of enemies like Silverfist Commander, Plaguebearers, and Lost Men Zealots are getting reworked to feel more fair as well.</p><p>“Now, we have a huge amount of much more meta-shifting changes that we know we want to make, and one of the best things about having the game in Early Access with the endgame is that we now have a much better idea of where we want character power to be and what the balance of bosses and monsters should be relative to that,” game director  Jonathan Rogers told fans over the weekend. “But those types of changes are going to have to wait until we are ready to make a new league with a new economy for people to play in.”</p><p>A league in <em>Path of Exiles</em> is like a season in <em>Diablo</em>, and with the game having just arrived in early access on Steam and console in December, it’s possible the game’s bigger overhaul won’t arrive until closer to the end of winter. Rogers said the team at Grinding Gear Games wanted to get these more immediate tweaks out into players’ hands before prepping the more major stuff for release.</p><p><em>Path of Exile 2</em> will go free-to-play like its predecessor once it releases in full, but for now it’s $30 to try. That barrier to entry has barely phased players on Steam, though. The multiplayer RPG about beating back the darkness is still one of the Valve-owned storefront’s top-five best-selling and most-played games a month after launching. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Let’s find out as we rank them from the weakest link to the best in the business of healing.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e7cd2cee155a657cb9c7d3db1e2a6b02" data-recommend-id="image://e7cd2cee155a657cb9c7d3db1e2a6b02" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Loki looks at the camera while holding his staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Loki looks at the camera while holding his staff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e7cd2cee155a657cb9c7d3db1e2a6b02" data-recommend-id="image://e7cd2cee155a657cb9c7d3db1e2a6b02" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Loki looks at the camera while holding his staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Far be it from me to tell the trickster god he’s got too many tricks in his kit, but Loki has a lot going on in his moveset and it makes him harder to nail down than most Strategists in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. In the right hands, Loki is a diabolical menace of survivability and trickery, but his effectiveness feels very much determined by the specific situations in which he finds himself. His ultimate, which allows him to transform into another character on the field and use their ultimate ability, is a fun gimmick and may give you the opportunity to pull off a clutch play, but it’s so dependent on who’s around that it can make him less reliable than other heroes on the roster. Loki can keep your team alive against otherwise devastating attacks and play tricks on your foes as he creeps around undetected and pops to different locations, but I have a hard time imagining most players telling someone to switch to Loki because the current team comp isn’t working.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="94621bfcf8680f0d13ebb107b8ce6129" data-recommend-id="image://94621bfcf8680f0d13ebb107b8ce6129" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket leans on his gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rocket leans on his gun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="94621bfcf8680f0d13ebb107b8ce6129" data-recommend-id="image://94621bfcf8680f0d13ebb107b8ce6129" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket leans on his gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Guardians of the Galaxy’s feisty furball is one of the most fun Strategists to play in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, even if his actual utility is a bit unremarkable. He’s super mobile when climbing up walls and flying around on his jetpack. His team-up with Groot is a blast to use as he rides on the sentient tree’s back and pumps out heals, essentially making the two unstoppable. And who could forget the most useful gadget in his arsenal: the team-reviving B.R.B. machine that basically gives a teammate a second life? But while Rocket is a lot of fun to play, he’s not the most efficient healer and his power-boosting ultimate is easily destroyed. I love Rocket, he’s my main Strategist. But there are better healers on the roster.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dde623dd70ffabac7cc6565de89860c6" data-recommend-id="image://dde623dd70ffabac7cc6565de89860c6" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jeff makes a silly little face because he's a silly little guy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jeff makes a silly little face because he's a silly little guy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dde623dd70ffabac7cc6565de89860c6" data-recommend-id="image://dde623dd70ffabac7cc6565de89860c6" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jeff makes a silly little face because he's a silly little guy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ most mischievous little guy’s not the most efficient healer, but there’s a reason he’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">a pest an enemy team hates to see coming</a></span>. He’s incredibly mobile, can ride on Groot’s back, and his healing bubbles allow him to disperse support without having to be up the team’s ass at all times. Best of all, his ultimate is the kind of thing that can flip a fight with minimal effort. Swallowing up entire teams to spit them off the map or just pulling them away from an objective is a quick and efficient way to completely shift a game. Players are starting to learn ways to counter him, but sending an entire team tumbling down into a chasm is still one of the most reliable strategies in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="89fb01d6bbf46ebe8263781e322a61d3" data-recommend-id="image://89fb01d6bbf46ebe8263781e322a61d3" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adam Warlock holds his hand out toward the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Adam Warlock holds his hand out toward the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89fb01d6bbf46ebe8263781e322a61d3" data-recommend-id="image://89fb01d6bbf46ebe8263781e322a61d3" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adam Warlock holds his hand out toward the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Marvel’s “perfect specimen” has a pretty unique kit that offers an interesting approach to the support archetype. He’s got decent heals, excellent damage, and an ultimate that can revive an entire wiped team. Perhaps most interesting of all, his novel approach to survivability has him evenly distributing incoming damage across multiple characters. Like Loki, he’s a bit more complex than some Strategists and can easily prove useless to an inexperienced player, but a skilled one can get an insane amount of value out of his kit.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="be5c87f9e40e8c3639cce59161bbaf0e" data-recommend-id="image://be5c87f9e40e8c3639cce59161bbaf0e" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Invisible Woman stands with her arms by her side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Invisible Woman stands with her arms by her side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="be5c87f9e40e8c3639cce59161bbaf0e" data-recommend-id="image://be5c87f9e40e8c3639cce59161bbaf0e" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Invisible Woman stands with her arms by her side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sue Storm is <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ newest Strategist and the latest to fall into an odd archetype of “women who throw light blobs at enemies.” At least her invisibility and shields make her distinguishable from others in the same box. Invisible Woman’s support comes in the form of not just heals but protection, with her shields radiating healing energy as they defend teammates from incoming fire. She can also use them to push and pull enemies around, making her great for plays that make use of the environment like pushing foes off a map. Her cloaking abilities are versatile, allowing her to both escape difficult situations and set up for an ambush. And her ultimate marries all of the above to create a powerful healing barrier that hides characters inside from incoming damage or heals. Sure, you can blindly fire within her ultimate, but you’re wasting time and bullets if you can’t actually see what’s inside. It also has some incredible combo potential, such as a Scarlet Witch preparing her explosive ultimate inside it, keeping enemies on the outside from seeing her and running for cover. Players are still getting the hang of her, as she’s only been in the game since Season 1 began on January 10, but even in those few short days she’s shown a lot of potential.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aa39bdf4b2ece26d0465228d210ef4f9" data-recommend-id="image://aa39bdf4b2ece26d0465228d210ef4f9" data-format="png" data-width="1403" data-height="788" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloak and Dagger reach out toward the screen in a cool action pose." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cloak and Dagger reach out toward the screen in a cool action pose." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa39bdf4b2ece26d0465228d210ef4f9" data-recommend-id="image://aa39bdf4b2ece26d0465228d210ef4f9" data-format="png" data-width="1403" data-height="788" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloak and Dagger reach out toward the screen in a cool action pose." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Cloak &amp; Dagger has one of the most unique set-ups of any character in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. The duo is able to freely swap between the supportive Dagger and Cloak the saboteur. The two’s duality is captured in every facet of their design, both visually and mechanically. Dagger’s dazzling as she rains down healing on a team while Cloak is enveloped in darkness and is able to blind enemies. They’re diametrically opposed characters in nearly every way, tied together by an unbreakable bond. You essentially have to master two playstyles and learn to manage each of their cooldowns to be an effective player, and skillfully swapping between the two at a moment’s notice can make the difference between a game-saving play or a quick defeat. By design they’re one of the most versatile picks in the game, and I hope they’re a sign that <em>Marvel Rivals</em> will continue to find innovative ways to fill out its roster.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="13a0d4c4bb84a686487292a69691fdd2" data-recommend-id="image://13a0d4c4bb84a686487292a69691fdd2" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mantis stands with her hand on her hip." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mantis stands with her hand on her hip." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="13a0d4c4bb84a686487292a69691fdd2" data-recommend-id="image://13a0d4c4bb84a686487292a69691fdd2" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mantis stands with her hand on her hip." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Guardians of the Galaxy account for almost half of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Strategists, but Mantis is far and away the standout among the three, and one of the most reliable picks in the game. Her utility is some of the best, allowing her to boost damage with her empathic abilities and hard crowd control foes by putting them to sleep, all with solid damage and healing output. On top of that, her ultimate is one of the best survival abilities in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. She heals surrounding foes and converts that healing to overhealth almost immediately, giving her team a tool to push through fortified enemy teams with and helping them hold their ground against the deadliest onslaught of foes. Honestly, depending on the day, I could see Mantis being tied for the number-one spot with who our first-place winner. There just aren’t really any situations in which having a good Mantis on your team is a bad play.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="89c55ae02e7ad5ac1c56ed38a8c97d83" data-recommend-id="image://89c55ae02e7ad5ac1c56ed38a8c97d83" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luna Snow points at the camera with one of her knees raised as if she is dancing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luna Snow points at the camera with one of her knees raised as if she is dancing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89c55ae02e7ad5ac1c56ed38a8c97d83" data-recommend-id="image://89c55ae02e7ad5ac1c56ed38a8c97d83" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luna Snow points at the camera with one of her knees raised as if she is dancing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ resident k-pop star is our pick for the hero shooter’s best strategist. Like Mantis, her kit has great healing and strong CC, and her ultimate is probably the most efficient healing ultimate in the game. It also has a slight edge on Mantis’ similar ult because of its versatility, with Luna being able to shift between near-insurmountable healing and devastating damage boosts that can help your team overcome just about anything. Some of my earliest memories of good team synergy in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>involved using Star-Lord’s ult over a dancing Luna Snow as she cranked up my damage output, deleting enemy teams in seconds. Luna Snow and Mantis have a lot of the same utility with different flavors, but the dancing queen just slightly comes out on top thanks to her excellent Team-up abilities, which give new tools to Namor and Jeff the Land Shark and allow her to wield Iron Fist’s Chi to keep enemies from getting too close. They’re both queens in their own right, though.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 can seem awfully daunting towards beginners and new players, but the iconic tactical shooter from Valve is easy to learn. Unlike in other popular multiplayer titles where there is a constantly shifting meta, CS2 mostly stays the same, apart from the occasional map pool change, a new gun, or a small gameplay tweak.</p>



<p>If you’re a new player jumping into CS2 for the first time ever, here are some tips for beginners to use.<em> </em></p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-learn-the-maps-and-callouts">Learn the Maps and Callouts</h2>



<p>CS2’s primary competitive mode, Premier, uses an active duty map pool that consists of seven bomb defusal maps. Getting used to the map layouts is important to CS2 beginners, but so too is learning the callouts, i.e. the names of specific locations. Knowing the callouts is key to relaying information between teammates.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you have a second monitor, display the map with callouts on your second screen. Over time, you’ll learn the callout locations and will be able to call them without needing the map. There are also community-made aim courses in the Steam Workshop that will help you learn common angles an hiding spots on each map. Speaking of aim courses…</p>



<h2 id="h-practice-makes-perfect">Practice Makes Perfect</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-practice-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Practicing is the only way to get better when you’re a new player to CS2</a>. Arms Race is a great mode for getting used to how all the weapons work and then you can use aim courses, warmup servers, and deathmatches to prioritize the crucial weapons. Once you feel capable with the main weapons, you can jump into Casual games first to get a better sense of the game.</p>



<p>Whether it’s weapon recoil or the round-to-round economy, the only way to get properly familiarized with all the systems in CS2 is to practice.</p>



<h2 id="h-communicate-clearly">Communicate Clearly</h2>



<p>Regardless if you’re a beginner or a veteran player with 1000+ hours, communication is key to winning in CS2. Communication in CS2 is crucial to coordinating everything: T-side rounds, retakes, buys, and crossfires. If you end up getting killed but you relay no information to your teammates, that round loss is on you.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re interested in playing competitive CS2, then it should be a requirement that you have a mic that you use. In a game like CS2, if you’re playing competitive, text chat and pings just are not good enough. And remember that a key part of communication is positivity. If you’re only using your mic to flame your teammates, you’re part of the problem.</p>



<p>What would you tell a new CS2 beginner? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Path of Exile 2’s lead developers have revealed that a hacker was able to compromise 66 player accounts recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.404media.co/hacker-broke-into-path-of-exile-2-admin-account-hijacked-wave-of-characters-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">404Media</a>, Path of Exile 2’s lead developers, Jonathan and Mark, recently appeared on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjxzTAcJqAM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">podcast</a> with Ghazzy TV and Darth Microtransaction. During this interview, the duo was asked whether there had been a data breach at the studio. Mark responded that there had been a situation where a Steam account got hacked, which gave the hacker access to an admin account on Path of Exile 2’s website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers revealed that they are now aware of how the hacker took over the admin account, but they do not understand the “full scope” of what occurred then. Mark explained that one of their admin accounts was linked to a Steam account, and the user of this account wasn’t aware of that. The Path of Exile 2 hacker compromised this account through Steam support, and as the user was not using the account, the malicious activity wasn’t noticed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another reason the Path of Exile 2 hacker went unnoticed was a bug in the system. Mark elaborated that whenever an admin account makes changes, the events are logged into an audit log, which can be checked later. However, due to a bug in the system, the password changes were not recorded as events but as notes instead. The hacker was able to delete these notes, which is why the team at GGG could not tell what was wrong when they looked through the accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark confirmed that 66 notes were deleted, which means that the Path of Exile 2 hacker was able to compromise 66 accounts. However, their log history only extends for 30 days, and the hack began 5 days before that, so the full extent is unknown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark stated they would release a report with all the information they could gather in a day or two. They feared GGG’s data would be breached, and the hacker might gain access to the servers, but that wasn’t the case. The development team also added a bunch of more “security stuff,” which Mark admits should have already been in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark also confirmed that the moment the team realised what was going on, they immediately reset the passwords for all admin accounts and deleted all sessions to ensure their safety. Since then, the Path of Exile 2 hacker has not compromised any other accounts.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-the-board-game-series-buying-guide<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the <a href="https://steamforged.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steamforged Games library</a>, you will find adaptations of some of the video game world’s biggest franchises sprinkled throughout – from Monster Hunter to Devil May Cry, Sea of Thieves to Gears of War, and their gigantic Elden Ring adaptation that is releasing soon. But for now, let's look at the company's Resident Evil series of titles with Resident Evil 1, 2, and 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting with Resident Evil 2 back in 2019, followed by Resident Evil 3 in 2021, and finally Resident Evil in 2023, each game of the trio plays out similarly, sharing a majority of the same mechanics between one another. In each title, you and up to three friends take turns navigating dark passages, burning streets, and nefarious labs as you play out the stories of each respective game. Each game comes complete with a plethora of incredibly detailed plastic miniatures depicting the gruesome creatures you will be going up against alongside those representing your survivor heroes. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player’s turn consists of three phases – the Action Phase, the Reaction Phase, and lastly the Tension phase. What you can do on your turns is straightforward – you have four actions, and with those actions, you can either move, open or close a door, search an area to grab an item, trade with another player in their square, use an item in their inventory, or attack. Enemies act during the reaction phase, where they move towards or attack the active player, causing the player to roll a die to see if they can avoid the danger. And finally, the Tension Phase has the active player draw from the special Tension deck of cards, which can result in three possible outcomes: Nothing happens, something bad happens, and something really bad happens. By the end of the first full go-around, players should have a pretty solid grasp on how to play the games and can start worrying more about how you will survive and thrive this zombie apocalypse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is done by rolling dice, and comparing the rolls with your equipped weapons stat and abilities. Depending on the result, you may simply push an enemy into an adjacent square, kill them, or miss altogether, and its surprising how tough even the most basic of zombies can be to take down, if your dice rolls aren’t lucky that day. Shooting will also give enemies in the adjoining rooms (as long as the doors are open) a free movement to the source of the sound. It's a system that makes you weigh your options and risks when opting for combat, adding to the overall “survival horror” vibe.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/13/20241021-192149-1736792356417.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Being <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign board games</a>, each one contains a number of scenarios that can be played either as one-off experiences or strung together, telling the story of the original games where things carry over from one session to the next. Levels are built using tiles with tokens denoting locked doors, items to pick up, and other goodies to uncover.  At the end of each scenario, players take stock of their inventories, health, and other information that may or may not impact future games. If you and your friends opt to play them as one-off games, each scenario also provides you with a list of gear and info to start you off. It works really well either way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For players that snag multiple entires of the series, there is some crossover that you can do, too – though some things may take a little fidgeting with to work well.  Due to how many mechanics carry over, I have mix-and-matched characters from the other games into ones they don’t normally appear in, such as having Leon trudge through the Spencer Mansion with Chris. Scenario tiles can also be used between games, so long as you don’t mind miss-matched themes on the tiles. Nothing in the rules state this, but if you are so inclined you can without much issue.</p><p id="resident-evil-the-board-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Resident Evil: The Board Game">Resident Evil: The Board Game</h2></p><div catalogid="0195dcc2-f781-49a3-bed4-b2e724443b07" id="213969"><div id="213969" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil: The Board Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>MSRP</strong>: $114.99 USD</li><li><strong>Players</strong>: 1-4 (best with 2)</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 60-90 minutes (per scenario)</li><li><strong>Ages</strong>: 14+</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAbXr7?object_uuid=afd33c54-4717-40f9-ba19-26ce3cadd378&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it at Amazon</strong></a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The newest and most refined of the trilogy, Resident Evil, takes and improves the best ideas of the previous two games and throws in some interesting new mechanics of its own, culminating in a really fun and tense package. In this entry, players such as Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, Rebecca Chambers, or Barry Burton explore the mysterious Spencer mansion and surrounding grounds. New this time around, however, you will also have access to special support characters Albert Wesker (definitely the most trustworthy person in the series), Enrico Marini, Richard Aiken, and Brad Vickers, who can be sent off on special missions to gather supplies and provide the team with other benefits at the risk of being taken out themselves. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Brought over from Resident Evil 3, the narrative flow of Resident Evil is flexible ,with players able to tackle the mansion’s rooms in a variety of orders, with rooms being unlocked by different items and solving puzzles. The mansion and subsequent locations are made up this time from special cards, an improvement over the dashboard paper of RE3, with smaller areas being built and expanded as you play, similar to something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-board-game-buyers-guide">Betrayal at the House on the Hill</a>, making setup for scenarios far quicker than the previous games.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you aren’t looking to play the whole set of games, this is an easy recommendation as the one to get.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The standard zombies are more of a threat this time around (they could be a pain in the previous games as well and were always worrisome when a group was around you) as when you kill one, they don’t leave the gameboard anymore. Instead, their corpses remain until players use a brand new resource, Kerosene, to burn the bodies – else they could return as a more dangerous Red Zombie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of other ways that Resident Evil refines and evolves its gameplay from its older board game siblings, but those are only a taste of what you can expect. If you aren’t looking to get into the whole set of games, this is an easy recommendation as the one out of the three to get.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Resident Evil Board Game Expansions</strong></h2></div><p id="the-bleak-outpost-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="The Bleak Outpost Expansion">Resident Evil: The Bleak Outpost Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="0195dcc2-f781-49a3-bed4-b2e724443b07" id="214018"><div id="214018" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil: The Bleak Outpost</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>MSRP</strong>: $69.99</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXKBv?object_uuid=afd33c54-4717-40f9-ba19-26ce3cadd378&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it at Amazon</strong></a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Adding six new scenarios and two new bosses with Neptune and Plant-42, The Bleak Outpost sends players to new locations, including the Guard House and Aqua Ring. For anyone who fell in love with the base Resident Evil game, this is a great addition. Like the base game, these scenarios can be tackled together as a mini-campaign or as standalone one-off sessions. </p></div><p id="resident-evil-2-the-board-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Resident Evil 2: The Board Game">Resident Evil 2: The Board Game</h2></p><div catalogid="0195dcc2-f781-49a3-bed4-b2e724443b07" id="213970"><div id="213970" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil 2: The Board Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>MSRP</strong>: $114.99 USD (Steamforge website price)</li><li><strong>Player</strong>: 1-4 (Best with 2)</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 60-90 minutes (per scenario)</li><li><strong>Ages</strong>: 14+</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/a0npJE?object_uuid=afd33c54-4717-40f9-ba19-26ce3cadd378&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it at Amazon</strong></a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the game that started it all (in terms of Steamforge's board games anyway), Resident Evil 2 introduced tabletop players to the zombie-infested hallways of the Racoon City police station and the other unspeakable horrors of the Umbrella Corporation. In this entry, players assume the roles of Leon Kennedy, Claire Redfield, Ada Wong or Robert Kendo as they go up a gainst the likes of Lickers, Zombie Dogs, and Birkin over the course off eight scenarios. These missions take players from the S.T.A.R.S Office in the Police Station all the way through their harrowing escape out of the Umbrella Laboratory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 2 may be the second chronologically (third if you count Zero, but that hasn’t received a board game adaptation yet), so while you may have an urge to visit this game after completing the first, I would recommend fighting it and actually starting here instead. That's because this game lacks some of the refinement and nifty features that pop up and are flesh out in the subsequent titles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The campaign of this game is straightforward where one scenario leads directly into the next without any real ability to deviate or tackle them in different orders – an approach that is only found in Resident Evil 2. Other quality-of-life issues also had yet to be worked out, such such as the tiles that you place and build the scenarios with are overly dark, making details hard to see and some games not including the required parts to fasten the life and ammo dials together. There are work arounds for both, and at the end of the day the details on the tiles don’t matter themselves since what matters is more just the shape of them, but it does take away from the experience a little bit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay-wise, though, Resident Evil 2 is still a fun game to play with friends. Some scenarios really require you to plan and strategize or risk getting overwhelmed. It's a solid game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Resident Evil 2 Board Game Expansions</strong></h2></div><p id="b-files-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="B-Files Expansion">Resident Evil 2 The Board Game: B-Files Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="0195dcc2-f781-49a3-bed4-b2e724443b07" id="214019"><div id="214019" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil 2 The Board Game: B-Files Expansion</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>MSRP</strong>: $54.99USD</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3RjOV?object_uuid=afd33c54-4717-40f9-ba19-26ce3cadd378&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it at Amazon</strong></a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who just can’t get enough Resident Evil 2, The B-files expansion doubles the number of scenarios that you and your friends can play through while also giving you brand new items, enemies, and goal – escape from Mr. X!</p></div><p id="malformations-of-g-b-files-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Malformations of G B-Files Expansion">Resident Evil 2: The Board Game - Malformations of G B-Files Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="0195dcc2-f781-49a3-bed4-b2e724443b07" id="214020"><div id="214020" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil 2: The Board Game - Malformations of G B-Files Expansion</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>MSRP</strong>: $32.99</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/zj4e8q?object_uuid=afd33c54-4717-40f9-ba19-26ce3cadd378&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it at Amazon</strong></a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">This small-box expansion is designed to be played alongside the B-Files expansion.

While this next entry retains a majority of the gameplay that was first introduced in its predecessor, out was the linear scenario approach in favor of giving players options in how they want to tackle exploring the burned-out ruins of Raccoon City. This time around, players can choose to pick up the holsters of Jill, Carlos, Mikhail or Nikolai, with each character having unique skills to help to survive the hellscape while being hunted by the menacing Nemesis. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dropping the linear narrative of its predecessor, Resident Evil 3 gives players some options in how they wish to explore Raccoon City, though similar to the video games, some areas are inaccessible until specific key items are discovered in other areas, that will further open up areas of the city. One of the neat things that Resident Evil 3 does is that the game continues to get more dangerous as the city deteriorates around you, with actions you take and whether or not you succeed or fail in your objectives playing a role in how fast it does. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new mechanic, Danger Tracker, reflects how bad things are going, and the worse it gets, the harder things are for players. The new Narrative deck helps keep the game interesting and unique from one play-through to the next. Having to choose whether or not it’s worth it to double back to try and find more resources or press on with what you have really helps to elevate that survival horror sense that the video games are known for.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Component-wise, the only place that this game stumbles with is the “map” of Raccoon City that you navigate around. While the cards are sturdy and feel nice to hold, and the tiles and tokens are solid and fine to punch out, the dashboard featuring the scenario map is on what feels like a small step up from the standard letter paper you would put in your printer, just with a gloss finish to it.  It does its job, but compared to everything else, it certainly is the odd zombie out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are more interested in a more open-ended campaign flow and want to skip over Resident Evil 2, this is a great starting place to get into the board game series with.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Resident Evil 3 Board Game Expansions</strong></h2></div><p id="the-last-escape-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="The Last Escape Expansion">Resident Evil 3: The Last Escape Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="0195dcc2-f781-49a3-bed4-b2e724443b07" id="214023"><div id="214023" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil 3: The Last Escape Expansion</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>MSRP</strong>: $44.99</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wXABp?object_uuid=afd33c54-4717-40f9-ba19-26ce3cadd378&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it at Amazon</strong></a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Adding Barry Burton, Brad Vickers, Tyrell Patrick, Marvin Branagh, Dario Rosso, and Murphy Seeker to the roster of playable characters, along with advanced versions of the base game’s cast, all hands are on deck to deal with the new monsters found in this expansion.

Players are still piecing together how to best use Mister Fantastic against the rest of the roster, but until then, most people just can’t get over how goofy he can be.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/SAtREw22fR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/SAtREw22fR</a></p>— Wong Updates (@WongUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/WongUpdates/status/1878589238020919326?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">A character who can contort his body into strange shapes carries a lot of meme potential. You might have already seen some of <a href="https://x.com/MRivalsHub/status/1876629635435241608" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the many comparisons to One Piece protagonist Monkey D. Luffy</a>, for example, thanks to Mister Fantastic’s Elastic Strength ability. It’s a bit that’s already gained enough traction for the modding community to create <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/1132" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a One Piece custom skin</a> despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-players-are-risking-account-bans-to-mod-the-game-even-after-season-1-clampdown">NetEase cracking down on modding recently</a>.

It’s a useful tool that can be used to turn an enemy’s damage against them, and it also happens to look almost too silly in motion. Using the move sees Mister Fantastic grow to the size of a refrigerator, so you can imagine what walking around like that might look like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ngl I think Mr. Fantastic's design encapsulates everything great about this game," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hzuzb8/comment/m6ug1fo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user said</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is fast approaching, and its scale won't be easy to contend with. Thankfully, developer Niantic has announced a collaboration between mobile game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-now/news/">Monster Hunter Now</a> and Capcom's upcoming behemoth, granting players a number of virtual goodies for a limited time.</p><p>Running from February 3 until March 31, Monster Hunter Now players can tackle a series of quests to earn an array of items and clothing options across both Now and Wilds. For the former, rewards include weapon and armor refining parts, an in-game hoodie layered equipment, and a collaboration guild card background. As for Wilds, you can get a gift code to redeem mega potions, energy drinks, dash juices, and other support items to aid your future hunts.</p><p>If you want to be up to date with each reward batch, make sure to log into Now every Monday in February from 9 AM (local time) to get a supply with item box expansions, potions, and the aforementioned refining parts. Some premium collaboration packs in the in-game shop will also be available from February 3 to February 28.</p><p>You can find more information about the collab event in the official <a href="https://monsterhunternow.com/en/news/collab-jan2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/report-after-many-leaks-switch-2-announcement-could-come-this-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Nintendo may be getting ready to make its Switch 2 console official. According to "industry whispers" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">collected by Eurogamer</a>, as well as <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1878827836741673217">reporting</a> from The Verge's Tom Warren, the Switch 2 could be formally announced sometime this week. Eurogamer suggests the reveal is scheduled for this Thursday, January 16.</p>
<p>The reporting also suggests that the reveal will focus mostly on the console's hardware design, with another game-centered announcement coming later. Eurogamer reports that the console won't be ready to launch until April; this would be similar to Nintendo's strategy for the original Switch, which was announced in mid-January 2017 but not launched until March.</p>
<p>Many things about the Switch 2's physical hardware design have been thoroughly leaked at this point, thanks mostly to accessory makers who have been showing off their upcoming cases. Accessory maker Genki was at CES last week with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/our-best-look-yet-at-the-switch-2s-expanded-size-and-snap-on-joy-cons/">a 3D-printed replica of the console</a> based on the real thing, suggesting a much larger but still familiar-looking console with a design and button layout similar to the current Switch.</p>
<p>On the inside, the console is said to sport a new Nvidia-designed Arm processor with a much more powerful GPU and more RAM than the current Switch. Dubbed "T239," Eurogamer reports that the chip includes 1,536 CUDA cores based on the Ampere architecture, the same used in 2020's GeForce RTX 30-series graphics cards on the PC.</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> could be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/" data-ref-id="1100-6528763">unveiled as soon as this week</a>, according to some reports. But once the system arrives, the real question is what's going to be on it beyond AAA Nintendo titles? According to a new report, Nintendo may have already secured some AAA support from Konami, Square Enix, and Ubisoft.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nate the Hate</a> is reporting that Konami's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-stays-loyal-to-the-mission/1100-6526099/" data-ref-id="1100-6526099">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> will be among the titles available on Switch 2, as will Square Enix's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-intermission-review-half-measure/1900-6417689/" data-ref-id="1900-6417689">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>. But it sounds like Ubisoft will be going even deeper by bringing a port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-back-to-basics/1900-6418126/" data-ref-id="1900-6418126">Assassin’s Creed Mirage</a> for the Switch 2 launch window. The upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, is also said to be in the works for Switch 2, but not in time for the system's launch. That title was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20/1100-6528717/" data-ref-id="1100-6528717">recently pushed back to March</a>.</p><p>The report goes to mention that Ubisoft is "doing more than half a dozen games for the Switch 2," including a game from The Division series, Rainbow Six Siege, and a potential compilation of the two Mario + Rabbids games. Earlier this month, a separate report from Nate the Hate suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">Microsoft will bring Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to both Switch 2 and PS5 in 2025.</p><p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-many-units-the-switch-2-could-sell-in-2025-in-the-us/1100-6528704/" data-ref-id="1100-6528704">Switch 2 could sell 4.3 million consoles</a> this year alone in the US, according to at least one video game analyst. Despite Nintendo's veil of secrecy, potentially leaked details about the Switch 2 have been running rampant. At CES, Genki showed off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">a Switch 2 mockup</a> that may have earned the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reportedly-sent-lawyers-to-genki-about-switch-2-mockup-at-ces/1100-6528776/" data-ref-id="1100-6528776">a visit by Nintendo's lawyers</a>. Once Nintendo officially announces Switch 2, the level of interest it attracts may only get bigger as it gets closer to launch.</p>

It’s a fan-favorite due to its highly viable minion builds that sprint through zones, clearing mobs with reckless abandon. But for a new player, making it to the end-game with the Witch means picking the right starting skills—a strong foundation. Let’s go over what that foundation looks like and what your best options are when starting out as a Witch. I wish I had taken these skills for the Witch in <em>Path of Exile 2</em> on my first playthrough.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195734" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195734,196411,195189" data-current="195734"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21246.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h15493"><a id="active"></a>The best Witch early-game skills to snag<br></h2><p>In <em>Path of Exile 2</em>, the skills you’ll unlock for your class range from Tier 1 to Tier 13, albeit skipping a few in between. Let’s focus on Tiers 1, 3, and 5, which will provide you with an early-game foundation toward success.</p><h3 id="h15494"><a id=""></a><strong>Tier I: Skeletal Sniper</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-recommend-id="image://f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Skeletal Sniper skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Skeletal Sniper skill in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-recommend-id="image://f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Skeletal Sniper skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Unearth </strong>is a relatively basic-yet-functional AoE (area-of-effect) skill that is completely free during the prologue section on the beach. But if you want to enhance your area damage, choose <strong>Skeletal Sniper</strong> as your Tier I skill. This is a powerful minion spell that summons a skeleton archer wielding a poison gas bow and arrow.</p><h3 id="h15495"><a id=""></a><strong>Tier III: Skeletal Arsonist</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-recommend-id="image://a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows the Skeletal Arsonist skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu shows the Skeletal Arsonist skill in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-recommend-id="image://a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows the Skeletal Arsonist skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Keeping up with the AoE theme, your second ability (this one for Tier 3), should be <strong>Skeletal Arsonist</strong>. This is another minion summon spell that spawns a group of bomb-throwing skeletons to wreak havoc on a given area. It’s exceptional for controlling an arena, like during one of the game’s many optional boss fights.</p><h3 id="h15496"><a id=""></a><strong>Tier V: Raise Zombie</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-recommend-id="image://caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Raise Zombie skill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Raise Zombie skill." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-recommend-id="image://caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Raise Zombie skill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lastly, for Tier 5, consider<strong> Raise Zombie</strong>. It is, as expected, another minion summon spell, just one that’s on a short timer. You can raise up to 10 zombies, creating a horde of minions that lash out at enemies who come too close. With Raise Zombie and your Skeletal spawning skills, you’ll have a small, undead force to rampage through a map.</p><h2 id="h15497"><a id="passive"></a>Best passive skills for the Witch<br></h2><figure id="" data-id="ae307356176271e58c922cdf51c3f050" data-recommend-id="image://ae307356176271e58c922cdf51c3f050" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the passive skill tree for the witch.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As should be obvious by now, the foundation we just discussed will lead you on to a heavy summons build in <em>Path of Exile 2</em>. As a new player, you may quickly feel overwhelmed by the passive skill tree, but it’s less intimidating than it appears. This is the passive skill tree for all classes, so you don’t have to worry about most of the tree, just your section where the game starts.</p><p>With that said, first, focus on the left-hand path, which<strong> increases</strong> <strong>Spell and Minion Damage</strong>. While it may change during Early Access, the first node provides a noticeable boost in your damage output,<strong> increasing Spell Damage by 8 percent and Minion Damage by 8 percent</strong>.</p><p>You should follow this path of the tree for a short while, then refocus your efforts on the right-hand node path, which will increase survivability. You’ll be a glass cannon initially, but it’s worthwhile to increase the power of your summons, which will handle the brunt of the work.</p><p>Of course, if you prefer a more tactical approach, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-mercenary-class-guide-beginners-best-1851721613&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-mercenary-class-guide-beginners-best-1851721613">new Mercenary class is considered one of the best in <em>Path of Exile 2</em> Early Access</a></span>!

<p>Xbox is set to get a new game from a “legendary Japanese IP” in 2025. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-2025-predictions-and-overview-microsofts-most-promising-games-line-up-in-history-meets-a-platform-under-duress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden</a> of Windows Central, the mystery game during Xbox’s upcoming Developer Direct will be from a classic Japanese franchise.</p>



<p>Corden didn’t spoil anything regarding what the game may be, but did say it has “decades of history”.</p>



<p>“[Our] sources indicate that it is a new entry in a legendary Japanese IP which has decades of history, and should make a lot of fans happy,” he said.</p>



<p>He continued: “Indeed, Microsoft has won some strong support from the region lately from studios like Square Enix for Final Fantasy, HoYoverse for Genshin Impact, and Sega/ATLUS for Persona, and we suspect this new game will help further that trend.”</p>



<p>Aside from the unknown Japanese title, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct</a> on January 23 will feature looks at games like South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>







<p>“Presented by the game creators themselves, Developer_Direct offers an in-depth look at upcoming titles, how they’re being created, and who’s creating them,” Xbox says. </p>



<p>In addition to the four games expected to be shown during the event, Xbox is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-xbox-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gearing up for a strong</a> 2025. The company also has Avowed scheduled to release in February as well as the reboot of Fable expected to launch sometime this year.</p>

                <p>The first major professional tennis tournament of the year, the Australian Open, is underway now in Melbourne. New for the 2025 event is an alternate broadcast that makes players look like something out of Wii Sports. The Australian Open organizers rolled out what they are calling "AO Animated" versions of tennis matches this year, featuring animated, video game-looking versions of the real players.</p><p>As you can see in the video game, from the Jacob Fearnley vs. Nick Kyrgios match, the animation is far from perfect--at times, the player's racket and the tennis ball vanish out of thin air. The audio doesn't sync up perfectly, either. But it's pretty solid, all things considered.
