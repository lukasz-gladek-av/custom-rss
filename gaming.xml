        <p>The “Yuki Onna” or snow woman moves quickly and glides with barely a sound. Make sure you listen carefully or she’ll appear when you least expect it! When Yuki Onna finds you, she spits out a blizzard which causes the player to be frozen in ice. Take care to watch the floors too, if they’re frozen by Yuki Onna, you’re likely to slip around and be caught more easily.</p><p><strong>About “The Mine”</strong></p><p>The mine was once a site where silver ore was excavated with vigor. Back in those days, silver was highly valued by those in power and it would take several hours to traverse through all of the tunnels.</p><p>Many workers were employed to dig through this maze of large tunnels. It was also difficult to get to the mines from the nearest village due to its rugged surroundings coupled with heavy snowfall. It was common for workers of the mine to sleep in a bare bones rest area in the tunnels, forced to work everyday without getting enough sleep. As a result, it was common for people to lose their lives due to accidents caused by human error.</p><p>The site grew to be revered as a mine that “once you enter, you never leave.”</p><p><strong>About the Downloadable Content</strong></p><p>Our very first downloadable content includes two additional characters and a soundtrack to the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/la-quimera-review-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Editor's note</strong></em><em>: La Quimera was originally set to fully release on April 25, but it was unexpectedly delayed that same day. </em><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2282350/announcements/detail/512957012199342082" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>A developer update on April 29</em></a><em> didn't provide a new release date, but did say La Quimera would now be launching in Early Access whenever it did arrive. This announcement came well after our review of what we were initially told would be the full game was largely complete – however, the update post indicates that the content at its new launch will be the same as what we played, so we have decided to publish this as a review of the Early Access version.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have to admit, I’m a sucker for direct-to-video sequels. There’s something about being five Tremors movies deep where all pretense is abandoned, and we all know what we are there for: To watch some ridiculous action and give our brains a break for a bit. La Quimera reminds me a lot of popcorn flicks like that. This FPS is not particularly good-looking, well-written, or innovative. The action doesn’t do anything memorable, and its acting ranges from mediocre to terrible. There is admittedly a certain charm to be found here, especially if you bring a friend or two along to share this rocky ride in co-op. But by nearly every metric, La Quimera is about as good a game as Tremors 5: Bloodlines is a movie. Which is to say it’s not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in the fictional South American city of Nuevo Caracas, the world is going to hell in a handbasket. Outside the city walls, some sort of robot apocalypse that’s never really explained is taking place. Inside, there are warring corporations and extreme poverty. That setup isn’t a socio-political commentary so much as a throwback to 80s sci-fi, complete with Power Loader-esque rigs that would look right at home on Ellen Ripley in Aliens. As a new PMC recruit, you and your squad get stuck in the middle of some nonspecific and uninteresting power struggle between corporations, leaving an equal mix of broken bodies and bots in your wake. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">La Quimera Early Access Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There is some legitimately cool environmental storytelling here. My favorite by far is the Bone Wall, a literal wall filled with what must be thousands of skeletons, that you get to see when one mission takes you deep through it. A voice in your ear describes the desperation that went into building the wall as all hell was breaking loose, and it’s neat to piece together how there was no time to slow down and help anyone who fell, whether that was due to exhaustion, injury, or dying from whatever encroaching threat drove the frantic construction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, La Quimera would have been better off if it let the environments do <em>all </em>the talking, because once its characters open their mouths, it is rough. The dialogue is awful, with obscenity-laced tirades that sound like someone watched a Quentin Tarantino movie once, and tried to mimic it without knowing how to make any of the lines land. The acting also ranges from a normal kind of bad to so awkward I can’t tell if it’s being purposefully campy or potentially using some sort of poorly implemented AI. Characters are very chatty too, and I found myself actively cringing on several occasions as allies shout out things like, “Oh perfect, robot dogs!”. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The dialogue is awful, and I found myself actively cringing on several occasions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The story itself doesn’t make much sense, either. Apparently, saving a billionaire’s daughter gets your PMC conscripted because… you are afraid he will sue? Which, naturally, means the people in the PMC all have to get experimental and highly dangerous augmentations, too. I wouldn’t mind the nonsense, it’s fine enough as a vehicle to make me want to go shoot robots – but the story is so clearly unfinished, ending abruptly after just a few hours without resolving anything. Developer Reburn unexpectedly decided to delay La Quimera on the day it was supposed to launch, and then later announced its eventual release would have the Early Access label on it. Given development is largely based out of Kyiv in Ukraine, the fact that it’s still coming out at all feels like something of an achievement worth applauding. But while this campaign is planned to grow over time, the version that's here now doesn't have any semblance of a complete story. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Identity Crysis</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">La Quimera isn’t exactly shy about the influence Crysis has had on it. Early on, you and your crew gain access to exosuits, complete with energy-powered armor, cloaking, and scanning. That last bit is especially important – one quick ping allows you and your teammates to see any nearby enemies, even behind cover. That’s huge when your weapons operate like a poor man’s version of the FarSight from Perfect Dark, able to lethally penetrate shockingly thick obstacles. It’s extremely satisfying to drop a bunch of orange silhouettes in rapid succession from sight unseen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, where Crysis tended to be more of an inverted funnel that pushed you toward open areas, La Quimera is decidedly about straight lines. Its levels are very linear, and your objective is almost always to clear enemies as you walk from point A to point B. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as a bit of a throwback like this can be a welcome palate cleanser in a time when wide-open gameplay is increasingly the norm, but it does all start to become a bland blur. That’s because so many areas repeat the same cycle of kill the enemies, open the heavy door, kill the next enemies, open the next heavy door, and so on. There are a handful of encounters that break that trend, most notably an extended gunfight on a slowly rising elevator in a corporate office building, but they are few and far between.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The gunplay itself is extremely basic, with your weapons effectively limited to a sidearm, shotgun, or rifle. You can’t change guns mid-mission, nor pick up any temporary options like a limited-use power weapon. You are given the choice between conventional firearms and electromagnetic weapons – the former works better against humans, while the latter tears through shields and robots more quickly – but you’ll be required to bring one of each into your missions anyway. Which one gets to be the more powerful primary weapon and which is relegated to your sidearm could have added a small strategic wrinkle, but the conventional arms are <em>so</em> poor against bots that there’s only one right choice, which is too bad. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing I like best about the fights themselves is the ammo economy. Bullets can become scarce, especially in later missions, which means you can’t just sit in one spot and pick off every enemy by shooting through walls the whole time. I had to keep moving to either scavenge rounds off of corpses or find more ammo boxes, which was just enough to create some badly needed forward momentum during otherwise slow fights. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Time is Money</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As a PMC, you are, of course, paid for completing missions – but while there are things to buy between them, the progression is badly underbaked at this point. There aren’t enough items or upgrades for sale in the first place, and the stuff that <em>is </em>here isn’t very interesting. You could buy one of a very small number of generic guns, or invest in either of the two alternate versions of your exosuit’s head, arms, torso, and legs, each of which have differences like improved cooldowns or increased med kit capacity. But those effects are all so small that it’s hard to feel a need for any of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The way you get money is a little weird, too. In addition to completing missions, cash can also be found in containers mid-level – but you have very shallow pockets for some odd reason, hitting “max money” far too quickly (which is a problem I can say with all honesty I have never experienced in my life). That's too bad, because collecting more would have given me a real incentive to go off the beaten path. There are some of the obligatory voice memos people seem to leave behind in every video game, but I can’t bring myself to opt into hearing more of this dialogue than I absolutely need to. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Justin's favorite military shooters</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For as down as I am on La Quimera (and, believe me, I am), I did still have a strangely fun time with it. That’s due primarily to two things: First, you can play the entire campaign (minus the tutorial) in online co-op with up to two other people. A couple of buddies is the exact thing you need to transform cringey dialogue from something you’ll roll your eyes at into a hilarious shared experience. Having another gun or two covering your back makes the combat more exciting as well, and the ability to do things like alternate who is doing scans so that you are never waiting on that ability’s cooldown keeps the fights moving at a faster pace. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other quality that keeps its many issues from becoming downright infuriating is how short La Quimera is. It took me right around four hours to complete my first playthrough. That could certainly be a negative if you put a lot of weight on “hours played per dollar spent” or whatever, but it does make a stronger case for going in with some friends, having a ridiculous time, and then getting out in a way that lets you enjoy the handful of high points while minimizing the impact of the lows. Of course, one of the reasons for this brief length is that La Quimera is outright incomplete in parts, and it would need to be significantly fleshed out to justify spending any more time than this in Nuevo Caracas anyway.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">La Quimera is bad, but it’s also a perfect example of how even something bad can have a bit of charm. The writing is cringey, the acting is embarrassing, and the middling but serviceable action tends to follow the same basic loop on repeat – but if some friends are riding this partially derailed train with you, there is still some fun to be found here. It doesn’t quite hit “so bad, it’s good” levels of jank, but it could still be a decent candidate for an evening of goofs. That said, even going into it with the right expectations, I wish there was any story resolution whatsoever, as La Quimera is clearly unfinished in more ways than one.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Apple and Epic Games have had bad ties for the past few years, especially after the latter introduced an alternative payment method that got it banned from the App Store. After years of lawsuits and rulings, Apple was ruled to be in violation of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-appeals-in-epic-games-lawsuit-wants-app-store-changes-delay/">2021 injunction</a> that required developers to redirect users to third-party purchase options on the web through dedicated in-app links. In response, Epic Games CEO and founder stated on X that Fortnite will return to the iOS App Store next week while offering Apple a proposal that could go in its favor in the long run.</p>
<h2>Epic proposes ending all legal disputes if Apple agrees to drop its 27 percent commission on external web transactions following the court ruling</h2>
<p>Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers has been handling the Apple vs. Epic Games battle for the past five years, and the latest remarks suggest that Apple is in "willful violation" of the 2021 injunction, which was provisioned to prevent anticompetitive behavior in the market. The ruling reads: "Apple's continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated." While Apple did allow developers to put an in-app link that would direct users to the web for payment, it also took a 12 to 27 percent cut from the transaction.</p>
<p>Epic Games escalated the scene, stating that the iPhone maker should be held in contempt of court for falling behind in complying with the order regarding the fee structure. Apple claimed it was already completely compliant with the injunction, but the judge took Epic's side. You can check out the 80-page order <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.1508.0_2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>To summarize: One, after trial, the Court found that Apple's 30 percent commission "allowed it to reap supracompetitive operating margins" and was not tied to the value of its intellectual property, and thus, was anticompetitive. Apple's response: charge a 27 percent commission (again tied to nothing) on off-app purchases, where it had previously charged nothing, and extend the commission for a period of seven days after the consumer linked-out of the app. Apple's goal: maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream.</p>
<p>Two, the Court had prohibited Apple from denying developers the ability to communicate with, and direct consumers to, other purchasing mechanisms. Apple's response: impose new barriers and new requirements to increase friction and increase breakage rates with full page "scare" screens, static URLs, and generic statements. Apple's goal: to dissuade customer usage of alternative purchase opportunities and maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream.</p>
<p>In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court's Injunction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judge Rogers also stated that the court "will not tolerate further delays" and that the company will not impede the competition. This means that the company should allow developers to communicate with the end-user, offering transactions outside of the app with an amended fee structure for transactions. You can check out the ruling below, which is effective immediately.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Imposing any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app, and as a consequence thereof, no reason exists to audit, monitor, track or require developers to report purchases or any other activity that consumers make outside an app;</li>
<li>Restricting or conditioning developers' style, language, formatting, quantity, flow or placement of links for purchases outside an app;</li>
<li>Prohibiting or limiting the use of buttons or other calls to action, or otherwise conditioning the content, style, language, formatting, flow or placement of these devices for purchases outside an app;</li>
<li>Excluding certain categories of apps and developers from obtaining link access;</li>
<li>Interfering with consumers' choice to proceed in or out of an app by using anything other than a neutral message apprising users that they are going to a third-party site;</li>
<li>Restricting a developer's use of dynamic links that bring consumers to a specific product page in a logged-in state rather than to a statically defined page, including restricting apps from passing on product details, user details or other information that refers to the user intending to make a purchase.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The court has referred the case to the United States Attorney for the North District of California, allowing it to "investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate." Tim Sweeney took to X to share his thoughts on the ruling, stating that Fortnite will return to the iOS App Store in the United States next week. However, he also proposed that Epic Games would "drop all current and future litigation" if Apple complies with the ruling.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week.</p>
<p>Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic. <a href="https://t.co/bIRTePm0Tv">https://t.co/bIRTePm0Tv</a></p>
<p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917716512347152499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At this stage, it remains to be seen if Apple will challenge the ruling and keep the case an ongoing fiasco or will finally succumb and introduce new policies and drop the off-app transaction fee for developers. The move could end Apple's quarrel with Epic but also hurt its revenue from its services. As we speak, Apple's Services revenue is a quarter of the total, and it could give all developers a nudge to shift their payment methods outside the app. We will keep you updated with the latest, so keep an eye out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/fortnite-will-return-to-ios-after-court-slams-apples-obvious-cover-up/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>In a statement provided to Ars Technica, an Apple spokesperson said, "We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal."</p>
<h2>An Epic return</h2>
<p>With the new court order in place, Epic says it will once again submit a version of <em>Fortnite</em> to the iOS App Store in the US in the next week or so. That new version will offer players the option to use standard Apple App Store payments or its own, cheaper "Epic Direct Payment" system to purchase in-game currency and items.</p>
<p>That would mirror the system that was briefly in place for iOS players in August 2020, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/epic-gives-fortnite-players-discounts-for-skirting-apple-google-fees/">Epic added alternate payment options to iOS <em>Fortnite</em></a> in intentional violation of what were then Apple's store policies. Apple removed <em>Fortnite</em> from the iOS App Store hours later, setting off a legal battle that seems to finally be reaching its conclusion.</p>
<p>For those few hours when Epic Direct Payments were available on iOS <em>Fortnite</em> in 2020, Sweeney said that about 50 percent of customers "decided to give Epic a shot," going through an additional step to register and pay through an Epic account on a web page outside the app itself (and saving 20 percent on their purchase in the process). The other roughly 50 percent of customers decided to pay a higher price in exchange for the convenience of paying directly in the app through the iOS account they already had set up, Sweeney said. "Consumers were making the choice... and it was a wonderful thing to see," he said.</p>
<p>Speaking to the press Wednesday night, Sweeney said the new court order was a "huge victory for developers" looking to offer their own payment service alongside Apple's on iOS devices. "This is what we've wanted all along," he said. "We think that this achieves the goal that we've been aiming for in the US, while there are still some challenges elsewhere in the world."</p>
<p>While Sweeney said the specific iOS developer account Epic used to publish <em>Fortnite</em> in 2020 is still banned, he added that the company has several other developer accounts that could be used for the new submission, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/judge-issues-restraining-order-protecting-unreal-engine-development-on-ios/">one it has used to support Unreal Engine on Apple devices</a>. And while Sweeney allowed that Apple could still "arbitrarily reject Epic from the App Store despite Epic following all the rules," he added that, in light of this latest court ruling, Apple would now "have to deal with various consequences of that if they did."</p>

<p><em>Bloomberg</em>&nbsp;also reports that one of the two incubation projects Respawn has canceled was an extraction shooter set within the Titanfall universe. As an incubation project, the title was very early in development. EA issued a statement about the layoffs, saying in part:</p>

<p>"These decisions aren’t easy, and we are deeply grateful to every teammate affected – their creativity and contributions have helped build Respawn into what it is today. We’re offering meaningful support to those impacted, including exploring new opportunities within EA."</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Original Story:</strong> </em>Respawn Entertainment, the developer behind Titanfall, Apex Legends, and the Star Wars Jedi series, has announced layoffs due to internal changes to its development pipeline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543">statement</a>, the developer says it is making “adjustments” to its Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi teams, the latter of which is currently working on a follow-up to 2023’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor/capturing-the-fantasy">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>. The developer has also ceased development of two “early-stage incubation projects.”</p>

<p>These changes have resulted in layoffs for an unknown number of staff. Respawn states it will offer “meaningful support” to affected employees, including finding new opportunities within publisher EA.</p>

<p>“Looking ahead, our commitment to player-first experiences remains unchanged,” says Respawn. “Innovation has always been at the core of Respawn’s identity, and it continues to drive how we build the future – from evolving live experiences to crafting new worlds and stories.”</p>

<p>The Borderlands 4 State of Play airs at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET and will run for 20 minutes. The presentation will be hosted by Gearbox creative director Graeme Timmins and senior project producer Anthony Nicholson to provide a guided look at gameplay. Expect to see the game’s new weapons, returning characters, and Action Skills, among other features.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/26vY2GMfYTw" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game’s launch date has been bumped up to September 12. The announcement was seemingly posted earlier than intended, with a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lnxicudw3e2c">video</a> of Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford announcing the date that was quickly taken down before Gearbox officially revealed the news about an hour later. Regardless, it’s always nice to see a game arrive earlier than expected rather than being delayed.</p>

<p>Borderlands 4 was first revealed at Gamescom 2024. Set on the planet Kairos, players control four new Vault Hunters to hunt for riches while battling the planet’s tyrannical dictator, the Timekeeper. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A Switch 2 version is slated to arrive sometime this year.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Gearbox showcased Borderlands 4 gameplay in a big way with a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/">State of Play</a> presentation that dug deeper into the changes in the game's loot, gear, movement, and overall gameplay, along with a few story tidbits.</p>
<p>The presentation took 20 minutes to show off a new gameplay trailer, before getting into different elements of Borderlands 4. It was also, expectedly, since it was a PlayStation presentation, all PS5 Pro gameplay footage.</p>
<p>One of the first changes you'll notice is your new movement capabilities. Being able to glide, for example, has a huge impact on how you can move around in combat and while exploring the world. You also have a grapple hook that can grab onto certain spots.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 | Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkIqhvWWiQQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Or, if you find one of a new kind of overworld activity in Borderlands 4, a Silo, you can launch yourself into the air to cover larger distances.</p>
<p>Another big change is that we're not on Pandora anymore, and have landed on a new planet called Kairos, which had been kept a galaxy-wide secret by a new antagonist called the Timekeeper. Basically, the Timekeeper kept the planet's population from leaving by controlling them with chips in their brains called bolts.</p>
<p>When a moon somehow teleported into the orbit of Kairos, it caused a big hullabaloo in the Timekeeper's keep-the-planet-a-secret protective cover, and the chips essentially stopped working. People started tearing them out of their skulls, and now there's a lot of fighting. That's where you, along with other fan-favorite vault hunter characters, along with a few new additions, enter the scene to help put an end to the Timekeeper.</p>
<p>The presentation introduced two of the new vault hunters joining the team, Rafa, an exosuited soldier, and a siren called Vex, who can summon her own familiar called 'Trouble,' who is a phantom giant alien sabertooth tiger that does different elemental attacks according to how you've chosen to customize your arsenal.</p>
<p>Which leads into what was a major portion of the presentation, how weapon customization has changed, and how character customization has changed, all before getting into the choices Borderlands players are used to with elemental damage and weapon types from various in-world weapons manufacturers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - State of Play Deep Dive | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KlRBwf3sjY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A key change is that you can customize weapons by putting together a gun that includes different parts from different manufacturers, to try and create the weapon that fits how you'd like to play. But that only gets interesting to make when you've found the right loot, and in terms of finding loot, Gearbox also confirmed that it has "<em>overhauled</em>" how drop rates work in Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>According to Gearbox, the times you find a legendary weapon will "<em>truly be special events</em>" once again in Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>In terms of how you can customize your vault hunter, each one will have a passive ability, and three "<em>action skills</em>" you can swap between. You can choose which action skill you use with that vault hunter, and then you can also improve and adjust that skill through its skill tree. Each of the three action skills a vault hunter has also has a skill tree, which you can re-spec and adjust how you like as you play.</p>
<p>Most of the focus in this presentation was on how key elements of the gameplay have changed, but plenty more about the game was notably missing. We didn't get any showcase on what the story will feel like; other than that, it'll have a serious moment or two.</p>
<p>Not to say the lighthearted elements of Borderlands won't be there, just that it was absent here. This was definitely a gameplay-first presentation, which is all fine and well, but it will be curious to see players' reactions when we eventually see that side of the game. Some of the loudest complaints players had about Borderlands 3 came from the dialogue and the story, with the biggest issue many players had being the two villains.</p>
<p>A repeat of that situation here would definitely be a disappointment, but if all the gameplay changes hold up, it won't be a deal-breaker for many players.</p>

Tons of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> and simulation games have some form of cooking mechanic or, at the very least, delicious-looking food. From the cozy familiarity of meals from Stardew Valley to fantastical feasts in The Witcher, I can personally say I've encountered tons of animated food I wish was real. Well, turns out it can be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gaming cookbooks offer an opportunity to learn unique recipes while immersing yourself in the lore of a world you love. Getting the materials you need might not be as fun as in-game adventuring or farming, but the end result is more than worth it. Whether you're passionate about a specific game, are looking for gift ideas, or just love some themed recipes, here's our list of the best gaming cookbooks in 2025. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Our Favorite Gaming Cookbooks in 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of our top picks for gaming cookbooks is The Official Stardew Valley cookbook, which features 50 recipes written in the voice of various characters as well as some adorable art. The recipes are naturally based on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Cooking_Recipes">meals you can make in-game</a>, including Pink Cake, Strange Buns, and even a full Autumn's Bounty to help you power through the mines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A great gift to inspire young chefs (especially those who particularly enjoyed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-a-minecraft-movie">A Minecraft Movie</a>), the Minecraft cookbook includes 40+ recipes inspired by the game's various mobs and biomes. The same goes for The Pokémon Cookbook, which focuses more on cute snacks and quick meals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of crafting-based games, themed cookbooks are also a great way to immerse yourself in fantasy worlds. The official Witcher cookbook takes inspiration from the games as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-books-reading-order">The Witcher books</a>, with 80 recipes covering everything from a refreshing drink to an exquisite banquet. The Elder Scrolls cookbook hones in on the world of Skyrim (as opposed to the rest of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-games-in-order">Elder Scrolls games</a>) while the Fallout cookbook is great for anyone who's particularly curious about the taste of Nuka-Cola. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls: The Official Cookbook</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the tabletop side of gaming, the Heroes' Feast Dungeons &amp; Dragons cookbook is the crème de la crème for anyone trying to impress their party. Across the board, these cookbooks feature great recipes as well as interesting new bits of lore and art for dedicated fans. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Upcoming Video Game Cookbooks </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The trend of gaming cookbooks isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Some upcoming gaming cookbooks include one inspired by Pac-Man, which, to be completely honest, is a mystery to me, as well as Borderlands, presumably part of the promotions for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>. As someone who's long been curious about Sojiro's curry from Persona 5, I'm particularly excited about the cookbook inspired by the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona games</a> coming out later this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Blythe (she/her) is an SEO Coordinator at IGN who spends way too much time in character customization screens and tracking down collectibles. </em></p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 30, 2025 9:58 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Borderlands 4, as we learned this week, is now arriving earlier than expected - but definitely not because of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, oh no. And with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">revised 12th September release date now out there</a>, developer Gearbox has shared more of its latest looty shooter in a new PlayStation showcase.
</p>
<p>
Weighing in at around 20 minutes, Gearbox's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KlRBwf3sjY">PlayStation-hosted Borderlands 4 "deep dive" video</a> spotlights a couple of new Vault Hunters, some of its new weapons, new traversal mechanics, its new planet, and more - all to whip-up enthusiasm for what creative director Graeme Timmins called "hands-down our best Borderlands ever".
</p>
<p>
Borderlands 4 - which supposedly harkens back to a time when the series was more "grounded", according to Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford - features four new Vault Hunters, and two were the focus of the studio's showcase: Vex the Siren and Rafa the Exo-Soldier.

<p>
Vex can utilise supernatural phase energy and conjure deadly minions, while Rafa comes equipped with an experimental exo-suit capable of "digistructing" an arsenal of weapons. In an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/">accompanying PlayStation Blog post</a>, Gearbox noted players can choose from three signature abilities  for their Vault Hunters, and there's talk of unique class Traits, special arguments, capstone abilities, and three branching upgrade paths of passive skills.
</p>
<p>
The team also highlighted some of Borderlands 4 new movement abilities - including gliding, dashing, double-jumping, and point-grappling - as they offered a short introduction to the Kairos, the all-new, seamlessly connected planet where the series' latest action unfolds. Expect new faces, returning characters - including Claptrap, Moxxi, and Zane - plus a personalised Digirunner vehicle players can summon to speed around the place.
</p>
<p>
There's plenty more detail to be found across Gearbox's deep dive video and blog post, so if any of that appeals, remember: Borderlands 4 now launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 12th September and not two weeks later. Why? That's "100 percent" down to the studio's "confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-not-the-reason-for-borderlands-4-release-date-change-randy-pitchford-insists">according to Pitchford</a>. And really, honestly, nothing to do with publisher Take-Two wanting to nudge it out the way of its other big game, GTA 6.

Borderlands 4 will feature eight weapon manufacturers, three of which--Order, Ripper, and Daedalus--are brand new. Each weapons manufacturer offers specialized weapons, usually excelling at some specific, like Jakobs weapons providing additional critical-hit damage.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KlRBwf3sjY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0KlRBwf3sjY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 Loot Manufacturers:</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Jakobs - Critical hit friendly</li><li dir="ltr">Maliwan - Elemental focused</li><li dir="ltr">Vladof - Less accuracy, more bullets</li><li dir="ltr">Tediore - Toss to reload</li><li dir="ltr">Torgue - Explosive</li><li dir="ltr">Order - charge shots</li><li dir="ltr">Ripper - Fully automatic</li><li dir="ltr">Daedalus - Easy to use, multiple ammo types</li></ul><p>As detailed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/" rel="nofollow ">PlayStation Blog</a>, Unlike the previous Borderlands games, the weapon manufacturers are going to overlap in Borderlands 4 as part of the Licensed Parts system. This system causes weapons to feature parts from different manufacturers, giving you multiple specialties on a single weapon. The example shown was a Vladof gun with a high ammo capacity using Torgue explosive bullets. It sounds like weapons will drop this way, as there was no mention of crafting or changing out parts on guns.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the new guns, there are also three new equipment types in Borderlands 4. Ordnance is a new shared slot for grenades and heavy weapons. Heavy weapons now operate on a cooldown system instead of using ammo. Enhancements replace Artifacts and now focus on providing boosts to specific weapon manufacturers. Lastly are the Repkits, which can provide healing or buffs on a cooldown.</p><p dir="ltr">Gearbox also discussed how it would be changing the loot drops in Borderlands 4 to make the loot chase more exciting. This primarily means reducing how frequently legendary weapons drop and improving their individual stats and unique abilities to make finding them feel more exciting. Loot will be instanced for each individual player in co-op in Borderlands 4, and to help out with the loot grind, you will be able to replay missions and boss fights for more loot drops.</p><p>Borderlands 4 recently had its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-up/1100-6531192/">release date moved up</a> to September 12, when it will release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>

Pitchford has since claimed that the game’s release date shifting has nothing to do with other games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>or <em>Marathon</em></a></span><em>. </em>Regardless, the looter shooter is coming out sooner than expected, and so it makes sense that Gearbox wanted to show it off via a new PlayStation State of Play.</p><p>On April 30,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sony aired a 2o-minute gameplay deep dive into <em>Borderlands 4</em></a></span> in which we learned a lot more about the upcoming FPS. Here are 13 key pieces of information from the event.</p><hr><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Pitchford claims <em>Borderlands 4 </em>is going to have a more “grounded tone” that harkens back to the original game.</li><li>Two of the new Vault Hunters in the game were given names and we learned more about them. Vex is a powerful Siren with a ghost-tiger that she can pet and use in combat. Rafa is a former Tediore soldier who uses advanced tech during fights. </li><li><em>Borderlands 4 </em>is set on Kairos, a new planet that was previously controlled and hidden by a mysterious alien being known as the Timekeeper. Some years before the game started, however, a rogue moon crashed into the planet and caused a ton of chaos. (OG character Lilith might have been involved in that...) </li><li>The looter shooter will support crossplay at launch. It will also let you play two-player split screen c0-op. While playing with others you’ll be able to set your own difficulty and all loot will be instanced, so no gun stealing between friends. </li><li>Kairos will feature four massive zones that players can explore freely with  no loading screens. In the mission we saw during the demo, the new hunters were infiltrating a secret blacksite research facility alongside <em>Borderlands 3</em> character Armata. </li><li>You can now glide across large gaps and use your zipline on certain points in exploration or during combat. Gearbox confirmed that sliding, double jumping and dashing are back, too. </li><li>Players will have access to a “Digirunner,” a vehicle which looks a lot like a Sparrow from <em>Destiny</em>. These are single-seat hovercraft that you can spawn into at any point while out in the world. </li><li>While exploring Kairos you’ll discover silos. These are locations that aren’t tied to side quests, but function more like the kinds of activities you might seen in a big open-world game like <em>Assassin’s Creed. </em></li><li>Most of the weapon manufactures from past games, like Tediore and Jakobs, are back. But this time around guns can spawn with “Licensed Parts.” So a Jakobs rifle might have a different brand of scope or barrel, which might change how it fires or the kind of damage it does. This will make the already wildly unique loot you find in <em>Borderlands</em> games even more varied. </li><li>Speaking of loot, Gearbox has reworked how often rare loot drops and promises that Legendaries will be rarer and more powerful than in <em>Borderlands 3</em>. You’ll also be able to unlock enhancements that can make certain weapon brands more powerful. </li><li><em>Borderlands 4 </em>will feature repayable missions and boss fights, which should make it easier than ever to grind for specific loot.</li></ul><p>So yeah, we learned a lot of about <em>Borderlands 4</em>! And I’m excited to see more of the game between now and its (earlier than planned) launch of September 12. <em>Borderlands 4</em> is set to arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Switch 2.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a> State of Play dove deep into the new gameplay elements of Gearbox Software's next looter-shooter, with loads of information on loot, new types of enhancements, and two of the four playable Vault Hunters, Vex and Rafa. The trailer also highlighted the world of Kairos--a brand-new planet to the Borderlands universe--and how exploring it will focus less on being given quests, and more on finding them yourself.</p><p dir="ltr">Kairos, according to the video, is a secret world, hidden away for thousands of years by The Timekeeper, Borderlands 4's main villain. Its location was discovered thanks to the events of Borderlands 3, as the moon Lilith teleported away from Pandora broke the veil hiding Kairos and exposed it to the rest of the universe.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4485562-bl4-digirunner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485562" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4485562-bl4-digirunner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485562"></a><figcaption>The Digirunner in Borderlands 4</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4485562-bl4-digirunner.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The State Of Play showed one of the game's missions, set in a snowy mountain area called Terminus Range. New movement abilities were highlighted--including gliding, dashing, double-jumping, and point grappling, and a new vehicle called a Digirunner--as well as a dynamic weather system.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo then introduces a silo, which according to the video is "one of several new activities found throughout Borderlands 4." These activities will appear "naturally" as players explore the world of Kairos, without the need of being assigned the mission first--once you find one of these random events, it'll be added to your map and tracked on the HUD.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KlRBwf3sjY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0KlRBwf3sjY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The latest in Gearbox Software's popular looter-shooter series, Borderlands 4 was first announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024 last August. The first gameplay trailer then aired at The Game Awards 2024, where it was confirmed to launch in September of this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 will launch September 12 on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. It was originally set to launch on September 23, but 2K and Gearbox moved the date up earlier this week--and they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-insists-gta-6-is-not-reason-the-games-release-date-changed/1100-6531221/">swear it was not because of Grand Theft Auto VI</a>.</p>

                <p>Amazon's <a href="https://amzn.to/4jtAJL3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gaming Week</a> runs through May 4, giving you a chance to pick up headsets, controllers, and video games at some of the lowest prices of the year. Several popular Capcom games are discounted in the event, including titles for PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, so if you’re seeking an affordable game to keep you busy as summer approaches, it’s a great time to shop.</p><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2 was one of our favorite games of 2024, and now you’ll find it for just $28 (was $36) on both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragons-Dogma-2-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CP349RP1?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragons-Dogma-2-XBX-Xbox-X/dp/B0CP34Z3DC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>, which <strong>is the lowest price we’ve ever seen for Dragon’s Dogma 2</strong>. Like its predecessor that launched back in 2012, the open-world action RPG leans into the hands-off game design sensibilities of old school RPGs, which results in a true sense of exploration and tension. It also features stellar combat, which isn't surprising given Capcom's action game pedigree. It's worth checking out as a fun (and affordable) alternative to the newly released Oblivion Remastered.</p><p>A notable deal for Switch players is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-Stories-Collection-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0CXW2C84K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Stories Collection</a>, which is available for just $28 (was $33.55).. This bundle includes the HD remaster of original Monster Hunter Stories and its sequel, Wings of Ruin, both of which off a unique take on the Monster Hunter universe. Unlike the mainline series' online multiplayer action RPG approach, the Monster Hunter Stories spin-offs are monster-taming RPGs where you track down and attempt to catch a variety of creatures, then team up with them in strategic turn-based battles.</p><p>Other great Capcom games discounted in Aamazon's sale include Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvel-vs-Capcom-Fighting-Collection-4/dp/B0D7NSB8XV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvel-vs-Capcom-Fighting-Collection-4/dp/B0D7NSB8XV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4</a>) for $27 (was $50),  Dead Rising: Deluxe Remaster (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Rising-Deluxe-Remaster-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D8M64LF3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Rising-Deluxe-Remaster-Xbox-X/dp/B0D8LVVVLC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox</a>) for $27 (was $50), and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-4-PS4-Xbox-X/dp/B0BJV1V458?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 4 (PS4)</a> for $20 ($30).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-revenue-continues-to-tumble-but-gaming-revenue-is-up-microsoft-reports<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Microsoft has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast">shared its financial earnings</a> for the third quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, and there's good news for Xbox - with gaming revenue up, despite hardware revenue continuing to fall.
</p>
<p> 
As a whole, Microsoft made $70.1bn in revenue during Q3 and saw a net income of $25.8bn, marking a 13 and 18 percent year-over-year increase respectively. That growth was predominantly driven by its Cloud and Office services, but its gaming division saw success too.
</p>
<p>
Overall, Xbox gaming revenue was up five percent year-over-year, and within that, Xbox content and services - which includes Microsoft's first-party game releases and Game Pass - saw an eight percent increase. While the quarter saw <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> launch for Xbox and PC, the company primarily attributed its Q3 gaming growth to Call of Duty and Minecraft. Additionally, Game Pass subscriptions are up - but it's unclear by how much, given membership figures haven't been revised since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-game-pass-now-has-34m-fully-paid-subscribers">Microsoft revealed they'd crossed 34m</a> last February.
</p>
<p>
These successes were offset, however, by a continuing decline in Xbox hardware numbers over Q3, with console sales falling by six percent year-on-year. Xbox's hardware slump has coincided with Microsoft's continuing efforts to pursue a platform agnostic approach for its releases, with its various cloud gaming partnerships meaning Game Pass titles can be streamed on everything from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-heading-to-meta-quest-vr-headsets">Meta Quest headsets</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-now-stream-xbox-games-direct-to-your-lg-tv-no-console-required">TVs</a>. Even so, Microsoft has repeatedly indicated it has no intention of backing out of the console market; not only has it discussed various Xbox handheld plans, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-says-next-xbox-will-deliver-largest-technical-leap-seen-in-a-hardware-generation">confirmed work on an Xbox Series X/S is well underway</a>.
</p>
<p>
Xbox president Sarah Bon previously said this new console would focus on "delivering the largest technical leap that you will have ever seen in a hardware generation", and recent reports have claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">Microsoft is currently aiming for a 2027 release</a>.

		<p>Gearbox has shared a first real look at Borderlands 4 gameplay with a dedicated State of Play stream hosted by Sony. Borderlands 4 is set to launch on 12th September 2025 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and PC, with the release date having been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/borderlands-4-gameplay-state-of-play-is-airing-tomorrow-30th-april-release-date-moved-forward/">brought forward by two week</a>.</p>
<p>Check out the gameplay deep dive, played on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - State of Play Deep Dive | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KlRBwf3sjY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hosted by Creative Director Graeme Timms and Senior Project Producer Anthony Nicholson, the gameplay deep dive saw the duo walk us through some of the missions we’ll see as you rampage across Kairos, the new weapons that can be generated, new and returning characters and Action Skills.</p>
<h2>Borderlands 4 Setting and Story</h2>
<p>Borderlands 4 takes us to the planet Kairos, a world that’s dominated by a ruthless dictator known as the Timekeeper, with an army of synthetic followers known as the Order. You, of course, will play as a Vault Hunter searching for mythical alien treasures in a race against time against the Timekeeper to uncover it.</p>

<p>Set after the rogue moon is teleported away from Pandora at the end of Borderlands 3 and into the orbit of Kairos, the planet has suffered devastating effects that have thrown the enforced order of the Timekeeper into disarray. The ordinary populace that had been happily controlled by their rulers.</p>
<h2>Campaign &amp; Co-op</h2>
<p>Borderlands 4 has a new lobby system that allows for full cross-play between platforms.</p>
<p>Local split-screen is returning.</p>
<p>And you can set independent difficulty levels for each player.</p>
<p>Obviously you’ll want to play through the main story, but Borderlands 4 has full mission and boss replay, so you can revisit parts of the game and don’t need to use saves to fight bosses a second time.</p>
<h2>World Activities</h2>
<p>The demo took us to the frigid zone of Terminus Range, one of four zones that are featured in the game as large open worlds to explore. Dynamic weather effects and dynamic events can take place to give you fresh activities.</p>
<p>The main mission here was to break into a secret blacksite in the mountains on the hunt for Lillith, but along the way a silo that needed to be hacked to unlock the tech within and boost the rebellion (and provide zipline points to shoot you up into the sky with he balloon that emerges).</p>
<p>Finding Vault Key Fragments can eventually unlock access to a high level dungeon with challenging combat and the top tier loot rewards.</p>
<h2>New Vault Hunters</h2>
<p>Two new Vault Hunters were revealed: Vex, the new Siren in the game who uses supernatural Phase energy to either empower herself or summon purple spectral creatures to fight alongside, and Rafa, a former TDR soldier with an experimental exo suit, who can unleach arc knives around them in a swirl pain.</p>
<p>Each Vault Hunter has three Action Skills to choose between, giving a unique unlock tree that can be further tweaked using Cap Stones. These can be amended on the fly or fully respec’d back at town.</p>
<p>Each character also has a passive Trait. For Vex, her summons can attune to the elemental damage of the weapon in her hand, so you can have a fire cat running around alongside you.</p>
<h2>Weapons</h2>
<p>All weapons and gear comes from one of eight manufacturers, with Jakobs, Maliwan, Vladog, Tediore and Togue returning alongside the new Order (charge and release), Ripper (full blast), and Daedalus (multiple ammo types) manufacturers.</p>
<p>In a great new twist, weapons can be customised with Licensed Parts from different manufacturers to lend properties of one to another and give you more control over how they work.</p>
<p>Enhancements replace Artefacts from previous games, providing specific boosts to weapons that include parts from a certain manufacturer.</p>
<p>A separate gear slot is reserved for Ordinance, your heaviest weapons like launchers and machine guns. These are not ammo-limited but instead are available on a cooldown to make them constantly useful.</p>
<h2>Looting</h2>
<p>Gearbox has heard the complaints over Borderlands 3’s looting, and looked to completely rebalance the system. In particular, Legendary weapons in Borderlands 3 were too common, while other good to great weapons were too difficult to find. So loot found in crates should generally be more rewarding now, while Legendary weapons are less frequent and should feel much more special.</p>
<p>Loot will be instanced for each player, so no worries about rushing to snap up the best stuff.</p>
<h2>Movement and Combat</h2>
<p>There’s a bunch of new movement abilities that work both while exploring the world and when in combat. Glide, double jump, dash, grapple, they give a lot of freedom.</p>
<p>These really came to the fore in a huge boss battle that forced the pair to keep jumping around and moving to dodge purple blasts of energy.</p>
<p>You also always have access to a personal Digi Runner hover vehicle that can be customised with fresh paint jobs, and also gives you another offensive option with its guns.</p>
<p>You can also fast travel to friends if you get separated.</p>
<hr>
<p>That’s everything we spotted in the quick-moving gameplay deep dive, and Borderlands 4 is looking pretty good if you ask us! Stay tuned for more, with a tease of a first hands on in June, leading up to release in September.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-roll20-demiplane-integration-feature-is-now-in-beta<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roll20 has rolled out an official Demiplane integration beta. This merging of two of the most popular virtual tabletop platforms has been highly anticipated since <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Roll20 acquired Demiplane</a> in 2024. Now, users can enjoy the benefits.</p>

<h2>The Roll20 Demiplane Integration Beta Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the Roll20 Demiplane integration beta is the result of months of active development and community feedback. The result are expanded key features integrated into both platforms as of today.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roll20-demiplane-integration-beta-character-sheet-image.jpg?itok=T7pjF97W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roll20-demiplane-integration-beta-character-sheet-image.jpg?itok=dKLZ8Hk- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One of the new features in this beta is cross-platform sync. If you own any titles on Roll20 or Demiplane, you can access that content on both platforms at no additional cost. This feature is added automatically if you have an account linked with Roll20 and Demiplane.</p>

<p>The cross-platform sync applies to all material from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder 2E</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/starfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Starfinder 2E</em></a>, <em>Vampire: The Masquerade V5</em>, <em>Alien: The Roleplaying Game</em>, and <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG</em>. In addition, select elements from <em>Cyberpunk Red</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/fallout-rpg-starter-set-preview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout: The Roleplaying Game</em></a> will support this feature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’re continuing to work closely with our incredible publishing partners to expand system support for Cross-Platform Sync,” said Jayme Boucher, Senior Marketing Manager at Roll20. “In today’s economy, we know that investing in your hobbies can feel like a luxury. That’s why we’re committed to giving players the most access and value possible for their hard-earned money. This is one way we can help stretch every dollar and make it easier for people to connect and support their mental well-being through play.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A second feature of the Roll20 Demiplane integration beta is a shared subscription. If you have an account linked to Roll20 and Demiplane and pay a premium subscription for one, you get the premium benefits of both platforms at no additional cost. This includes content sharing with up to 24 players and unlimited character creation on the Demiplane platform.</p>

<p>Lastly, users can use Demiplane character sheets in the Roll20 VTT. All player actions work as before within one interface. The Demiplane character sheets can be used on the following games in Roll20:</p>

<ul><li><em>Pathfinder 2E</em></li>
	<li><em>Starfinder 2E</em></li>
	<li><em>Marvel Multiverse Roleplaying Game</em></li>
	<li><em>Cyberpunk Red</em></li>
	<li><em>Vampire: The Masquerade V5</em></li>
	<li><em>Alien: The Roleplaying Game</em></li>
	<li><em>Candela Obscura</em></li>
</ul><p>The press release states that more TTRPGs will be gaining support between Demiplane and Roll20 in the near future. Titles that include Darrington Press' upcoming fantasy RPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-darrington-press-hotly-anticipated-ttrpg-is-now-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerfall</em></a>, and Brotherwise Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cosmere RPG</em></a>.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft today revealed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/">year one update roadmap</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> weather-appreciate-em-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. It includes a steady drip feed of new quest and story updates, some fan requested features like NG+, and a few additional quality of life bits. However! None of this matters. Shoo, less important details. The real headline here is that the series built around making jumping between rooftops feel good is making jumping between rooftops feel even better. Excellent news.</p>

<p>I'll admit that this is probably a very personal thing, but I'm often left confused watching Ubisoft pour energy into dozens of supplementary features over the years, while seemingly neglecting what I see as Assassin's Creed's core fantasy. The parkour traversal that felt so key to the series' identity in the early years has gradually turned into a frictionless, ho-hum means of traversal, absent all the thrills and creativity it has the potential to offer. Make climbing on things fun, and everything else falls into place, say I.</p>
<p>The first update is coming in May, where Ubi say they'll be adding "often-requested height-gaining back-ejects, fully re-animated height-gaining side-ejects, and a brand-new parkour move called the Vertical Ledge Jump, allowing both characters to jump and grab onto awnings and lower overhangs – a move that is particularly handy when wall-runs are not an option". They'll also be adding "more little parkour tricks" and tweak over the year.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other bits on the roadmap, too, including a higher difficulty setting and other regular community feedback updates. It's nice to listen to fans, even if I can't help picturing <a href="https://youtu.be/yGsHq-mZI8U">The Simpsons' Itchy and Scratchy focus group</a> whenever a developer goes to these sort of community-appeasing lengths.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Vex the Siren is a powerful Siren who can empower herself or manifest deadly shades to fight alongside her, while Rafa the Exo-Soldier shines as a former Tediore trooper who wears an experimental exo-suit capable of digistructing an arsenal of weapons.

The friends discovered along the way will be recruited by players to their cause while enemies will experience first-hand the arsenal of weapons and abilities wielded by the Vault Hunters.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_962401"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>As seen in the explosive footage shared during PlayStation’s State of Play, Vex and Rafa tear a path through a secret blacksite in Terminus Range, a frigid, mountainous region.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> is a great remaster in terms of it being a very-well done boost in graphical fidelity from the original, but it's also great because it was more than just the original game with a graphics boost.</p>
<p>It also included a new expansion called In the Beginning, with 18 new puzzles to solve, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">16 of which</a> were actually made in collaboration with members of the Talos Principle's community.</p>
<p>So it's no wonder that they are some of the most difficult puzzles in the whole series. They're not impossible, mind you, they're just very difficult. The thing is that there's always a trick to them, and if you want a hint for Subway Escape before getting the whole solution, the hint here is that creating redundancies will take you far.</p>
<p>That's your hint, but if you just want to know the steps to solve the puzzle, keep reading.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Subway Escape Puzzle Guide</h2>
<p>When you walk into the Subway Escape puzzle area, it's immediately a bit confusing. There's a subway cart in the center of the room behind a fence and two shields on one side. You also can't head forward across the tracks, due to the walls being lined with turrets. Solving Subway Escape, thankfully, has nothing to do with these elements. Everything about the puzzle begins when you walk through the purple forcefield on the left side of the room and pick up the jammer.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the jammer and head around the corner towards the shield blocking the path to an elevator. Use the jammer on the shield.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Turn around and grab the connector you walked by on your way to the elevator, and take the elevator down with the connector in hand.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When you get to the bottom floor, you'll see another jammer (J2) keeping a shield in front of you deactivated. Walk into the room and grab J2 to deactivate the shield on the right-hand side of the room. Then, use the connector to connect the red laser generator to the red node, creating a redundancy with J2, and the red laser, keeping the shield deactivated.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up J2 and walk it to the other side of the shield so you can keep the shield deactivated while grabbing the connector and bringing it to the corner of the room.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use J2 to deactivate the shield blocking your path to the fan, pressure switch, and hexahedron behind the shield on your right.&nbsp;Place the hexahedron on the pressure switch, pick up the connector, and jump on the fan to fly up to the second level.&nbsp;Head down the stairs and walk towards the middle of the room so that you can place the connector in a spot where you can connect it to the blue node and blue laser generator on the bottom level. This has now created a redundancy with the shield J2 is deactivating and the blue laser.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the bottom level and grab J2. Fly back up to the second level with J2 in hand, and place it next to the connector.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the connector and jump back down to the bottom floor so that you can leave the connector on the pressure switch that activates the fan, and carry the hexahedron up with you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>You'll have noticed that so far, we've been ignoring the second hexahedron sitting on the purple forcefield, and that's because we haven't needed it yet. Grab it, and the other hexahedron and place them both beside J2.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>This next part is simple, but a little tedious. You simply have to use the hexahedrons to 'walk' across the purple forcefield. If you fall off the hexahedrons, you'll have to reset, so don't fall off. Step by step, while staying on top of the hexahedrons, make your way across the purple forcefield to the other side with J2 in hand.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedrons on the two pressure switches to deactivate the shield in front of you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>With J2 in hand, walk through the deactivated shield to jump back down to the bottom floor, and take the elevator back up to the top floor.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Now, take both J2 and J1 back to the purple forcefield you walked through to get into this area, and use them to deactivate the two layers of shields blocking the way to the subway cart and the tetromino.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Walk over to the tetromino inside the cart to solve the puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you'll be able to take the subway cart through the hall of turrets and to the next puzzle, which is arguably the most difficult puzzle included in The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>
