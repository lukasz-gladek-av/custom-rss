		<p>During Nintendo’s Kirby Air Riders Direct, Nintendo confirmed that the game will available from November 20th on Switch 2. Kirby Air Riders is a racing game sequel to Kirby Air Ride which launched in 2003 for the Gamecube, with Masahiro Sakurai taking on the director duties of the game. If you want an in depth look at the game, you can watch the full Kirby Air Riders direct below.</p>

<p>Kirby Air Riders will feature a roster of 16 playable characters, including Kirby, Meta Knight, King Dedede, Bandana Waddle Dee, Cappy, Chef Kawasaki, and Starman. After choosing your character you can also choose different Air Machines, with each having various stats that affect speed and durability, meaning some will be better to use when facing off against opponents. Each character also has a unique special ability that can give an advantage during races, apart from Kirby who has four abilities depending on which colour Kirby you play as. While the abilities are unique, all characters have the Copy Ability which allows characters to steal and use each other’s abilities.</p>
<p>Skyah is the main area players will be able to travel across freely starting off with a rather weak Air Machine. In Skyah, players will be able to attack opponents and take part in different events all over the map including races and battles. If you don’t fancy spending all your time in Skyah you can head to the Stadiums and take part in different challenges, with some challenges being recommended based on your machine stats. Air Ride Mode is a race mode that has six racers compete against each other to cross the finish line first. There is also a Lessons mode which is essentially a tutorial mode where players can try out different machines and characters.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco has finally confirmed the next Tales series remaster, and — shocker! — it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_xillia_remastered">Tales of Xillia Remastered</a>, and it's coming to Switch 1.</p>
<p>So, we all saw this coming after last week's leak, but here's the surprising bits of news — it's coming out on 31st October 2025, <em>and</em> only Xillia 1 is included, not Xillia 2. Well, the latter was sort of expected, but we hoped the sequel would be bundled too.</p>
<p>Like with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_graces_f_remastered">Graces f Remastered</a> earlier in the year, the Switch version of the remaster will also run at 30fps (confirmed on <a href="https://coexist.tales-ch.jp/">the Japanese website</a>) and will be 1080p docked, 720p handheld, making it a bit of a downgrade compared to other releases.</p>
<p>But there are a ton of other features that may make picking this remaster a sweeter deal. Detailed on <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/tales-of/tales-of-xillia-remastered">the official website</a> (under the What's New section), Tales of Xillia Remastered will include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded visuals</li>
<li>Access to the Grade Shop immediately, plus a new item in the shop — "50% off items"</li>
<li>Over 40 original DLC available from the start</li>
<li>Autosave</li>
<li>A new Enemy Encounter toggle, meaning you can entirely avoid combat (except for certain Events)</li>
<li>A Retry feature for regular fights</li>
<li>Subtitles in combat, which you can customise to your liking</li>
<li>A toggle for dashing</li>
<li>Map icons for story destinations, sub-events, and unacquired items and treasure chests</li>
<li>Toggle to automatically skip events</li>
<li>New Artes and items will now be marked</li>
<li>Item descriptions added to the Jet Black Feather Trading Post</li>
<li>Pressing the appropriate button in Option or in the Store will take you to the top of that screen/option from any level</li>
<li>Batch selection available for store development</li>
<li>Can open chests and items even if not facing them - as long as you're next to them, you can open them</li>
<li>You can switch between camera distances on the map to near, normal, or far</li>
<li>Key binding is available on the map and in battle</li>
<li>Additional volume settings, allowing you to adjust the volume of any individual sound aspect</li>
<li>The ability to swap between English and Japanese voices</li>
<li>Typos and errors corrected (in the Japanese version)</li>
<li>Some expressions have been tweaked.</li>
</ul>

<p>So... quite a lot has been tweaked, then! Plus, the biggie is that the game is no longer stuck on PS3. So that's good!</p>
<p>A Digital Deluxe Edition will include the digital soundtrack, artbook, a Battle BGM Pack and Super Growth Support Herb Set. Pre-ordering early will also get you a handful of in-game items to aid you in your journey, which includes Life Bottles and healing Gels.</p>
<p>Along with the announcement trailer up top, there's also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1nfS6iEx2E&amp;ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica">short video from the Tales series producer, Yusuke Tomizawa</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-announced-for-october.1274034/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-battlefield-2042-update-battlefield-6-beta-end/">Battlefield 6</a> has had its open beta, and now it's Call of Duty's turn, as the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-cross-gen-bundle/9plbm5790l94">official store page on Xbox website</a> confirms that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will have an open beta that will be live for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers on October 2, 2025, and for everyone else on October 5. The description doesn't say how long the beta will last, or if there will be a second weekend, but further down in the description it does say that "<em>Open Beta duration is 2 days</em>" at a minimum.</p>



<p>That said, we'll likely have much more information on the beta and on Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 in general after Gamescom ONL 2025 today, which is kicking off in just a little more than an hour at the time of this writing. The game's full reveal is <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-gamescom/">set to kick off the showcase</a> today, and it's a good bet that we'll hear more specifics about the open beta, and get a confirmation of the game's release date that seems to have <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-november-14-no-switch-2/">already leaked just last week</a>. </p>



<p>Though the store page does potentially confirm the release date, since it says that the Reznov Challenge Pack that can be unlocked in Black Ops 6 "<em>Must be redeemed by November 14, 2025</em>."</p>







<p>What's interesting about these open beta dates, and the leaked release date, is that it means Black Ops 7 will be having its beta right around the time Battlefield 6 is launching, and if the leaked release date is correct, Battlefield 6 will have had a full month to build an audience and potential lead on Call of Duty before its even out on store shelves.</p>



<p>There's been a lot of talk about what the bout between both shooters will look like this year, with some thinking that <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">EA has the chance to take a win over Activision</a>, though others are less convinced, even while admitting that <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-potential-to-do-best-battlefield-has-ever-done-600k-steam-pre-orders/">Battlefield 6 is looking like it'll be a tentpole entry for the series</a>.</p>



<p>Call of Duty has the strength of its annual releases and years of community built behind it, so it's definitely unlikely that Battlefield 6 will be able to go toe-to-toe with it Black Ops 7 on the sales charts. But it can certainly try, and for shooter fans, it's exciting to see both series back in fighting shape after years of Call of Duty dominance. </p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-1-reloaded-remaster-ps5-xbox-pc-summer-1851779167"><em>Gears of War</em> is making the leap to PlayStation 5 later this month</a> in what is one of the biggest signs that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">console wars are over</a>. And while I find the idea of playing <em>Gears</em> on a PlayStation controller strange, franchise creator Cliff “CliffyB” Bleszinski is “thrilled” that something he worked so hard on will soon be available to more players.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-creator-cliff-bleszinski-thrilled-about-seeing-his-once-xbox-exclusive-on-playstation">In a new interview with <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, Bleszinski was asked about the upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-cross-save-progression-ps5-xbox-2000618072"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>, which is a remaster of the original game’s <em>last</em> remaster. This new version with enhanced visuals and improved performance is launching on both Xbox and, for the first time in franchise history, PlayStation via a PS5 port. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-ps5-remake-remaster-halo-forza-port-1851779186">But while some fans find it all a bit bizarre</a> to chainsaw monsters with the DualSense’s circle button instead of the Xbox gamepad’s B, the original <em>Gears</em> trilogy’s director doesn’t feel the same.</p> <p>“It doesn’t feel strange,” Bleszinski explained to <em>Eurogamer</em> when asked if he finds the PS5 port weird. “I’m thrilled that more people are going to get to experience a big part of my legacy that I worked so hard on.”</p>

And since then, even after Microsoft bought the franchise in 2014 and started making its own third-person cover shooters, fans have continued to ask Bleszinski if he’d ever return to help make another<em> Gears of War</em> game. According to him, he’s asked “nearly every day on social media” about returning.</p> <p>“And I’m like ‘uh, I’ve said it a thousand times, I’m open to consult on any of it’,” said Bleszinski. But it seems Xbox isn’t interested in bringing him back to consult on a future game in the series, with the <em>Gears</em> creator adding, “Crickets. On to the next!” There is some irony in Xbox ignoring Cliff Bleszinski in 2025, despite <a href="https://youtu.be/AXO1mpgc-is">making “CliffyB” the rockstar face of the Xbox 360 </a>at the height of the console war between Microsoft’s device and the PS3 back in 2005, and positioning Epic’s then-upcoming game, <em>Gears of War,</em> as the 360’s killer app. Now they won’t even call him to get his input on the franchise.</p> <p><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> launches on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on August 26. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gears-of-war-reloaded-game-pass-2000618432">It will be available on day one with Game Pass</a> and will be free to anyone who already owns <em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em>, aka Xbox’s previous remaster of the game.</p>

<p><strong>“Take on high-stakes challenges across a wide spectrum of environments, from the neon-lit rooftops of Japan to the Mediterranean coast, and even into the deepest corners of the human psyche</strong>,” the game’s description reads.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is scheduled to launch on November 14. If you can’t wait that long, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a multiplayer beta will take plac</a>e starting October 2.</p>

Fergusson recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-boss-departs-blizzard-after-five-years/1100-6533809/" data-ref-id="1100-6533809">announced his departure from Blizzard</a> after spending five years with the company.</p><p>2K Games subsequently shared an internal memo with GameSpot from president David Ismailer, which stressed that the BioShock franchise is important to the company. "While we're excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we've made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game," said Ismailer.</p><p>Ismailer characterized the Cloud Chamber layoffs as an opportunity for the remaining developers "to focus on this work and give the game more time in development." He also confirmed Fergusson's new role in the company and touted his track record in the industry.</p><p>"As Head of the BioShock Franchise, Rod will lead Cloud Chamber and oversee the development of the next BioShock game, as well as franchise extensions including our film partnership with Netflix. We will share more about Rod’s onboarding and how these changes will take shape in the coming days and weeks. Rod and I worked together 10+ years ago and I am grateful he has chosen to return to lead our BioShock efforts."</p><p>Fergusson also shared a statement on social media about his return to 2K Games.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/RodFergusson/status/1957824815018213692" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Would you kindly allow me to share some news?<br>Some of you guessed it, I’m returning to 2K to lead a series that means a lot to me as the new Head of the BioShock Franchise.

                <p>As it currently stands, playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> on PC can be a subpar experience. It's had plenty of issues since launch, and while it's better now for some, it still suffers from numerous performance problems. However, Capcom is continuously working on solving the game's issues on PC, and in a <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1957473035885121806" rel="nofollow ">post shared to the official Monster Hunter X account</a>, it explained the steps it intends to take, but it sounds like significant fixes may not arrive until this winter.</p><p dir="ltr">"To our hunters playing [Monster Hunter Wilds] on PC, we're committed to listening to your feedback and improving both performance and stability of the game," reads the post. "Although we will continue to implement gradual improvements in the weeks ahead, we are targeting Free Title Update Four this winter to implement a multifaceted plan, including CPU and GPU related optimizations, followed by a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards." The post ended by saying that specific details will be coming in the future.</p>

I'll be joined in the commentary box by Tom Orry and we'll be watching the broadcast and bringing you a blow-by-blow account of it, right here. We also have a number of our team there at the show, so maybe they'll cause some mischief in the auditorium as we watch.</p>
<p>The important stuff: the Opening Night Live pre-show begins at 6.30pm UK time, and the main show at 7pm (8pm CEST / 2pm EDT / 11 am PDT). You don't need to do anything but keep this page open and watch and comment, and the coverage will roll in.</p>
<p>So what do we hope to see? We can expect a better look at the next Resi game, Resident Evil: Requiem, as well as some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, the new World of Warcraft expansion Midnight, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7, and The Outer Worlds 2. Oh and some Hollow Knight: Silksong, if you can believe it, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-announcement-today-as-special-announcement-is-scheduled-for-thursday">a bigger announcement was announced - that's confusing - for this Thursday</a>. Still: Silksong! What's next - a Bloodborne remake? Half-Life 3?</p>
<p>Not long to go now so let's buckle up and get prepared. Snacks ahoy, let's do this.</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has officially announced Tales of Xillia Remastered, which is not too much of a surprise as a remaster was leaked a little while ago. This release is only Tales of Xillia Remastered, and there is no mention of a remaster for the follow up Tales of Xillia 2. Tales of Xillia Remastered will be released on October 31st for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch. You can check out the announcement trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tales of Xillia Remastered - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/feXG0jHLpU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tales of Xillia Remastered will have enhanced visuals and quality of life improvements including the option to turn off encounters, auto save, destination markers, early access to the Grade Shop, and all the original DLC including character costumes and bonus items. Tales of Xillia was the first Tales of game that allowed players to pick one of two protagonists to play as and experience the story from different viewpoints. That also meant that to really get the full picture playing through as both Jude and Milla was pretty much necessary.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/08/06/tales-of-xillia-review-ps3/">Tales Of Xillia Review</a></h2>
<p>In the original Tales of Xillia review from 12 years ago, I wrote, <em>“Tales Of Xillia is a brilliant title, and could just be the breakout game that really establishes the series in Western markets. There’s a great story here, with likable characters and voice acting that makes the characters feel real. The streamlined leveling, equipment choices and skill tree make Xillia one of the best RPGs I’ve played. In fact Tales Of Xillia may just be what the JRPG genre needed.”</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioshock-4-developer-cloud-chamber-will-reportedly-suffer-layoffs-diablo%E2%80%99s-rod-fergusson-taking-over-as-studio-head.1273983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, Cloud Chamber, the studio that's working on the next game in the BioShock series that we currently know as BioShock 4, is laying off some of its staff, and former general manager of the Diablo franchise, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-has-10-year-plan-for-diablo-iv/">Rod Fergusson</a>, will be taking over as Cloud Chamber's studio head.</p>



<p>Schreier shared the news in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr7jxitg22z">quick post on Bluesky</a>, and also pointed out that Fergusson is seemingly finding himself in a similar position compared to the last time he worked on the BioShock series, since he was brought in at the eleventh hour to help cobble together BioShock Infinite when it was facing development struggles.</p>



<p>This report also follows Schreier's reporting from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-reportedly-development-hell-failed-review-narrative-overhaul/">beginning of August</a>, when he shared that the game was in development turmoil and had undergone major leadership changes after it failed a milestone check-in with Take-Two.</p>







<p>Fergusson is taking over for Kelley Gilmore, who was removed from her role as studio head and pushed into a position on the publishing side of things earlier this month. It's unclear how much of the team Cloud Chamber is losing, but all these changes, save for Fergusson coming in, don't exactly spell good things to come for BioShock 4's development.</p>



<p>At least Fergusson has the chance to be a bright light for Cloud Chamber. He has a reputation for being able to save projects stuck in development hell, after famously doing it for BioShock Infinite, Gears of War, and Diablo IV. </p>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/RodFergusson/status/1957824815018213692">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Fergusson shared the news that he'd be returning to the series as the new head of BioShock at 2K, saying that it's a meaningful moment for him because BioShock is a series that "<em>means a lot</em>" to him, but understands that he's coming in at a difficult time.</p>



<p>"<em>While I’m excited to get started in the coming weeks, I recognize the studio restructuring is a difficult time for the team. I’m deeply grateful for the work done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love,</em>" Fergusson wrote.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Would you kindly allow me to share some news?</p><p>Some of you guessed it, I’m returning to 2K to lead a series that means a lot to me as the new Head of the BioShock Franchise. I’ll be heading up Cloud Chamber and overseeing development of the next BioShock game, along with…</p></div>— Rod Fergusson (@RodFergusson) <a href="https://twitter.com/RodFergusson/status/1957824815018213692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>BioShock 4 has been in the works in one way or another <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-in-development-since-2015/">since approximately 2015</a>, and with no near end in sight for what's clearly been a marred development period, there's now a bit of hope for the game's future. Right now, it seems like if anyone can fix the issues it is having, Rod Fergusson is the one to do it.</p>



<p>Let's hope he can keep earning his reputation as a 'closer' to troubled projects, with the help of the rest of the remaining team at Cloud Chamber.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/757680/sony-inzone-pc-gaming-headset-keyboard-mouse-hands-on</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-just-launched-five-new-pc-gaming-peripherals-so-i-tried-them-all-at-once.1273980/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony is finally ready to take on the likes of SteelSeries, Razer, and Logitech with its InZone brand of PC gaming accessories. While InZone started with monitors and headsets in 2022, with a few new products since then (including its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911238/sony-inzone-buds-gaming-earbuds-h5-price">great InZone Buds</a> and the sleek but pricey <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253167/sony-inzone-gaming-monitor-m10s-480hz-oled">M10S OLED</a>), Sony is making a concerted effort to take over your desk. It just launched two new headsets, a gaming keyboard, a wireless mouse, and even a couple of mousepads, all developed alongside esports organization <a href="https://fnatic.com/">Fnatic</a>, and all available for preorder today.</p><p>As you might expect, Sony’s not aiming for the bargain bin here. Each of these peripherals is made for competitive play, and they come with high prices that don’t always feel justified.</p><p>To test them all out at once, I swapped out each of my regular PC peripherals for the new InZone gadgets, which made me feel like I was on a Sony Pictures movie set with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/14/9321561/new-sony-ad-is-james-bond-product-placement-in-reverse">intense product placement</a>.</p><div><p id="sony-inzone-h9-ii"><h2>Sony InZone H9 II</h2></p></div><p>The InZone H9 II gaming headset is the successor to the <a href="https://youtu.be/VjTh03_ssHo?si=52u4_JuNStjdySvS&amp;t=260">bulkier H9</a> from 2022, with a refined finish, a handful of improvements, and a gen-to-gen price hike from $299.99 to $349.99. The headset is slimmer and lighter (273g versus 330g), and it features a clever “pinch-to-adjust” button on each side of its headband to let you easily find the right fit. The suspended headband design feels lightweight on my head, rivaling the most comfortable models I’ve used, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23132836/steelseries-nova-pro-wireless-review-gaming-bluetooth-anc">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless</a>.</p><p>The new model has the same 30mm speaker drivers as Sony’s latest WH-1000XM6 flagship headphones. Even though they’re 10mm smaller than those in the previous-gen model, they sound just as phenomenal for music as they do for games. You’re also getting fantastic active noise cancellation, with the option to turn on a transparency mode that, notably, doesn’t affect the audio quality. You can customize the H9 II’s more granular settings within the company’s InZone Hub on PC or via Bluetooth in Sony’s Sound Connect mobile app — the same one used for several of its consumer headphone models.</p><p>This headset has several features every wireless model should have. The ear cups are on swiveling hinges, giving you the option to let them rest on your chest between matches, or if you need to remove them to talk in person. You can now listen to audio via a 3.5mm cable, even when the headset is out of battery. Wired mode will override any wireless connections. If you’d prefer to go wireless, it can maintain simultaneous connections over Bluetooth and its compact 2.4GHz USB-C transmitter, which has a toggle for PC and “other” platforms.</p><p>The headset works just fine with the PS5 and Switch 2, letting me listen to podcasts from my phone as I play. This model adds Bluetooth LE Audio support, allowing them to last longer per charge with better sound — love that, especially since I’m likely to keep them paired to two devices. Another new feature for this generation is a feature that several other headsets have: a removable boom microphone, in case you’d rather use a desktop mic or if you’re heading outdoors.</p><div><p id="sony-inzone-e9"><h2>Sony InZone E9</h2></p></div><p>The $149.99 InZone E9 wired in-ear monitors are small and lightweight, with good noise isolation. They’re simple to use, either connecting via 3.5mm jack or its included 3.5mm-to-USB-C dongle, which is required to personalize the audio in the InZone Hub app. Unlike normal earbuds, these and all other in-ear monitors have hooks that route the cables on top of your ear cartilage and down the back of your ears, so as to stay out of your face. It all ships in a nice case that springs open when unzipped, exposing several ear tip size options.</p><p>The E9 in-ear monitors are tuned for FPS games out of the box. The default equalizer setting gives a flat, reference-style sound that pursues accuracy over bombast — the better to locate footsteps and gunshots in game. It’s effective, but outside of gaming, I found the E9s boring to listen to compared to the full-bodied, warm sound of the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Linsoul-Earphones-Faceplate-Detachable-Audiophile/dp/B07WTTJSCF?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Linsoul KZ ZSX</a> in-ear monitors that I bought on Amazon for about $60. That Linsoul model is the best-sounding set of headphones that I own — with detachable cables, no less — and I never expected to pay so little for something so good. Perhaps you’ll be as inspired as I was by our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20943377/chinese-hi-fi-audio-chifi-fiio-hifiman-tin-audio">2019 piece</a> on great Chinese hi-fi to find other options that are significantly cheaper, yet better-sounding than Sony’s new IEMs, at least for non-gaming needs.</p><p>Sony is one of the only major companies making gaming in-ear monitors, along with Razer, which makes the <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fstreaming-earphones%2Frazer-moray%2FRZ12-04450100-R3U1" rel="sponsored">Moray</a> (those have detachable cables and are $20 cheaper) but I hope it aims higher, and future models sound better than the cheaper competition.</p><div><p id="sony-inzone-keyboard"><h2>Sony InZone keyboard</h2></p></div><p>To type all of this, I’ve been using Sony’s InZone KBD-H75, a name so clunky that I’m just going to refer to it as the InZone keyboard. This wired milled-aluminum board took the place of my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KINESIS-Gaming-Freestyle-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07SXX7P6D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">split ergo gaming keyboard made by Kinesis Gaming</a>, which I use to manage wrist strain during and after work. So, this wasn’t a swap that I was exactly looking forward to for ergonomic reasons. However — forgetting my wrists for a moment — it feels nice to type on, once I got used to the 75 percent layout that omits several navigation keys I commonly use.</p><p>The KBD-H75 uses Hall effect magnetic switches that actuate faster and more accurately than mechanical switches. I’m accustomed to clicky Cherry MX Blue switches, and I found the InZone keyboard doesn’t have quite enough resistance for my taste. In fact, they’re so easy to press that I kept accidentally actuating keys in chat apps, making it look like I fell asleep at my desk. This can be rectified by customizing the actuation point of each key, between 0.1mm and 3.4mm. It’s a feature that’s common among its competitors. And thankfully, you won’t need to install the InZone Hub app to make adjustments; Sony took a page from other keyboard makers by building a web version of its app that can be accessed from any PC this keyboard is plugged into — perfect for tournaments or LAN tournaments.</p><p>Thanks to the milled-aluminum case and gasket-mounted switchplate, I couldn’t sense vibrations as I pounded out articles and messages. Tapping each key results in a quiet yet satisfying sound, and I know my partner wishes my split ergo was this quiet. But, again, I prefer switches that have a little bit more resistance. I’m sure if I were a professional gamer, I’d be happier with these.</p><p>Ask most people who are into keyboards and they’ll probably tell you a handful of alternatives with similar features to the InZone keyboard that cost less than the $299.99 Sony’s asking for. At this price, most gamers expect wireless support and hot-swappable switches. The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keychron.com%2Fproducts%2Flemokey-p1-he-wireless-magnetic-switch-custom-gaming-keyboard" rel="sponsored">$169.99 LemoKey P1 HE</a> has hot-swappable Hall effect switches, plus 1000Hz polling over 2.4GHz wireless. Unless Sony’s design and its promise of 8,000Hz polling rate are really doing it for you, there are many good options out there that cost less.</p><p>I’m dubious of this keyboard’s 8,000Hz polling rate, which is one of its selling points (as well as one of the mouse below). Instead of being limited to 1,000Hz, which means it can register your input once per millisecond, 8,000Hz increases the rate to register movement and clicks once every 0.125ms. Sony’s definitely not the first company to advertise 8,000Hz polling in a gaming peripheral, but its utility is just as questionable here as it is in other products. As it turns out, human reaction time is pretty slow, so, maybe you shouldn’t pay more for this feature.</p><p>I’ve been radicalized by <a href="https://youtu.be/MfgrnFzsuCs?si=GJRuWT6T7w0Y08zA&amp;t=145">Rocket Jump Ninja’s video</a> on YouTube, which demonstrates that 1,000Hz is more than enough speed for most people; in the video, it shows that even fast human reaction times are still over 150ms, or approximately 6.67Hz. So, unless you have superhuman reflexes, this feature just isn’t necessary. Plus, trawling through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MouseReview/comments/1fsyhws/how_much_impact_does_8k_polling_rate_really_have/">Reddit</a> shows that some gamers have had issues with an 8,000Hz polling rate affecting game performance.</p><div><p id="sony-inzone-mouse-a"><h2>Sony InZone Mouse-A</h2></p></div><p>Lastly, there’s the InZone Mouse-A — Sony’s first wireless gaming mouse. It costs $149.99, and at 48 grams, it’s the lightest mouse that I’ve ever used. This right-handed mouse is light on flourishes and excess buttons, with just a left and right click, two thumb buttons, the scroll wheel, and a profile-switching button on the bottom. As someone who typically uses the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Model-Ergonomic-Matte-Gaming/dp/B0B63Z6PYV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Glorious Model I</a>, I quickly warmed up to its soft, matte-textured arch, though I wish it had a thumb rest. It feels pretty similar to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23043644/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-gaming-mouse-price-release-date-specs">Logitech G Pro X Superlight</a> in terms of ergonomics. I have an average-sized hand, though small-handed gamers will also likely find this to be a comfortable pick. The click is swift and relatively quiet, and it has optical switches (as many gaming mice do at this point), letting inputs register faster than they would with mechanical switches.</p><p>To complement its new mouse, Sony has launched two cloth mousepads, both of which are 18.89 x 15.7 inches in size. The Mat-F is thicker at 6mm (versus 4mm), with a surface that’s meant to create some drag to prevent the mouse from moving any more than you want it to. It’s designed for tactical first-person shooters that don’t emphasize twitchy movement. It costs $59.99. The $34.99 Mat-D, is for those who want speed, and the ability to make quick flicks of the mouse to pull off headshots and other commands. I don’t typically use any kind of mousepad, just a mat that my keyboard, mouse, and drink sit on. Sony only sent the Mat-D for me to test, and while it’s step up from my desk mat, I think it’d prefer the Mat-F for its higher friction.</p><p>Of all of Sony’s InZone gear, the product that I’ll miss the most is the H9 II headset. Despite its $349.99 price, you’re getting great audio quality for the money. And, thanks to its removable mic, using it as a set of headphones away from your desk won’t make you look as ridiculous as the first-gen model does. Each of the new products has redeeming qualities, but a lack of novelty and high prices across the board make them tough to broadly recommend.</p><p>Sony is a household name, but not so much in esports. It’s going up against companies that have been making similar products — often with lower prices — and have years of goodwill attached to their names. But I suppose every company has to start somewhere. High prices aside, this isn’t a bad place to begin.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/757680/sony-inzone-pc-gaming-headset-keyboard-mouse-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

              <p><em>Game of Thrones</em> author George R.R. Martin recently appeared on a panel at Seattle WorldCon 2025 entitled The Shifting Landscape of Epic Fantasy, alongside Brandon Sanderson, Robin Hobb, Rebecca Roanhorse and Ryan Cahill. However, during the question-and-answer portion at the end of the session, one member of the audience got up in front of the all-star panel to complain that George R.R. Martin was taking far too long to write the penultimate book in the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series, <em>The Winds of Winter</em>, and given that he likely doesn’t have that long left to live, shouldn’t he let someone else write it?</p> <p>The outstandingly rude question was met with an astonished murmur in the hall, while the guests on stage looked incredibly uncomfortable and attempted to move the topic on. However, the audience member seemed not to be able to pick up on the mood they’d created, and just continued digging their hole with a series of staccato additional words. You can see the squirm-inducing moment here (thanks&nbsp;<em>ScreenRant</em>):</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GEORGE RR MARTIN WORLDCON PANEL 2025 FULL " width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rCiQWbjPtYI?start=7762&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Which somehow means someone choosing to film a two-hour panel in portrait wasn’t close to the most offensive thing that happened.</p>

 <p>The bizarre, rambling question, which begins with the audience member talking somewhat incoherently about Martin Scorsese directing her in a movie, then takes a dramatic left-turn as she declares, “George, you’re not going to be around for much longer.”</p> <p>Martin, who is 76 and clearly still reasonably healthy, didn’t appear to react to the premonition of his death (although the person filming infuriatingly avoided filming him at any point). “This is a tough question,” the person at the mic continues while the audience begins audibly booing and vocally disagreeing, attempting to rescue herself by adding, “this is more directed at Brandon…” The reason being that Brandon Sanderson, a spritely 49, took over writing Robert Jordan’s unfinished <em>The Wheel of Time</em> epic fantasy series after the author died, aged only 58. The questioner wondered if the same could be arranged for <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>. “How would you feel about someone else taking over and finishing the books?” she said, seemingly now addressing Martin again, despite various members of the panel loudly saying, “No, no,” and getting up from their seats.</p> <p>“Not me,” you can hear Sanderson say, while Martin gets up from his seat. Even then, the person at the mic keeps going, responding to inaudible comments from the panel, in a room that surely could no longer contain any air at all.</p>

 <p>Obviously a lot of&nbsp;<em>GoT</em> fans are frustrated by <em>The Winds of Winter</em>‘s prolonged absence, given the book was due out 14 years ago. Given the series is <em>two</em> books away from being finished, and given Martin’s current output, it’s reasonable to wonder if any human would live long enough to get it finished at the current rate. Assuming another 14 years, Martin would be 90. However, there are obviously more human and decent ways to approach the subject.</p> <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/george-r-r-martin-howard-waldrop-ugly-chickens-game-of-thrones-1236078329/">Martin said of the delay last year</a>, “How could I be 13 years late? I don’t know, it happens a day at a time.” He then added, “A lot of people are already writing obituaries for me. ‘Oh, he’ll never be finished.’ Maybe they’re right. I don’t know. I’m alive right now! I seem pretty vital!”</p> <p>And who knows! Maybe he’ll surprise everyone and release his version of the story’s conclusion all of a sudden (the <em>Game of Thrones </em>TV series had to write its own ending, given it unexpectedly ran out of source material). In the meantime, maybe don’t yell at the old dude on stage that you reckon he’ll die soon.</p>

    <div id="main-content">
        

        <p>Project recently 'failed internal review'.</p>

    </div>

    <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> 4 developer Cloud Chamber is reportedly laying off an "unspecified" number of employees. The news comes as former Diablo boss Rod Fergusson joins as new studio head following claims of development "turmoil".
</p>
<p>
Word that BioShock 4's development had running into difficulties first emerged earlier this month when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-fails-to-impress-at-internal-2k-review-resulting-in-leadership-shake-up-and-revamped-narrartive">project had failed an internal review at publisher 2K Games</a>, with particular criticism being levied at its narrative. Soon after, studio head Kelley Gilmore was ousted and staff were warned the team needed to "become more agile and efficient", leading to concerns layoffs were imminent. And now Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr7jxitg22z">reports</a> job cuts affecting an "unspecified number of staff" at Cloud Chamber have begun. Eurogamer has contacted 2K Games for comment.
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, former Diablo boss Rod Fergusson has now been revealed as Cloud Chamber's new studio head. Fergusson most recently served as general manager of the Diablo franchise at Blizzard, having joined the company in February 2020, but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-boss-rod-fergusson-leaves-blizzard">confirmed to be "stepping away" from his position</a> earlier this month. Notably, Fergusson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rod-fergusson-the-closer-who-helped-get-bioshock-infinite-out-the-door-is-leaving-irrational">played a key role in the release of the third BioShock title</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, joining Irrational Games to help the project over the finish line after its own difficult development.
</p>
<p>
Confirming his new role at Cloud Chamber <a href="https://x.com/RodFergusson/status/1957824815018213692">on social media</a>, Fergusson wrote, "Some of you guessed it, I'm returning to 2K to lead a series that means a lot to me as the new Head of the BioShock Franchise. I'll be heading up Cloud Chamber and overseeing development of the next BioShock game, along with franchise extensions like the in-development Netflix movie.
</p><p>
"While I'm excited to get started in the coming weeks, I recognise the studio restructuring is a difficult time for the team. I'm deeply grateful for the work done so far, and I'm committed to building a BioShock game we'll be proud of and that our players will love."
</p>
<p>
BioShock 4 was confirmed to be in development in 2019, with its release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-in-development-at-new-2k-studio-cloud-chamber">said to be "several" years away</a> at the time. 2K Games has, however, been attempting to get a sequel off the ground for over a decade - back in 2014, the publisher <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-2k-marin-now-responsible-for-bioshock-franchise">announced its now-defunct 2K Marin studio would be responsible for the future of BioShock</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levine-steps-away-from-bioshock-to-create-something-new">series creator Ken Levine departed Irrational Games</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-reveals-new-studio-ghost-story">found Ghost Story Games</a>. Little has been heard of the project since its shift to Cloud Chamber, but in 2021 it was reported BioShock 4 would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshocks-setting-and-time-period-detailed-in-new-report">take place in a fictional Antarctic city set sometime during the 1960s</a>, roughly concurrent with the events of BioShock 1 and 2.
</p>
<p>
As for Levine and Ghost Story Games, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levines-new-game-looks-like-bioshock-in-space">studio's next project, Judas</a>, is still without a release date - but it seems likely the BioShock-style shooter will emerge well before 2K's next official BioShock game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In June, SAG-AFTRA video game voice actors ended a nearly <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">year-long strike</a> when they <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-deal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached an agreement</a> with a handful of major companies. While the new agreement offers considerable AI <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/video-game-actors-strike-contract-ratified-sag-aftra-1236451291/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protections</a>, soundalike voice actors have been and continue to be particularly impacted by AI and its growing influence on the industry.</p><h2>Voice match acting before the dawn of AI</h2><p>Soundalike, or voice match, actors are performers whose job is to imitate the speech pattern of a famous actor or celebrity. These actors can be used for many reasons. One well-known example is when Square Enix and Disney couldn’t secure Tom Hanks to reprise his role as Woody in <em>Kingdom Hearts 3</em>, and so cast his brother, Jim, to step in to voice Woody in his stead.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="hollup…Let him cook (Woody - Kingdom Hearts 3)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZG1W2xwp2s4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>BAFTA-winning voice actor <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4047315/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cissy Jones</a> has done her fair share of voice match acting, as well as being a renowned voice talent in her own right. She describes honing the craft as something similar to a musician tuning an instrument to match the cadence and tones of celebrity actors.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s a lot like hearing musicality. I used to do a ton of voice matching. I did Charlize Theron, Rebel Wilson, Penelope Cruz, and Emma Thompson… [E]ssentially, it is hearing the musicality in a speaker’s voice,” Jones told Aftermath. “What I like to do when I get a script is, usually there’s an MP3 file that comes along with it [that] they want you to match and see if the timbre and the cadence are correct. I will often shut my eyes and listen to the file multiple times, play and repeat the music of it. That gets me right in the spot.”</p><p>When an actor excels at impersonating celebrities—like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1082823/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Bauza</a>’s uncanny voice match of Antonio Banderas in <em>Puss in Boots</em>—they often become a go-to substitute, much like a reliable understudy in a theater troupe. These voice match actors are called upon whenever the original star isn’t available, whether due to scheduling conflicts or budgetary constraints.&nbsp;</p><p>"If you look at <em>Kung Fu Panda</em>, they can’t afford to have Jack Black come in and do Po for the entire series, so <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1964186/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mick Wingert</a> does it, and he’s amazing. He sounds exactly like [Black], and he makes scale,” Jones said. “[Companies] used to do it where they would swap out curse words for non-curse words, but they would have a [voice match] actor come in to do it. For games and animation, doing soundalike is definitely more cost-effective.”</p><p>Voice match actors’ work is especially valuable during the production of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_vocal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scratch lines</a>—temporary audio placeholders used in trailers or early film edits. Producers may also rely on them in post-production to record additional dialogue or <a href="https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/adr-film-explained-examples-75425/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ADR</a> (automated dialogue replacement) that the original actor can’t return for. In some cases, voice match actors are tasked with resurrecting the vocal essence of a bygone performer, preserving their signature twang or cadence for nostalgia and continuity. Audiobooks often require narrators who can channel a specific vocal style. For example, Jones narrated the audiobook of<em> The Nightmare Before Christmas</em> in the breathy, high-registered, Mid-Atlantic accent of Catherine O’Hara.</p><p>“[Producers] would have voice actors come in and do a voice match for Charlize Theron to say, ‘We gotta get out of here,’ or whatever. They would have us come in and do things for the trailer so that it could go to air without having to pay her rates to come in. They paid me scale, but it was a good living,” Jones said.&nbsp;</p><p>Scale is the minimum wage for an actor. Once they join a union like SAG-AFTRA, a union job will guarantee a performer's base pay—which is the scale—for that contract, plus pension, health, and an agent commission scale. Jones says celebrities often receive multiple times the scale, where only a rare few prominent voice actors can demand double without it being a big deal; otherwise, most voice actors work at the standard scale. Depending on the contract, Jones says video games typically pay $950 for a four-hour session, plus pension, health benefits, and an agent's commission. Animation, which is also offered on a four-hour session basis, can pay an actor $1,100 per session. Other work, like commercials, which offer the highest payouts, is a completely different ballgame in terms of rates and residuals for rebroadcast.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>It is crickets out there.</p><cite>Cissy Jones</cite></blockquote></figure><blockquote><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Voice matching isn’t just a subgenre of voice acting for up-and-comers. It includes prominent voice actors, such as Jennifer Hale of <em>Mass Effect</em> fame. When I reached out to Hale to discuss the work, she was actually on her way to a voice recording for soundalike work. While she couldn’t disclose for who or what her soundalike role pertained to, she reaffirmed that her soundalike sessions are about the human connection between the producer, the performer, and the role.&nbsp;</p><p>“They’re pulling me in. They’re not using AI, and it's because they truly value that beautiful human spark, which is what uplifts anything,” Hale said.&nbsp;</p><h2>How AI has impacted voice acting</h2><p>Before AI entered the scene, voice match actors I spoke to said they were already starting to see fewer opportunities. The general feeling was that unless they were doing the voice match for a celebrity in a video game, they weren’t getting much work. The main source of income for voice match actors has traditionally been commercial work, such as movie trailers, but even that is decreasing.</p><p>“For trailers, I used to get 10 to 15 voice match movie trailer auditions a week. Now, I might get three in a year. It’s died considerably—at least from my point of view,” Jones said. “Granted, I also used to work with a manager who had a lot more access to movie trailer companies and would get very specialized auditions. But even before I let that manager go, I really wasn’t seeing those kinds of auditions coming through anymore. It is crickets out there.”</p><p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3084185/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carin Gilfry</a>, who has done voice matching for celebrities like Kate McKinnon, Scarlett Johansson, and Brie Larson, feels that much of the reason voice acting as a profession has declined is due to reckless, unregulated use of AI. One way this is manifesting that several voice actors I spoke with brought up is how many synthetic voice websites claim to have been approved with consent, but<a href="https://kotaku.com/ai-voice-actors-steve-blum-elevenlabs-contracts-sell-1850108292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> often aren’t</a>. For a quick buck—money actors will never see—fans can pay for soundbites of actors in character saying funny, off-color things for internet memes. Hale warns that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/ai-fears-and-short-sighted-execs-voice-acting-legend-jennifer-hale-lays-out-the-stakes-of-the-video-game-voice-actor-strike-2000501935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sharing reposts of AI-generated content </a>helps spread unauthorized AI voice videos of their favorite actors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>When that opportunity is given to a robot instead of a human, that human doesn't have the chance to make those connections.</p><cite>Carin Gilfry</cite></blockquote></figure><p>What’s more troubling about the rise of AI is how it can restrict new voice actors from breaking into the industry. Gilfry and voice actor <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm12048923/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Scott</a> told me beginning voice actors can no longer depend on voice matching as a way to get into the industry or land union jobs. Furthermore, situations like when Epic Games used a generative AI model to digitally recreate James Earl Jones’ voice (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/fortnite-darth-vader-ai-epic-games-star-wars-james-earl-jones-2000603304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who signed away his likeness to Lucasfilm before he died</a>) for their<em> </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-ai-darth-vader-star-wars-epic-games-sag-aftra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Star Wars</em> Darth Vader event</a> feel like a chilling effect legitimizing AI voice models over voice match actors. In the past, Jones said a company might have hired a voice match actor to mimic James Earl Jones. To Gilfry and Scott, AI voice technology has cut off a route for actors who, through their hard work and growing reputation as reliable voice matchers, would have moved forward—all because a c-suite executive saw using an AI prompt to replicate a celebrity’s voice as cheaper than finding someone with the talent to match a performer.&nbsp;</p><p>Most people today get into voice acting not through SAG-AFTRA union jobs, but through online casting sites such as <a href="https://voice123.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voice123</a>, <a href="http://voices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voices.com</a>, or <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fiverr.</a> Unfortunately, AI has taken over many of these seemingly entry-level roles, such as creating training videos, local commercials, or phone system recordings. When companies use more robotic AI to record full commercials, it takes away what could have been an entry-level job for a budding actor, especially since some companies claim that humanistic acting isn’t necessary.</p><p>“What I've seen every single one of my sessions for the past two months, [producers] say, Hey, so here's a scratch track. Here is the audio that we have that we want you to match, or we put it into the video so we can see what it sounds like with voice over—every single one of the sessions that I've been in so far has used an AI scratch track. Every single one,” Gilfry said. “That did not used to be the case before two months ago. I've kept track of the past two months. Every single one's an AI scratch track.”&nbsp;</p><p>Scratch voice-over is a gateway for many voice actors to break into the industry, serving as an entry-level opportunity for actors to gain work. It's how actors like Scott, who's done voice match for actors like Kid Cudi, broke into the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>“Kid Cudi is in the show <em>Young Love</em> [and] I voice-matched him, literally reading the whole script as scratch, and the producers fell in love with me and gave me a role,” Scott told Aftermath. “Before I knew it, I was 10 characters in the show, like a series regular, because that scratch was the pathway to get into that ongoing work. I wouldn't have had that opportunity with AI as a barrier.”</p><p>One of the most well-known examples of a scratch track leading to an actor securing a major role is when Disney was so impressed with<em> </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSnrEve212M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Coco</em> actor Anthony Gonzalez’s scratch performance as Miguel</a> that he was cast in the film.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Making of: Disney's COCO | The Voice of Miguel Rivera (Anthony Gonzalez)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dSnrEve212M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“You form a relationship with the production team, with the directors, with everyone who's working on the project, and they start to know you,” Gilfry said. “When that opportunity is given to a robot instead of a human, that human doesn't have the chance to make those connections.”</p><p>Now, Gilfry says human scratch tracks are no longer used as much as AI because AI is cheaper and quicker, and producers no longer need to go through traditional casting. Instead, they are asking people to imitate an AI’s scratch performance.</p><p>“The production team starts to fall in love with the sound of the scratch. Then you, an actor, are being asked to mimic the timing and delivery of the AI voice—to bring your humanness to it, because they don't want the AI on the final product. But they want you to match what's there,” Gilfry said. “It's really a weird time.”</p><h2>How voice actors are trying to deal with AI as ethically as they can</h2><p>Unlike NFTs' fleeting life cycle that quickly shifted from a buzzword-worthy trend to an ethered tech bro venture, AI's influence on the creative industry is complex. It cannot be simply put back in the proverbial toothpaste tube. For actors, solutions aren’t as all-or-nothing as some online have made them out to be. One such solution is for actors to find ethical ways to utilize AI in a manner that ensures they have consent, control, and compensation for their voices being replicated.&nbsp;</p><p>Before the strike began, Jones said she often encountered platforms where producers praised the ease of using AI programs and the fact that they didn't have to call actors in for pickups — a sentiment she finds “incredibly violating.” To avoid that uncomfortable feeling, she co-founded <a href="https://ethovox.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethovox</a>, an AI voice startup where she also serves as CEO. According to Gilfry, Ethovox works by having a company working on a film request the use of a digital replica of a performer’s voice for that film only. Performers schedule a recording session with Ethovox, where they collect data, making a digital copy of their voice. From there, clients pay a generation fee, which is passed on to the human actor, to use their digital double for voice over on commercial or entertainment projects. With those parameters in place, a performer can expect to hear their voice used only for approved projects.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>Our joke is AI doesn’t have trauma.</p><cite>Cissy Jones</cite></blockquote></figure><blockquote><blockquote><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>SAG-AFTRA’s <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-06/2025%20Interactive%20Media%20%28Video%20Game%29%20Agreement%20Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contract</a> sets out rules for consent and pay around voice replicas, but some voice actors I spoke with still had suspicions around the idea, fearing that it is a concession to AI. Additionally, desperate performers just starting their careers might be willing to sell their voices for less than they’re worth for the promise of passive income, potentially harming themselves and their colleagues by having their synthetic voices eliminate them from commercial and entertainment opportunities down the line. Scott also mentioned a potential nightmare scenario hanging over actors: a client might cut corners by violating the terms of the agreement for voice replicas on projects beyond the scope of their approved usage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“If I am doing a radio commercial and they say it's supposed to run for six months, we have to put trust in the system, meaning our managers, our agents, the client, that they are ethically using our voice for the time and the term period that they licensed it for with AI. Who's to say they don't take every acting job we do and put it into perpetuity?” Scott said. “Part of the way we make money—either through residuals or through the contract terms—would go away, decimating our industry, because there is no increase in the renewal that you would typically get if the client decides, ‘Hey, I love this Christmas commercial. We're going to use it again this year, and we're going to pay you a little bit more because we love it so much.’ The amount increases slightly every year, or according to the terms. That's one of the biggest dangers with AI, is that the robot can just do the work whenever, however, forever, into perpetuity.”</p><p>Another problem with the still-in-its-infancy threat that AI poses is that there is no legislation in place to make unethical and unconsented uses of it punishable by law.</p><p>“The <a href="https://navavoices.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Association of Voice Actors</a> is trying to get legislation in place to make it so that every person has the intellectual property rights over their voice, image, name, and likeness. We're doing that in support of the <a href="https://www.coons.senate.gov/download/no-fakes-act-one-pager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No Fakes Act</a>, but also talking with the copyright office, working even overseas, to make sure that that happens with the EU, and ideally, we would all own ourselves so that you can license that out,” Gilfry said. “When someone wants to create an AI version of you, there are currently no federal laws or many state laws in the United States that protect our rights to ourselves. So, it's the wild west with AI, and I am worried that this new administration in the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/trump-releases-his-all-american-action-plan-for-ai-2000633155" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US is so focused on AI progress</a> that they will not regulate it in a way that provides us with guardrails to do it ethically.”</p><p>While much of voice matching’s use case in all of this is allocated to substituting for celebrities in shows, film, and commercials, it is also affected by AI’s growing influence on how the industry operates, which is limiting who can join the space as a sonic doppelganger for celebrities. Some of that relates to how AI has already become part of SAG-AFTRA’s new contract, with AI usage in ADR included in contracts.&nbsp;</p><p>“With the new <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/production-center/contract/813/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV theatrical agreement with SAG-AFTRA</a>, AI ADR is built into that contract. So if [an actor is] signing on to the new TV theatrical contract, you are already automatically agreeing to let them do ADR using a synthetic voice, because it's all considered post-production. As long as it doesn't change too much of your performance, it's allowed,” Gilfry said.&nbsp;</p><p>No one I spoke with thought we’re so far gone that AI will cause irreparable damage to the industry, such as replacing actors, voice match, or similar roles, entirely.</p><p>“We’re designed to look for tigers,” Hale says. “Couple that with the notion that what you focus on grows, and if we’re all focusing on where the losses are and where the problems are, we’re going to miss the incredible burgeoning of creativity.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Harrison Ford Crashes The Game Awards" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TLxL3U91YaY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Put more bluntly, the performers I spoke with feel there is a desire for human actors to reclaim the space, as the trend of AI being the flavor of the month among tech bros on Wall Street and Silicon Valley is bound to cycle out again because AI doesn’t, and can never, hit the same way as a human performance.&nbsp;</p><p>“Our joke is AI doesn’t have trauma,” Jones said. “AI can’t bring the trauma to a performance like a human can, and I think there will be a middling out where a lot of main characters are going to be human actors and a lot of the background characters are probably going to be AI-generated.”</p><p>“If you think about the Olympics, we're looking at the peak of human performance. It is exciting to watch someone run 100 meters as fast as they possibly can. The same is true when I watch <em>Fences</em>, and I see Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, where tears are flowing down their face, I'm connected to the emotion of it, but I'm also impressed by their amazing ability to go there as people,” Gilfry said. “It's just not impressive if a robot is doing it. I feel no connection to it. I might be impressed by the technology for a second, but it's not something that is going to touch me, because I can't empathize. I can't relate to it. I know that someone prompted it to do that. It's just not impressive.”</p><p>“I suspect we'll go through a phase where we're infatuated with the shiny new object of, ‘Oh my goodness, [AI] can copy anything.’ You've seen some of the crazy videos that Google's put out where they've got ‘AI humans’ doing performances that seem quite intense, emotional and human,” Hale said. “But when you tune into your gut, there's a piece missing. I honestly suspect that creators will get through this infatuation period and begin to long for that human element—the actual, undefinable, beautiful spark of the human soul.”</p><p>While Hale admits that the indistinguishable spark is undervalued in areas where content is simply created, she believes the pendulum will eventually swing back as people crave the human element of a performance over AI-generated voices. Plus, the excitement of watching actors try their hand at either voice-matching performances for characters like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/mark-hamill-kevin-conroy-joker-batman-one-last-reunion-1851298354" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Hamill’s Joker and Kevin Conroy’s Batman</a>, or putting their own stamp on characters like <a href="https://youtu.be/HwkeTEEbfc8?t=27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roger Craig Smith</a> with the caped crusader or <a href="https://youtu.be/9uIEng_Q9_0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Keaton as Spider-Man</a> is a sensation that fans will gravitate towards once folks grow bored of how tacky AI voices are in comparison.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you look at our culture from a sort of a very wide, you know, 30,000 foot view,&nbsp;</p><p>everybody's been all about chasing money for so long. I'm seeing everybody look around and realize how soulless, lonely, and disconnected that has left us. And we're beginning to seek each other, community, meaning, and connection because that shiny object—sometimes literally—is leaving us empty,” Hale said. “I believe we're gonna have the same experience even in soundalikes. With this technology, it's fun to play with, but we're going to miss home, and home is that divine spark of the human soul.”</p><p><strong>Correction, 8/19/25, 12pm--</strong>The original version of this article misstated which Hanks voiced Woody in <em>Kingdom Hearts 3</em>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mafia-old-country-review-impressions"><h3>Curling Up With A Sandwich, A Warm Drink And Mafia: The Old Country</h3></a><p>'I'm genuinely wistful for a good 'ol 7/10, last-days-of -summer video game'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esports-world-cup-new-global-sport-conference-2025-hideo-kojima"><h3>Come On, Guys</h3></a><p>Nobody is forcing Hideo Kojima and a host of industry luminaries to attend a Saudi sportswashing conference.

		<p>Commodore Amiga owners were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWBSnBsCW5Y">spoilt for superb shoot ’em ups</a> with original games such as&nbsp; Xenon II, Project X, Swiv,&nbsp; and Bloody Money, and superb arcade ports such as R-Type.&nbsp;One title that stood out from the crowd was Apidiya, a game that ditched spaceships and battle stations and replaced them with insects and ponds.&nbsp; It was totally unique and it’s coming back in almost exactly the same form.</p>
<p>Apidya Special is a full remake rather than an emulated version of the original Amiga title and it’s been developed by the original team, together with a devoted Apidya super-fan-turned-developer. The new version is based on an unreleased console port from the 90s, presumably the Sega Megadrive version, and uses the original assets along with brand new pixel art.&nbsp; There’s also a new version of the soundtrack by legendary 16-bit composer Chris Hülsbeck.</p>
<p><iframe title="Apidya' Special Announcement Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OHiFhz-yJkE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“We never thought we’d return to Apidya after all these years,” said Peter Thierolf, original creator of the game. “but with new technology, the right team, and the passion of the community, we can finally deliver the version we always dreamed about.”</p>
<p>While remaining true to the original game there some new features that have been added, check them out:</p>

<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentic Remake</strong>&nbsp;– Completely rebuilt from scratch; no emulation.</li>
<li><strong>Two Visual Modes</strong>&nbsp;– Seamlessly switch between HD widescreen or original Amiga 4:3 presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusive Chris Hülsbeck OST</strong>&nbsp;– Newly arranged soundtrack alongside remixed and classic tracks.</li>
<li><strong>Retro Visual Effects</strong>&nbsp;– Optional CRT shaders, bloom, and authentic scanline simulation.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Worlds</strong>&nbsp;– 5 diverse themed worlds (Meadow, Pond, Sewers, Cyber, Lair), up to 5 levels each, 20 unique bosses, and hidden special stages.</li>
<li><strong>Fresh Surprises</strong>&nbsp;– Randomized in-game events like “Night Mode” with new enemy sprites.</li>
<li><strong>Co-op Mode</strong>&nbsp;– Second player controls one of the helper drones.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility Options</strong>&nbsp;– Modernized difficulty settings to make the game enjoyable for all generations (including the original devs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apidya Special will launch next year on PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Can someone please remake SWIV now? Pretty please?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legendary producer Rod Fergusson has been appointed as the new franchise head for the&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>series, following the fourth game's well-documented production struggles.</p>

<p>Fergusson announced his new position <a href="https://x.com/rodfergusson/status/1957824815018213692" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media</a> earlier today, declaring that he'll be heading up&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>developer Cloud Chamber and "overseeing development of the next&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>game, along with franchise extensions like the in-development Netflix movie".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that while he's excited to start his new role, he understands that "the studio restructuring is a difficult time for the team", and that he's "deeply grateful" for the work completed on&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>by Cloud Chamber thus far (although we still don't know exactly how much work that is).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bioshock-infinite-rod-fergusson.jpg?itok=8bkzByqD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bioshock-infinite-rod-fergusson.jpg?itok=-RZ1k_Yj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rod Fergusson oversaw the final stretch of development on&nbsp;<em>BioShock Infinite</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering to what Fergusson is referring, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-remake-canceled-bioshock-4-story-report" rel="nofollow">reported recently</a> that a remake of the first&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>game was canceled internally at publisher 2K, and that development on the still-unannounced&nbsp;fourth major&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>game is in a rough patch.</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, 2K execs are unhappy with the way&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4</em>'s story was progressing, leading to the ousting of Cloud Chamber head Kelley Gilmore and a change in creative director Hogarth de la Plante's role to a more "publishing"-focused position.</p>

<p>The internal review that led to these decisions also apparently resulted in layoffs at Cloud Chamber, which is likely what Fergusson is referring to when he talks about "studio restructuring". It's another corporate term for staff cuts.</p>

<p>Rod Fergusson has something of a reputation as a "closer", a producer who's brought in to bring struggling projects over the finish line. It's a trick he performed before with 2013's&nbsp;<em>BioShock Infinite</em>, which is probably why 2K execs feel like they're in safe hands with him now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bioshock-2-remastered-rod-fergusson.jpg?itok=BfcvPzC0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bioshock-2-remastered-rod-fergusson.jpg?itok=aUwQ-XMu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fergusson will be overseeing the whole&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>franchise at 2K.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that amid all of this upheaval,&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>hasn't actually been officially announced yet, so we don't even know what direction the game will take.</p>

<p>Still, with Fergusson at the helm, perhaps the huge, lumbering Big Daddy that is the franchise at this point can start juddering into motion again. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

              <p>With a reputation for being a closer, Rod Fergusson helped get the last troubled BioShock game out the door. Can he do it again? The outgoing head of the <em>Diablo</em> franchise at Blizzard revealed on Tuesday that he’s joined <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-boss-rod-ferguson-leaving-blizzard-after-five-years-2000616680">2K Games’ struggling Cloud Chamber studio,</a> as <em>BioShock 4</em> development stalls and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr7jxitg22z">layoffs</a>&nbsp;hit the Montreal-based team.</p> <p>In an memo to staff shared with<em> Kotaku</em>, 2K Games president David Ismailer confirmed that Fergusson would be head of the BioShock franchise, including helping to oversea its movie spin-off that’s currently in production at Netflix. But he also said the team at Cloud Chamber would be downsized as <em>BioShock 4</em> is reworked.&nbsp;“While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a <em>BioShock</em> game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,” he wrote.</p> <p>Fergusson announced earlier this month he was <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-boss-rod-ferguson-leaving-blizzard-after-five-years-2000616680">leaving Blizzard after five years</a>, having joined just prior to the launch of <em>Diablo 4</em> and before Microsoft, his old employer, purchased Activision Blizzard. He was similarly brought in to help ship <em>BioShock Infinite,</em> which suffered multiple delays under a chaotic development process led by series creator Ken Levine at Irrational Games over a decade ago.&nbsp;“I’m returning to 2K as Head of the BioShock Franchise, leading Cloud Chamber!” Fergusson wrote on Bluesky. “I’m deeply grateful for the work the studio has done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love.”</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:7stk6kdxhyemi6fdsk23q3ta/app.bsky.feed.post/3lwr7mrw2gc2e" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiae25sd7bmtqrb6sjljl5iqrc6oobscldxw6nr6af2hcjlcqmsi6m"> <p lang="en">Would you kindly allow me to share some news?</p> <p>I’m returning to 2K as Head of the BioShock Franchise, leading Cloud Chamber!</p> <p>I’m deeply grateful for the work the studio has done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7stk6kdxhyemi6fdsk23q3ta?ref_src=embed">Rod Fergusson (@rodfergusson.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7stk6kdxhyemi6fdsk23q3ta/post/3lwr7mrw2gc2e?ref_src=embed">2025-08-19T15:20:29.637Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Not long after it launched, Levine left Irrational, and parent publisher 2K Games announced it was shutting the entire studio down. Years later, it was revealed that a new studio in Canada called Cloud Chamber would be making <em>BioShock 4</em> while Levine worked on Judas, a very BioShock-looking sci-fi immersive sim, at his Ghost Story Games startup. Despite both being revealed a while ago, each project is still MIA.</p>

 <p><em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-cloud-chamber-2k-take-two-remake-2000614413">reported earlier</a> this month that <em>BioShock 4</em> had suffered a setback and leadership change after a recent negative internal review. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-not-canceled-movie-judas-ken-levine-2000616424">claims the game won’t be canceled, however</a>. “It’s going to come out,” he said in a recent interview. “That I can say hand on heart, without question.”</p> <p>Fergusson, a long-time producer, is a known hater of the phrase “it’s ready when it’s ready.” “It takes the agency away from the team,” he <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo/492060/diablo-4-rod-fergusson-ready-when-its-ready/">told <em>Polygon</em></a> last year. “Saying ‘it’s ready when it’s ready’ means the team doesn’t have control over what they’re building. Mind, I’m giving you one person’s philosophy. But you control the scope. You control the schedule. You control a bunch of things. The idea that the game has to reveal itself somehow, with some unknown amount of content…I just find ‘it’s ready when it’s ready’ to be so passive.”</p> <p>Here’s the full email Ismailer sent staff today about the changes:</p> <blockquote> <p>BioShock is woven deeply into the fabric of 2K. It’s one of our most beloved franchises and respecting its legacy and meeting our fans’ expectations is critical to its future success.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p> <p>Work on the next BioShock game has been underway for several years. While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p> <p>I know this is tough news for everyone. If your role is being affected, you’ll hear from your manager or studio leadership today with details on severance, career services and support resources.&nbsp; There is no easy way to do this, but we hope to do whatever we can to support you through this.&nbsp; I want to thank each of you for your dedication and hard work.<u></u><u></u></p> <p>I also want to share an important studio leadership update. After an extensive search, I’m excited to announce Rod Fergusson will be leading Cloud Chamber as the new Head of the BioShock Franchise. Rod is an industry veteran with a proven history of critical and commercial success, including BioShock Infinite, Gears of War, and Diablo.&nbsp; Rod rejoins us from Blizzard, where he was GM of the Diablo franchise and launched Diablo IV – Blizzard’s fastest-selling game ever.<u></u><u></u></p> <p>As Head of the BioShock Franchise, Rod will lead Cloud Chamber and oversee the development of the next BioShock game, as well as franchise extensions including our film partnership with Netflix. We will share more about Rod’s onboarding and how these changes will take shape in the coming days and weeks.&nbsp; Rod and I worked together 10+ years ago and I am grateful he has chosen to return to lead our BioShock efforts.<u></u><u></u></p> <p>I recognize that today is a day of mixed emotions. We’re excited to have Rod joining us, and are equally grateful to everyone at Cloud Chamber who has helped us get this far. These changes are rooted in 2K’s firm confidence in BioShock as one of the most beloved franchises, and our commitment to deliver the best game in franchise history.</p> </blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony has announced its brand new Inzone lineup of gaming products. Joining the new product lineup are Inzone H9 II headset, the E9 in-ear headphones, KBD-H75 keyboard, a gaming mouse, and two new mouse pads.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-wide-range-of-peripherals">A Wide Range Of Peripherals</h2>



<p>Starting with the headset, the <strong>H9 II</strong> is the follow up to the original H9. <strong>Retailing for $349.99</strong>, the new headset features up to 30 hours of battery life with quick charging that gives you up to three hours of use on a five minute charge. Other features include a detachable unidirectional 14000kHz super wide band microphone, Bluetooth connectivity, active noise cancelling, and 360 spatial sound.</p>



<p>Moving on to the<strong> $149.99 E9 in-hear headphones</strong>, there are a pair of wired earbuds that also come with a 3.5MM to USB adapter for more adaptability. Like the H9 II, the E9 also features 360 spatial sound while allowing audio setting customization through Sony’s proprietary <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/software/00279252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inzone Hub app</a>. The E9 has a pressure-free and ear hanger design that allows for more comfortable wear during long sessions.</p>



<p>On the keyboard front, <strong>the KBD-H75</strong> is a 75% form factor board that retails for <strong>$299.99.</strong> The KDB-H75 features magnetic hall effect switches that allow for customization of its actuation points ranging from 0.1-3.4mm. The gasket-mounted keys absorb the impact on press, making them feel quicker and smoother, and it features an 8000Hz polling rate.</p>



<p>The <strong>$149.99 Inzone Mouse-A</strong> gaming mouse can be both wired or wireless, depending on your preference. At 48 grams, it comes in as a lightweight option for those who like the control. Features of the Mouse-A include a 90-hour battery life, 8000Hz polling rate, 30,000 DPI, and the same quick charge feature as the headset. For the mouse, however, the quick charge is 10 hours of use after a five minute charge and only 1.5 hours for a full charge. </p>



<p>Lastly, there are two new mouse pads—Mat D and Mat F—each designed for different types of players. <strong>The $34.99 Mat D</strong> features a 4mm high-density rubber cushion that Sony says is geared more for battle royale and first-person shooters. <strong>The $59.99 Mat F</strong> is more geared for tactical control with 6mm cushion. Both have a cloth surface.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have full impressions of the newest lineup of Sony Inzone products in the coming days, letting you know if they’re worth the investment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rod Fergusson, who recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-gm-rod-fergusson-leaves-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced his departure</a> from Blizzard after five years, has revealed that he is heading to 2K to become the new head of the BioShock franchise.</p>



<p>In his post on <a href="https://x.com/RodFergusson/status/1957824815018213692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Fergusson said that he’ll be <strong>“heading up Cloud Chamber and overseeing development of the next BioShock game, along with franchise extensions like the in-development Netflix movie.”</strong></p>



<p>With Fergusson taking over, it was also revealed that the studio will be letting go an unknown number of employees as part of the changes.</p>



<p><strong>“While I’m excited to get started in the coming weeks, I recognize the studio restructuring is a difficult time for the team,”</strong> he said. <strong>“I’m deeply grateful for the work done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“For now, the firehose of onboarding awaits, and I look forward to sharing more when I can.”</strong></p>



<p>Fergusson joins 2K and BioShock after if it was recently reported that the next BioShock game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-bioshock-game-suffers-development-hell-failing-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in development hell</a> after failing an executive review. The original report said that 2K was “overhauling parts of the next&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>&nbsp;game and shaking up management after senior executives expressed they were unhappy with its development.” </p>



<p>That shake up now includes Fergusson as the head of the studio. </p>



<p>At the time of the news, a 2K Spokesperson told Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier that they were <strong>“working hard to set&nbsp;BioShock&nbsp;up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the new BioShock entry, it was also reported that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioshock-remake-shelved-this-year-claimed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remake of the original game</a> was recently shelved as part of the changes happening within the company.</p>

I’ll be heading up Cloud Chamber and overseeing development of the next <em>BioShock</em> game, along with franchise extensions like the in-development <a title="Companies > Netflix [85 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> movie.”</p><p>Fergusson also confirmed that Cloud Chamber is “restructuring,” following <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr7jxitg22z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report</a> from Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier that the studio is laying off an unspecified number of staff.</p><p>“While I’m excited to get started in the coming weeks, I recognize the studio restructuring is a difficult time for the team,” Fergusson said. “I’m deeply grateful for the work done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love.”</p><p>He continued, “For now, the firehose of onboarding awaits, and I look forward to sharing more when I can.”</p><p>2K <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2019/12/2k-games-opens-new-studio-cloud-chamber-to-work-on-the-next-bioshock-game">announced</a> the opening of Cloud Chamber and a new <em>BioShock</em> game in December 2019. Earlier in August, Bloomberg <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lved2wh33k2z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Cloud Chamber leadership was changing following a recently failed publisher review, and that an unannounced <em>BioShock</em> remake was also canceled earlier this year.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Fergusson’s return to <em>BioShock</em> is notable, as Fergusson was hired by 2K in August 2012 to salvage the then-troubled <em>BioShock Infinite</em>‘s production. In a 2014 report by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/6/5474722/why-did-irrational-close-bioshock-infinite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a>, it was said that many employees believed the game would not have shipped without him.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/rod-fergusson-joins-2ks-cloud-chamber-as-head-of-bioshock-franchise]]></content:encoded>

The custom sensor is complemented by a wireless signal with a polling rate of up to 8,000Hz, the same as the KBD-H75.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Canceling-WH-1000XM6-Lightweight-Detachable/dp/B0FJ2WXDRY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-Canceling-WH-1000XM6-Lightweight-Detachable\/dp\/B0FJ2WXDRY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Canceling-WH-1000XM6-Lightweight-Detachable/dp/B0FJ2WXDRY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Sony Inzone H9 II Wireless Noise-Canceling Gaming Headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Canceling-WH-1000XM6-Lightweight-Detachable/dp/B0FJ2WXDRY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-Canceling-WH-1000XM6-Lightweight-Detachable\/dp\/B0FJ2WXDRY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Canceling-WH-1000XM6-Lightweight-Detachable/dp/B0FJ2WXDRY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$350 | Releases September 5</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Wireless-Canceling-Over-ear-Headphones/dp/B0B1TDHLPT?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original H9 Wireless Gaming Headset</a>--which is excellent--the H9 II utilizes the audio driver from Sony's flagship WH-1000XM headphone series. This time around, that's the recently released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM6 headphones</a>, which retail for $450. Sony's Inzone H9 and the Inzone Buds have the best noise-canceling features we've tried in gaming-focused audio gear, and the H9 II should be even better with ANC while also offering improved positional audio. The leatherette ear cushions should also be similar to the XM6, just with a fuller form factor.</p><p>The H9 II has a detachable cardioid boom mic with ambient noise-filtering tech and a Super Wide Band mic. The H9 II supports 2.4GHz Wireless (USB-C adapter) and Bluetooth, including simultaneous connections on multiple devices, with up to 30 hours of battery life. The H9 II comes with a soft carrying pouch.</p><p>Another notable difference between the H9 II and its predecessor is the headband design, which looks similar to what SteelSeries does with its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B09ZWCYQTX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova headsets</a>--the most comfortable gaming headsets around.</p><p>The Inzone H9 II will be available in white/black and an all-black color scheme at launch, matching the current lineup of Inzone headsets.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Isolating-Comfortable-Included-Developed/dp/B0FJ2WLQFK?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-Isolating-Comfortable-Included-Developed\/dp\/B0FJ2WLQFK?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Isolating-Comfortable-Included-Developed/dp/B0FJ2WLQFK?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Sony Inzone E9 In-Ear Monitor (Wired Gaming Earbuds)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Isolating-Comfortable-Included-Developed/dp/B0FJ2WLQFK?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-Isolating-Comfortable-Included-Developed\/dp\/B0FJ2WLQFK?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Isolating-Comfortable-Included-Developed/dp/B0FJ2WLQFK?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$150 | Releases August 29</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Sony calls the Inzone E9 an In-Ear Monitor for gaming, but yes, that's just fancy wording for earbuds. The E9 comes with two different styles of eartips and multiple sizes for each. The foam eartips are designed to isolate noise, and then there are also more traditional silicone eartips.</p><p>Sony says the E9 earbuds are its first "fully enclosed structure," which is intended to help with isolating specific sounds. The earbuds support virtual 7.1 surround sound and Sony's 360 spatial sound. Each pair of E9 gaming earbuds comes with the carrying case shown above.</p><p>Since the E9 earbuds connect via 3.5mm audio, you could use them on basically all of your gaming platforms and devices, but the Inzone Hub customization suite only works on PC, as does some of Sony's audio features.</p><p>This isn't Sony's first pair of gaming earbuds. Sony previously released a pair of noise-canceling wireless earbuds for PC and PlayStation consoles called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJH6NV38?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inzone Buds</a>. We'd highly recommend the Inzone Buds for PC and PlayStation as well as mobile devices with USB-C--the Inzone Buds are limited to Bluetooth LE, so you need to use the dongle for most mobile devices. Sony raised the price of the Inzone Buds from $200 to $230 earlier this year, but you can grab a pair for $198 at Amazon. The Inzone Buds have ANC, whereas the E9 earbuds have noise isolation features.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Mat-D-Speed-Type-480x400mm/dp/B0FJ2X253H?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-INZONE-Mat-D-Speed-Type-480x400mm\/dp\/B0FJ2X253H?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Mat-D-Speed-Type-480x400mm/dp/B0FJ2X253H?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Sony Inzone Gaming Desk Mats</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Mat-D-Speed-Type-480x400mm/dp/B0FJ2X253H?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-INZONE-Mat-D-Speed-Type-480x400mm\/dp\/B0FJ2X253H?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Mat-D-Speed-Type-480x400mm/dp/B0FJ2X253H?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Mat-F: $60 / Mat-D: $35 | Releases September 5</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>To go along with its new keyboard and mouse, Sony is adding a pair of mouse pads to its Inzone lineup.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> PC players are finally set to receive proper optimisation for the game's performance issues, but Capcom has stated it won't arrive until this winter. That's almost a year after the game was released.</p>
<p>"To our hunters playing #MHWilds on PC, we're committed to listening to your feedback and improving both performance and stability of the game," said Capcom in a post on social media. "Although we will continue to implement gradual improvements in the weeks ahead, we are targeting Free Title Update 4 this winter to implement a multifaceted plan, including CPU and GPU related optimisations, followed by a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards."</p>
<p>The PC version of the game has been heavily criticised since the game's release for its poor performance, but waiting so long for improvements is ironic when the game has sold incredibly well and Capcom itself has noted how important the PC platform is. Will the improvements coming in winter be too little too late?</p>

<p>"Yeah, there are more players than ever playing on PC, including in Japan," said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-producer-acknowledges-importance-of-pc-platform-and-crossplay">producer Ryozo Tsujimoto back in February</a> ahead of the game's release, "so we definitely see room for the series to capture new players who haven't tried it before if that's their chosen platform." That's partly why Capcom released a PC benchmark tool too, to help satisfy PC players.</p><p>It's a sentiment mirrored across the industry. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has noted the importance of the PC platform</a>, teasing a release for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sees-game-sales-drop-but-multiplatform-strategy-continues-in-earnest">Square Enix is pursuing a multiplatform strategy</a> that's seen sales of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> games and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> boosted. And just look at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-runaway-success-on-pc-proves-south-korea-is-positioning-itself-to-become-a-major-force-in-global-gaming-and-experts-agree">PC success for Shift Up's Stellar Blade</a>, which sold a million copies on Steam in just three days.</p> <div>

<p>So when Capcom released Monster Hunter Wilds across PC and console in February, it's no wonder sales skyrocketed after the success of both World and Rise. It became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">company's fastest-selling game</a>, with over 8m units sold in just three days. It even helped propel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-series-helps-capcom-achieve-12th-consecutive-year-of-increased-profit">Capcom to its 12th consecutive year of increased profit</a>. According to Capcom's recently updated <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html">Platinum Titles list</a>, Monster Hunter Wilds has sold 10.5m copies across all platforms and is the eighth best-selling Capcom game of all time.</p>
<p>And on PC the game got off to a spectacular start. On Steam, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">quickly surpassed Monster Hunter World's all-time player peak</a> before hitting over a million concurrent players. Shortly afterwards, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-propels-steam-to-highest-ever-player-count">Steam hit a new player peak across the platform</a>. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai5telk2p">Analyst Mat Piscatella</a> stated in March Monster Hunter Wilds was the best-selling game of February, with Steam accounting for over half the game's sales.</p>
<p>Yet quickly that success was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-responds-after-monster-hunter-wilds-steam-success-is-marred-by-performance-complaints">marred by performance complaints</a>, specifically on PC. Capcom acknowledged these issues, but has failed so far to fully rectify them. Even now, the game sits with a mostly negative rating on Steam.</p>
<p>Sales and player counts have tumbled as a result. Last quarter, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter">Monster Hunter Wilds was outsold by Devil May Cry 5</a>, albeit through sales and its new anime series raising interest levels. Monster Hunter Wilds sold 477k copies, which was only just higher than the four-year-old <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>. At the time of writing, the game has a Steam 24-hour peak of just under 46k - that's a 97 percent drop from its all-time peak of 1.38 million players. Concurrent players don't tell the whole picture of a game's success, but the drop here is monumental however you look at it.</p><p>Capcom has released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-finally-fixes-the-games-inexcusable-performance-woes-on-pc">multiple patches to address performance issues on PC</a>, but problems remain. What's more, the forthcoming patch doesn't appear to be all-encompassing as a "second stage of mitigation measures" will follow, suggesting this will be a major overhaul as issues run deep. If that's required to fix problems, it'll be worth the wait to get the game back on track.</p>
<p>But that long wait is a huge disappointment for players, with responses on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1mtq9f2/capcom_is_working_on_mh_wilds_pc_optimization/">reddit</a> ranging from apathy to frustration at how long it's taking.  As <a href="https://x.com/W33ab00Jones/status/1957534736441561510">one response</a> on social media reads: "You guys waited too long and lost me. Sorry, not sorry."</p>
<p>While the initial sales of Monster Hunter Wilds has proven the success of the series, its massive drop-off ever since just shows how quickly the audience has moved on. The lack of a comprehensive fix on PC is a core reason for this, but so is the endgame.</p>
<p>Capcom has today released a statement acknowledging the demand for increased replayability of endgame content. As such, Appraise Talismans will now be available in top level quests, allowing for deeper customisation. A new Melding Pot feature will also allow for unwanted Appraised Talismans to be used to create new items.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>🛡 Guild Report 23 🛡</p><p>The team has heard the requests regarding end-game content, and implemented improvements in Ver 1.021, released on August 13.</p><p>Request:<br>Increase replayability in endgame content.</p><p>Improvement:<br>You will now be able to obtain Appraised Talismans in 9★ quests… <a href="https://t.co/Krjt46PmsI">pic.twitter.com/Krjt46PmsI</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1957719118154477785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Still, the additional monsters and challenging hunts <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/letter-2508/">coming later this year</a> feel like minimal extras. Presumably, Monster Hunter Wilds will receive a major expansion just like Iceborne for World and Sunbreak for Rise. Typically these extend the lifespan of Monster Hunter games considerably, with extra story and more monsters to hunt. Until then, it's frustrating to see Capcom continue to stumble on a fundamental level.</p>

		<p>If you’re not up to speed on Hollow Knight: Silksong, here’s the short version. It was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-silksong-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch/">announced in February 2019</a>, but then updates were few and far between until a new trailer was revealed at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase in June 2022. The game was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/10/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed/">officially delayed in May 2023</a>, and then in April 2025 it appeared in a sizzle reel for Nintendo with a 2025 release date.</p>
<p>However, the lack of communication and six-year (and counting) development time has led fans to joke that the game will never come out.&nbsp; A playable demo <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/29/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-at-the-xbox-gamescom-booth-this-year/">should be on the floor</a> at Gamescom 2025 starting tomorrow, but as there was a playable demo in 2019 that doesn’t mean much to the fans.</p>


<p>In a massive tease, Team Cherry have now posted a video that will launch a “Special Announcement” for the game at 3.30pm on 21st August.&nbsp; The internet has responded in the only way possible by suggesting that the big announcement is that the game is cancelled.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong was scheduled to come to PlayStation, Nintendo, PC, and Xbox, and was also meant to be a Day One launch on Game Pass. However, some of those details are now years old so things may have changed since then.</p>

<p>Here’s a little more about the game, but again, this is from previous announcements so may not be accurate.</p>
<p><em>Hornet, princess-protector of Hallownest, finds herself alone in a vast, unfamiliar world. She must battle foes, seek out allies, and solve mysteries as she ascends on a deadly pilgrimage to the kingdom’s peak. Bound by her lineage and guided by echoes of her past, Hornet will adventure through mossy grottos, coral forests and shining citadels to unravel a deadly thread that threatens this strange new land.</em></p>
<p><em>Hornet must master a whole new suite of powerful moves to survive. She’ll unleash devastating attacks, learn incredible silken abilities, and craft deadly tools in order to overcome the kingdom’s challenges. Over 150 all-new foes stand between Hornet and the shining citadel crowning the kingdom. Beasts and hunters, assassins and kings, monsters and knights – Hornet must face them all with bravery and skill!</em></p>
<p><em>The vast inter-connected world of Hollow Knight: Silksong is brought vividly to life in a traditional, hand-crafted, 2D style. Gilded cities, Lakes of fire, and misted moors are illustrated in exquisite detail and accompanied by a vibrant orchestral score. In her search for the truth behind her capture, Hornet will befriend surprising strangers, discover shocking secrets and solve ancient mysteries in a kingdom full of wonders.</em></p>

			<p>Developer Team Cherry has announced that it will host a "<em>Special Announcement</em>" for Hollow Knight Silksong this coming Thursday, August 21, 2025, at 7:30am PT / 10:30am ET / 3:30pm BST. It's the first official word from Team Cherry on its highly anticipated title in what feels like forever, and it is likely when we'll learn about the game's release date, if we don't hear about it today during Gamescom ONL 2025, that is.</p>



<p>"<em>The countdown is on! Join us in 48 hours for a special announcement about Hollow Knight: Silksong!," </em>the description of the video, which is set to premiere on YouTube, reads. The studio shared the same message on <a href="https://x.com/TeamCherryGames/status/1957812884773433667">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, so for now it seems like that's all we'll get from them until Thursday.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We've known that Silksong would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-gamescom-2025/">playable at Gamescom 2025</a> for a while now, and with its marketing ties to Xbox and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, there's been a lot of speculation that when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/">officially learn the release date</a> for the new Xbox handheld, we'll also learn the release date for Silksong.</p>



<p>That could still be true, and with the ROG Xbox Ally release date likely going live during Gamescom ONL 2025, Silksong's release date could be part of the ONL news cycle, with this presentation later in the week being a deep-dive into gameplay. At least, that would be the case, if not for Bloomberg's Jason Schreier claiming that the release date is being saved for the Thursday presentation.</p>







<p>We'll see how it all shakes out by the end of today, and if Silksong makes an appearance during the ONL presentation. What's certain, is that we are in the final stretch for Silksong. The wait is almost over, and we'll soon have a lot more official news on the title than we've had in the years since it was first announced. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed that the next&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game to be getting the remaster treatment is none other than&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia</em>, and the remaster is due to land later this year.</p>

<p>Last week, the studio accidentally confirmed the existence of&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia Remastered&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-xillia-remaster-rumor" rel="nofollow">via an unfortunate YouTube thumbnail</a>, but earlier today, the remaster was officially revealed. It's landing on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch (but not Switch 2, strangely) on October 31st.</p>

<p>The project is part of Bandai Namco's promise to release remastered versions of games in the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-series-remasters-regular" rel="nofollow">"fairly consistently"</a>, with the first entry in the so-called Remaster Project, namely&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review-spirited-journey" rel="nofollow">launching earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>Big changes include new "vivid and beautiful graphics", as well as the inclusion of over 40 DLC packs released for the original game, although certain licensed content (probably referring to the outfits themed around Japanese anime&nbsp;<em>Star Driver</em>) aren't included.</p>

<p>You'll also find a new autosave function that will save your game after events or "moving around the map", as well as the chance to toggle random enemy encounters, a new Retry feature if you die in battle, and much more.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em>, which shows the work the team has done in order to update the original for modern systems, right here.</p>




<p>When the first <i>Tales of Xillia Remastered&nbsp;</i>leak happened, some suggested that the direct sequel&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia 2&nbsp;</em>may also be included as part of a package, but that's not the case. I'd imagine, though, that&nbsp;<em>Xillia 2&nbsp;</em>is on the cards if this remaster does well.</p>

<p><em>Tales of Xillia Remastered&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on October 31st. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p>Xbox has just announced the new games arriving on Game Pass in the second half of August, and it contains a couple of enormous names. We already knew that&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> was going to be a day-one release on Microsoft’s subscription service, but we’ve now learned that <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> will be joining it two days later. Along with a bunch of others.</p> <p>Added today for PC is <em>Balatro</em> publisher Playstack’s <em>Void/Breaker</em>, developed by Stubby Games. Another game launching directly onto Game Pass, this is from the same team that created 2022’s extremely good FPS puzzler <em>The Entropy Center</em>.&nbsp;<em>Void/Breaker</em> is a roguelite FPS in which you’re trapped in endless loops by an evil AI, and is all about lightning-fast action.</p> <p>Also arriving on PC is an early access build of <em>Blacksmith Master</em>, a game that’s proven to be well-liked on Steam in which you…well, you already guessed from the title. It’s a blacksmith management sim.</p>

 <p>Arriving tomorrow, August 20, on consoles and PC is <em>Goat Simulator Remastered</em>, the recent remake of the original&nbsp;<em>GTA</em>-like spoof, and <em>Persona 4 Golden</em>, the 2012 update to one of the most beloved entries in the murderous coming-of-age series. Then on August 21 there’s <em>Herdling</em>, the big-beast herding adventure <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-trailers-announcements-1851627031/36#content">first announced at Gamescom last year</a>.</p> <p>Come August 26, the big hitter arrives. Stretch your crouching muscles because it’s <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>, the anticipated remastering of the original <em>Gears of War</em> from 2006. Being published by Xbox Games Studios, it’s coming straight to Game Pass Ultimate, but in our new, strange future, it’s also being released for sale on PlayStation as well.</p> <p>Then there’s the big surprise for this month, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. While the game has developed some manner of infamy for allegedly being poorly treated by both <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569">BioWare</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-live-service-1851756169">EA</a>, and was then caught in the tiresome culture wars, it remains a solid RPG and a great piece of storytelling in a well-loved universe. It already faced the ignominy of being <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-playstation-plus-march-sonic-tmnt-1851766608">free on PS Plus just a month after it was released</a>, but perhaps makes more sense to arrive on Game Pass now that it’s six months old.</p>

 <p>Here’s the full list of releases for August, and the various tiers of Game Pass on which they appear:</p> <p>Aug 19: <em><strong>Blacksmith Master </strong></em>– PC (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 19: <em><strong>Void/Breaker</strong></em><em> –&nbsp;</em>PC&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 20:&nbsp;<em><strong>Goat Simulator Remastered</strong>&nbsp;</em>– Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Standard)</p>

 <p>Aug 20:&nbsp;<strong><em>Persona 4 Golden</em></strong> – Cloud, Console, PC (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard)</p> <p>Aug 21:&nbsp;<strong><em>Herdling</em></strong> – Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 26:&nbsp;<strong><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></strong> – Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 28:&nbsp;<strong><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>– Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p>

 <p>Then, because the universe must be balanced, a bunch of games are leaving. On August 31 you’ll no longer have:</p> <ul> <li><em>Ben 10 Power Trip&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>Borderlands 3&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>Paw Patrol Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>This War of Mine: Final Cut&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> </ul> <p>Presumably&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em> is being removed to entice you to pay for&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em> when it comes out in September.</p>
