		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/civilization-vii">Civilization VII</a> is coming at a really interesting time for the historical 4X genre, with a bunch of rivals having sprung up in the last few years, and everyone trying to explore similar concepts to better translate the passage of time and evolution of nations into video game form.</p>
<p>We got to go <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/hands-on-civilization-vii-preview-one-for-the-ages/">hands on with the opening few turns at Gamescom 2024</a>, and alongside a breakdown by Firaxis for the overarching concepts and changes, it feels like an exciting new chapter for the storied franchise. But there’s always more to ask and to find out, and we had the opportunity to sit down with Creative Director Ed Beach to dive into what’s new, different and what’s staying the same in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/civilization-7">Civ 7</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sid Meier’s Civilization VII - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><strong>TSA: So, change is very difficult for people to accept…</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed Beach:</b> We’ve noticed! Our forums are abuzz with that!</p>

<p><strong>TSA: [laughs] I mean, we’ll obviously talk about what’s different with Civ 7, but what kind of security blankets are there for people? What’s staying consistent and staying true to Civilization?</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> The number one change that seems to have thrown our community, and that we were expecting to throw our community, is that your civilization changes are you get to each age. I think the security blanket that they’re going to realise is there, is that they’re thinking “I’m starting as Egypt, and the game is asking me to switch to India.”</p>
<p>They saw that in some of our competing products, and it was very jarring, but we have a historical pathway system that’s really going to make a lot of those choices much more logical within history. So certain areas of the world, like India and China, that have their own ecosystem of dynasties that evolved over time, a lot of people are thinking there’s one India in the game, but that’s not necessarily true anymore. We are not revealing our whole lineup of civilizations, because that’s part of our marketing campaign to roll that information out, but in an area where it makes sense for us to have a representation of, say, India in all three ages, that’s very much what we might want to do.</p>
<p>So that’s not that much different to playing India before, but now its much richer, because you might have not just abilities through one slice of the game. Like all of our empires before, you’d get to play America or England and have to wait for your abilities to come online, and you’re hoping in a multiplayer game that you don’t get crushed and wiped off the map before you’re relevant – now you have this much richer portrayal of a particular historical pathway, because you’re playing through three layers and they all have bonuses.</p>
<p>I think players will realise that’s actually very cool and very much improved over what was there before. Obviously there’s going to be cases where players can unlock a strange pathway, and some players will love doing that, while players who love the historical immersion may shy away from that. And that’s fine. Everyone should play the game the way that they want. But it should cater to both those historical enthusiasts who want it to be more traditional…</p>
<p><strong>TSA: Like those who want Egypt to always be exactly how it was…</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> But even then, Egypt ended up getting entirely conquered by the Ottoman Empire later in history, and how should that be represented?</p>

<p><strong>TSA: I think another part that might not be grasped on a surface level is that it’s called Egypt in the game, but obviously Egypt now is very different from Ancient Egypt.</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> And if you look at something like Rome, Rome had influence everywhere and there’s a lot of modern empires that can say they did start with a big Roman influence, and that makes sense for me.</p>
<p>We’re launching the game with more civs than we’ve ever had before, because the more civs we have, the more of these pathways we can have, but it’s going to benefit even more as the mod community and our DLC packs start pumping even more into the game. It’s going to be really interesting all the ways you can navigate your way through history.</p>
<p><strong>TSA:&nbsp;</strong><strong>You alluded to your competitors, the rivals to your crown let’s say, and it’s a really interesting time for the historical 4X genre. Is it encouraging that so many minds are exploring a similar direction to yourselves? Especially as everyone has their own particular way of representing ages and evolving cultures.</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> I feel like there was a catalyst to this, and maybe it’s slightly egotistical on our part to think that Civ 6 was a driver, but it was very successful, and obviously we sold lots of units, we have a big install base, and that’s the kind of situation where anyone with business sense is thinking “We can grab a piece of that pie and it’ll be very profitable for us too!”</p>
<p>There’s tons of activity in this space, which is good for everybody.</p>
<p>As we developed this product, we didn’t know we were going to have four competitors when we started. We had actually gotten very used to, the first ten years I was at Firaxis, we didn’t have competitors and they stayed away from the historical space. Like “We don’t want to take Civ on, so we’ll go and do Sci Fi or Fantasy”, and they did some very good jobs at those other genres, but the competition directly in the historical space was limited.</p>
<p>What we saw was one by one those competitors were popping up, and we were like, how much attention do we have to pay to them? We knew we wanted to break the game up into chapters to make it more manageable for players to get through to the end, because we had data on how many people bail out, and we wanted to address that problem directly.</p>
<p>We ended up being distracted a couple times by some of these competitors, but we ended up in the final analysis was that we stick to our plan. […]
</p><p>You can tell that we’re all poking at the same problems, because the name Ages is in our game as it is in Millennia, Influence is in our game and i think in Humankind. So we’re coming up with the same solutions, we’re trying to name things the same, even if they’re slightly different things, so we’re all poking at this idea of what makes a great historical strategy game and how to structure it. We had the advantage that Civ 6 was out there and still performing well, so we didn’t have to rush, so we could iterate on things quite a bit, and I think that’s been helpful.</p>

<p><strong>TSA: The Civ 6 expansion Rise and Fall tried to deal with this kind of, well it’s in the name really, rise and fall of empires. What can you say about how those ideas morphed into the Ages here.</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> It’s a really good observation, because the thing we wanted to do with Rise and Fall was to not represent human progress as this ever-ascending ramp where players or empires are never being challenged and they can just keep on getting bigger and stronger. That’s traditionally what a Civ game has been, but it’s not really the way history works.</p>
<p>It’s much more, you grow so big that you don’t know how to control your empire anymore, outside invaders see that you have weaknesses and poke it, and so there’s some kind of crisis. You typically end up having to retrench, regroup and push forward again, but you’ve taken a step back.</p>
<p>Rise and Fall we experimented with that. We had the loyalty system where if you went into a dark age, you would lose cities at the edge of your empire. We’re taking inspiration from that idea, we have a Crisis system so there is a challenge at the end of each Age, and a natural reason why your empire starts to fall apart.</p>
<p>We have historians on the team and they’ve looked at when those time periods across the world, where there was a Dark Age everywhere, not just in the Roman Empire, but in the East where none of the big empires were surviving. So we’ve tried to slot the times that the crisis happens in, so there’s a historical story to tell there.</p>
<p>But there were a few things about Rise and Fall that we didn’t like, and you’ll notice in this game that a couple things have disappeared from Civ 6. The points system to get just enough Era score to evaluate if you go into a dark age or a golden age, and the tech and civic boosts –&nbsp;those systems did some good things, but they made players chase mini objectives almost to a level that was distracting from their strategic vision as an empire, so we’ve backed off that.</p>
<p>There’s still quests in the game – advisors give you quests, you can get quests from the narrative system –&nbsp;and there’s always the need to explore the map more to find discoveries, so we think we have enough short term objectives in the game without making the players keep track of all these little scores.</p>
<p><strong>TSA: I was also going to ask diplomacy and how some games will present all the numbers and how stats add up, other games will try to obscure it a little bit, and these mini objectives</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> You can just get an overload of too many little numbers and trackers and progress bars to fill up, and I don’t think that’s a fun game.</p>

<p><strong>TSA: I’ve mentioned it now, so let’s talk about diplomacy and if there any key ways that you’re shifting this side of the game?</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> I didn’t feel quite as passionately about it as some members of my design team, but i agreed with them: the one thing they felt was unrealistic about Civ games all the way back to Civ 4… 3 actually, was the deal table. If you’re a great leader, you’re Augustus Caesar, you shouldn’t be haggling over the price of figs when you’re trying to trade them to your neighbour! That just didn’t feel right.</p>
<p>The diplomacy systems in Civ games had this weird incentive where the more time you spent going around to different leaders and trying to negotiate those deals with them? That was the best way to play, because you could go, “Oh this guy’s a little friendlier to me, he’ll give me a better deal. I just got this new commodity, let me get as much gold as possible.” There was this weird min-maxing game that A) took a lot of time, and B) didn’t feel like something a world leader should be doing.</p>
<p><strong>TSA: It’s more like a space trading game where you go from one port to another.</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> Exactly, and then the third thing about it was you were trading your luxury goods to other leaders through that interface, but we also had a trade route system and you establish routes to other players, but there was no connection between them. We always wanted them to be unified.</p>
<p>We have unified those, and when you set up a trade route to another player, that’s how you get their resources. There’s no deal table where you’re haggling over prices, now your merchants go out and bring commodities back. Everything you buy from another player, they’re going to earn gold from, and you get one free trade route with everybody, but if you want more trade routes with somebody, you need to be friendly enough that they’ll allow it. So diplomacy and trade are very tightly tied together, but it’s a brand new system that unifies a lot of what we felt needed to be unified.</p>

<p><strong>TSA: Finally, you’re keeping the unpacked city style from Civ 6, which was so visually arresting, but with the new transitions between civs, how are you evolving it for Civ 7?</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> There’s three big changes. The first one is that each urban tile is not assigned a specialty –&nbsp;it’s not a science district or a culture district –&nbsp;you get two building slots there and you can put whatever building you want there.</p>
<p>There second thing is cities have to grow out from the centre. It used to be that you had the centre of your city here, and your first district could be way out on the edge of the [city’s area], and players were like, “That doesn’t feel like the same city, that feels like little suburbs.” So now your city has to grow out from the centre.</p>
<p>The third thing is that as you go from one age to the next, the city buildings from the previous age lose their power. The new buildings from the new age are much, much better, and you want them to be in the choice spots where you put the earlier buildings for adjacency bonuses and things like that, so we have this system where you over-build. In the presentation we talked about how London was built in layers, and that’s very interesting because now the same part of the map you’ll get to figure out how you want to lay out your cities on it multiple times through a game, and that gives you all sorts of opportunities for this building gameplay to evolve and improve as you’re working on it.</p>
<p><strong>TSA: Extending from that, is there anything where you visually merge the civilisations together?</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> If you play as Egypt and you get the special necropolis mortuary complex built on a tile, that’s permanent, and so even if you move on from Egypt to another empire, that Egyptian quarter remains. Think about cities that have, you know, Latin quarters, Jewish quarters and that was an inspiration to have these old quarters that are vestiges of the empire that used to live there, and as you go through the ages, your whole lineage starts to reveal itself to you on the map.</p>

			<p>The developers at GSC Game World are in the final stretch of development for STALKER 2 after going through lots of hardships. At Gamescom 2024, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gamescom-qa-gsc-game-world-talks-about-the-final-rush-to-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> PR Specialist Zakhar Bocharov and Lead Producer Slava Lukyanenka to discuss what's left before launch, and the optimization of the Xbox Series S version (with the help of the Xbox team) stood out.</p>
<p><em><strong>Slava Lukyanenka:&nbsp;</strong>Well, our team is mature enough to take care of many aspects of the game themselves. Yet, the Xbox team knows best how the Xbox performs and what's better to do in a case like we need to go deeper into the optimization. The Microsoft team visited several times, providing essential expertise on what else we could do that we didn't think of. It's not over yet. Aside from Xbox Series X, we're still working on optimization for Xbox Series S. It's going well, and the Xbox team is contributing a lot.</em></p>
<p><em>On Xbox Series X, we have two available modes. One of them is Performance Mode, where STALKER 2 is running with 60 FPS and slightly different graphics than in Quality Mode, which looks super awesome with all the reflections and high-resolution textures, but runs at 30 FPS. We are trying to achieve a similar experience on Xbox Series S by combining these two approaches. So far, we have it at 25ish FPS on the Xbox Series S, but we still have space to optimize.</em></p>
<p>I also asked about the Game Pass partnership with Xbox, and GSC Game World expressed gratitude for all the support they've received from Microsoft during the making of STALKER 2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong>&nbsp;That's right. That's a Game Pass partnership and Microsoft is not pushing us in any way to release on any date or just put the content out of the game or something like that. Actually, Microsoft, they are super supportive of us. We didn't exactly ask someone from Microsoft to be our friends, but Sarah Bond is obviously a friend of the game. Phil (Spencer) was super supportive, all the teams from Microsoft were. They didn't put any additional pressure on us.</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is out November 20 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, available on Game Pass from day one. Based on info from the Epic v. Apple legal fight, the game should be a console <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-a-3-month-console-exclusive-microsoft-will-increase-revenue-share-for-xbox-games-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive</a> for Microsoft's platform for three months, although this was never acknowledged by either Microsoft or GSC Game World.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/visions-of-mana-studio-hit-by-huge-layoffs-on-release-day-per-report.968259/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-layoffs-netease-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has alleged that&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>developer Ouka Studio has been hit by layoffs on the very day the game launched across the world.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-30/tencent-netease-rethink-japan-approach-as-game-strategy-stalls" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bloomberg's Takashi Mochizuki</a> (who, in turn, cites the old chestnut "people familiar with the matter"), Ouka's owner NetEase has "cut all but a handful of jobs" at its Tokyo studio, with a view to eventually closing the company completely.</p>
<p>Mochizuki goes on to say that NetEase's plan is to "shut the Shibuya outfit" (i.e. the Tokyo branch), with a handful of employees remaining to oversee the rollout of Ouka's final games before it "winds down".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-layoffs-report-creatures.jpg?itok=9HC3IuSP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-layoffs-report-creatures.jpg?itok=jblHS9oF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Visions of Mana</em>'s developer has reportedly been hit by huge layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>What makes this layoff report particularly cruel is the timing.&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-release-date">launched just yesterday</a>, earning itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/visions-of-mana-review-exceptional-venture">a very favorable review</a> from our very own Brittany, so the studio behind the game suffering layoffs feels especially unfortunate in light of that.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Ouka's owner NetEase hasn't officially confirmed these layoffs; in a statement given to Mochizuki and Bloomberg, NetEase said it had "nothing to announce" with regards to Ouka's closure.</p>
<h2>Ouka's layoffs are reportedly part of a wider trend</h2>
<p>Per the Bloomberg report, the layoffs at Ouka are part of a wider trend concerning Chinese companies pulling out of Japanese investments amidst a resurgence of the Chinese game market and a lack of success in Japan.</p>
<p>Mochizuki says that both NetEase and gaming giant Tencent are reconsidering investments in Japanese studios. The report gives the example of&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-canceled-west-japan-service-ending">recently canceled in the West</a>; Tencent was to develop and publish the mobile version of that game.</p>

<p>Zhu says that Tencent and NetEase may be following a wider industry trend of scaling back headcounts or investments, and also that "anecdotally", Japanese studios' "desire to tightly control" their IP has been a "source of friction" between Japanese outfits and Chinese companies.</p>
<p>The Chinese gaming market has also opened up in recent months. GameScience's&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-sales-10-million">topped 10 million sales</a> just a few days out from release, and HoYoverse games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a>&nbsp;</em>have also seen success.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-boss.jpg?itok=k3gcAklc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-boss.jpg?itok=J7yGO_I8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is spearheading a Chinese gaming industry resurgence.</figcaption></figure><p>In recent years, NetEase has made big investments in Japanese industry legends like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netease-launches-new-studio-pincool-led-by-former-dragon-quest-producer-will-work-on"><em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>producer Ryutaro Ichimura</a>, former Capcom exec <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-producer-founds-new-studio-at-netease">Hiroyuki Kobayashi</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Yakuza&nbsp;</em>creator <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-creators-team-up-to-create-nagoshi-studios">Toshihiro Nagoshi</a>.</p>
<p>Whether this reported shift in the company's strategy will make a difference to these investments remains to be seen, but NetEase told Bloomberg it's always "making necessary adjustments to reflect market conditions". Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-30/tencent-netease-rethink-japan-approach-as-game-strategy-stalls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a> via Bloomberg, NetEase could potentially shut down Visions of Mana developer Ouka Studios.</p>



<p>The report says that NetEase possibly “intends to shut the Shibuya outfit.” It adds that NetEase “has cut all but a handful of jobs at its Ouka studio in Tokyo.” </p>



<p>Bloomberg later elaborated <a href="https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1829342570042048776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a> that NetEase has issued these staff reductions “since this spring at least.”</p>



<p>Both Tencent and NetEase are also reportedly reconsidering a variety of investments in Japanese studios. This may be because “years of spending yielded few hit games.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: Tencent and NetEase are rethinking their Japan investment as Japanese developers failed to produce hit games. NetEase cut many staff at Ouka Studio with a plan to shut it down while Tencent backed off from funding commitments on several projects.<a href="https://t.co/89nXAwVFYa">https://t.co/89nXAwVFYa</a></p>— Takashi Mochizuki (@6d6f636869) <a href="https://twitter.com/6d6f636869/status/1829320388817686780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>At this time, neither Tencent nor NetEase issued official confirmation that there are plans to shut down Ouka Studios. However, the new report does include statements from each company.</p>



<p>Tencent said that it “remains committed to its partner studios and developing its business in Japan.” NetEase stated that it has “nothing to announce” regarding Ouka Studios closing down. </p>



<p>However, a NetEase spokesperson said that “we craft our strategy based on our goal of providing better gaming experiences to local and global players.” They added that NetEase is “always making necessary adjustments to reflect market conditions.”</p>



<p>Ouka Studios only just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-launches-on-august-29-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released Visions of Mana</a> a day ago, and it already has solid critic reviews on Metacritic. Visions of Mana is available now on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

    <p><span>The Wardance Ceremony, new challenge, and new characters.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.5 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [29 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Flying Aureus Shot to Lupine Rue,” will launch on September 10, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [171 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-911217"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update introduces the eagerly awaited Wardance ceremony, alongside powerful new adversaries. As the brand-new trailblazing journey on the Xianzhou Luofu continues to unfold, players will have the opportunity to recruit new five-star characters, including Feixiao, the General of the Xianzhou Yaoqing, who will also feature in the Echo of War, as well as Lingsha, the new Cauldron Master from the Alchemy Commission of the Xianzhou Luofu, and Moze, the reticent and silent Shadow Guard of the Yaoqing, who has already played and will continue to be an important role in the upcoming adventure.</p><p>Following a recent prison break in The Shackling Prison, the Cloud Knights have swiftly arrived to initiate rescue efforts. General Feixiao will personally lead her troops to capture the escaped Borisin criminals and secure the surface of the Luofu. Meanwhile, General Jing Yuan will investigate the incident, while General Huaiyan will oversee the Luofu’s Six Commissions. As long-buried secrets within the Shackling Prison are revealed, this trailblazing silkpunk saga will race toward its climax. Meanwhile, the Luminary Wardance is set to ignite in Version 2.5, attracting numerous participants, including familiar faces like Luka, who is visiting Xianzhou Luofu for the first time. Trailblazers who engage in activities related to the Luminary Wardance can earn the charming pet “Tuskpir” as a companion. Alongside the Wardance ceremony, the Xianzhou will host other exciting events, inviting Trailblazers to dive in and explore!</p><p>As the excitement of the Wardance unfolds, a formidable new ally emerges on the battlefield. Feixiao, the Merlin’s Claw of Xianzhou Yaoqing and one of the Seven Arbiter-Generals will enter the battlefield as a 5-star playable character. Renowned for her unrestrained and straightforward nature, Feixiao is a master of all forms of martial arts, having refined herself into the ultimate weapon. Revered by both Xianzhou soldiers and civilians, she is celebrated as “The Vanquishing General.” During battles, General Feixiao fights across the cosmos and works closely with her allies. After her teammates strike an enemy, she follows up with a powerful attack. She accumulates “Flying Aureus” with every few attacks. This Spiritus, granted by the Reignbow, fuels her power and duty. Not only does Feixiao gather “Flying Aureus” from her attacks, but she also benefits from her teammates’ strikes. When she uses her Ultimate, Feixiao consumes the Flying Aureus and carries out a series of powerful attacks on the enemy with her gunblades or battle-axe. These strikes reduce the enemy’s Toughness while bypassing their Weakness Type and enhance her Weakness Break Efficiency. In Version 2.5, Feixiao will also introduce a new trial for Trailblazers: “Echo of War: Inner Beast’s Battlefield.” In this trial, players will face a shadow of Feixiao and the apparition of Flying Aureus—Ecliptic Inner Beast.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_911218"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Another highly anticipated five-star character from the Xianzhou allies, Lingsha, will join the playable roster. With her keen sense of smell, she diagnoses illnesses and uses incense to soothe others. Skilled in managing complex social interactions, she maintains a calm and serene demeanor even when she’s agitated inside. In battle, Lingsha stands out with her ability to summon Fuyuan, an incense beast she created. Fuyuan assists in combat, but dissipates after a few actions. Lingsha can use her Skill to extend Fuyuan’s actions, allowing it to perform follow-up attacks. This attack not only deals damage to all enemies, but also dispels one debuff from allies and restores their HP as well. When Lingsha uses her Ultimate, she deals damage to all enemies, heals all allies, and inflicts the Befog state, which increases Break damage on enemies. As a reliable Cauldron Master, Lingsha ensures her allies are well-protected.</p><p>In addition, Moze, the 4-star Shadow Guard of the Yaoqing will make his debut as a playable character. Known for his reticence- and solitary nature, Moze operates in secrecy, rarely revealing himself. In battle, he marks a single enemy as the Prey and then enters the Departed state while the Prey is on the field. After allies attack the Prey, Moze deals additional damage. Additionally, Moze’s Ultimate deals DMG to enemies and launches a follow-up attack. With his elusive tactics and deadly precision, Moze brings a new level of strategy and intrigue to the battlefield.</p><p>A special Warp Event will kick off in the first half of Version 2.5, featuring the return of limited 5-star characters Robin, Black Swan, and Kafka. The Warp count for the guaranteed 5-star will be shared across rerun and current limited banners. Switching banners won’t reset the guarantee count. In the second half of Version 2.5, the limited 5-star character Topaz will have a rerun.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,838 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [21,120 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/creation-of-parallax-occlusion-mapping-pom-in-unreal-engine-5<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s still a problem understanding such a complex approach in materials like POM and we’ll try to deeply understand how to use POM and as short as possible. Also we’re going to explain what each node does and why we use each one of them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s start with what materials are in Unreal Engine? </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Materials in Unreal Engine define the surface properties of the objects in your scene. A material is something like a "paint" that defines the visual appearance of an object.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now what is POM? </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM) is a complex texture-based approach to add more details for meshes.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> With POM we get more depth visually than we could get just with Normal maps, because we get three-dimensional shapes without adding any additional vertices to meshes. POM uses Ray Tracing to find the correct offsets at each point.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So why is Parallax Occlusion better than making subdivision to meshes?</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s faster than modeling since you can put it on any mesh;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Easy to set - you can do it with all textures if they’re correctly made.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there are also some things that you should remember:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">POM adds texel height data, separately from the texel normal data;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each fragment of data is ray-traced on the GPU to determine the correct visual result, resolving all of the above limitations. This gives an exceedingly realistic result under many viewing conditions, at the expense of substantial GPU time;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We still use the same textures that we would. The difference is we also add a displacement map and a few more nodes to our material;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">POM doesn’t really work with overlapping UV and can look bad if you have wrong UV;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On low scalability POM won’t be visible at all. You should have AT LEAST medium scalability;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">POM is a complex function and we need a lot of nodes that should be also correctly configured, otherwise we’re going to get artifacts;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">POV doesn’t work very well with shadow maps, so PROBABLY you have to untick “cast shadow map” for a mesh to which you have given a POV material.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So let’s create a POM material. First, let’s create a material. Press the right mouse button in “Content browser” and pick “Material”, now you should name it. Since it will be a master material, let’s name it M_POMbricks or MM_POMbricks. The difference between “Master Material” and “Material Instance” is like a parent to a child in programming. If a parent has some values a child will get them too, but a change of values of a child won’t affect a parent. The connection between them is called a “Parameter”.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ve got now a completely clean material and we need textures. We can make our own textures, but our main subject is POM , so let’s press the right mouse button on “Content Browser” and pick “Add Quixel Content”. Find a brick material. In my case it’s “BRICK WALL”. Download it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After downloading it, open the material that we created before by pressing the left mouse button twice. To have these textures, you have to select the textures of “BRICK WALL” and move it to the Material Graph. Then you should connect them all like in the screenshot below.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The texture with usual colors without any information about light (Albedo) belongs to “Base color”, it gives colors that we need to see in a brick wall in this case. The blue texture belongs to “Normal”, because it gives depth. But the yellow texture that we call “ARD” texture differs from others, because it has a few textures inside in different channels, so we’re going to use some of them. ARD = Ambient occlusion + Roughness + Displacement, that’s why we connected like what’s on the screenshot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now let’s create more nodes so we could finally have a POM effect. To create a node press the right mouse button inside of the material graph and write the name of your node. Or press the palette and find the nodes that you need. In the screenshot there are names for each node.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Constant - is a number that we’re going to need to give a numerical value. It’s a little green node. Press the right mouse button and type “Constant”, then press the left mouse button on it. Names of other nodes you can see in screenshots below.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s continue. You see that constante nodes have different names in the screenshots? It’s because they’re not just nodes, they’re Parameters. Now you have to press the right mouse button on them and press “Convert to Parameter”, then you name them like in these screenshots.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now let’s explore each node. What does each of them mean?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">1)Channel (it’s called so because we named it like that after making this node a Parameter) - is a four-vector constant, to create it you need to write not just “constant”, but “constant4vector”. As we wrote before, this node controls which channel is going to be provided to ParallaxOcclusionMapping. If you remember what we wrote about ARD, then you can guess that we’re going to use “B” channel, which means we have to make it completely Blue, so it should be 0,0,1,0. Also we used the node “Append”, because ParallaxOcclusionMapping expects us to give value of constant4vector (that’s why there’s written V4) and since four-vectors constantes have Alpha channel we give the color (B channel) and alpha.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">2)Texture Coordinate controls scaling of the texture. Create another node and connect it to “Multiply” (this node multiplies two connected values), create another node and connect it too. Now you can scale it. We need texture coordinates and the scale depends on the scene you’re creating.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">3)Height Ratio (Parameter of one-vector constant) - controls values of our height map, in other words controls how much POM this material will be. We will write 0.3 as a default value and we’re going to change it in a material instance that we’re going to create, because everything depends on the textures that we use.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">4)Min Steps and Max Steps - Values for making POV smooth. The more steps we have, the more smooth it becomes, it’s like the modifier “Subdivision” in Blender.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As you see we connected ParallaxOcclusionMapping to the textures, but we also connected “Pixel Depth Offset” of both nodes. We did it because otherwise we won’t have any POV effect. But again as I mentioned before, since we use Pixel Depth Offset, most likely you should turn off “Cast shadow” on actors on which we’re going to use our materials since they don’t work together very well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We now understand why we created such nodes for the POM effect. Keep in mind that Material Instances with Parameters help us in making materials and this case shouldn’t be an exception either.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end of this article it would be great to add a few more things that could help you:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Texture resolution affects memory and bandwidth. They will cause lag and freezes. How you handle resolution depends totally on you;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you get the warning “The current material has compilation errors, so it will not render currently in feature level SM6”, then you probably forgot to make the node Constant4Vector (Heightmap on images in this article) a Parameter;</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Written by Alexander Mukhitdinov, game developer of Skyhell, mentor and co-founder of Cube of Skill.

Under the stewardship of CEO Wade Rosen, the company </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/atari-relaunches-infogrames-immediately-buys-totally-reliable-delivery-service">revived the Infogrames label earlier this year</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to publish a "core portfolio of IP associated with the Atari brand," while also developing new collections and sequels.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer about Atari's publishing drive at Gamescom 2024, Rosen said the company hopes to position Infogrames as a "preservationist" publisher that can acquire franchises from developers who simply don't have the resources or bandwidth to support them anymore.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Infogrames is pretty unique in that we had a lot of opportunities coming to us of games or IPs that people wanted to sell because they felt like they shouldn't just disappear," says Rosen, noting that's precisely why it acquired Totally Reliable Delivery Service, Awesomenauts, and Surgeon Simulator.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As those deals started to stack up, Atari resurrected Infogrames to provide a home for a growing number of franchises that didn't neatly fit into other business segments. "We felt like Infogrames was the right place to have those series and carry them on. So, for Infogrames it's really about games that developers and publishers have moved on from–that probably still have some life in them," continues Rosen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The goal is to then [engage in] preservationist publishing. What that means for each title will be variable. Sometimes it's just making it accessible on more platforms. Sometimes it's remastering. Sometimes it's sequels."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Atari boss says the company must acknowledge its limitations in a 'tough' market">Atari boss says the company must acknowledge its limitations in a 'tough' market</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a fascinating model in that Atari isn't really interested in speaking with developers about new projects. Rosen explains those deals wouldn't give the company a "competitive advantage." and notes that corner of the market is already dominated by major players like Devolver Digital and Annapurna. Atari has no intention of stepping on their toes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[We're really interested in] IPs that have been out for a long time, that people have moved on from. The people who want to focus on their future projects and want to raise capital to make new games and focus on those–that's really what Infogrames is looking for," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Why we don't typically look at unreleased projects is I don't think we're more qualified to do that than anyone else. I don't think we have a competitive advantage. I don't think we're the best in the world at it. Best in class at it. So, really, why would we do it?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen says Atari is targeting "straightforward" and "clean" IP acquisitions. He feels it's tough to work on a franchise if there are lots of "complications" and red tape. In the long-term, pursuing those deals should help the company mitigate risk. That's vital for Rosen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He acknowledges publishing is a "tough business" fraught with uncertainty, and that's why you have to carve out a visible niche. "There's not a really strong moat around this space, so competition can increase rapidly and decrease rapidly. The ones that survive have a strong brand," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think that's the only way indie [publishing] works. You have to become a publisher that transcends those games, and than have the discipline to choose games that support that [brand]. That probably means saying 'no' to games that could be commercially viable, but might be confusing to your target demographic. That's why we started Infogrames."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moving forward, Atari is "definitely" in the market for more IPs and it's evident Rosen has a personal shopping list. He explains Atari's rich history in arcades means it's always interested in nabbing vintage morsels from that era.

Wall jumping is perhaps the most notable and exciting additions, and players can do so without consuming stamina by pushing their input direction away from the wall.</p><p>In addition, four teleporters have changed locations and will now remain closed for the first 10 minutes, two bounce pads have been added next to sideland walkers at the cultural center and courthouse, and several buildings have changed size to make their rooftops out of bounds. The full patch notes are available below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Deadlock is a six versus six, third person hero shooter with a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) twist, taking inspiration from genre classics such as Leage of Legends, Dota 2, and Heroes of the Storm.</p><p>Valve seemingly looked to keep it a secret for weeks despite data showing that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deadlock-valves-new-hero-shooter-is-quietly-amassing-thousands-of-playtesters">thousands of players were already online</a>, but has now acknowledged its existence proper with an official Steam page.

This was released as the last 2D Final Fantasy game in 1994, before Final Fantasy 7 arrived on the original PlayStation and redefined the franchise in 1997.</p><p>"In terms of the Final Fantasy that I think is the ‘most complete'; I believe Final Fantasy 6 comes close, and does stand out above the other Final Fantasies, especially because it was the last Final Fantasy to use pixel art in all of its visual expression," Sakaguchi said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Screens - Final Fantasy VI (PC)</h3></div></output><p>Final Fantasy 6 is certainly among the most beloved in the franchise and introduced the now synonymous steampunk elements for the first time, moving away from the strictly medieval fantasy setting of previous games.</p><p>Though it's been ported to myriad consoles and devices already, fans are calling for Square Enix to release a full remake in the same vein as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-review">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Rebirth</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-three-part-trilogy">the incoming third and final game</a>.</p><p>Final Fantasy 6 director Yoshinori Kitase didn't offer much hope when asked, however, as he said a remake akin to that of Final Fantasy 7's could take around 20 years to complete. Final Fantasy 6 features so much content that he estimated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-6-remake-would-take-about-20-years-to-make-original-director-says">it would take twice the length of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lots-of-square-enix-staff-want-to-remake-final-fantasy-6">Kitase previously commented on the popularity of the idea though</a>, even saying many developers within Square Enix are eager to work on a remake of Final Fantasy 6. The project would be very difficult, however, and Kitase said he couldn't think about it at least until the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy has wrapped.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-fsr2-xbox-series-s-challenged/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Black Myth Wukong on PlayStation 5 uses AMD FSR 2 over TSR, and this is likely due to a few factors, including the usage of the very first version of Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>The tech experts at Digital Foundry recently talked about Game Science's decision to go with AMD's upscaler for the PlayStation 5 version of the game, highlighting how this could be a simple leftover from when the game was being developed in Unreal Engine 4. Frame generation, which is used in Performance mode, may also have played a part in the decision. The most likely reason, however, could be that Black Myth Wukong uses the very first version of Unreal Engine 5. In this version of the game development engine, TSR is more demanding than in the latest, and it lacks specific optimizations for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Still, console users don't seem to be missing out much, as, while TSR looks better than FSR 2 in some scenarios, producing less ghosting and flickering, it still isn't particularly good.</p>
<p><iframe title="Black Myth: Wukong - Why Did The Devs Choose FSR2 Over TSR Upscaling?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xDdWyrgo0eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong has yet to be released on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, as Game Science is reportedly dealing with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-memory-leak/">critical tech issues</a>, but Digital Foundry seems to be certain how the Xbox Series S isn't causing the delay. The game is not CPU bound, and Unreal Engine 5 is not heavy on VRAM, which should make it easy for the developers to scale things down and have the game run decently on the system, although features like Lumen and other visual settings, including resolution, will obviously get toned down. A subpar experience, however, could be caused by the team's inexperience with console development, as the PlayStation 5 version highlighted. As long as weird optimization choices aren't made, such as using frame generation in Performance mode to go from 30 to 60 FPS, everything should be fine. There's also the chance that Game Science could go with different choices, resulting in a slightly better experience than the one currently offered on PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/the-asus-rog-ally-runs-windows-eats-battery-and-needs-time-to-cook/3/">first ROG Ally from Asus</a>, a $700 Windows-based handheld gaming PC, performed better than the Steam Deck, but it did so through notable compromises on battery life. The hardware also had a first-gen feel and software jank from both Asus’ own wraparound gaming app and Windows itself. The Ally asked an awkward question: “Do you want to pay nearly 50 percent more than you'd pay for a Steam Deck for a slightly faster but far more awkward handheld?”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/gaming-handhelds/rog-ally/rog-ally-x-2024/">ROG Ally X</a> makes that question more interesting and less obvious to answer. Yes, it’s still a handheld that’s trying to hide Windows annoyances, and it's still missing trackpads, without which some PC games just feel bad. And (review spoiler) it still eats a charge faster than the Steam Deck OLED on less demanding games.</p>
<p>But the improvements Asus made to this X sequel are notable, and its new performance stats make it more viable for those who want to play more demanding games on a rather crisp screen. At $800, or $100 more than the original ROG Ally with no extras thrown in, you have to really, <em>really</em> want the best possible handheld gaming experience while still tolerating Windows' awkward fit.</p>

<p>The ROG Ally X is essentially the ROG Ally with a bigger battery packed into a shell that is impressively not much bigger or heavier, more storage and RAM, and two USB-C ports instead of one USB-C and one weird mobile port that nobody could use. Asus reshaped the device and changed the face-button feel, and it all feels noticeably better, especially now that gaming sessions can last longer. The company also moved the microSD card slot so that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader">your cards don’t melt</a>, which is nice.</p>
<p>There’s a bit more to each of those changes that we’ll get into, but that’s the short version. Small spec bumps wouldn’t have changed much about the ROG Ally experience, but the changes Asus made for the X version do move the needle. Having more RAM available has a sizable impact on the frame performance of demanding games, and you can see that in our benchmarks.</p>
<p>We kept the LCD Steam Deck in our benchmarks because its chip has roughly the same performance as its OLED upgrade. But it’s really the Ally-to-Ally-X comparisons that are interesting; the Steam Deck has been fading back from AAA viability. If you want the Ally X to run modern, GPU-intensive games as fast as is feasible for a battery-powered device, it can now do that a lot better—for longer—and feel a bit better while you do.</p>
<p>The Rog Ally X has better answered the question “why not just buy a gaming laptop?” than its predecessor. At $800 and up, you might still ask how much portability is worth to you. But the Ally X is not as much of a niche (Windows-based handheld) inside a niche (moderately higher-end&nbsp;handhelds).                                                                        </p>
                                                                                
<figure><figcaption><p>I normally would not use this kind of handout image with descriptive text embedded, but Asus is right: the ROG Ally X is indeed way more comfortable (just maybe not all-caps).</p><p>Asus</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>How it feels using the Rog Ally X</h2>
<p>My testing of the Rog Ally X consisted of benchmarks, battery testing, and playing some games on the couch. Specifically: <i><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-will-mine-hours-of-auto-shooting-joy-from-your-life/">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a></i> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/tactical-breach-wizards-weaves-engaging-tactics-with-lively-dialogue/"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a> on the devices lowest-power setting (“Silent”), <i><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/deathloop-review-a-dishonorable-bethesda-discharge/">Deathloop</a></i> on its medium-power setting (“Performance”), and <i><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-ground-me-into-dust-which-is-why-i-recommend-it/">Shadow of the Erdtree</a></i> on its all-out “Turbo” mode.</p>
<p>All four of those games worked mostly fine, but <i>DRG: Survivor</i> pushed the boundaries of Silent mode a bit when its levels got crowded with enemies and projectiles. Most games could automatically figure out a decent settings scheme for the Ally X. If a game offers AMD’s FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution) upscaling, you should at least try it; it’s usually a big boon to a game running on this handheld.</p>
<p>Overall, the ROG Ally X was a device I didn't notice when I was using it, which is the best recommendation I can make. Perhaps I noticed that the 1080p screen was brighter, closer to the glass, and sharper than the LCD (original) Steam Deck. At handheld distance, the difference between 800p and 1080p isn't huge to me, but the difference between LCD and OLED is more so. (Of course, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">an OLED version of the Steam Deck</a> was released late last year.)</p>

            <p>Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus - the gorgeous 2.5D platformer with Metroidvania elements based on Japanese folklore - released earlier this year across PC and consoles. However, soon after its debut, its publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-confirms-restructuring-amid-reports-all-staff-have-been-laid-off">Humble Games faced "restructuring" at the company</a>, resulting in layoffs. (Eurogamer and Humble Games share a parent compamy, IGN Entertainment.)</p>
<p>This had a knock-on effect for the game's developer Squid Shock. Soon after news broke about layoffs at Humble, Squid Shock assured its community it remained committed to Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, but the changes at the publisher could result in delays for updates, particularly on consoles.</p>
<p>"We are now in a difficult situation when it comes to updating the console ports, as both Porting and QA Support was tied into our deal with Humble," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bo-path-of-the-teal-lotus-console-updates-may-be-delayed-due-to-humble-layoffs-developer-warns">Squid Shock wrote in July</a>. "We are actively pursuing all available avenues to allow us to roll out updates to console versions, but we regret to say this may take some time to put in place."</p>

</figure>
<p>Thankfully, a solution has evidently been found. Last night, Squid Shock shared an update on social media platform X, calling the recent ordeal a "long and arduous journey".</p>
<p>"The challenges we've faced over the past month were beyond anything we could have anticipated, leading to disruptions in our porting, QA, and console submission pipelines," it wrote. "But today, we're relieved and excited to tell you that we've overcome those obstacles. We're thrilled to announce that the patches for Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus on Xbox X/S, PS5, and Nintendo Switch are now live!"</p>
<p>These patches will address a number of general issues across Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus' console versions, including bug fixes and gameplay improvements.</p>
<p>"It's a testament to the dedication and resilience of our team that, despite everything, we've been able to bring these crucial updates to you," Squid Shock continued. "Our greatest hope is that these improvements bring you closer to the experience we always intended for Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus. We want you to know how much your support means to us, and we're overjoyed to be able to continue this journey together.</p>
<p>"Thank you for standing by us through thick and thin."</p> <div>

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-final-release-before-restructuring-has-launched-a-patreon-in-these-uncertain-times">Squid Shock set up a Patreon to support Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus</a> "in these uncertain times". At this time, Squid Shock said whilst it did not fault the team's work, the changes at Humble "have meant we have missed out on critical post-launch support, which may put our studio's future at risk".</p>
<p>As for Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, I was rather enamoured with it when I gave the demo a go earlier this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/what-we-played-concord-age-of-mythology-retold-star-wars-outlaws/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>And so it begins. The week after Gamescom feels like a dam-break for the games industry, and the first of this year’s big holiday releases are arriving, this time in the shape of Star Wars Outlaws. I loved my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/30/star-wars-outlaws-preview-this-is-the-open-world-game-youre-looking-for/">first hands on</a>, and with the full release it seems like the perfect time to grab a Ubisoft Premium subscription to play it. So I’ve even been playing via Luna here and there, and thus far it’s the Star Wars adventure I needed right now. Beyond that, I’m catching up on my Gamescom writing, as well as sneaking in some Overwatch 2, Concord and Age of Mythology: Retold.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has had a quieter week on the gaming front, but he’s still been playing Beyond Galaxyland for review and a couple of matches on FC24. Meanwhile, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing Star Wars Outlaws for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">our review</a> as well as Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> is stuck in a card-based loop, as he’s pretty much exclusively played MTG Arena. <strong>Nick P</strong> has&nbsp;been putting a lot of time in Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and The Casting of Frank Stone for review! As always, a little Dead by Daylight and Fortnite on the side.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> took a punt on Black Myth Wukong, but it hasn’t really landed with him, “It was getting some good buzz online and had picked up a whole lot of 5 star player reviews on the PS Store, so I thought it would be decent. Visually the game looks amazing and its interpretation and presentation of Chinese Mythology is absolutely phenomenal… unfortunately the combat totally sucks. It’s messy, imprecise, and plays more like a bad button masher. There’s no sense of contact or impact to any of the, admittedly very pretty, spells and attacks. So, after giving the game several hours, I can’t see myself going back to it. For anyone thinking about picking it up, better off giving it a miss I’d say. On the plus side, I’m keeping occupied playing Wild Bastards for review instead!”</p>


<p>Having abandoned the mean streets of Night City and New Vegas for a week, <strong>Jim</strong> has been absolutely glued to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord</a>. It’s scratching that hero shooter itch I’ve had since first peeling away from Overwatch, making subtle tweaks to the genre and presenting a cast of characters who are all really fun to play as.</p>
<p>As this week’s king of the shooty stuff, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been mostly playing the sequel duo of Destiny 2 and Space Marine 2. His first impressions? “GRRRRRRRRRRR MEN GRRRRR SHOOT STUFF GRRR”. So, there you go.</p>
<p>And rounding things out this week is&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong>, who’s also been on the Gamescom write up train, but also caught a train to go play a couple games that don’t involve trains. Whatever could they be? You’ll find out over the next couple weeks. He’s also got back to Emio: The Smiling Man for our Famicom Detective Club review.</p>
<p>What about you, what have you played?</p>

It includes a campaign that can be played co-op, a PvE Operations mode, and a PvP mode.</p><p>Let’s start with the console performance specs. On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, Quality Mode enables 4K resolution at 30 frames per second, and Performance Mode enables “up to” 60fps at 1080p resolution. Focus said that on the less powerful Xbox Series S, the Quality Mode allows for 1440p at 30fps, and Performance Mode is unavailable.</p><p>As for PC, it’s a mixed bag. DLSS2 / FSR2 is available at launch, but DLSS3 / FSR3 is “planned for post-launch.” Ray tracing / HDR is not supported. Wide-screen support won’t be available right at launch, unfortunately. Focus said it’s planned to hit the game by the end of September.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Multiplayer Modes Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Similarly, full Steam Deck support is being worked on but isn’t ready yet. That’s coming by the end of the year. There are no plans for official mod support, perhaps unsurprising given Space Marine 2 is an officially licensed Games Workshop title.</p><p>Focus confirmed that in campaign mode, progression is saved on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S while playing offline. However, for the PvE mode, called Operations, you need to be online to ensure your progress in that mode is saved. Offline progression does not carry over to your next session. Focus said players should stay online to keep all earned perks, skins, and other rewards.</p><p>Cross-platform saves are supported via the platform Prism Ray Online Services (PROS), which Focus uses for a number of its games. LAN play is not supported.</p><p>There’s full crossplay between Steam, Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S players from day one, Focus confirmed. You can play the campaign and PvE modes without any restriction, but when it comes to the PvP mode, called Eternal War, crossplay is split between PC players in one pool (Steam and EGS) and console players in another (PS5 and Xbox Series X and S). Focus said this is “for fairness and balancing purposes,” perhaps hinting at the advantage mouse and keyboard users on PC might have against controller players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In Operations mode, your squad can only include one Space Marine of each class. In Eternal War mode, however, there is a limit of two players per class and per team. “No all-Sniper teams, but you'll have plenty of strategic variety!” Focus said. There is no friendly fire in either of the three game modes, so don’t go in expecting a Helldivers 2 kind of experience.</p><h2>You can check out the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 launch FAQ in full below:</h2><p><strong>Will my progression be saved when playing offline?</strong></p><p>Be reassured, in Campaign Mode, your progression will be saved on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S while playing offline.</p><p>For Operations Mode (PvE), you will need to be online to ensure your progress in PvE is saved. Offline progression will not carry over to your next session, so make sure you're connected to keep all earned perks, skins, and other rewards.</p><p><strong>Does cross-platform save work well?</strong></p><p>➡️Yes, cross-platform saves are fully functional through the platform Prism Ray Online Services (PROS).</p><p><strong>Is PvE/PvP playable via LAN?</strong></p><p>➡️LAN play will not be supported.</p><p><strong>Will the game support crossplay, and can it be toggled off?</strong></p><p>➡️Yes, full crossplay between Steam, Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S players will be supported from Day One.</p><p>You will be able to play the Campaign and PvE modes without any restriction, but note that for fairness and balancing purposes, crossplay for the PvP mode “Eternal War” will be split between PC players in one pool (Steam &amp; EGS) and console players in the other one (PlayStation 5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S).</p><p>You will also have the option to disable crossplay functionality if you prefer to only play with those using the same platform as yours.</p><p><strong>Are there any restrictions for what classes can be played in “Operations” mode (PvE)?

And other specific details.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Quality Mode: 4K resolution at 30FPS.</li><li>Performance Mode: Up to 60FPS at 1080p.</li><li>Please note that on Xbox Series S, the Quality Mode will allow for 1440p at 30FPS and the Performance Mode will not be available.</li></ul><p><strong>What kind of communication tools will we have in-game?</strong></p><p>➡️There is a Voice Chat, a Communication Wheel with preset messages and a Text Chat (exclusive to PC versions) to facilitate your exchanges with your teammates.</p><p><strong>Does the game support the haptic features of the DualSense controller?</strong></p><p>➡️We support force triggers on the DualSense controller, but not haptic feedback at launch.</p><p><strong>What about RayTracing, DLSS, and other PC-specific technologies?</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>DLSS2 / FSR2: Available at launch.</li><li>DLSS3 / FSR3: Planned for post-launch.</li><li>RayTracing / HDR: Not supported.</li></ul><p><strong>Is the game compatible with wide screens?</strong></p><p>➡️Wide screen support is planned. While it won't be available right at launch, we're working on implementing it by the end of September.</p><p><strong>Will the game be playable on Steam Deck?</strong></p><p>➡️We are working on official Steam Deck support, but it's not ready yet. We’re currently targeting the end of the year for full Steam Deck support.</p><p><strong>Will the game have official mod support (e.g., NexusMods, mod.io)?</strong></p><p>➡️We currently have no plans for official mod support.</p><p><strong>What anti-cheat system is in place?</strong></p><p>➡️We will be using Easy Anti Cheat on PC at launch.</p><p><strong>Does the game use DRM software (ie.

Is there a “Cinematic” mode available?</strong></p><p>➡️Though there is no actual “Cinematic” mode available where all of the UI elements can be turned off at once, all of them can be individually displayed or removed through the Settings menu. Only the crosshair, enemy attacks and missions objective pop-ups will be visible.</p><p>Three options are available: ON, OFF or DYNAMIC, with “Dynamic” meaning that the UI elements you’ve chosen will appear when you need it most (for example, during combat) and disappear otherwise.</p><p><strong>Will I be able to pre-load the game, and if so, when will pre-load be available?</strong></p><p>➡️Your ability to pre-load Space Marine 2 depends on your platform of choice:</p><p>On Xbox Series X|S: Pre-loading is already available. You will download the full game as soon as you pre-order either of the game’s versions. The game will unlock on September 5 or September 9 depending on whether you purchased the Standard, Gold or Ultra Edition.</p><p>On PlayStation 5: Pre-loading will be available on September 3 at 11:00 AM UTC if you have pre-ordered the Gold or Ultra Edition, to allow you to play up to 4 days before the official release. If you have pre-ordered the Standard Edition, pre-loading will start on September 7 at 4:00 PM UTC and the game will unlock on September 9, the day of release.</p><p>On PC: Pre-loading will not be available.</p><p><strong>Do I need to have played the first Space Marine to enjoy Space Marine 2?</strong></p><p>➡️Having played Space Marine is absolutely not a requirement for playing and enjoying Space Marine 2. Both games’ storylines can be enjoyed individually, and both offer brutal third-person action gameplay.

            <p>Rumours of a PlayStation exclusivity deal for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> have arisen, causing confusion around its forthcoming Xbox release.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong released earlier this month across PC and PlayStation 5, with an Xbox version still awaiting a launch date. Back in June, developer <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11">Game Science</a> stated it was "optimising" the Xbox Series X/S version of the game "to meet our quality standards".</p>
<p>As such, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">Black Myth: Wukong was not released on Xbox</a> simultaneously with PC and PlayStation. "We apologise for the delay and aim to minimise the wait for Xbox users. We will announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards," Game Science said at that time.</p>

</figure>
<p>Reports have since circulated the reason for this ongoing delay is due to technical issues with Black Myth: Wukong's Xbox version.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, leaker <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1827840322623119683">eXtas1s</a> claimed to have spoken to Xbox developers during <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, and reported the game is "suffering from a bug known as 'memory leak', which can cause significant crashes that could compromise the performance" of Xbox consoles. As a result, eXtas1s said Black Myth: Wukong "has not passed Xbox's bug detection tests and has therefore been indefinitely delayed until they manage to optimise the game for Series X/S".</p>
<p>However, following word of technical issues with the Xbox version, other sources have said the reason for the delay is actually due to an undisclosed exclusivity deal made between the Black Myth: Wukong developer and PlayStation.</p>
<p>
The exclusivity deal has been corroborated by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/27/new-report-sheds-light-on-why-black-myth-wukong-isnt-on-xbox/">Forbes</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-not-tech-issues-according-to-source">IGN</a> sources, though the exact terms of this alleged deal remain unknown. Previous claims of tech issues causing a delay to the Xbox release are "inaccurate", IGN was told.
</p>
<p>The exclusivity agreement was subsequently disputed by journalist Jeff Grubb. Speaking as part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/YOf7LJRiDww?t=1432s">Giant Bomb's Game Mess Decides podcast</a>, Grubb said "Sony has no money marketing deal to keep [Black Myth: Wukong] off of Xbox" consoles, as per his sources.</p>
<p>"Now, is there some other thing that's happened here, where Sony showed up and said 'hey, here's some help to get this game on PlayStation', and maybe there was an exchange of value on that side of things? I guess that's possible," Grubb said. "Or maybe it's more simple than that... and it's like, well, you put the game on PlayStation if you are Game Science because there are more PlayStations in China than Xboxes." Grubb noted the majority of the game's sales and player base is from China. "Maybe Xbox doesn't even occur to [Game Science] on first blush."</p>
<p>While Grubb stated he was speculating on whether Sony did give Game Science a hand with Black Myth: Wukong's release, as "far as [he] could tell" and from what his sources have told him, "there is no exclusivity deal" in place.</p>
<p>XboxEra's Nick "Shpeshal Nick" Baker also believes this to be the case. Resharing Paul Tassi's post regarding Black Myth: Wukong's alleged exclusivity deal, <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1829299883481936230">Baker</a> wrote: "I heard there was a misunderstanding around this stuff. I heard Sony only paid to help get the port done. No exclusivity."</p>
<p>Windows Central's <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1829335350482706717">Jez Cordon</a> then replied simply: "No misunderstanding here."</p>
<p>Game Science, Sony and Microsoft have all refrained from confirming or denying these reports. </p>
<p>However, back in June, Microsoft appeared to hint there was some kind of Black Myth: Wukong exclusivity deal in place with Sony.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded">Windows Central</a> earlier this summer, a Microsoft spokesperson said: "We're excited for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> on Xbox Series X/S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. We can't comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the centre of that."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Game Science, Microsoft and Sony for further comment on Black Myth: Wukong's Xbox release and alleged PlayStation exclusivity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-year-1-roadmap-has-a-surprise-trip-to-ibiza/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>In a big pre-launch surprise, KT Racing has revealed that Ibiza will be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown">Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown</a> just three months after launch, as part of the year one content roadmap.</p>
<p><iframe title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown | Post-Launch Content Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b_6hzDhBWis?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Launching on 12th September, Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown will feature a 1:1 recreation of Hong Kong Island to race around, but the announcement that Ibiza will return to the game this year is a massive fan-pleaser – it was the setting for TDU2 13 years ago. Once again, this is a 1:1 recreation, though of the city and its outskirts and not of the full island.</p>
<p>The first two seasons will also include free Solar Pass progression tracks that can eventually unlock new cars, before Season 3 focuses in on the Clan Wars, and Season 4 brings back another fan-favourite with the Casino.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown from KT Racing:</p>

<p><strong>Season 1 – Launch content from September 12, 2024</strong></p>
<p><em>The Solar Crown competition opens its doors! Once the game is released, the most competitive players will be able to embark on a series of races and frantic challenges to climb the ranks, collect Solar Points and climb to the top of the leaderboard in the hope of becoming the next Solar King/Queen. This first season also includes 60 player levels, 50 Sharps/Streets clan progression levels and a free 25-level Solar Pass featuring various rewards, including cosmetics and an exclusive car.</em></p>
<p><strong>Season 2 – Ibiza city makes its comeback</strong></p>
<p><em>This second season marks the return of a familiar location that TDU2 fans have known for 13 years: Ibiza (Eivissa in Catalan) is back in TDUSC, more splendid than ever. Players will be able to discover the city and its outskirts, recreated at 1:1 scale in the KT Engine, offering players a different and complementary experience to Hong Kong Island, 3 months after the game’s release. The season will be accompanied by an island-exclusive clan progression with 20 new levels, a Solar Pass, new rewards and exclusive cars, including 5 car models revisited for the occasion.</em></p>
<p><strong>Season 3 – Clan War, a constantly evolving game mode</strong></p>
<p><em>This third season revolves around a clash between the Sharps (whose members consider themselves the elite of sophistication and luxury) and the Streets (provocative and sometimes extreme, seeking to make their mark) across Hong Kong Island and Ibiza/Eivissa, with the arrival of the clan war. This season will also feature 30 new clan progression levels and seasonal content additions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Season 4 – The Casino, an iconic location in the Unlimited series</strong></p>
<p><em>The fourth and final season of Year 1 marks the grand return of the Casino, a favorite of Test Drive Unlimited 2 fans. This new Solar Crown version of the Casino will offer players the chance to wager their virtual currency through a variety of activities, including poker and slot machines. In addition to bringing 50 player levels, the Casino will allow players to win exclusive new cars, cosmetics and rewards.</em></p>
<p>Obviously, alongside these seasonal content updates, KT Racing will be updating the game in tandem with player feedback. There will be ongoing work on the cameras and steering wheel animations in first person cockpit views, for example. They are also considering fan requests like Real Estate, motorcycles and more.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/07/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-announced-release-date-consoles/">Announced way back in 2020</a>, it’s been a long wait for fans of earlier games in the series – the last of which arrived in the early 2010s for PS3 and Xbox 360 – to have a true confirmation of when Solar Crown will be released. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/07/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-announced-release-date-consoles/">First planned for September 2022</a>, KT Racing has been afforded a further two years to bring their vision for Test Drive Unlimited to fruition.</p>
<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown will take players to Hong Kong Island, featuring a full-sized recreation of reality, with a blend of built up cities and the thick wilderness. There will be plenty of high speed racing to be found within this game and setting, and players will choose between the Sharp and Street clans that vie for supremacy on Hong Kong’s roads, but TDU has always been about celebrating cars and car culture, as much as the racing itself. The intention is for this to be more of a social driving MMO, in contrast to the car bonanza of other open world racers.</p>

            <p>I won an awful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-board-games-on-pc">board game</a> from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.</p>
<p>The game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/floop-big-house-adventure">Floops Big House Adventure</a>. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.</p>

<p>It’s pretty simple as far as the shooting of it all goes. Horrible little bastards come at from all angles, and you do gun violence at them with a selection of collectable weapons. Floop farts when you get hit, and his life is measured out in tacos, to paraphrase T.S Eliot. Shoot enough horrible little bastards, and a horrible big bastard shows up.</p>
<p>There’s some hopping hairball freaks that look perpetually pained until they jump, at which time their agonised gaze twists into a faint flatulence smile, as if temporarily relieved from crippling joint pain. There’s some Bart Vs The Space Mutants-ass tentacle blobs. There’s an upgrade shop ran by a smoking, anus-headed gentlemen named Bob.</p>
<p>I played with mouse and keyboard, but it’s a little stiff like that, so controller is the way to go here - it gets more bullet-hellish as you progress. So say the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2783290/Floops_Big_House_Adventure/">Steam page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>FEATURES
<ul>
<li>Fast runs - Floops can be beat in under 20 minutes!</li>
<li>Retro Saturday morning cartoon action!</li>
<li>Nostalgic Nickelodeon art style!</li>
<li>90's references galore! Spot them all throughout Floops House.</li>
<li>Random waves will have you on your toes as cartoon mayhem erupts. Learn the various enemies attacks and patterns to rack up the high score!</li>
<li>Item synergies and boosts await! Try them all to see what unique combos you can come up with.</li>
<li>Hardcore Mode! Defeat the game with healing restrictions to test your mettle.</li>
<li>Fun costumes to equip!</li>

<p>20 minutes, you say! That’s just enough time to eat several massive bowls of cereal and a couple of lollipops marketed as Too Sour To Handle unless you’re a real enough dude. I actually don't miss the 90's at all, now I think about it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-nintendo-praised-for-improvements-to-use-of-minerals-from-conflict-zones<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>While Sony results regress.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
An annual report into the use of minerals sourced from conflict zones by major technology companies has praised Microsoft and Nintendo for their efforts to improve over the past year. 
</p>
<p>
But the same report - compiled by former GamesIndustry.biz writer Brendan Sinclair, now at <a href="https://www.unlosingwriter.com/microsoft-improves-conflict-minerals-sourcing-as-sonys-backslide-continues/">Unlosing Writer</a> - also highlighted how Sony had regressed.
</p>
<p>
The use of minerals in hardware manufacturing - most commonly tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold - is tracked by US and EU legislation to ensure companies disclose the countries and specific mines where their resources originate in a bid to ensure these operations aren't funding human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>
This year's report reflects on an overall dip in standards caused by the Covid pandemic - when inspections were more difficult and conditions more opaque - to the situation this year, which has seen improvements by several major brands. 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft reports that 87 percent of its mineral sources had passed its audit this year, up from 65 percent previously. Nintendo, meanwhile, improved from 95 percent to 100 percent. 
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo has also continued to do business with partners in the DRC and neighbouring countries, which is a good sign," Sinclair wrote. "Before 2022, Nintendo had embraced a policy of not sourcing minerals from conflict-affected and high risk areas, which helped ensure it wasn't funding human rights abuses in those regions, but actually ran against international guidance because in many such places, the mineral trade is the best opportunity to build the local economy and grow political stability that could help end the violence."
</p>
<p>
Sony, however, reported that it's ongoing slide in standards had continued, with just 69 percent of mineral sources up to scratch. It's the third year in a row its percentage has slipped, from in the low 80s previously.
</p>
<p>
Meta saw its pass rate increase from 89 percent back up to 95 percent, where it had sat previously. Logitech also improved, with a 98 percent conformant rate, up from 96 percent last year. 
</p>
<p>
Apple maintains a 100 percent conflict-free audit, though only after acting to removing problem cases as they're identified.

			<p>A new Batman game might be in development, according to a new rumor <a href="https://puck.news/how-the-wbd-fire-sale-could-play-out/?_cio_id=f6c60601ab8301dced02&amp;utm_campaign=What+I%27m+Hearing+-+LEADS+%288%2F29%2F24%29&amp;utm_content=What+I%27m+Hearing+-+LEADS+%288%2F29%2F24%29&amp;utm_medium=email_action&amp;utm_source=customer.io&amp;utm_term=f6c60601ab8301dced02" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by film insider Matthew Belloni from Puck News. The article is behind a paywall, but the relevant excerpt was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1f4pr5v/a_game_set_in_matt_reeves_the_batman_universe_is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on Reddit:</p>
<p><em>Back in 2020, AT&amp;T tried to sell the Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment video games unit for a cool $4 billion. But months later, it was deemed “too valuable to unload.” Then, when Zaslav took over, many advised him to offload games. But Zaz still sees the games unit as strategic, especially as the various WBD divisions are beginning to collaborate more closely on properties like the upcoming Penguin HBO show and game, both seeded in the 2022 The Batman movie.</em></p>
<p>The game is reportedly set in the Batman universe created by Matt Reeves with the film released theatrically two years ago. While Belloni seems to link this project to the Penguin HBO show (due to air its eight episodes from September 19 to November 10), it appears unlikely that the game is actually centered on the Penguin himself unless it has a strategy focus. The villain certainly isn't known for his action prowess.</p>
<p>A Batman protagonist is certainly easier to imagine, especially after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flop</a> of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, made by the studio behind the beloved Arkham trilogy. Even so, it is strange that Warner Bros. has approved a game set in a separate universe from the main DCU crafted by James Gunn, who previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/dcu-will-connect-games-movies-and-tv-says-james-gunn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> films, TV shows, and games would all be connected.</p>
<p>It may be a while until we learn more about this project. However, Batman fans can look forward to <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-is-an-exclusive-meta-quest-3-vr-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arkham Shadow</a>, a Virtual Reality sequel to Arkham Origins in development at Camouflaj for the Meta Quest 3.</p>

            <p>Here’s one we missed from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-9">this week’s release round-up</a>, possibly because Konami appear to have given it precisely zero promotion: the Castlevania Dominus Collection, a four-game bundle spanning PC ports of three well-regarded DS Castlevanias, plus a redesigned version of Castlevania Haunted Castle, the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/castlevania">Castlevania</a> game to grace an arcade machine. It’ll set you back $25, £20 or €25, and my drive-by analysis of the trailer below is that they've done a decent job with the ports.</p><!--more-->

<p>The DS games in question are Castlevania: Dawn Of Sorrow, in which you can combine souls to make weapons, Castlevania: Portrait Of Ruin, which sees you switching between two protagonists with different abilities, and Castlevania Order of Ecclesia, in which you scour Dracula’s Castle for magic glyphs. All have naturally been reorganised to fit on a single screen, with inventory and map stuff over on the right. In the case of fiddlier DS-specific flourishes, like Dawn Of Sorrow’s drawing mechanic, they’ve come up with some… <a href="https://x.com/KZXcellent/status/1828457055134347594">straightforward solutions</a>. The port of Haunted Castle, meanwhile, includes both a redesigned version with more elaborate pixelart and a straight port of the original. </p>
<p>Oh hang on, I get why we missed this from the round-up. They shadow-dropped it during one of those Nintendo Direct things the Silksong people keep shrieking about, which also brought news that Konami’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1932640/Suikoden_III_HD_Remaster_Gate_Rune_and_Dunan_Unification_Wars/">Suikoden 1 and 2 HD remasters will arrive in March</a>. Konami are doing a brisk trade in revivals of various kinds at the minute, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-hours-of-bloobers-silent-hill-2-its-unclear-who-is-remaking-who">a new version of Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-metal-gear-solid-need-a-new-kojima-konami-have-many-people-in-mind-but-its-difficult">a new-ish version of Metal Gear Solid 3</a> on the cards.</p>
<p>My thoughts inevitably turn to the future of the Castlevania series. Our buddies the Belmonts and old man Dracula have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s6pu6QvkxY">found another lease of life/undeath on Netflix</a>, but it’s been a while since the last actual new Castlevania game, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2-review">underwhelming</a> Lords Of Shadow 2. Konami appear content right now to loan their various vampires and vampire-killers out to games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/v-rising-is-getting-a-free-castlevania-crossover-to-coincide-with-its-10-launch">V Rising</a>. I’d really love to play a Sonic Mania-style reboot of the 2D series. In the meantime, you can check out the Dominus Collection on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2369900/Castlevania_Dominus_Collection/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
