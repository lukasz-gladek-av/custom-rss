It doesn't appear to be a hardware problem either, as Switch 2 users have reported that the console isn't correctly registering how much of a battery charge is left, resulting in them being told that they're almost out of power after playing for only a short amount of time.</p><p><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68272/~/the-battery-charge-indicator-or-percentage-displays-incorrectly-on-nintendo" rel="nofollow ">According to Nintendo</a>, the quick fix for this problem is to enter the secret Recovery Mode on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>This should reset the console battery, and it can be done by following these steps:</p><ul><li>Make certain that your Switch 2 has the latest system update</li><li>Power off your Switch 2 completely</li><li>Press and hold down the volume up (+) and volume down (-) buttons, then press the power button <strong>once</strong> to turn the system back on</li><li>Keep holding down the volume buttons until the menu for Recovery Mode appears</li><li>Power off the console again by pressing and holding the power button until it turns off</li><li>Power the console back on</li></ul><p>Our testing confirms that this method does work--my Switch 2 would only charge up to 82% with the power-saving mode enabled but it now reaches a charging percentage of 89%--and there is a second solution here just in case this one doesn't work.</p><p>This requires a few more steps, as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/support/articles/the-battery-charge-indicator-or-percentage-displays-incorrectly-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo advises charging the Switch 2 to 100%</a> and then letting the battery drain until it is <em>almost </em>empty--a complete drain is harmful to overall battery life--and then charging it back up to 100% again. Doing this several times should "gradually" improve the battery charge indicator, Nintendo says.</p><ul><li>Ensure the console has the latest system update</li><li>Set all three Auto-Sleep mode settings to "Never"</li><li>Connect the AC adapter directly to the console</li><li>Allow the console to charge until the battery is 100% fully charged, or until the console has been charging for at least three hours</li><li>Leave the console alone and connected to the AC adapter for an additional hour</li><li>When an hour has passed, disconnect the AC adapter from the console and allow the console to display the Home menu for approximately three to four hours</li><li>The remaining battery life must be depleted as much as possible</li><li>Once the battery charge is almost depleted, power off the console and leave it alone for at least 30 minutes</li><li>Repeat these steps 3 several more times</li><li>The battery charge indicator will improve gradually by repeating this process several times</li></ul><p>If that's not enough to fix the problems on the Switch 2, Nintendo recommends sending it in to be serviced. With the Switch 2 now out, owners have discovered several tips for ensuring that the device runs in peak condition. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-improve-switch-2-battery-life/1100-6531649/">There are several ways to ensure that the Switch 2 battery has a long life</a>.

                <p>Get your Splattershots ready--Nintendo's beloved shooter series Splatoon is getting its first spin-off game. The Nintendo Today app shared the announcement of Splatoon Raiders, a spin-off featuring the Deep Cut idol band from Splatoon 3. It's coming out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive/2900-6628/" data-ref-id="2900-6628">exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2</a>, while Splatoon 3 is receiving a free Switch 2 update this week.</p><p>The Splatoon Raiders trailer depicted Deep Cut members Shiver, Frye, and Big Man on a helicopter, discussing their next treasure-hunting destination, the Spirhalite Islands. Their helicopter crash-lands, setting the stage for an island adventure. Players will take the role of a mechanic, exploring the mysterious new locale with Deep Cut.</p><p>While the Nintendo Today video showed some action, it didn't share any specific objectives or details about the gameplay loop of Splatoon Raiders. The video also lacked any details about a release window.</p><p>Watch the announcement video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ve2zWmkEA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d7ve2zWmkEA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Meanwhile, the upcoming Splatoon 3 update, scheduled for June 12, will freshen the game up for Nintendo Switch 2. Along with improved visuals and performance, especially in hubs like Splatsville, which were capped at 30fps on the original Switch. More importantly, this version 10.0.0 update for Splatoon 3 includes new weapons.</p><p>The Splatlands Collection of 30 weapons features familiar ink-splatting artillery but with different loadouts of sub- and special weapons, along with unique visual designs. And for the more hardcore competitive players, the upcoming patch includes a new stat in the ranked Anarchy Battles called Series Weapon Power, which tracks win/loss ratios per weapon and matches players with others with similar ratings.</p><p>The Splatoon 3 update is a welcome surprise, considering Nintendo only planned to add new content to the game for two years after its September 2022 launch. It's also another fun addition to the growing list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">Switch 1 games getting a free update</a> for the new hardware. And while Splatoon Raiders isn't necessarily a proper fourth installment, the spin-off may satisfy Splatoon players, especially all those Big Man fans out there.</p>

SAG-AFTRA has announced it has reached a tentative agreement with signatory game companies, including Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Epic Games Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Take 2 Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc.&nbsp;</p><p>The agreement is subject to review and approval by the National Board and ratification by members in the coming weeks, and it is expected that the terms <span>of a strike suspension agreement will be finalized with employers soon, according to SAG-AFTRA. When that agreement is finalized, the strike that began July 16 last year will end. However, until that agreement is finalized, the strike will continue.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>"Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike," SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland writes in a press release. "Patience and persistence have resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary AI guardrails that defend performers' livelihoods in the AI age, alongside other important gains."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In the same press release, SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher wrote, "Our video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the world's most lucrative industries. Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal. The needle has been moved forward and we are much better off than before. As soon as this is ratified, we roll up our sleeves and begin to plan the next negotiation. Every contract is a work in progress and progress is the name of the game."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The aforementioned strike began last July after </span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/26/sag-aftra-members-vote-yes-to-authorize-video-game-strike"><span>SAG-AFTRA members approved a strike authorization in September of 2023</span></a><span> with a 98.32% yes vote. Though SAG-AFTRA executives sound happy about the agreement, we won't know how it specifically addresses AI and other concerns that led to the strike until the ratification materials are officially released in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Splatoon Raiders is the first game announced for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/tech/2025/06/09/switch-2-review-a-safe-but-effective-bet">Switch 2</a> by Nintendo since <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/impressions/2025/06/05/game-informer-editors-share-their-early-nintendo-switch-2-impressions">the launch of the console last week</a>, and it was revealed in the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/28/nintendos-day-old-app-reveals-the-release-date-for-the-live-action-zelda-movie">Nintendo Today app</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Playing as a mechanic, you'll adventure to the mysterious Spirhalite Islands alongside Deep Cut, the idol trio of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> that consists of Shiver, Frye, and Big Man. Though the reveal trailer doesn't show too much, it seems players will be exploring a set of islands while chasing after a mysterious yellow beam shooting into the sky within a tornado or water cyclone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the Splatoon Raiders reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7ve2zWmkEA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7ve2zWmkEA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The trailer teases that "research" is still underway on Splatoon Raiders, likely indicating there's some time to go before the game is ready for launch. Nonetheless, considering <span>that Splatoon 3 has surpassed 10 million units sold and </span><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/09/12/splatoon-3-had-the-best-launch-ever-for-a-switch-game-in-japan">had the best launch for a Switch game in Japan</a>, a new Splatoon game is exciting.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no word on when to expect Splatoon Raiders, but Nintendo says it will launch exclusively on Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elsewhere in today's Squid Research Lab Report, Nintendo revealed that version 10 of Splatoon 3 is on its way. It will feature the Splatlands Collection, which consists of 30 weapons from the series' past but refreshed for the game. Plus, weapon freshness caps will be raised, and players can earn new in-game badges. And in the Anarchy Battle Series, players can utilize the Series Weapon Power, a new stat that tracks your effectiveness with a weapon based on your win-loss ratio in battles. It will also be used in matchmaking to put you up against players with similar stats.&nbsp;</p><p>That's not all, though. Nintendo also revealed that Urchin Underpass, a map from the first Splatoon game, will return to the rotation of Splatoon 3. And for Switch 2 players, an upgrade will bring improved visuals, including better resolution and more. The company says this update won't affect play capabilities between Switch and Switch 2 players when it launches this week on June 12.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting for this update, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/splatoon-3/multicolored-mayhem"><em>Game Informer's </em>Splatoon 3 review</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you hope Splatoon Raiders is?

            <p>Early access life sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> will be releasing on Mac this August, the team has announced.</p>
<p>Those interested in picking up InZoi via Mac are able to pre-order now, with the site touting a 20th August release date. "Let your imagination lead the way," the <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1932241322573983768">team wrote on social media</a>, sharing the news.</p>

<p>InZoi was initially released in early access this March, quickly going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-access-life-sim-inzoi-breaks-krafton-sales-record">on to break records for publisher Krafton</a>. It crossed the 1m sales mark one week after its debut, however since then the game has struggled to keep its player numbers as high as they were not even three months ago.</p>
<p>Over on Steam, the game currently has a peak concurrent player count of 87,377, which it reached during its launch period. Since then, player numbers have sharply declined, with its current 24-hour peak sitting at a comparatively tiny 1,753. That is a player decline of 97.99 percent (so, 98 percent).</p>
<p>While declining numbers are to be expected following a game's launch, this is a big drop in a pretty short period of time. To compare, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> currently has a 24-hour player peak of 35,871, so InZoi evidently isn't the 'Sims killer' (at least not yet) that some had wondered if it could be.</p>

<p>Even <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a>, which initially released in June 2009, currently has a similar player count to InZoi, which given that game debuted 16 years ago is quite eye-opening.</p>
<p>Maybe its release on Mac will turn InZoi's fortunes around.</p>

			<p>Big news today for Splatoon fans, as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/splatoon-raiders-the-first-ever-splatoon-spinoff-game-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo announced</a> the first Nintendo Switch 2-exclusive Splatoon game with Splatoon Raiders, a spin-off game where players will head to the Spirhalite Islands as a mechanic along with the Deep Cut trio. Nintendo also announced that a new update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/splatoon-3-fresh-yet-familiar/">Splatoon 3</a> will be available on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 later this week on&nbsp;<strong>June 12, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Nintendo announced the news through its Nintendo Today! mobile app, with a short teaser trailer introducing the new adventure. There's not much we know about Splatoon Raiders, like whether it'll be a single-player adventure or if it is a multiplayer-focused game, but the emphasis on the game's core party of characters in this announcement, like the protagonist and the Deep Cut trio, and the short bits of gameplay shown in the trailer seem to suggest it's a narrative-driven title in some sense.</p>
<p>According to a post from the official <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonNA/status/1932423796964606143">Splatoon America account on X</a>, our protagonist for Splatoon Raiders is "<em>an expert mechanic with a mysterious background. That ink tank and walking robot look rather intriguing, wouldn't you say?</em>"</p>

<p>Nintendo also failed to mention when we can expect to see Splatoon Raiders on store shelves, though, as a Switch 2 exclusive, it will be interesting to see how Nintendo prices the game. Since it's a spin-off title, will it come in closer to, say, $50, or will it be the latest Switch 2 exclusive to be priced at $80?</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Splatoon world, and in the same video following the Splatoon Raiders announcement, Nintendo confirmed that Splatoon 3's version 10.0 update will launch later this week, bringing along with it the return of the Urchin Underpass map from the first Splatoon game, a new set of weapons and cosmetics from the Splatlands Collection, new stats for players to track, and most importantly for Switch 2 owners, "<em>more detailed visuals and a smoother appearance in locations like Splatsville and the Grand Festival Grounds</em>" when playing on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>The update will also add support for cross-play between Switch and Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/682063/the-new-york-times-nyt-games-crossplay-scrabble-pips<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>The New York Times</em>’ games team is trying something new: it’s about to start testing a <em>Scrabble</em>-like game it calls <em>Crossplay</em>, but instead of folding the game into the main NYT Games app, <em>Crossplay</em> will be a standalone app. The game is soft launching in New Zealand on iOS on June 10th.</p><p>I was recently shown a demo of the game by Jonathan Knight, head of games at <em>NYT</em>, and I think it will look familiar to any fans of <em>Scrabble</em> or <em>Words with Friends</em>. The game takes place between two players. Each turn, your goal is to build a word out of the up to seven letter tiles on your tray and the letters already on the board. Every letter has a different point value, and you can boost your score by taking advantage of bonus tiles on the board that multiply your letter or word scores.</p><p>(The <em><em>NYT</em></em> did not provide screenshots I could publish; Knight says that a screenshot of the game right now doesn’t represent where it will be when it launches more widely.)</p><div><p>“We’re really presenting a very pure, classic, elevated version of the game”</p></div><p>The <em>NYT</em> has a few of its own tweaks to differentiate <em>Crossplay</em> from similar games, including different positions for bonus tiles and a different letter distribution, Knight says. The end of the game has a clever twist, too: after all of the letter tiles have been drawn from the virtual bag, each player gets just one additional turn instead of having to clear their tray of tiles to end the game.</p><p>Knight argues that <em>Crossplay</em> is its own app because it’s an experience that would be hard to fit in another app. “We’re very specifically wanting to reach all new audiences with this game,” particularly people that love to compete and love word games, he says.</p><p><em>Crossplay</em> requires a free <em>NYT</em> account to play, and your friends from the main <em>NYT</em> Games app will carry over, Knight says. “Certain aspects” of the game will be exclusive to paid subscribers, such as a feature that will help you review your matches. But he says <em>Crossplay</em> won’t have many of the things that can make other free mobile games frustrating.</p><p>“In a world where mobile games have become little mini casinos, and it’s often hard to find the game itself behind all of the treasure chests and friction and aggressive monetization tactics and coins and all of that, we’re really presenting a very pure, classic, elevated version of the game that you can just get in and enjoy without all that business,” Knight says.</p><p>The <em>NYT’s</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911274/wordle-new-york-times-free-word-game-acquisition">acquisition of <em>Wordle</em></a> arguably kicked off the race for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279439/news-games-crossword-wordle">daily puzzle games</a>, with places like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23984103/puzzmo-acquired-hearst-zach-gage">Hearst</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152045/linkedin-games-crossclimb-queens-pinpoint">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276945/netflix-is-getting-a-daily-word-game-from-ted">Netflix</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24295846/words-with-friends-single-player-daily-puzzles-wordle">Zynga</a> putting their own stamps on the genre. Overall, the <em>NYT’s</em> games business is growing, according to Knight, including “tremendous downloads,” growing app use, and subscriptions.</p><p><em>NYT</em> puzzles were played 11.1 billion times in 2024, according to statistics shared with <em>The Verge</em> by <em>NYT</em> spokesperson Jordan Cohen. <em>Wordle</em> was played 5.3 billion times, “3.3 billion successful <em>Connections</em> were made,” and <em>Strands</em>, the <em>NYT’s</em> word search game, was played 1.3 billion times.</p><p>The <em>NYT</em> games team is still developing new puzzles for the main games app, such as <em>Pips</em>, a logic game, that it started beta testing in Canada in April.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’ll include improved visuals and performance and feature cross-gen play with people on the original Switch.

Based on previous weapons, these new additions have fresh looks with different sub and special weapons. There are a total of 30 new weapon kits in this collection. A returning stage from the original <em>Splatoon</em> game on Wii U, called Urchin Underpass, will also be added to the stage rotation.</p><p>&nbsp;Plus, all weapon Freshness caps will be raised and players can earn new in-game Badges. A new stat will be added for Anarchy Battle (Series) called Series Weapon Power. It will track a player’s effectiveness per weapon based on their win/loss ratio in battles – and will then match them with players of a similar power. This makes it possible for players to try new weapons without being disadvantaged and push the limits their favorite weapons.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Further, with this new update <em>Splatoon 3</em> players on Nintendo Switch 2 can enjoy more detailed visuals and a smoother appearance in locations like Splatsville and the Grand Festival Grounds. Today’s trailer also confirmed that <em>Splatoon 3</em> players will be able to play together across both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p></blockquote><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Mario Party is a game lots of players love, but often not without reservations. The big knock against the series has long been its late-game antics, which can render strategy meaningless by creating huge swings that can suddenly shuffle the standings, regardless of how well or poorly you've been playing all along. Handing out bonus stars like Oprah gifting her audience with cars just doesn't make for a good virtual board game.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also not so predictable which of the many categories of minigames will be involved in any Mario Party endgame moment, and as a result, not always so much fun to play, even while the rest of a session might be enjoyable. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-party/" data-ref-id="5000-681517">Lego Party</a>, a similar minigame-laden multiplayer party game, is intended to be similar to Mario Party but without that annoyance for players, allowing them to strategize more reliably.</p><p dir="ltr">The team behind Lego Party removed the concept of bonus stars (gold bricks in this case) from their take on the party minigame genre, because the team understood that having late-game bonuses that can invalidate playing well in the early game is not an enjoyable mechanic. "I just don't like them," SMG Studio project director Mark Fennell told me bluntly. It feels like randomness added where it doesn't belong. And I can say its absence was appreciated in my Lego Party demo at Summer Game Fest 2025.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2PgTclraWk" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A2PgTclraWk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That's not the only pain point Lego Party seeks to address as a party "board" game. Like in Mario Party, you can steal items, including highly valuable gold bricks, from other players, if the right conditions are met. In Mario Party, you can decline to buy a star when offered, but you can't decline to steal from another player (either a star or coins) if you land on the board game space that says you have to do so. In Lego Party, that's not the case. Since the Lego Party team expects the game to have an audience of players with mixed experience levels, or parents playing with their kids, the change leaves room for the game's older or more mature players to show mercy to younger ones.</p><p dir="ltr">"We did over 100 playtests, and we had some tears," a developer told me, speaking to the times when kids would cry because they'd suffered a loss in the game. Lego Party was re-tuned with this feedback in mind. The option to steal gold bricks can now be declined by the pilfering player. If you're a parent trying to go easy on your kid, you'll have the opportunity <em>not</em> to go through with the action that's going to upset them. It's a nice touch that makes the game kid-friendlier. And of course, if you <em>don't</em> want to go easy on another player, you can just choose not to.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet another small tweak to the rules results in big changes to how games unfold. The player turn order isn't static, like it is in Mario Party, where it's chosen at the beginning of the game. Instead, each turn is given a new order based on the most recent minigame results. If you were just a space away from scoring a star in Mario Party and you're first in the turn order, you can rest assured you'll get it after the next minigame, no matter what happens. In Lego Party, however, you're gonna need to lock in, because the winner of the minigame gains turn priority. That means they could beat you to the gold brick when your group returns to moving around the board.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Party will launch with four boards and over 60 minigames, and those I saw were a fun mix of play styles and objectives. My favorite was one in which players would need to grapple up to a moving platform--a small dancefloor, really--and amass points for staying on it and grooving away. I also saw games like a rally race, a memory test, and a familiar one where players compete for painted space on the ground, constantly painting over each other's brushstrokes.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Party benefits from being recognizable; it's "Mario Party but Lego," for the most part, and though that's a fun proposition, its merits may come down more to how it differs, and in particular, how it improves on Nintendo's long-standing party game.</p>

<p>This game will serve as a spin-off of the Splatoon series, with players taking on the role of a mechanic. The game was first announced via Nintendo's bespoke Today app, where it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">shares daily updates on games and franchises under its umbrella</a>.

<p>In addition to Splatoon Raiders, Nintendo also has <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> version 10.0.0 inbound. This will add new weapons, badges and more to the base game. As per the video shared via the Nintendo Today app, Splatoon 3 players will soon find 30 new weapon kits, the arrival of Urchin Underpass, new stat tracking options for weapon power, while the weapon freshness limit is being increased.</p>
<p>On top of all that, Nintendo has also talked of improved visuals and frame rate for Switch 2 as part of an update coming on 12th June. It has assured that those playing on Switch 2 will still be able to play against those on the original Switch console, as well.</p>
<p>Splatoon 3 was initially released back in 2022, and we here at Eurohamer were rather taken with it. "There are few surprises to be found in Splatoon 3's multiplayer or campaign, but it is the best Nintendo's spectacular series has been to date," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-review-a-lot-more-of-the-brilliant-same">Eurogamer's Splatoon 3 review</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a Switch game we thought would get a little boost on Switch 2 — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>! While it wasn't part of the initial free update line-up, Nintendo (via the Nintendo Today! app) has announced that the game will be receiving a Switch 2 update later this week, on <strong>12th June</strong>.</p>
<p>That's not all, though — 30 new weapons in the form of the Splatlands Collection (based on older weapons), a raise on freshness caps, new badges to earn, and a new stat in Anarchy Battle which will help with matchmaking.</p>
<p>Urchin Underpass, a classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/splatoon">Splatoon 1</a> stage, is also making a return later this week. All of these additions are coming to the game regardless of whether you're playing on Switch 1 or 2.</p><p><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qjATCE2dk"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qjATCE2dk">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>On the Switch 2 side of things, Splatoon 3 is getting a performance boost, with smoother framerates in particular areas and more detailed visuals. We assume that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-splatoon-3-squid-roll-bug-reportedly-surfaces-on-switch-2">Squid Roll bug will also be fixed</a>. (<em>Update: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3lraygscif323">Confirmed via OatmealDome</a>'s translation of the <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonJP/status/1932425767314682174">Japanese Splatoon X account</a>).</em></p>

<p>Strangely, no Mouse Mode support (though this isn't a Switch 2 Edition), but at least you'll be able to play with friends online regardless of whether they're on Switch 1 or 2.</p>
<p>Well, that was a handy reminder to get the Nintendo Today! on your phone, wasn't it? Alongside the Splatoon 3 update, we're also getting a Switch 2-exclusive spin-off in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>.</p>

<p>Wait, what?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, an all-new spin-off title exclusive to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Taking place on the Spirhalite Islands, Splatoon Raiders is a single-player story-focused experience in which you play as a mechanic investigating some strange goings on alongside Deep Cut.</p>
<p>Gameplay looks reasonably familiar, from what little we've seen of it so far, though it seems exploration might take centre stage this time around. We're definitely excited to see how this one mixes up the formula for the series.</p><p><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qjATCE2dk"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qjATCE2dk">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>"Research is still underway", apparently, which pretty much means Nintendo is still knee-deep in development for Splatoon Raiders. Given the company's recent track record, however, chances are we won't have to wait to long to hear more.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation has been added to even more PC games, providing accelerated frame rates to owners of RTX graphics cards, depending on their GPU. Users equipped with the RTX 20 or 30 Series can enable DLSS Super Resolution, those with an RTX 40 Series graphics card can add DLSS Frame Generation, and the lucky few who have purchased a shiny new RTX 50 GPU can boost frame rates even further with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p>One of those games is Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man 2. The game already supported DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, DLAA, NVIDIA Reflex, and several ray traced effects when it <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on PC earlier this year. Now, an update has added Multi Frame Generation, allowing RTX 50 Series users an average boost of 4.9x at 4K resolution with all settings maxed out, ray tracing included. The GeForce RTX 5090 runs the game at 256.5 FPS, the RTX 5080 reaches 209.5 FPS, and the RTX 5070 Ti averages 184.9 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Similarly, the fantasy action RPG Dragonkin: The Banished <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragonkin-the-banished-early-access-hands-on-preview-who-wants-a-pet-dragon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> three months ago in early access with DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. With a new update, the game now supports Multi Frame Generation, and the NVIDIA app allows RTX users to activate the override to the improved NVIDIA DLSS 4 transformer AI model for better visual quality.</p>
<p>Today is release day for two highly anticipated PC games. One of them is Funcom's Dune: Awakening, which debuted last week for those who had purchased the Deluxe or Ultimate editions, but kicks off for everyone today. The massive survival sandbox multiplayer game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-boosts-performance-by-an-average-of-4-9x-in-dune-awakening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> all NVIDIA DLSS 4 technologies: Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, and Reflex, as well as the aforementioned transformer AI model override via the NVIDIA app. Just like in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, the average performance uplift is 4.9x. The GeForce RTX 5090 averages 338 frames per second, and even the GeForce RTX 5070 is practically at 200 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The other game due to launch today is Build a Rocket Boy's <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-pc-system-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MindsEye</a>, which also includes all the above plus NVIDIA DLAA. Looking ahead, June 12 will mark the debut of <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stellar Blade on PC.</a> Shift Up's acclaimed action game also supports all NVIDIA DLSS 4 technologies, providing an average 3.4x performance improvement on GeForce RTX 50 GPUs. The flagship graphics card, the RTX 5090, goes up to 540 frames per second, while both the RTX 5080 and the RTX 5070 Ti surpass 300 frames per second, and the RTX 5070 reaches 260 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Next week, Sloclap is going to release the arcade football game <a href="https://wccftech.com/sifu-developer-sloclap-has-announced-a-release-date-for-its-new-soccer-game-rematch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REMATCH</a>. This isn't a particularly taxing game, but you'll still be able to turn on NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex to maximize your experience when the game launches on June 19.</p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye | 4K DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ot_ZpJYyLGc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On July 1, the multiplayer action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/mecha-break-open-beta-mashmak-pc-hands-on-preview-extracted-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mecha BREAK</a> will make its debut with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, and Super Resolution. Lastly, The Order of Giants DLC for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (which was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-announced-launches-in-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be releasing on September 4) will still feature the full RTX suite (DLSS Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and path tracing) just like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base game</a>. Unfortunately, NVIDIA did not mention the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Hair update</a> that was supposed to be released a while ago but never materialized.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-raiders-splatoon-3-switch-2</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-raiders-splatoon-3-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first ever&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>spinoff,&nbsp;<em>Splatoon Raiders</em>, has been revealed for Switch 2, and what's more,&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>will also be getting an update for the new machine in the next couple of days.</p>

<p>Over on the Nintendo Today app, Nintendo revealed&nbsp;<em>Splatoon Raiders&nbsp;</em>with a brand new trailer that shows Deep Cut members Shiver, Big Man, and Frye en route to a new location known as the Spirhalite Islands.</p>

<p>Of course, their helicopter crash-lands on the islands, presumably along with the player character, so it sounds like it'll be up to you to get yourself and Deep Cut off the Spirhalite Islands, presumably while fending off threats.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splatoon-raiders-announced-big-man.jpg?itok=YuJQYWGI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splatoon-raiders-announced-big-man.jpg?itok=bfecjgXE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Splatoon Raiders&nbsp;</em>is a brand new&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>spinoff coming to Switch 2.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't know too much more about&nbsp;<em>Splatoon Raiders&nbsp;</em>than that right now. Nintendo says it will be an "adventure" in which you'll play as a mechanic, and that Deep Cut will be joining you for your adventure, but we didn't get to learn exactly what kind of game&nbsp;<em>Raiders&nbsp;</em>will be.</p>

<p>We do, however, know that&nbsp;<em>Splatoon Raiders&nbsp;</em>will be a Switch 2 exclusive, so you won't be able to play it on the original Switch, unfortunately. Nintendo says more info will be shared later down the line.</p>

<h2><em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>is also getting a Switch 2 update</h2>

<p>Happily,&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>is also getting some love for the Switch 2. The game will be getting an update later this week that smooths out some perfomance issues and brings improved visuals as well.</p>

<p>Despite major updates for&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-updates-ending" rel="nofollow">coming to an end in September last year</a>,&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>Version 10.0.0 will also be getting new weapons as part of the Splatlands Collection. They'll be based on previous weapons, but will sport "fresh new looks".</p>




<p>If you're worried about not being able to splat with your Switch friends, fret not: you'll still be able to enjoy crossplay between Switch 2 and original Switch.</p>

<p>We don't have a release window for&nbsp;<em>Splatoon Raiders&nbsp;</em>yet, but the&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>Switch 2 update launches on June 12th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Revenge Of The Savage - 20 Minutes Of Gameplay With The Devs</p>
      </div>
<p>As for bringing the game to Game Pass at launch, Hutchinson said working with Microsoft--and presumably taking payment from the company--was part of Raccoon Logic's balancing effort of trying to reach as many people as possible and making money. The financial terms of Game Pass deals are not made public, but it's understood that Microsoft pays developers to bring their games to Game Pass at launch as part of the Xbox company's ambition to scale the service and attract new users.</p><p>Hutchinson said the "whole industry should agree to only allow games on subscription services a year after release." He said the video game industry should embrace the traditional movie model where a film debuts in theaters exclusively and then comes to DVD, TV, or a streaming service.</p><p>"The current structure will prove very damaging to anyone who is not owned by a publisher soon if it continues," Hutchinson said. <a href="https://x.com/BangBangClick/status/1932143109493674096" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Posting on social media</a>, Hutchinson said Nintendo stands alone with respect to retaining the value of games. "Everyone except Nintendo is also in a race to value content at zero which will end in tears," he said.</p><p>Hutchinson is saying this as a person who took a deal from Microsoft to launch Revenge of the Savage Planet into Game Pass on day one, so what gives? He said the studio's hope with making a deal with Microsoft was to help Revenge of the Savage Planet get exposure that would in turn encourage people to buy a DLC pack or encourage a friend to buy the game. That's not what's happened, though.</p><p>"We haven't seen that, or at least not yet. What we've seen is that content has been devalued and that people are less willing to pay for things, which in the long run will likely mean less games being made and a lot more studios going under," he said.</p><p>As for the Game Pass payments from Microsoft, Hutchinson said it was true that the checks were "big enough to make a difference," but that was "years ago."</p><p>"These days unless your game is tiny, or you're a rare enormous brand, it isn't much. But Microsoft have been amazing partners and we're so glad to be working with them," he said.</p><p>Game Pass is a paradigm shift for gaming, and it's a model that no other major competitor has embraced. For its part, Sony has said it will not launch its new games into PlayStation Plus on day one because of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-on-why-it-wont-launch-games-day-one-on-ps-plus-like-xbox-game-pass/1100-6501975/" data-ref-id="1100-6501975">how it can erode and negatively impact its overall value chain and ecosystem.</a> Nintendo doesn't have a similar program, either, and is historically known for holding prices, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">in the case of Mario Kart World, increasing prices.</a></p><p>Hutchinson directed Assassin's Creed III and Far Cry 4 while at Ubisoft before leaving to start Typhoon Studios, which released Journey to the Savage Planet in 2020. Google acquired Typhoon for its failed Stadia gaming ambitions, before closing the studio and scuttling Stadia. Hutchinson then founded Raccoon Logic in 2021, releasing Revenge of the Savage Planet in May 2025.</p>

<figure><a title="Coins" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1bca9c83ebf7/coins.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> lets you unlock a bevy of interesting new karts by collecting in-game coins. Specifically, you get one new kart for every 100 coins you collect; which is pretty much how it was on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>.</p>
<p>You'll need to grab a total of 3,000 coins to nab every in-game vehicle, which in standard play might take quite a while depending on how often you're able to dive in for a race. However, it seems some Mario Kart World players have found a pretty solid way to farm coins and unlock every kart pretty quickly.</p>
<p>We say "quickly", but it seems pretty tedious to us. Essentially, there's a vehicle driving around the world that constantly spits coins out of its backside. So all you need to do is hop into Free Roam (press '+' on the main menu), track down the vehicle, and follow it around for a while.</p>

<p>Does it take all the fun out of it? Yeah, in our opinion, it probably does. But if you're someone who simply <em>has</em> to have every kart unlocked as quickly as possible, then this is definitely a viable option.</p>
<p>Or you can just keep playing the game naturally and you'll likely find that those coins will start piling up pretty quickly anyway. Up to you!</p>
<p>We'll have our final verdict on Mario Kart World very soon, but for the time being, check out our Review in Progress if you're keen to see what we think so far.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/samsung-mocks-apples-liquid-glass-design/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Apple <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-announces-ios-26-with-new-glass-dsign-updated-features-more/">unveiled</a> its new Liquid Glass redesign for its entire product line, and to be fair, the updates are quite significant, not just when it comes to looks but functionality as well. While the design of iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26 is pretty neat that takes into account different layers of digital glass that refract light differently, it would be unfair to point out that Windows did it first. Moreover, Samsung wasted no time in reminding Apple that it, too, had already used glass in its UI.</p>
<h2>Apple’s Liquid Glass UI for iOS 26, macOS Tahoe faces Samsung, Windows jabs over design originality, AI features</h2>
<p>Samsung has always stood on top when it comes to poking Apple for its design, whether its hardware or software, and iOS 26 is no exception. The Cupertino tech giant calls its new 'Liquid Glass' UI design language 'expressive,' which sounds a bit too familiar, as Google recently announced the <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-releases-android-16-qpr1-beta-1-for-pixel/">Material 3 Expressive design</a> for Android 16, which kind of follows the same glass approach. Samsung was quick to notice and posted its insights mockingly on X.</p>
<p>The South Korean giant first poked fun at the "sleek glass UI" of iOS 26 by referencing its own One UI 7 redesign. One UI 7 is pretty reminiscent in this regard, and while the approach and mechanics behind the design could be different, the general visuals appear to be pretty similar.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Customizable apps? Floating bars? That sleek glass UI? Looks… familiar 🤔</p>
<p>— Samsung Mobile US (@SamsungMobileUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungMobileUS/status/1932126084641718633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Samsung stated that its One UI 7 update launched with some of Apple's new AI features first, including Live Translations across Messages, FaceTime, and the Phone apps. This feature was introduced with the Galaxy S24 lineup last year, and now they are available on additional devices. Samsung also took a dig at Apple for just adding AI features to the Apple Watch, like Workout Buddy and other minor additions. Samsung says that it has used AI on its Galaxy Watch models for a while, and while it is not something to brag about, the company is the first to adopt the technology.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">New to live translations? Welcome aboard! We’ve been translating text and speech in real-time for a while now… <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyAI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GalaxyAI</a></p>
<p>— Samsung Mobile US (@SamsungMobileUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungMobileUS/status/1932130403726590361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">AI is coming to your watch? Cute. Ours already knows when you’re too tired to care 😴 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyAI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GalaxyAI</a></p>
<p>— Samsung Mobile US (@SamsungMobileUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungMobileUS/status/1932135428410196118?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Samsung may have used AI and glass UI in its products first, but Apple's implementation is quite different, and the usability might vary as well. If you think this is it, <a href="https://wccftech.com/macos-tahoe-brings-liquid-glass-ui-new-spotlight-games-app-more/">macOS Tahoe 26</a> has also been mocked for its Windows Vista-like design language.</p>
<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/06/10/apple-innovates-windows-vista-aero-glass-with-macos-26-liquid-glass-oh-well/">Windows Latest</a></em>, macOS Tahoe 26 and Windows Vista share various similarities, not just the visuals. Apple says the macOS Tahoe “is crafted with Liquid Glass, a translucent new material that reflects and refracts its surroundings.” On the flip side, Microsoft describes Aero Glass in Windows Vista as "providing spectacular visual effects such as glass-like interface elements that you can see through.”</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The publication also states that macOS Tahoe uses soft tints and depth layers for folders and apps, which is pretty similar to how Vista worked with color-based transparency effects. You can read the full piece for more details on the design of both software updates.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>There is no first-mover advantage when it comes to design; it just looks good and is totally up to the user how he sees it. Apple's rendition is neat and new for the company and its user base, which makes all the difference. How did you like the new Liquid Glass redesign? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Some Kind of Halo PS5 Release Is Apparently On the Cards]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-ps5-rumor</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/some-kind-of-halo-ps5-release-is-apparently-on-the-cards.1214307/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-ps5-rumor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new leak has emerged which suggests that&nbsp;the venerated&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>series, previously exclusive to Xbox consoles and PCs, could be on its way to the PS5 at some point in the near future.</p>

<p>As spotted by leaker <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1932240994939834370" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">eXtas1s</a>, trusted&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>source <a href="https://x.com/gruntdotapi/status/1932217175885938726" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">grunt.api</a> spotted a reference to a&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>game for PS5 within the series' API, an information repository that provides info for developers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the API listing doesn't show which game in the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>series is coming to PS5, although they do say that since the listing has a <a href="https://x.com/gruntdotapi/status/1932218210528739642" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"new ID"</a>, it probably won't be the <i>Master Chief Collection</i>, <a href="https://x.com/gruntdotapi/status/1932405680742580324" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">nor will it be</a>&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-infinite-halo-ps5-leak-rumor.jpg?itok=OkbVTTeo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-infinite-halo-ps5-leak-rumor.jpg?itok=X3mRoUcB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>game for PS5 apparently won't be&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Master Chief Collection</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If grunt.api is correct, then this could mean that a brand new <i>Halo&nbsp;</i>game will be arriving on PS5, presumably at the same time as it comes to other platforms, although there's no mention of a Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 release for the game.</p>

<p>Alternatively, of course, it's possible the API listing could be for a rebrand or a remastered version of an existing game, so we could well be getting an&nbsp;<em>Infinite&nbsp;</em>port for PS5.</p>

<p>If I was launching a long-running series like <i>Halo&nbsp;</i>for the first time on a new ecosystem, then I'd probably release a remake or remaster of the very first game in the series to introduce new fans, but hey; I'm not Microsoft, nor am I Sony.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682075/verge-staffers-react-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is finally, officially out, and <em>Verge</em> staffers have spent a bunch of time playing with it. The new console has a lot of improvements, like a bigger screen and an extra USB-C port. There’s a bunch of games to play, too, including a new <em>Mario Kart</em> and nice updates to older games.</p><p>Here’s our impressions of our first few days with the Switch 2. Our full review is coming soon.</p><div><p id="bigger-screen"><h3>Bigger screen</h3></p></div><p>I wish the Switch 2 had an OLED screen, particularly considering the price, but this 7.9-inch, 1080p 120Hz panel absolutely makes my original 6.2-inch Switch seem like a bargain basement tablet by comparison. It’s <em>so</em> much more real estate, it’s crisper and clearer, navigating the UI feels smoother thanks to the high refresh rate, and I no longer feel like my field of vision is getting squeezed by loads of ugly bezel.</p><p>But the Switch OLED already solved a few of those issues. And while reasonably bright, the Switch 2’s screen can’t compare to the Steam Deck OLED’s amazingly bright and colorful HDR panel. —<em>Sean Hollister, senior editor</em></p><div><p id="old-games-on-new-console"><h3>Old games on new console</h3></p></div><div><p>The Switch 2’s slim launch lineup is supplemented by updates to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition">some of the original Switch’s most popular games</a> — some free, some paid. In a lot of cases, the vision and ambition of these games stretched or even exceeded the capabilities of the original Switch hardware, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679031/pokemon-violet-scarlet-switch-2-update-hands-on">their performance on the Switch 2 is a <em>drastic</em> improvement</a>.</p></div><p>I’m glad some great games are finally able to escape the shackles of the original Switch and really shine, but it also highlights just how overdue the Switch 2’s improvements really are. —<em>Kallie Plagge, senior copy editor</em></p><div><p id="only-one-color-option"><h3>Only one color option?</h3></p></div><p>Speaking as a man with a bona fide Joy-Con collecting problem — I racked up six pairs for the Switch because I like all the colors and am bad at managing my money — it was bittersweet news that the Switch 2 only comes in black with tiny red and blue accents. It saved me from spending even more at launch, but that’s only delaying the inevitable.</p><p>Does it mean future Joy-Con designs will be similarly understated, with pops of color below the control sticks? Will we have to live with the knowledge that future colored controllers won’t match the hidden accents on the console itself? Most importantly, will I be able to curb my collection compulsion this time around? —<em>Dominic Preston, news editor</em></p><div><p id="its-so-much-faster"><h2>It’s so much faster</h2></p></div><p>I would like to apologize to a bunch of game developers, because I’ve spent the last several years cursing them for interminable loading times, unnecessarily complicated menus that take a second to register every button press, and a lot of overall slowness. All of which turned out to be the Switch’s fault</p><p>I have been shocked at how much zippier the Switch 2 feels in almost every way. Games load faster, menus render more quickly, old games play like new again. The overall speed of the device is, in my time with it so far, a bigger upgrade than just about anything else about the Switch 2. <em>—David Pierce, editor at large</em></p><div><p id="the-extra-usb-c-port"><h3>The extra USB-C port</h3></p></div><p>To my surprise, my favorite change for the Switch 2 so far is the extra USB-C port on the top of the console. Maybe that’s just because of the way I work: my desk is usually an overflowing pile of various gadgets and cables, so I like having the extra port on top for charging or plugging in a webcam for some <em>Mario Kart</em> (which I’m definitely only testing for work, pinky promise). <em>—Jay Peters, news editor</em></p><div><p><cite>Photo: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="ergonomics"><h3>Ergonomics</h3></p></div><p>The original Switch wasn’t comfortable to hold for an extended time, and I thought the Switch 2’s larger size could remedy that. But to me, the Switch 2 might actually be worse.</p><p>The slightly bigger Joy-Con 2 controllers give you a little more to wrap your fingers around in handheld mode, but they’re not contoured like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871866/hori-split-pad-pro-controller-nintendo-switch-daemon-x-machina-review">larger third-party gamepads</a> or chunkier PC handhelds. The hard edge along the bottom of the Joy-Con 2 controllers digs into my palms when I’m leaning back on the couch. I felt noticeable discomfort after playing <em>Mario Kart World</em> in this position for less than an hour. By the end of my two-hour session, it was unbearable.</p><p>Maybe my soft hands just aren’t burly enough. (After all, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23527936/sony-alpha-a7rv-mirrorless-fullframe-camera-hands-on-ergonomics-pain">I’m on the record</a> complaining about uncomfortable cameras.) But I think the move from the original Switch Joy-Cons’ rounded borders to the Switch 2’s hard edge is a small downgrade I’ll have to work around. <em>—Antonio G. Di Benedetto, reviewer</em></p><div><p id="the-mystique-is-gone"><h3><strong>The mystique is gone</strong></h3></p></div><p>There was so much hype ahead of the Switch 2’s launch (even before its announcement) that it’s impossible for a device to live up to it all. And yet, after a weekend with the Switch 2, it’s great, though I’m surprised that all of my personal feelings of mystique surrounding it are gone. What it can or can’t do is no longer a mystery, even if figuring out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682008/which-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">which webcams will work</a> remains one. </p><p>I agree with my colleague Andrew Webster who said in his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682661/nintendo-switch-2-early-hands-on-mario-kart-world">in-progress testing</a> that it’s “a pleasant upgrade, as opposed to a next-gen shift.” However, I’m disappointed that the mystique didn’t stick around a little longer, like it did with the Steam Deck. Turns out, when a handheld doubles as a Linux PC, the possibilities feel limitless.</p><p>The same can’t be said for the Switch 2. It’s a better Switch, but conceptually, it’s the same formula. I’m still getting used to that. —<em>Cameron Faulkner, commerce editor</em></p><p><em><strong>Update, June 10th</strong>: Added David’s entry.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Favourite Course Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/497742fd6641d/favourite-course-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're willing to bet there are a fair few of you out there who spent the weekend up to your elbows in axle grease with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> - would that be a fair assessment?</p>
<p>It's a big old game and we're <em>still</em> working on finalising our review of the Switch 2 launch game after getting our hands on it last Thursday, and while you can read our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">in-progress impressions</a> right now, you'll have to wait a little longer for our final verdict. (It's not much of a spoiler to say that they're mainly positive, though.)</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182523 @ 1749559775 -->
<p>However, having gotten a good handle on it in the past few days (Felix had put in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTOghSITWvw">over 30 hours</a> before the weekend was out) and explored the titular World <em>a lot</em>, we're keen to find out your standout tracks so far.</p>
<p><em>Tracks, as in circuits, or tracks, as in music off the soundtrack?</em> you may well ask. Well, despite the incredible number of killer cuts that play as you race, today we'll be focusing on the courses - but watch this space for a musical deep-dive at some point!</p>
<p>You'll find a poll at the bottom, but let's hear first from Team NL and get their picks...</p>
<h2>Space Race &amp; Movie Magic (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>

<p>This might be my favourite selection of new courses in Mario Kart history. I know the intermission tracks are divisive, but in terms of visual variety and layout? It's staggering. I've spent all weekend thinking about this question.</p>
<p>I've settled on the two that I think are the most different from anything we've had before — <strong>DK Spaceport</strong> and <strong>Boo Cinema</strong>. The former is <em>such</em> a fun tribute to the original arcade <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/donkey_kong">Donkey Kong</a>, chasing a robotic version of DK with the iconic music from the arcade remixed perfectly. It's an eight-checkpoint race up a huge structure with so many twists and turns. I love it.</p>
<p>Boo Cinema is self-explanatory. How have we not had a movie theatre race course before? Plus, I love Boo (and King Boo, often my go-to MK character since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_kart_double_dash">Double Dash</a>). This course was made for me. Jumping through the screen with the sepia scenery and movie reels? And a little bit of Banshee Boardwalk outside? <em>Ugh</em>. Magic.</p>
<p>I have a million honourable mentions — Cheep Cheep Falls, Whistlestop Summit, Acorn Heights. But I might be restrained if I continue.</p>
<h2>Anything with water (Gavin Lane, editor)<br></h2>

<p>Watch out, here comes the 40-something gaming dude with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/wave_race_64">Wave Race</a> fetish!</p>
<p>Yes, the moment I saw MKW's hot wave tech, I was jonesing to see how Nintendo would channel its AWOL jet ski series. And my word, it's got me worried that an <em>actual</em> new Wave Race might feel a bit vanilla after the hijinx of hop-boosting off crests and lobbing projectiles while zipping across the water.</p>
<p>If you want a specific course, <strong>Wario's Galleon</strong> was the first water course I encountered and it made a serious impression. I've barely touched the Free Roam mode just yet, but I feel like I'll be spending a lot of my time in the brine.</p>
<h2>Life, uh, finds a way (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>

<p>I love me some dinosaurs.</p>
<p>So naturally, I've gravitated immediately toward the new version of <strong>Dino Dino Jungle</strong>. Being able to dash up the Triceratops' head to get an early boost is a thrill, and avoiding the stomping Brachiosaurus and T-Rex will never stop being fun. Plus, the music reminds me of Alton Towers, somehow, which just dredges up some wonderful childhood memories.</p>
<p>I also adore <strong>Starview Peak</strong>, if only because the twisty-turny waterways remind me of the Loopdeeloop Galaxy from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>. Racing through for the first time brought back memories of the Manta Ray Surfing, and I only wish the game offered this up as a vehicle option.</p>
<h2>The ultimate question (block) (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>

<p>Gosh, can I say "every circuit"? No? Okay, fine, I'll narrow it down, but if you think I'm going to be able to stick to just one, you've got another thing coming.</p>
<p>I'm a sucker for anything that has a really cool flying sequence in it. It's why I've always loved DK Mountain so much, and it's why I was grinning cheek to cheek when I first flew up to <strong>The Great ? Block Ruins</strong>. Aside from its awesome Indiana Jones vibes and the shortcut potential that I'll never be skilled enough to use, this track is just <em>so</em> gosh-darn cool! It's all high-flying jumps and wicked rail riding - eat your heart out, Tony Hawk.</p>
<p>I'm going to throw in a mention for <strong>Rainbow Road</strong>, too. It's one of the easier variants out there, I'll admit, but it's such a wonderful victory lap for the game itself, with all those little nods to the circuits before it — if you haven't spotted the train yet, you're in for a treat. Oh yeah, <em>and</em> it has the sharp, ace ascent to get up to it. What can I say, I'm a predictable chap.</p>
<h2>The one where you fall off a lot (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>

<p><strong>Rainbow Road</strong> is, and always will be, my favourite MK track for the simple reason that, ever since the OG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a> back in '92, it's the one that puts the fear factor front and centre (for a man of my modest driving skills, at least). This is the track that I get sweaty thinking about, because my timings need to be <em>reasonably</em> good for fast snaking through corners that, if misjudged, lead to a very time-consuming drop into the abyss.</p>
<p>Looking back on the first Rainbow Road, my brain imagines something in line with the majestic, cloud-buffeted spectacle presented here in Mario Kart World, where in fact it's actually a very rudimentary course indeed. But the corners, those corners remain a constant, and the thing that has kept this track, in its various guises, as my fave time and again. It may look approximately 1,000,000,000 times better these days, but the core conceit remains. This is the track where you get a little test on those drift skills.</p>
<p>Oh, and this might actually be my favourite variant of RR in ages, too. I love the lead into it, the magically crumbling start to the blocks, how the karts are lifted up through the air to it, and how you can see the twisting course spread out across the cloudscape ahead as you barrel along. What a cracker - and an insanity in multiplayer!</p>
<hr>
<p><em>So there you have it. It's tough, though, because the way Grand Prix works in this one, some of those transition routes between circuits are pretty neat in their own right!</em></p>
<p><em>Let us know in the poll below your favourite tracks of the 30 available (remember that Crown City and Peach Stadium are repeated in Grand Prix mode with different variants), and take to the comments if there's a specific highway, byway, or raceway section that's floating your kart-turned-boat.</em></p>

            <p>Wizards of the Coast knows the people thirst for more more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>-ish CRPGs, and the company's president has made it clear they still plan on making those kinds of things, even if the D&amp;D action game they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-ip-overlord-wizards-of-the-coast-reveal-a-new-dungeons-dragons-single-player-action-adventure">recently announced</a> will be a different kettle of magic frogs</p>
<p>"Don’t get me wrong," said President John Hight when speaking to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons/605631/dnd-video-game-giant-skull-wizards-interview">Polygon</a> about the different possibilities making a D&amp;D game offers being a factor in going that route with this latest game, "we are going to do CRPGs that are going to be as serious as BG3."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The WOTC chief was speaking at Summer Game Fest, which mainly focused on the upcoming Dungeons and Dragons action game being developed by Giant Skull, and led by ex-Star Wars Jedi director Stig Asmussen. With this action game, says Hight, the focus is more on giving some new folks a chance to see what else they can do with the universe.</p>
<p>Hight and Asmussen are currently keeping their cards close to their chests as to what that'll look like, with the former musing that "sometimes people immediately latch on to, oh, here’s the story we have to do and here are all the features that we want in the game. They start building out broadly without discovering: what’s the underlying thing that’s fun?"</p>
<p>It sounds like that's the stage Asmussen and co are at right now, with the director having concluded that while D&amp;D does come with some of the same canony headaches as Star Wars, there's room within it to do plenty of interesting stuff. Meanwhile, Hight cited Asmussen's work adapting all sorts of mythological beings into God of War 3 as something that should translate to integrating D&amp;D monsters "that form the dreams and the nightmares of people, from gelatinous cubes to owl bears".</p>
<p>Uh oh, how does he know about my dreams of gelatinous cubes gelationously cubing around? Are you  infiltrating minds like a nether brain, mr exec man?</p>
<p>Anyway, as for the actual bones of the game, Asmussen was clear that he's leaning on the single-player action lessons he learned making Star Wars Jedi for this D&amp;D game. There's a lot of chatter about a movement system that doesn't feel janky and Asmussen mentions Hight liking his studio being "experts at melee combat".</p>
<p>It's early days yet, but even if it isn't BG3-ish, here's hoping Giant Skull's game ends up being interesting enough not to just feel like a Star Wars Jedi game wearing a snazzy D&amp;D poncho.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
