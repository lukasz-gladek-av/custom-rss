            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As the end of the year heads into sight, and as my YouTube algorithm seems set on reminding me, gaming chairs are one of the best ways to upgrade your gaming setup. This time around, we’re checking out Boulies’ latest edition of their Master Series, and it’s fair to say that you’re looking for a gaming chair with a great amount of choice, this is an excellent option.</p>
<p>The Master Series lets you make your first choice with the sizing, with the regular Master Series chair recommended for people between 155cm and 180cm, and weighing up to 110kg. Meanwhile, the Master Max is built for the larger-framed gamer, so that’s anyone standing between 180cm and 200cm, with an increased load that’s capable up to 135kg. Our review unit was in the standard Master Series sizing, but beyond the increased load weight and extra sizing, the designs are fundamentally the same.</p>



<p>Once you’ve chosen your frame, you can select from a range of materials: Ultraflex PU, Water Repellent Fabric, or the top-of-the-range Nappa Leather. With the standard Ultraflex PU pricing currently sitting at £290 in the UK, and the Water Repellent option at £295, the Nappa Leather bringing it up to an ultra-premium £580. That’s a huge difference, but if you’re set on the best of the best, then Boulies gives you that option.</p>
<p>While the leather version is only available in black, the two cheaper finishes come in a range of colours. Our review unit came in water repellent Slate Blue, and I really liked the slightly subdued colour tone, which makes it feel very non-gamer chair. There’s a central black strip through the centre of the chair back, while the seat has two flaring black sections on either side. That’s then further carried through by the black neck pillow that attaches to the top of the chair.</p>


<p>Visually, I think it’s a great-looking chair, and one that manages to retain a certain level of maturity and seriousness. That’s not always the case with gaming chairs, and whether you’re settling in for your hundredth hour of Battlefield, or working on a PowerPoint presentation, this is manages to straddle the line between work and play.</p>
<p>The water repellent fabric they’ve used is very soft, and gentle, and, weirdly, I kind of wanted to find it across the elbow rests too, though that would look pretty odd. Boulies do note that the waterproofing will wear out over time, and that the degradation of that system will come down to how much wear the chair comes in for. So far, there’s no sign of it having lost any of its immunity to an accidental splash of tea or water, but then, I wouldn’t expect it to degrade quite so quickly.</p>
<p>Weird personal expectation aside, the armrests are actually made from soft PU foam. They offer 4D movement – that’s up and down, left and right, forward and back, and rotation on the central axis– and they stay resolutely in the same position once you’ve locked them into place. Adjustments are simple though, so if another person is using the chair, or you suddenly don’t find it’s quite the right fit anymore, the buttons to release them are immediately accessible.</p>

<p>There’s more adjustment to be found elsewhere, starting with the personalised lumbar support. Two dials on each side of the backrest let you alter the placement of the lumbar support, moving it up and down, the supportive bump shifting into the small of your back as needed. It works well, though you’ll likely forget exactly which way the support moves each time you’re using it.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got it all setup how you like it, it’s fair to say that the Boulies Master Chair is hugely comfortable. It’s a little firmer than some gaming chairs, but I actually found that really helpful through longer gaming sessions. You can also change the angle of the backrest, so you can sit studiously upright while working, before leaning all the way back for some more lazy gaming at the end of the day.</p>
<p>As with all gaming chairs, the Boulies Master Series arrived in a massive and heavy box and had to be put together. In the scheme of things, this wasn’t a hard build – you’re talking more like grown-up Duplo rather than Lego Technic – but there are one or two fiddlier moments thanks to having to attach everything to the underside of the seat itself with Allan-key equipped screws.</p>

<p>It took me about half an hour, and while I have put a number of gaming chairs together over the years, I think that anyone with a solid understanding of flat-pack furniture, or who has bought literally anything from IKEA will be at home with what the instructions are asking of you. The only point that you might want to consider is having a second pair of hands for when you’re attaching the chair back, as it’s quite heavy and unwieldy, but I managed it myself without too much problem.</p>

<figure data-uuid="ce2730dafbe3e"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ce2730dafbe3e/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released the English translation of its recent financial <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2e.pdf">Q&amp;A session</a>, and it mostly covers the company's plans for the Switch 2, its games, and potential movies going forward – lots of stuff we already know about, to be honest.</p>
<p>One question, however, managed to raise a smile on our otherwise stone cold faces, and its regarding the late president of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi, who passed away in 2013 at the age of 85. One attendee essentially asked what kind of comments Yamauchi would make if he were to evaluate the success of the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Shigeru Miyamoto said that Yamauchi might feel "a sense of envy" at the fact that the Switch 2's numbers are so high. Otherwise, he would remain humble and advise the company to "keep your feet on the ground and do the right thing".</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Hypothetically speaking, if (former president) Hiroshi Yamauchi were still alive and evaluated the current state of Nintendo Switch 2, what kind of comments do you think he would make?<br>
<strong><br>
Shigeru Miyamoto:</strong> Yamauchi, as president of Nintendo, might feel a sense of envy that the numbers have surpassed those of his own tenure, but in a typical Kyoto business executive manner, I think he would say, ”Stay humble. Keep your feet on the ground and do the right thing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a nice moment in what is otherwise a pretty straightforward Q&amp;A session. As you'll no doubt already know, Yamauchi was instrumental in transforming Nintendo from a company that specialised in Hanafuda to a global leader in the world of video games.</p>
<p>So yes, we imagine he would probably be both envious and thrilled at just how well the Switch 2 is doing so far. Since its launch back in June, the console has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">already sold over 10 million units</a>, with Nintendo upping its forecast up to 19 million units for the financial year.</p>

<p>Zombies returns in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and there’s plenty to sink your teeth into, including the main quest that advances the story and provides a bunch of easter eggs.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, and Zombies is a huge part of the launch, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several maps planned</a>, the return of Dead Ops Arcade, and plenty more teases.</p>



<p>For those wanting to dive immediately into the main quest in Black Ops 7, we’ve got all the details on when you can get your journey started.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-black-ops-7-zombies-main-quest-launch">When Does The Black Ops 7 Zombies Main Quest Launch?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Waiting. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The main quest in Black Ops 7 Zombies will be available from 10 AM PT on Friday, November 14.</strong></p>



<p>This release is over 12 hours after the main release of Black Ops 7, so you will have to wait a little longer once you jump into the game for the main quest to go live.</p>



<p>Additionally, Directed Mode will not be available at launch or when the main quest goes live. Instead, Directed Mode will land at the start of Season 01 later in the year.</p>



<p>The table below shows the release times for the main quest in Black Ops 7 Zombies in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">12 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">3 AM – Nov. 15</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-zombies-before-the-main-quest-launch">Can You Play Zombies Before The Main Quest Launch?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Zombies will be fully playable as soon as Black Ops 7 launches, and you don’t need to wait for the main quest launch to jump into the mode.</strong></p>



<p>However, many secrets will be locked at this stage, likely meaning you won’t have full access to all the available Wonder Weapons, and other Easter Eggs won’t be live.</p>



<p>You will be able to play the mode and level up your account, however, which is required to access features like Research, and Zombies will remain a great place to gain the XP needed to push through the early player levels in Call of Duty.</p>

<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/zelda_musou/status/1986357898071638423">Zelda Musou social media account</a> has revealed that two updates are in the works for the game. These updates will be free, it said, and allow fans to "enjoy Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment for even longer".</p>

<p>There is currently no indication of when we can expect these updates to arrive, or what they will actually include when they do. A new fighter or two to expand the roster seems more than likely, though. Any thoughts on who?</p>
<p>Age of Imprisonment is set before the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and is the latest crossover with Koei Tecmo's Warriors franchise. Previous Zelda crossovers include Hyrule Warriors (no extra flourish unless you count the enhanced ports Legends and Definitive Edition) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review-a-hugely-enjoyable-impressively-authentic-zelda-spin-off">which served as a spin-off of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-impressions-review-story-gameplay">Alex has already taken Age of Imprisonment out for a spin</a>, calling it Warriors' "richest offering yet".</p>

<p>Here at Nintendo Life, we're keenly aware that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> just hasn't had enough, well, airtime.</p>
<p>Look, two Directs clocking in at 1 hour 45 minutes (yes, longer than <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>) just isn't enough, gosh darn it! So we want to rectify that.</p>
<p>Nintendo kindly invited us to give Kirby Air Riders a whirl, and so we've put together a 20-minute+ video of gameplay for you to peruse at your leisure. We get a good glimpse at some races and the City Trial mode, and while it's not direct-feed, it's pretty good quality nevertheless, if we do say so ourselves.</p>
<p>Don't forget, you can try out Air Riders for yourself with the Global Test Ride, kicking off this weekend for Switch 2 owners. For a proper look at what times you'll need to set aside, be sure to check out our full guide down below.</p>

            <p>You’ve probably noticed that there’s been only a sporadic amount of Nic Reuben in your RPS lately, and we’re sad to say that Nic is leaving the treehouse to resume his glittering freelance career. Please join us in saying goodbye and wishing him well before he jets off on his solid rhodium pleasure plane, never to return (unless we ask him very nicely to review a Warhammer game or something).</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>James:</strong> I distinctly remember, when Nic joined RPS, a feeling of not quite believing our luck. We were bruised at the time from several painful team losses and yet in the space of less than a year, managed to nab both Edwin <em>and</em> Nic, two of the best free agents in the gamewords business. Proper pinch-me stuff. Once in the staff writer chair, he immediately established himself as the best kind of crewmate: not just an excellent person with bottomless wells of empathy and humour, but a writer so damned good that he made everyone around him better. Through, like, talent osmosis. And he didn’t even realise he was doing it.</p>
<p>I can’t list all his best stuff because we’d be here for months. But even before he started at RPS full-time, he was exhibiting a profound skill of looking at games in interesting and unusual ways, like his now-famous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-kind-of-pot-is-elden-rings-pot-boy-we-asked-an-expert">study of Elden Ring’s pot boy</a>. Or later, an investigation into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-did-a-medieval-peasants-raw-sour-breath-sound-like-manor-lords-composers-tell-us">medieval soundscape of Manor Lords</a>. Or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-uk-games-industry-has-a-class-problem-heres-how-one-organisation-is-trying-to-fix-it">picking out the class issues in a whole bunch of stuff</a>. Or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/object-ive-review">Object-ive Review</a>, his Supporters-exclusive series on PC gaming’s finest inanimates. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">skilled</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">reviewer</a> and newsman both, Nic was also exceptional at digging up the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sorry-i-only-drink-wine-that-was-aged-listening-to-the-nier-automata-soundtrack-now">offbeat</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-enjoy-daemonologies-incredibly-normal-sheep-with-me">darkly fascinating</a>, usually while deploying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-have-spent-the-morning-learning-about-a-recently-deceased-horse-thanks-to-umamusume-pretty-derby">turns of phrase</a> that could snap your neck with the G’s.</p>
<p>Nic also knew when to sharpen that wit and point it fearlessly at deserving targets, be it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-future-where-you-and-this-bucket-that-fits-over-your-head-decide-what-a-game-meant-to-say-not-the-useless-idiots-that-made-it">embarrassing pro-AI op-eds</a> or, uh, the<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-get-my-old-battered-gamer-chair-for-oh-i-dunno-50-quid-1"> deals posts</a> that our bosses sometimes make me do. Still, some of my personal favourite Nic pieces had him doing the opposite, championing cool indie games he’d discovered or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dreams-on-a-pillows-developer-on-the-challenges-of-making-games-from-the-west-bank">telling the stories of marginalised devs</a>. And, of course, there was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/booked-for-the-week">Booked For The Week</a>, a regular dive into the reading habits of some of the industry’s most accomplished names – a brilliant and deeply RPS-y idea that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-deus-ex-looking-glass-studios-and-othersides-warren-spector">Warren Spector</a> maybe enjoyed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-help-warren-spector-keeps-emailing-me-about-books">a little too much</a>.</p><p>Nic really could do it all, and I’m chuffed to bits that he did it vaguely near the rest of us, from where we could leech at least some of his powers. Goodbye and good luck, Nic – whatever you do next, I’ll be reading.</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> Nic's work has never failed to bring me joy, even during those horribly busy times when all I could afford to do was glance at the headlines. Just scrolling through his author page, I couldn't help but laugh - more than once - at his fearsome and fearless wit. And then I felt sad once more that he's hauling his enormous sack of talent away from the RPS treehouse.</p>
<p>I mean, just look at this intro to one of his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/battle-prose">Battle Prose</a> diary posts. I picked it at random.</p>
<blockquote>"What do you mean the game didn't save?!", Thilmann had not so much asked Slackbladder as stowed the question in a sack of rocks, spat on the sack until no moisture remained in his body, then swung the sack at Slackbladder's forehead, leaving the thief dazed and more than a little soggy. "What in Odin's gammy eye flap does that even mean?!".<p>No idea, both Slackbladder and the rest of the company were forced to admit. All we knew was that last fight had gone even worse than we'd thought. Dogpollock and Glass Toe Jim Joe Jackon were still dead, but now Terry and Fritz had joined them. "How do you play a battle worse the second time?!" bellowed Thilmann. Again, none of us including Thilmann understood what this meant, although we all agreed it sounded unbelievably stupid. Real "massive idiot who still hasn't learned the game after four diary entries" hours.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nic is the most phenomenally entertaining writer. It always seemed to be effortless for him. That's almost certainly not true, of course. He probably bled from the eyes sometimes, thinking up the perfect nugget of sarcasm to turn a simple news post into a Nic Reuben News Post. Well, I think I speak for all of us when I say: thank you, Nic, for your offer of eye-blood. We accept it in the spirit with which it is given.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> I’m sad I didn’t get to work with Nic for all that long. He’s an excellent writer and took on the task of being proudly and gloriously RPSy with the kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for people who’ve just remembered the capital of Liechtenstein on Who Wants to be a Millionaire. He also typed ‘oh no’ in quite a reassuring way when, early in my RPS tenure, I managed to forget to save one of my articles before handing it over for edits, leading it to disappear into the purple ether. Best of luck for the future, Nic. Hope you enjoy the many more words you’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Nic is a magnificent writer, the sort that any gaming site would kill to have. The fact that we possessed a sliver of his soul for a short while meant we were all the better; the sad reality that he is leaving us means that our collective voice has been dampened. His bio here at RPS read that he was secretly “several Skaven in a trenchcoat “ - and if that is truly his real identity, I tip my hat to ‘em, whiskers and all. Said Skaven came down harder than I did on a few games during the last two years (looking at you, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">Avowed</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollowbody-is-almost-a-great-survival-horror-game">Hollowbody</a>), but their critiques were always eminently well reasoned and argued. Damn, were they a fine collective of Ratkin. We’ll miss you, Nic.</p>
<p><strong>Edwin:</strong> Nic, I can’t think of an adequate compliment, and I suspect you have long since cringed yourself into a ball of wrinkled leather over all the embarrassing gushing above, so I’ll try not to overdo my bit. In brief, I have never worked harder or dreamed bigger as a writer than when working day-to-day with you. Ah nuts, fucked it already.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some pieces of yours that I especially treasure: your reviews of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grunn-review">Grunn</a> (“less lock-and-key, more tearing layers of wrapping paper from a massive non-euclidean pass-the-parcel”), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/felvidek-review">Felvidek</a> ("the best art is buttressed by an irremovable layer of deep, thick grime"), and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth</a> ("enter teenage android side character Chadley, a grotesque Satnav of a pimple of a productivity app, a creature spawned from fear of Not Enough Game, to squeeze the universe into a ball and wrap checklists around it"). I will also include a few of your best from the news section: your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tactical-breach-wizards-is-refreshingly-unlike-xcom-despite-wearing-the-same-tactical-underwear">Tactical Breach Wizards write-up</a>/stealth pitch for "the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams (call me)". Your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys">40-wordish, barely polysyllabic piece on a minor Total Warhammer update</a> that became one of our top articles that day, despite gobbing in the face of SEO. And your graceful intervention about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people">Clair Obscur’s team size</a> that pivoted the entire critical conversation around it.</p><p>These are just a handful of my favourites. You are really very good at this writing trade, Nic! It is most vexing. Please carry on doing it in whatever capacity seems right. But in the shorter term, please treat yourself to an awesome break. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick is teasing a bright future for the Mafia franchise after this year’s prequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, “performed well ahead of expectations.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick spoke about the future of 2K Games’ long-running open-world crime series during an interview with IGN ahead of Take-Two's Q2 financial report (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">the one with the latest GTA 6 delay</a>). As developer Hangar 13 prepares to release new content and updates following The Old Country’s launch in August, the Take-Two boss teased that fans may eventually have more Mafia to look forward to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Definitely,” Zelnick said when asked if The Old Country performed well enough to instill confidence to continue the franchise. “We’re really excited about Mafia, and I think that’s a great question because it is sort of a reset for the franchise. We don’t have anything to announce — that comes from the label — but it definitely performed well ahead of expectations."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like the decision to sell Mafia: The Old Country at a cheaper than expected $49.99 price point paid off, then. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-the-move-to-80-video-games-kicks-in-gamers-point-to-mafia-the-old-country-and-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-hope-the-50-trend-succeeds">Fans praised The Old Country's $50 price tag when it was confirmed</a>, and publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 managed expectations by stressing pre-launch that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-mafia-the-old-country-to-gta-6-dev-says-theyre-not-as-similar-as-youd-think">it was absolutely <em>not</em> a Grand Theft Auto-style open-world game, but a linear, narrative-driven game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two stopped short of providing exact sales figures but said the early 1900s Sicily-set Mafia “quickly surpassed our internal expectations and affirmed our belief that consumer demand remains strong for premium, narrative-driven experiences that over-index on value.” Although it’s unclear when or how another Mafia game could materialize in the future, more new content and updates for The Old Country are confirmed to be in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mafia: The Old Country launched in August as a prequel for the crime drama video game franchise that first got its start with the original Mafia in 2002. The series saw semi-regular releases up until the launch of the divisive Mafia 3 in 2016, with only a group of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-definitive-edition"><u>well-received definitive edition remasters</u></a> arriving to break up the wait for more in 2020. After nearly a decade of waiting for a new entry, it sounds like fans won't have to wait quite as long for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hangar 13 and 2K propped The Old Country up as a fresh start for Mafia when it released earlier this year, and it appears to be a plan that’s panning out. We called it “Great” in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-review"><u>8/10 review</u></a>. At the time of its release, we said, “Mafia: The Old Country is a conventional but effective return to the linear and tightly story-driven format of the original Mafia and Mafia II, and it boasts a wonderful eye and ear for detail.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on The Old Country, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-dev-confirms-free-ride-mode-is-on-the-way-as-part-of-a-free-update"><u>the Free Ride mode</u></a> it received as part of a free update a few months back.

He admitted the launch was met with “a little bit of softness” due to technical issues that have since become infamous in the Borderlands community, but he remains confident “it’ll all be made up,” given enough time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those technical issues resulted in "a little bit of softness out of the gate on the U.S. sales side, but in the fullness of time we’re convinced it’ll all be made up, and we’ll be in a great place," Zelnick said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two expanded on that in its financial report annoncement, saying: "The game received high critical praise, with many reviewers calling it 'the best Borderlands yet.' The series’ highly active community eagerly welcomed the title, and during its opening weekend, it reached the largest concurrent player count on Steam in franchise history. Borderlands 4 also dominated YouTube with 30 million views and earned the #1 spot on Twitch during its launch, underscoring the franchise’s enduring mass appeal. While we experienced some challenges with optimization and performance on PC, Gearbox has been addressing these issues and releasing updates to improve gameplay. We are confident that Borderlands 4 will achieve strong unit sales over its lifetime."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 received praise from critics (we gave it an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-review"><u>8/10 in our review</u></a>) upon its September 12, 2025, release date for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, but it was also almost immediately faced with a wave of criticism from fans.

                <p>CKRD is getting the band back together, as the company behind several controllers for rhythm games has teased a new drum kit for 2026.

The full reveal will be in Q1 2026, and the company says that it has two more announcements to make this year.</p><p>Rhythm games have made a small comeback over the last couple of years, thanks in part to Fortnite Festival.

In the year 2000, for example, <strong>Pokémon</strong> was arguably at its height, the Game Boy Color was flourishing, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a> was delighting and baffling fans in equal measure.</p>
<p>To really get a feel for how the company presented itself back in 2000, '<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:porwhxzwut6vszlqjcvnmmag">Nintendeal</a> guy' Andrew Wolf has scanned and uploaded a rare <a href="https://archive.org/details/nintendo-company-guide-2000/page/n37/mode/2up">Nintendo company guide</a> online. Clocking in at 44 pages, it's relatively light on text (which, understandably, is in Japanese), but there's a load of images and iconography to pore over.</p>
<p>We're particularly interested in the pages depicting individuals holding the Nintendo logo like a pair of binoculars – what's that all about?</p>

<p>Otherwise, there's a really cool early look at the Game Boy Advance which, as shown on page 8, is depicted with a <em>very</em> rudimentary image. The accompanying text highlights it as "Nintendo's futuristic Game Boy, a complete model change for the 21st century".</p>
<p>We also get a brief introduction from the late Hiroshi Yamauchi, a segment dedicated to Rare, images of the consoles and games that were very much in vogue at the time, and more.</p>
<p>A solid preservation effort from Mr. Wolf, then!</p>

<p>It seems like PlayStation 5 players can look forward to Los Santos once more, as GTA 5 is reportedly coming back to PS Plus in November 2025. This is likely to offset any disappointment over the newest GTA 6 delay.</p>



<p>Rockstar Games is having an interesting time as of late. Take-Two delivered the news we were all dreading on November 6 by declaring that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6 was delayed to November 2026</a>. This led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-second-delay-stock-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two’s stock price dropping by 10%</a>, leaving the community in tatters. PlayStation is allegedly trying to appease the handful of people who haven’t played GTA yet by making GTA 5 a PS Plus game again.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-5-makes-its-triumphant-return-to-ps-plus">GTA 5 Makes Its Triumphant Return To PS Plus</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hi again, Trevor. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>We divert to the ever-reliable billbil-kun over at <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dealabs</a> for their exclusive GTA PS Plus story.</p>



<p>According to billbil-kun:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Based on our recent investigations, we can say that&nbsp;Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;will be one of the new titles that will be added to the PS Plus game catalog. Rockstar Games’ cult classic game is set to be available&nbsp;from November 18, 2025&nbsp;for all PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not the GTA you want to see on PlayStation Plus, we know that (we feel the pain, too), but it’s at least something to keep us ticking over for another agonizing, painful 12 months of waiting and twiddling our thumbs.</p>



<p>Just as a reminder, you must have one of PS Plus’s more expensive tiers to download and play GTA 5. The Essentials tier misses out, and this is vital information for potential GTA 5 players.</p>



<p>Like before, don’t expect Grand Theft Auto 5 to be on PS Plus forever either. This will be for a limited duration—presumably a few months—so make the most of a new playthrough or some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-now-included-with-gta-membership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online</a> shenanigans to kill time.</p>



<p>This is a fairly moot question at this point, but what do you make of the GTA 6 delay? Would you rather Rockstar release it when they are 100% sure it’s ready? Or debut it sooner, and release lots of patches soon after?

<p>The gaming world is reeling from the announcement that Grand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed to November 2026, and the latest GTA 6 delay could have repercussions for a host of other releases.</p>



<p>Rockstar Games announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 would be delayed until November 19</a>, almost six months on from the previously stated May release, extending the long wait for the latest entry in the beloved series.</p>



<p>While gamers around the world are expressing concerns that this still might not be the final release date, developers across the globe will also have to deal with a major reshuffle in the calendar, and it could be Microsoft that is impacted the most.</p>



<h2 id="h-fall-2026-shaping-up-to-be-huge-with-gta-6-delay">Fall 2026 Shaping Up To Be Huge With GTA 6 Delay</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Repercussions. Image via Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://x.com/DMC_Ryan/status/1986543677095960746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey</a>, Microsoft has some major releases that are likely to drop in the Fall 2026 window, including Halo: Campaign Evolved, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brings the franchise to PlayStation</a>, Gears of War: E-Day, Fable, and the 2026 instalment of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Though the Fall 2026 window is spread out and has several months to release titles, it’s also one of the busiest periods for gaming with a host of regular annual releases deploying in that period, including the likes of EA Sports’ Madden and EA FC.</p>



<p>Adding GTA 6 to the mix could cause problems, as no developer will want to go head-to-head with one of the biggest gaming releases of all time, as it would almost certainly impact sales.</p>



<p>These issues are not exclusive to Microsoft, however, as PlayStation, Nintendo, and developers across the world will also be tussling with the new calendar.</p>



<p>Marvel’s Wolverine, for example, is slated for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-gets-new-trailer-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch in late 2026</a>, while it’s widely expected that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-wind-waves-gen-10-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tenth generation of Pokémon</a> will debut in Q4 2026 as part of the 30th anniversary celebrations.</p>

            <p>CEO of Take Two Strauss Zelnick has revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> continues its monumental growth twelve years after its release, with GTA5 selling more than the entire population of Brazil.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again">Speaking to Chris Dring over at The Game Business</a>, Zelnick discussed the continued growth of the current iteration of the open world criminal adventure game, even as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA6</a> saw yet another delay into November, 2026.</p>
<p>Zelnick stated: "We continue to supply content to GTA Online, and in fact we've had terrific results there. And GTA+ continues to grow its membership. In fact, it's had 20 percent growth year-over-year. And GTA 5 has sold in more than 220 million units."</p>

<p>Just to put that figure into perspective, the entire population of Brazil is estimated to be roughly 213m people, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/brazil-population/">according to Worldometer</a>. Brazil is no slouch either, being the 7th largest country in the world by population. It's safe to say with those figures in mind, Take Two isn't exactly in dire waters right now.</p><p>Still, the delay of GTA6 is a blow against the industry giant. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">Take Two's stock took a tumble following news breaking about the new release date</a>. Meanwhile, protests were held outside <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9v10rr1meeo">Rockstar Games and Take Two's UK offices due to the sudden firing of staff looking to unionise</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> claimed these employees were sharing confidential information.</p>

            <p>Last night was a bumper time for games being delayed yet again, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> quickly following in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>'s probably rather expensive shoes. Skydance New Media have now pushed the release of their superhero game "beyond early 2026", with no concrete new release target given.</p>
<p>Rise of Hydra was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/Christmas%202025">previously delayed</a> from what looked like it'd be a release around Christmas 2025 to early next year, with Skydance citing a need to spend more time polishing their World War 2-era costumed capers.</p>

<p>"Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect," the studio wrote in their post announcing this latest delay. "To fully realise our vision for Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, we’ve made the decision to shift our release window beyond early 2026.</p>
<p>"We’re grateful for the passion and support from the community and players around the world. The team is working hard to create something truly special, and we look forward to sharing more with you as development progresses."</p> <div>

            <title><![CDATA[G’AIM’E Review—The Most Accessible Lightgun System In 20 Years]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gaime-review-lightgun-system/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/g%E2%80%99aim%E2%80%99e-review%E2%80%94the-most-accessible-lightgun-system-in-20-years.1346638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>What if I told you that from opening up your G’AIM’E package, you could play an upgraded version of the original Time Crisis and have it set up and ready to go within five minutes? The lost art of lightgun gaming can now be accessed in less time than it takes to wade through a live-service game’s endless oppressive microtransaction screens.</p>



<p>Speaking of screens, did you know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gaime-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G’AIM’E</a> is playable on any modern-day TV (LCD, OLED, etc) up to 150″? You no longer have to squint to make out your nearest pixel on a tiny CRT setup. G’AIM’E is the latest name attempting to bridge the divide between a bygone era and the restoration of lightgun shootouts to the mainstream at an affordable price with much-needed ease of accessibility.</p>



<p>G’AIM’E gets a lot of this right, and I think it’s comfortably the most accessible lightgun system on the market. It does misfire slightly, but not much. Let me explain in our G’AIM’E review.</p>



<h2 id="h-g-aim-e-review">G’AIM’E Review</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Finding the balance is key. Credit to G’AIM’E</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tassei Denki has been producing video-game peripheral devices for years. So leaping to a contemporary lightgun product wasn’t beyond the realms of possibility. But how do you market and make an age-old medium relevant again? By celebrating the 30th anniversary of arguably the famous lightgun shooter ever—<strong>Time Crisis</strong>—and pushing it to the forefront of EVERYTHING.</p>



<p>Each G’AIM’E package is centered around Namco’s 1995 classic, with the logo emblazoned on the consoles, collectibles, and guns. The basic edition includes a custom G’AIM’E lightgun, a mini-console with a redone-from-the-ground-up flashier emulated version of Time Crisis installed, a power cable, a HDMI cable, and a setup guide.</p>



<p>The Premium version has all of this and adds three more games to the console (<strong>Point Blank, Steel Gunner, and Steel Gunner 2</strong>), a pedal, and a Time Crisis Pin badge. Whereas the super-duper Ultimate pack includes everything so far, and throws in a second gun for two-player gaming, an AC Adapter, and a Time Crisis Diorama Stand.</p>



<p>For the purposes of this Insider Gaming G’AIM’E review, <strong>I was fortunate enough to test out the Ultimate edition</strong>. The collectibles do sit lovely with my other memorabilia, but you’re here to know if it’s worth dropping a lot of money on plastic guns, pedals, and piranhas—Where are my Point Blank fans at!</p>



<h2 id="h-we-have-a-time-crisis-on-our-hands">We Have A Time Crisis On Our Hands</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One game spawned a money train. Credit to NAMCO</figcaption></figure>



<p>I removed everything from the box, undid all the packaging, hooked up the mini-console and guns, and I had eyes on Richard Miller within minutes. Calibration was ridiculously easy, and the provided setup instructions are more crystal clear than a Time Crisis “Danger” prompt.</p>



<p>My 65″ OLED TV required me to be at the maximum distance from the TV, and I followed those instructions. After countless hours across all four games, <strong>my experience was extremely enjoyable, but not perfect</strong>. I want to sit here and tell you everything was inch-perfect, every shot felt like it was where I was aiming, there wasn’t a hint of a delay in my bullets, and any mistakes were through human error (which many of them probably were, and I have a lot of improving to do).</p>



<p>As sophisticated as the AI tracker and camera are, I think there are going to be times when you can’t be as accurate as you’d like. Is it a dealbreaker? Not even close. As I said, it was fleeting moments. I was so impressed with the tracker’s ability to refocus under different circumstances. I pointed the gun well away from the screen, I adjusted my distance before returning to the original spot, and I even had someone walk in front of the gun. All mini-experiments to test the AI’s capabilities, and it’s remarkable how consistently it remembers the original position and gauges proximity and the complexities and changes in the environment.</p>



<p>I’d say the main drawback of an AI-based algorithm over infrared is more noticeable during the moments when you need utmost precision: Enemies hiding behind walls and cover with only a few pixels for you to hit, or the trembling-inducing task of needing to shoot a single leaf or apple with one shot in Point Blank. </p>



<p>In fact, any of Point Blank’s one-shot or limited-ammo mini-games can crank up an already pressure-cooker environment!</p>



<p>If you calibrate everything correctly and optimize your setup and surroundings, you’ll have a ball as you start blasting at everything. The guns feel great, and <strong>the pedal is a genius enhancement, enriching an already homely arcade experience</strong>. The guns don’t rocket back and forth with recoil technology. Instead, there’s an optional haptic feedback-based vibration that kicks in with every shot. </p>



<p>I’m absolutely fine with this, and you can still feel the rush of every shot pulsating through your wrist, traveling up and tapping into the brain’s pleasure senses. Again, G’AIM’E is advertised as “plug and play,” and it does everything it says.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-smart-selection">A Smart Selection</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I wonder how many times they’ve been eaten. Credit to NAMCO</figcaption></figure>



<p>G’AIM’E has collaborated with Bandai Namco to deliver a “Custom licensed version of TIME CRISIS™, faithfully recreated from the original arcade ROM to give you a new and unique arcade experience!” per the official <a href="https://www.mygaime.com/product-tcgun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">G’AIM’E</a> site. You have to hand it to the team as <strong>Time Crisis plays and runs beautifully</strong>. It looks and feels crispier than last night’s pizza, air-fried to perfection. Its constant peek and cover gameplay was revolutionary at the time, and you traverse three full acts of escalating, endlessly replayable combat scenarios.</p>



<p>It’s not the case for most people, but the Point Plank addition is what piqued my interest in G’AIM’E. I grew up playing it at home; <strong>it was <em>my </em>Time Crisis</strong>. I’ve shot so many flying meteors, flaming torches, UFOs, and skeletons that I get real-life PTSD at carnival games. It’s a bunch of quickfire, target-based mini-games using (sometimes protecting) the mecurial duo of Dr. Dan and Dr. Don. It’s so addictive, it’s just as much fun as it was in 1994, and it’s still <em>so </em>hard!</p>



<p>Again, Point Blank is for Premium and Ultimate owners, as is Steel Gunner 1 &amp; 2. While I don’t think you’ll log as many hours in these as Time Crisis or Point Blank, they round out a neat little collection, which brings me to my other concern—longevity and price. Taking off my nostalgia glasses and putting on my critical hat, let’s look at this objectively. Time Crisis takes about 20 minutes to complete, Steel Gunner 1 and 2 playthroughs are about the same, and a quick volley of 16 Point Blank mini-games (17 with the firework finale) is over in roughly 10-15 minutes.</p>



<p>Time Crisis and Point Blank aren’t the home console versions, meaning the Special Mode—which I think is cooler than the main story, as it changes your route depending on your speed and accuracy—isn’t available for Time Crisis. On the other hand, Point Blank is missing all the extra Party and Story Mode features. These would’ve added to the overall package and replayability, but I understand this probably wasn’t possible due to licensing issues. Your mileage with the G’AIM’E packages will vary.</p>



<p>The Basic edition is <strong>$99.99/£99.99</strong>, Premium is <strong>$149.99/£149.99</strong>, and Ultimate costs <strong>$199.99/£199.99</strong>. Paying just under $100 for what is a 20-minute game won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. I think Premium and Ultimate are the way to go, and hand on heart, I probably would’ve opted for Ultimate myself because of the extra gun, as you can play Point Blank and the Steel Gunner games with a friend. It’s been confirmed that each mini-console can’t add new games, meaning any further game expansions will likely require another box and another purchase.</p>



<h2 id="h-g-aim-e-review-verdict">G’AIM’E Review Verdict</h2>



<p>To reiterate, other third-party lightguns and configurations exist—as do expensive cabinets—but this is easily the most accessible and sophisticated lightgun setup in the world. Plug, play, and enjoy pew-pew paradise. I recommend a Premium or Ultimate edition, as you get the best of everything this way. Time Crisis is lightgun heritage, and Point Blank is a timeless classic that you can replay over and over. Old school CRT-enthusiasts might raise an eyebrow at the mostly-solid AI tech, and the price point is definitely worth a conversation.</p>



<p>But at the end of the day, G’AIM’E is exactly what I have been crying out for: A quick and convenient way to enjoy legendary lightgun gaming.</p>

      </div>
<p>Take-Two's latest earnings report revealed that Mafia: The Old Country quickly outperformed the company's expectations for it. "What we suspected was confirmed," Zelnick said in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "Which is just… if you give consumers a great narrative experience that's a lot of fun, somewhat contained, and at a fair price, then you can have the perfect result."</p><p>In the earnings call, Zelnick said that The Old Country's success means we can expect to see more cinematic titles in the same vein from Hangar 13, both in the Mafia franchise and in "future creative pursuits."</p><p>The Old Country's success was a high point in Take-Two's earning call, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">latest GTA 6 delay</a> causing the company's stock price to plummet, and the company revealing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-came-in-below-take-twos-sales-expectations/1100-6536020/" data-ref-id="1100-6536020">Borderlands 4 didn't perform as well</a> as Take-Two wanted.</p><p>Take-Two subsidiary Rockstar Games is also under fire, having been accused of union-busting over the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">recent firing of over 30 staff members</a>.

<p>Yes, it was quite an eventful night last night. While I was curled up under the covers watching Amandaland (it's hilarious), the industry was reacting to not just one but two video game delays from two pretty big IPs.</p>

<p>Notably, the studio did not share a new release window with its community.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Rockstar Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the second GTA VI delay. Originally slated to launch in Fall 2025, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was moved to May 26, 2026</a> on May 2, 2025. However, the studio has now requested more time to polish the game, which will launch on November 19, 2026.</p>



<p>The news came just before Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two, announced its Q2 2026 financial results. Predictably, investors questioned Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick on the matter during the earnings call; the executive stated that this new GTA VI delay will allow Rockstar not only to surpass but also to exceed the incredibly high expectations of fans. Furthermore, Zelnick highlighted that the developer and publisher had never regretted delaying their games before, whereas some other players in the industry had decided not to delay their games and suffered as a result. Here's the exact quote:</p>



<p><em>The drivers are the desire to deliver as perfect an entertainment experience as we possibly can and to try to live up to consumers’ extraordinary expectations and then exceed those expectations. It is always painful when we move a date. We have done so occasionally in the past, and we have never regretted it in retrospect. I would like to point out that we have some competitors that, in the event where more polish was required and it required slipping a date, they chose not to slip the date, and they did so at their peril.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, Rockstar previously delayed key games. Grand Theft Auto IV and V were both delayed once, and Red Dead Redemption 2 got delayed twice. We also know that Rockstar doesn't settle for anything short of extraordinary, and with the sequel to GTA V, the bar is even higher considering that it's the second best-selling premium game of all time after Minecraft.</p>



<p>While the GTA VI delay was clearly the big news of the day, the earnings call also saw questions about other recent releases, such as Gearbox's Borderlands 4. Zelnick admitted that Borderlands 4, despite a strong critical reception, was selling a bit less than expected, and attributed that to the widely reported PC optimization 'challenges' at launch. Still, the executive expressed confidence that over time, the game's performance would be 'very solid' and in line with the original estimates. On the other hand, Mafia: The Old Country was reported as having better than anticipated sales, which probably means we'll get another game in that vein (narrative-focused, relatively short, budget-priced).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Warhorse Studios, the creator of the Kingdom Come franchise, has revealed that the second game in the critically-acclaimed series is <strong>free to play </strong>this weekend, exclusively on Xbox. Earlier this year, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was released to an overwhelmingly positive reception, and many believe it’s lining up for several Game of the Year awards.</p>



<p>It’s the twilight period for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, with the game’s final DLC dropping soon, bringing an end to years of development and evolution. If you’ve never played the ambitious open-world epic, now is the time.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-free-this-weekend">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is Free This Weekend</h2>



<p>If you own an Xbox Series X or an Xbox Series S console, you can play Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 for free this weekend. It’s a no-strings-attached kind of deal, and it’s set to run hand-in-hand with one of the biggest discounts ever applied to the game.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we published our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review</a>, dubbing the game a ‘monumental medieval masterpiece’. It was years in the making, borne of a Kickstarter campaign that began more than a decade ago.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The free play window for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is set to run from November 6 (yesterday) to November 10, giving you plenty of time to soak up all that the stellar title has to offer.</p>



<p>It won’t be enough, though. That’s why the massive discount has been arranged, so if you want to keep up your adventures with Henry of Skalitz, you can do so by purchasing the game at the lowest price it has ever boasted.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ll be playing Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 this weekend.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-devs-tricks-up-sleeve-cheaters/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-devs-have-%E2%80%98tricks-up-their-sleeve%E2%80%99-to-combat-cheaters.1346602/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, Nikita Buyanov, revealed that extra effort is being applied to take care of cheaters when 1.0 is released later this month. As one of the biggest concerns around, fans are worried that cheaters will negatively impact the game’s launch, which has been building for <strong>a decade</strong>.</p>



<p>Buyanov has explained that years of ‘hatred’ haven’t prevented a ‘huge department’ from working ‘day and night’ to produce new methods to combat cheaters in the spearhead extraction shooter game.</p>



<h2 id="h-cheaters-be-damned-in-escape-from-tarkov">Cheaters Be Damned in Escape from Tarkov</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/escape-from-tarkov/1-0-steam-cheating-measures-battlestate-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent interview</a>, Nikita Buyanov, the prolific leader of Battlestate Games, explained how the company has ‘a few tricks up our sleeve for the release’ of Escape from Tarkov. This is in reference to combating the cheaters that have plagued the game for years, causing one of the most consistent issues around.</p>



<p>It’s one of the reasons why so many players have turned to PvE over the last year and a half, removing other players from their experience and eradicating the concern of cheating.</p>



<p>Buyanov explained how the studio has remained stalwart despite years of criticism:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is truly unfortunate and somewhat upsetting to read all kinds of comments over the years and navigate through waves of hatred, as if we are not doing anything.</p>



<p>We have a huge department working on this, banning players day and night and coming up with new methods. But it’s impossible to change the players’ opinions. And that can be depressing at times. To be honest, to some extent, this emotional background is very discouraging and frustrating. But we’re used to it. It’s a never-ending race, and we’ve never given up and don’t intend to give up.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recently, the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-rewards-revealed-pre-order/">revealed the rewards</a> coming to all Escape from Tarkov owners when the game goes live on November 15. There’s a pack incoming, including exclusive outfits, dogtag models, hideout customization elements, and more.</p>



<p>Also on November 15, Escape from Tarkov will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-i-need-to-buy-escape-from-tarkov-steam-again/">released on Steam</a>, marking the first time that the game has been available outside Battlestate Games’ proprietary launcher.</p>



<p>Do you believe that cheaters will be taken care of when Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release is here? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>So, after being capped at around 30fps on the Switch, depending on the amount of players participating, you'll soon be able to enjoy Sonic's latest racer at double the frame rate. Of course, there's also the higher resolution and improved visuals.</p>
<p>The same FAQ reveals a <strong>16GB</strong> storage requirement, as well as cross-platform matchmaking on Switch 2. And once again, the physical version will include the "full base game" on a 64GB cartridge.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition arrives digitally on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>, and the upgrade pack for existing Switch owners is currently 50% off.</p>

<p>In a post on GTA Forums that was later verified by the site’s admins, a former Rockstar Games employee divulged information about the recent controversy that saw more than 30 employees suddenly dismissed from the company. In the words of Rockstar, they were fired for leaking game information in a Discord server, but that might not be the case.</p>



<p>As the user posted, nobody was leaking anything in the private Discord server that contained only Rockstar Games employees, but instead, they were using it to discuss unionization in a bid to encourage change at Rockstar Games for the better.</p>



<p>It has been alleged that Rockstar Games fired these employees for taking part in this activity.</p>



<h2 id="h-former-rockstar-employees-are-lashing-out">Former Rockstar Employees Are Lashing Out</h2>



<p>The lengthy post on <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1004182-rockstar-games-alleged-union-busting/#comment-1072605777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the GTA Forums</a> reveals a tale of heartbreak and disappointment at the sudden dismissal of more than 30 Rockstar Games employees in the United Kingdom and Canada.</p>



<p>In the post, the user named ‘Organize’, who joined the forums in June, revealed that Rockstar Games broke several UK employment laws when dismissing staff on grounds of gross misconduct. Many have claimed this was a thinly veiled attempt to bust unionization efforts.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Last week, my colleagues who were in the studio were each individually messaged by HR for a short friendly meeting, under the friendly guise of “Hey, are you free for a quick chat?”</p>



<p>Upon attending this meeting they were handed an envelope with a short letter stating that their employment had been terminated for “gross misconduct” regarding posts made in Discord.</p>



<p>They failed to provide any evidence when asked, nor was any stated in the letter. And did not divulge any other information or reasoning – “and no other reason”</p>



<p>They refused their right to Union representation in the disciplinary meeting (which is against UK employment law) and were frogmarched out of the studio with the meeting lasting less than 5 minutes.</p>



<p>For colleagues who were not in the Studio that day, they received a phone call from HR that lasted less than 2 minutes telling them they were fired and that they’d receive the same letter as above. I am aware of one employee who had a panic attack at this moment, and HR hung up on them during this panic attack not caring at all about their wellbeing.</p>



<p>These colleagues of mine were hard workers who have spent many many years at R* in critical roles. With colleagues who have been at R* for more that 18 years and none of them have ever had a disciplinary in that time. They are not easily replaced and will certainly affect us in making our project deadlines.</p>



<p>These are very senior artists, animators, QA testers, designers, programmers and producers. Including Leads. All super talented people who were proud of their work over multiple R* titles, and all they wanted was the best for R* and their fellow colleagues.</p>



<p>Some of these members were off sick, recovering from surgery or on paternity leave. Fired without pay, losing their careers and putting them into hardship in the lead up to Christmas, and even potentially losing their VISAs to work in the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me make this clear! I never saw any discussion/leaking of Rockstar projects in the Union Discord. The only ever discussion was around unionisation efforts and the working conditions at R*. The Discord wasn’t public. It was a private Discord group that only contained R* employees and the IWGB Union officials.</p>



<p>This was Union Busting and nothing else! Everyone fired was a Union Member, they were also predominantly from those who were on the Union Organising Committees of each UK studio.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The user revealed that almost enough members had been reached to ‘seek recognition and begin engaging in collective bargaining.’</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They have fired over 34 of us now. There were over 250 of us in that Union/Employee Discord group. There is the fear that if they get away with this, they’ll have nothing stopping them from doing this again and again.</p>



<p>Those of us who are lucky and remain for now work in fear! Fearful when talking to each other at the tea prep, fearful that we’re next in line and are easily got rid of, too scared to go outside the studio and talk to (or even acknowledge) our colleagues outside protesting in fear of reprisals. Morale in the studio is at rock bottom. When we should be excited about what’s to come over the next year we are now totally deflated and our trust and confidence in others is totally shot.</p>



<p>Which is the truly heartbreaking part, as for us in the Union, all of our ambition was to make R* a happier, fairer, safer and more equitable place. That’s all. What has happened clearly shows that we care more about the wellbeing of our colleagues at Rockstar than the Company does.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This would have allowed the employees to address key issues in the company: ‘worsening crunch, inadequate pay, and inflexible working arrangements.’ To protest the firing of these Rockstar Games employees, the IWGB union and former employees <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-rockstar-workers-protest-take-two/">marched on Take-Two’s London office</a> yesterday.</p>



<p>In recent Rockstar Games news, Grand Theft Auto 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/">was delayed by several months</a> and will now be released on November 19, 2026, rather than May 26, 2026.</p>

<p>In a new TikTok ad, it was once again teased that Rogue and Gambit are coming to Marvel Rivals. Fans were quick to spot and screenshot the images, but it became tough to replicate it until a Marvel Rivals leaks page uncovered the ad and confirmed it was real.</p>



<p>Rogue and Gambit would join a roster of more than 40 playable heroes from across the Marvel Universe, and they’re expected to arrive on November 14 when the game’s fifth season goes live.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-rogue-and-gambit-coming-to-marvel-rivals">Are Rogue and Gambit Coming to Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>The imminent arrival of Rogue and Gambit has been teased in recent patch notes, with eagle-eyed players spotting the characters in the background of an image posted by NetEase.</p>



<p>On November 14, the game’s fifth season will drop, and many believe that’s when Rogue and Gambit will surface as the latest new characters.</p>



<p>In a recent TikTok ad, art of the two characters was revealed. It was picked up by Marvel Rivals pages on social media and shared around before <a href="https://xcancel.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1986491569122299996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XOX LEAK confirmed</a> the content’s validity.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans are wondering why NetEase hasn’t dropped the trailer for season five yet, which would undoubtedly reveal the presence of Rogue and Gambit as new playable heroes.</p>



<p>There are rumors that the trailer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">season five</a> will be released on November 11, revealing everything coming in the supersized update.</p>



<p>In recent news related to the game, one of the most prominent esports organisations in the business <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sentinels-announce-marvel-rivals-esports-exit/">left Marvel Rivals</a> and made quips about how NetEase isn’t effectively supporting the ecosystem.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-sales-results-softer-than-expected/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4%E2%80%99s-sales-results-were-%E2%80%98softer%E2%80%99-than-expected-take-two-says.1346581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Take-Two has been in a sticky spot of late. The company faced a protest yesterday in London as former Rockstar employees unfairly dismissed were joined by union members outside Take-Two’s office in the heart of the United Kingdom. Then, an announcement of another GTA 6 delay caused the company’s stock value to plummet by 10%.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, Strauss Zelnick, confirmed that Borderlands 4 also failed to meet expectations, adding another layer of woe to the Take-Two story this year.</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-didn-t-do-as-well-as-everyone-thought">Borderlands 4 Didn’t Do as Well as Everyone Thought</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick confirmed that, while Borderlands 4 had a great launch, it failed to wow with sales figures, and the numbers were ultimately ‘softer’ than the company would have liked.</p>



<p>Here’s the quote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The critical acclaim for Borderlands 4 was superb, and we’re really happy with the release.</p>



<p>Equally, as you know, there were some challenges with the Steam release. Gearbox has been addressing those challenges and will continue to do so. In terms of units sold out of the gate, the numbers were <strong>a little softer than we would have liked</strong>. In the fullness of time, we think it’s going to do great.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That means that Zelnick expects Borderlands 4 to keep selling as time goes on, even if the game is already slipping far down the charts in favor of other, more recent titles.</p>



<p>In recent Take-Two news, the publisher found itself in hot water over the delay of Grand Theft Auto 6. While many thought it would be the case, it caused Take-Two’s stock value to drop by around 10%, representative of the shaken faith of investors.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-5-878-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-880-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-friday-november-7.1346578/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the end of the week – congratulations on making it this far! I hope your NYT Connections streak is still looking clean and consistent. I’m here today to support that goal, bringing you today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions, allowing you to solve today’s puzzle in the quickest way possible.</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections hints and answers you need for today.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-7">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 7)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #880:</p>



<ul>
<li>HULA HOOP</li>



<li>EGGPLANT</li>



<li>SALSA VERDE</li>



<li>BAGEL</li>



<li>SWING STATE</li>



<li>RELISH</li>



<li>ANIMAL PRINT</li>



<li>POLKA DOT</li>



<li>WASHER</li>



<li>BARNEY THE DINOSAUR</li>



<li>PESTO</li>



<li>HOUNDSTOOTH</li>



<li>INNER TUBE</li>



<li>CHIMICHURRI</li>



<li>HERRINGBONE</li>



<li>PEOPLE EATER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of what you might see on a fashionable coat or a retro couch</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Zesty, herby, and often spooned over grilled meats or sandwiches</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Round and hollow — some edible, some inflatable</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These words are feeling kind of purple</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 7.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-7-880">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 7 (#880)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– ANIMAL PRINT, HERRINGBONE, HOUNDSTOOTH, POLKA DOT</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CHIMICHURRI, PESTO, RELISH, SALSA VERDE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BAGEL, HULA HOOP, INNER TUBE, WASHER</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BARNEY THE DINOSAUR, EGGPLANT, PEOPLE EATER, SWING STATE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
