            <link>https://kotaku.com/save-space-and-boost-efficiency-with-ankers-675-usb-c-docking-station-while-its-going-for-32-less-2000648509</link>

              <p>Docking stations are a great way to manage multiple devices on your desk without cord clutter. You plug everything into a single unit and keep it beside your monitor for easy access. But what if we told you there’s an even more efficient way of doing things?</p>
<p>Anker’s 675 USB-C Docking Station doubles as a monitor stand and lets you connect up to 12 devices at the same time! <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/">On a regular day, it would run you around $250, but all thanks to Black Friday, you can grab one for just $170 today.</a> That’s after a massive 32% discount. Even better, you’ll enjoy free shipping with your purchase, whether you’re a Prime member or not. The main sale event is technically over, and Cyber Monday is still a couple of days away. This lingering deal is a great way to save on an efficient charging solution if you missed grabbing it yesterday and can’t wait for Monday!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Saves Space</h2>
<p>It looks like a regular monitor/laptop stand, even though it’s anything but that. You’re getting a bunch of ports on the side, including a 100W max USB-C upstream port, 3 USB-A ports, 2 USB-C ports, SD/microSD card slots, a 4K HDMI port, a wireless charging pad, and an Ethernet port. That’s everything you need to connect all your essentials, plus a few extras, without feeling limited. Place your monitor on the top, and then add a keyboard, external storage, headphones, and more. The wireless charging pad makes it easy to top up your smartphone while you’re busy being productive. All of us have our phones on our workstations anyway, so it’s a great way to juice them up instead of letting them sit idle. The 100W max USB-C upstream port charges your laptop as you work, just as well. Note that the dock does not support display via any of the USB-C ports. You can only do that using the single HDMI port. It shouldn’t be a problem, though, unless you’re looking for a bigger, multi-monitor setup with three or four screens.</p>
<p>There’s some space under the dock that you can use to store your keyboard and mouse when not in use. Just push them under once you’re done working, and come back to a clean, tidy setup the next day. Raising your monitor to your eye level also promotes a better posture, as you can easily sit up straight instead of slouching.</p>



<p>Exceptional stability comes from an Aircraft-Grade aluminum alloy body with an anti-slip silicone strip for sturdiness. The curved edge design makes the overall look and feel premium. It’s built to blend into any workstation, from the most basic ones to those that have quite a lot going on in terms of personality. Getting started is straightforward, as just plugging your laptop in wakes your entire workstation up. The dock plays nicely with a wide range of laptops and monitors, including Dell XPS, Lenovo, iMac, MacBook, and more. OS-wise, it works well with Windows 10 and 11, plus macOS 10.14 and above.</p>
<p>The package comes with the docking station, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/"> The current deal brings the price down to just $170, which is basically nothing for the features it offers.</a> You’re saving a nice $80 on a solution that’s going to make your workstation much more efficient and a whole lot cleaner.</p>

<figure data-uuid="72449c02573ec"><a title="Kir air riders city trial map" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/72449c02573ec/kir-air-riders-city-trial-map.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Right, it's been out a week now, so it seems like enough time should have passed that we can start having a little chat about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, and in particular its stellar City Trial mode.</p>
<p><em>"Stellar? It's a chaotic mess!"</em> Indeed it is, and well met, my friend. However, that's exactly why it's so damn good, so stop shouting at me.</p>
<p>Also, it's only a mess when you don't know what you're doing. That's right, and as I tried to impress in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">my 8/10 review</a>, once you know what you're doing in Kirby Air Riders, and once you take that knowledge with you into the online realm...well, it's a surprisingly strategic thing. There's a way to play well and a way to play badly, and luck doesn't come into it nearly as much as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a>, with its back-of-the-pack power-up boosts and blue shell upsets.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adwuogmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Nope. If you know the score in City Trials, as is the case with any race on any track in this game, you'll reap the rewards directly, and so being able to quickly grab the best power-ups (that's all those ludicrously massive icons that littler the arena) alongside a proper knowledge of the fastest routes, most protected avenues, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-how-to-reach-city-trials-floating-garden-and-floating-island">secret areas</a>, and all that jazz, will make you a winner. Oh, wonderful skill-based racing with a high-skill ceiling - you <em>were</em> hiding in there all along.</p>

<p>So. Given that I'm rightly enamoured with the air riding here, and given that I've been so impressed by a game that manages to remove acceleration control (one of the best bits of driving) whilst still remaining more strategic and engaging than other racers of its ilk, it's shame to have a complaint, but I do.</p>
<p>As we reported a little while back, Kirby Air Riders creator and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> guru Masahiro Sakurai has said that there will <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/sakurai-has-no-plans-for-kirby-air-riders-dlc-everything-is-here">not be any more DLC for the game</a>. Sad (and also slightly spoiled) face. And it's a sad face because as much as I adore City Trial, I think its biggest strengths are drawn from and highlighted by its map - as a map you have to learn so well.</p>
<p>However, in having to get so very familiar with it to succeed against the best that online play can throw at you, only having the one to play on is something that's gonna limit my time with this one, and maybe, ultimately, bring it to a premature end.</p>
<p>If I was aware of even one new City Trial map coming down the pipeline, I'd be confident in the fact that Kirby Air Riders would remain on my Switch 2 indefinitely. And it still may do, by the way, because I just can't get enough of Rick.</p>
<p><em>Why</em>? Well, because he's a huge and cuddly hamster and I love him. But that's a different story.</p>

<p>No, what I mean is <em>why</em> can't we just have one more map? It's not an issue in any way in the rest of the game's modes, and the minigames that see out a round of City Trial are superb - nothing needs doing there.</p>
<p>Indeed, I fully feel as though Sakurai is being 100% genuine in his "<em>Everything is here...I've thrown everything I have into this game from the start"</em> statement when announcing that DLC was a no-go. I just...can't we just have even one more? (How hard can it be to design a breathtakingly brilliant map that works in solo <em>and</em> online play for player counts that vary wildly? I mean, <em>come on.</em>)</p>
<p>There's a ton of content here when you dig into Air Ride, there's endless reams of stuff to unlock and collect in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-all-playable-characters-and-how-to-unlock-for-every-game-mode">characters</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-all-tracks-and-how-to-unlock">tracks</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-all-machines-and-how-to-unlock">machines</a> in Road Trip, but the very nature of City Trials, with its hyper-fixation on this single (admittedly large and very well thought-out) Skyah map, surely means that it'll only continue to thrive and surprise if they chuck more maps in there for the long-term riders to tuck into.</p>
<p>C'mon, Nintendo. Let us feast on the fun of learning another area inside out whilst crushing our foes in online match-ups.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple Keeps the M5 MacBook Pro at All-Time Low as It Begins Clearing Out Post–Black Friday Stock]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apples-2025-macbook-pro-dropped-to-its-lowest-price-ever-for-black-friday-2000648462</link>
            <guid>1368034</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday and Cyber Week are upon us. Now is the time to save big on tech stuff, home good, and everything else under the sun. Been thinking about upgrading your laptop? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6078/">Amazon is offering the Apple MacBook Pro at its lowest price yet, with a 16% discount that slashes $251 off the regular price, bringing it down to just $1,349</a>. If you’ve been eyeing this powerhouse laptop, there’s no better time to grab it.</p>
<p data-start="484" data-end="1070">This particular model is the 2025 version of the MacBook Pro, featuring Apple’s latest M5 chip, built to handle even the most demanding tasks. The M5 is equipped with a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, delivering exceptional performance for everything from creative work to software development. The 16GB of memory and 512GB SSD ensure smooth multitasking and plenty of storage space for your files, apps, and media. This MacBook Pro can tackle everything from heavy video editing project to coding to everyday tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6078/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="484" data-end="1070">Built for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p data-start="1072" data-end="1516">AI has taken over the zeitgeist so its unsurprising Apple’s marketing around the M5 chip is leading with the buzzword. It’s been engineered for what Apple calls “Apple Intelligence,” making it powerful enough for automatically compiling tons of code, responding to AI prompts, and generating images based solely on descriptions. Whether you engage with AI or now, the chip’s power still translates into faster performance and more efficiency, so you can get more done in less time.</p>
<p data-start="1518" data-end="1947">Battery life on the 2025 MacBook Pro is exceptional. Thanks to the M5 chip, you can expect up to 24 hours of continuous use on a single charge, which is an incredible improvement over Intel-based MacBook Pro models. In fact, this is up to 14 times longer battery life than previous Intel versions, allowing you to work, stream, and browse for hours without worrying about finding an outlet.</p>
<p data-start="1949" data-end="2358">The MacBook Pro’s 14.2-inch Liquid Retina display is another highlight. The screen boasts an impressive 1,600 nits of brightness and supports a wide color gamut, delivering vibrant, true-to-life colors that will make all your photos, videos, and creative projects pop. The display’s able to render one billion colors, ensuring incredible detail and accuracy when watching a movie or editing photos.</p>


<p data-start="2360" data-end="2782">For those who rely on video calls—whether for work, school, or just catching up with loved ones—the MacBook Pro has some great little features . The built-in 12MP camera shoots in full 1080p HD, ensuring that you always look your best during meetings or virtual hangouts. The three-microphone array works alongside the six-speaker system to create an immersive sound experience, using spatial audio technology to ensure clear audio on both ends of the call.</p>
<p data-start="2784" data-end="3289">The camera also features Apple’s Center Stage, which uses AI to automatically adjust the camera’s angle as you move, ensuring you remain centered in the frame throughout video calls. No matter where you are in the room, Center Stage keeps you in view. This feature is compatible with pretty much all the popular video call apps like FaceTime and Zoom.</p>
<p data-start="3291" data-end="3572">This model is available in two elegant color options: space black and silver, so you can choose the one that best suits your style. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6078/">Both are on sale for Cyber Monday at its all-time low price of just $1,349.</a></p>

            <p>A new Dead Rising game is reportedly in development.</p>
<p>While there's been no formal word of a follow-up game, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-dead-rising-game-development-set-in-hollywood">mp1st</a> claims Capcom has another "major" Dead Rising project in the works, reportedly set in Hollywood.</p>

<p>According to the site's sources, the game has been in development since 2023. Codenamed 'Rec', it reportedly sees the return of Frank West and <em>may</em> be a direct sequel to the 2006 zombie game (the source seemingly wouldn't confirm either way). Isabela Keyes and the game's signature Psychopaths will also be returning.</p>
<p>For those who can't remember that far back, 2010's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-rising-2">Dead Rising 2</a> boasted similar gameplay to the original game, but featured a completely different character. West only returned in Dead Rising 2's Case West DLC.</p>
<p>That's not all, either. The same source claims the main villain will be "an extravagant and deranged film director who forces Frank and other survivors into various trials, all in the pursuit of filming his 'perfect movie'."</p>
<p>We'll also see the return of his "time limit mechanic" and his infamous camera. Sadly, there's no firm commitment to a release date at this stage, though.</p>
<p>We gave last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-review">Dead Rising's Deluxe Remaster a middling three out of five stars</a>, writing "the over-the-top zombie shenanigans still hold up in 2024, but next to the remaster from 2016, this is definitely geared more toward first-time players than returning fans."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/day-after-black-friday-ends-microsoft-suddenly-offloads-xbox-controllers-at-record-low-2000648669</link>
            <guid>1368025</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Since Black Friday Week started, Amazon has sold hundreds of thousands of Xbox controllers. Even though it’s now the weekend after Thanksgiving, there are still great deals on these gaming essentials but the problem is that a lot of the color options are already sold out. However, the famous <em>Carbon Black</em> version is still available this Saturday morning and is now at its lowest price ever: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">$39, down from its usual price of $64</a>. This is the <strong>2025 model with all the newest features</strong> and at this price, you’re getting Microsoft’s best controller for almost 40% less than what you’d normally pay.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play on Any Platforms</h2>
<p>The new Xbox wireless controller has some important improvements over older models. For example, it works with more than just traditional gaming setups as you can can<strong> connect this controller to your Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows PC, Android devices, iOS devices, Fire TV Sticks, smart TVs, and even VR headsets</strong> without wires using Bluetooth. You only need to buy one controller that works with all of your devices so you don’t have to switch between different peripherals for different platforms.</p>
<p>Microsoft improved the ergonomics by adding a <strong>textured grip to the triggers, bumpers, and back case</strong>. This makes it easier to control the game for long periods of time. The hybrid D-pad has a faceted design that makes it easier to make both sweeping and exact directional inputs. This makes a big difference in fighting games and platformers where every input counts. The <strong>controller also has a dedicated Share button</strong> that lets you take screenshots and video clips without stopping the game which makes it easier to make content if you like streaming or just want to save special moments.</p>



<p>The included AA batteries last a long time and <strong>give you up to 40 hours of gameplay</strong>. If you want to use rechargeable batteries instead, you can switch to the Play and Charge Kit. You can now keep a stable connection up to 30 feet away from your device, which gives you more options for how to set up your gaming area. Dynamic latency input technology makes the time between pressing a button and an action on the screen shorter. This makes the game feel more responsive, which competitive gamers will love, but casual gamers will also benefit from it.</p>
<p>The Carbon Black color is the <strong>classic Xbox look that never goes out of style</strong>: It has a matte finish that doesn’t show fingerprints as easily as glossy finishes. The housing is sturdy and doesn’t flex or creak, and the buttons give satisfying feedback without being too loud. You can also use the Xbox Accessories app to change the buttons on your controller to fit your needs for certain games or accessibility, which is more customization than most third-party controllers offer.</p>
<p>For $39, you get the newest controller technology from Microsoft which is less than what last generation’s model usually costs. The price is at an all-time low, and the improvements coming in 2025 will make it even better.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Razer Blackshark V3 PRO—Even Better Than Brilliant]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/review-razer-blackshark-v3-pro/</link>
            <guid>1368022</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Razer Blackshark V2 Pro was my go-to headset for the longest time, and it was also the pick of many of the world’s best esports pro players. That’s why I was elated when Razer revealed the Blackshark V3 Pro, the next generation of the award-winning headset, packed with upgraded technology but retaining the classic, flawless aesthetic that we all knew and loved.</p>



<p>The Razer Blackshark V3 Pro is out now and selling like hot cakes. In this review, I’m breaking down exactly why this headset is worth every penny of the somewhat expensive price tag.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-razer-blackshark-v3-pro-worth-269-99">Is the Razer Blackshark V3 Pro Worth $269.99?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing this review, the Razer Blackshark V3 Pro had a price tag of $269.99, which might seem exorbitant to some. However, the technology that’s packed into this headset more than makes the tag worthwhile, and there’s a reason why the world’s best pro players, especially those in the Call of Duty space, rely on this device.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the fundamentals. This is a wireless ANC headset, which means that when you’re playing, you’re unencumbered by cables and you won’t hear a thing around you. You’re completely in the zone and loving life, and that’s what this headset is all about.</p>



<p>It uses Razer’s Hyperspeed technology to ensure you’re getting low-latency connections that deliver your audio as clearly and efficiently as possible, which is of the utmost importance for <strong>any gamer</strong>, as audio desync is a harrowing issue that prevents the pinnacle of performance being delivered.</p>



<p>If you’re playing as part of a team, you’ve got the Hyperclear, detachable boom mic, which has a fat pop filter to keep your vocals clean and your callouts succinct. I used the boom mic on a range of software to test it out, from OBS to Audacity, and from Discord to in-game voice chats, and I can confirm it’s just as clear as most desktop podcast microphones, which is <strong>nice</strong>.</p>



<p>The Razer Blackshark V3 Pro comes in a range of designs, from black to white, and from ‘esports green’ to a special-edition Counter-Strike 2 version. I’m a <strong>huge </strong>fan of the esports green variant, which is available exclusively from Razer, but for my review of this headset, I used the clean white version.</p>



<p>For this new generation of the Razer Blackshark headset, the tech titan has pumped new technology behind the cups. The extremely capable drivers have been tweaked to reduce harmonic distortion, the bass range has been improved, and the directional audio capabilities are second-to-none, thanks to the THX Spatial on-board mechanics.</p>



<p>Put simply, you’ll hear a foot scraping on the floor across the map and be able to pinpoint exactly where it came from.</p>



<p>It gets better, though.</p>



<p>The Razer Blackshark V3 Pro has <strong>quad mode</strong> connectivity, which means it can work with 2.4Ghz wireless bands, Bluetooth, USB inputs, <strong>or </strong>via a 3.5mm cable. The battery is also nuts, and without ANC turned on, you can get up to 70 hours of battery life. The only negative I have about the headset is that it could really do with a dock of some kind to make charging more ‘comfortable’ and seamless.</p>



<p>That’s why I love the Astro A50 Gen 5, after all.</p>



<p>Interchangeable faceplates, app control, customization through the Razer Synapse software, and incredible levels of comfort thanks to a low-weight profile and comfy cushioning all come together to make this one of the best headsets on the market right now for both casual and pro gamers.</p>



<p>Don’t sleep on the Razer Blackshark V3 Pro.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Razer Raiju V3 PRO Review—An Elite Alternative to Scuf and Battle Beaver]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/razer-raiju-v3-pro-review/</link>
            <guid>1368019</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re in the market for a ‘pro-grade’ controller and are considering a Scuf or a Battle Beaver, put those thoughts on hold. Instead, take a look at the Razer Raiju V3 Pro, an all-new device that’s customizable, capable, and created by the best technical minds at Razer, one of the most reputable gaming brands around.</p>



<p>In this Razer Raiju V3 Pro review, I’ll help you understand why this is one of the best alternatives to the eye-wateringly expensive pro controllers on the market, and why it’s definitely worth your investment.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-razer-raiju-v3-pro-worth-219-99">Is the Razer Raiju V3 Pro Worth $219.99?</h2>



<p>The Razer Raiju V3 Pro will set you back a pretty penny, but it’s worth every cent. I’ve been trialling this wonderful controller for a couple of weeks on <strong>both </strong>PlayStation and PC as I write this, and I have had a brilliant time. I’ve used it across Battlefield 6, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and ARC Raiders, and in every situation put before me, the controller has excelled.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the build.</p>



<p>The controller is bigger than your average Dualsense controller, but it uses a similar mapping in terms of thumbsticks and face buttons. It has the classic trackpad that you’ve learned to associate with PlayStation controllers, but the triggers and shoulder buttons are more reminiscent of an Xbox controller. It’s the perfect hybrid, in my eyes.</p>



<p>You’ve got two extra buttons alongside the shoulder inputs, and up to <strong>four </strong>tactile inputs on the back, all of which are hot-swappable and customizable in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>The thumbsticks are modular and can be swapped out just as quickly, and you get extras in the attractive carry pack that the controller comes in to suit your needs.</p>



<p>Additionally, almost every input on the controller is ‘mouse-click’ in build, the triggers come with stops that you can switch on and off to suit your game, and the entire thing is wrapped up in a comfortable, durable shell that looks great and feels nice in your hands.</p>



<p>It’s as premium as you can get, and it still comes in under the cost of a Scuf or a Battle Beaver.</p>



<p>But wait, <strong>there’s more!</strong></p>



<p>The Razer Raiju V3 Pro can be further adjusted with Razer’s Synapse software, which includes creating on-board profiles, setting actuation points, adjusting deadzones, remapping inputs, and so on.</p>



<p>If you want to use the controller wirelessly on a PS5, you’re covered. If you’d rather go wired on a PC, you can do that too – and you can switch between those inputs easily enough. The Razer Raiju V3 Pro is marketed as a ‘lag-free, esports-grade’ device, which means you have lightning-fast response times and super-low latency inputs.</p>



<p>It’s expensive, but that’s the point. It’s a premium controller that’ll suit the best pro players in the world, and it has been crafted in collaboration with those very competitors, especially in the Call of Duty space. It takes a while to get used to the inputs if you’ve never used a controller like this, but it’s well worth investing that time to seek those results in-game.</p>



<p>I can’t fault the Razer Raiju V3 Pro controller, and that’s rare for me when it comes to reviewing peripherals.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-quest-darkwater-review-cant-stop-rot</link>
            <guid>1368007</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A rot that started long ago in the Jade Abbey has surged, making a final push, seeking to taint the sacred water of the Everspring. One of its former keepers has gathered a group to stop this from happening, hoping to save the entire realm from falling entirely to the Chaos god Nurgle. <em>Warhammer Quest</em> is back! In this spoiler-free article, we check out the brand new set, <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em>.</p>

<p>We've covered previous editions of <i>Warhammer Quest</i> on the site, including the futuristic <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> iteration, <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/on-tabletop-warhammer-quest-blackstone-fortress" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Blackstone Fortress</a>, and the horror-filled streets of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-quest-cursed-city-preview" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Cursed City</a>.</p>




<h2>What's the Quest?</h2>

<p>The original <i>Warhammer Quest </i>hit tabletops in 1995, following the earlier success of <em>HeroQuest</em>, which has also seen a recent revival. Games Workshop brought <em>Warhammer Quest</em> back in 2016, and since then, we've seen new iterations, using the same concept of players cooperatively exploring and conquering a dungeon. Each edition has had variations in rules and mechanics, along with a brand-new setting for each.</p>

<p>This time, <em>Warhammer Quest</em> continues to explore the depths of the <em>Age of Sigmar</em> setting, moving away from the snowy, cramped, and death-filled streets of Ulfenkarn to Ghyran, the realm of life, and the Jade Abbey, the source of the powerful waters of the Everspring, for which Nurlge, the plague god, has set his sights.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-3.jpg?itok=xg-rblNb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-3.jpg?itok=ElU6mTxL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I absolutely love the background for <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em>. Gelgus Pust, a Chaos Champion of Nurgle, has sought to control the Everspring ever since he betrayed his order. Once a senior in the Jade Abbey, his lust for power corrupted him, and he brought others with him in a revolt that nearly captured the Everspring. To stop him, the Everqueen flooded the Jade Abbey, wiping out attackers and defenders alike, but keeping the Everspring from falling into the Chaos God's hands.</p>

<p>Pust has since been on a ruthless campaign, steadily weakening the defences of the Jade Abbey over centuries until he's now in a position to strike. But there are heroes willing to risk it all to stop him. Gathered by Inara Sion, a former colleague of Gelgus and the last surviving member of the Jade Circle, tasked with defending the Everspring. The battle between Pust and Inara, finally coming to settle the score after centuries, sets the stage for the adventure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-2.jpg?itok=bovzTfmG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-2.jpg?itok=f9iIgzaG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> map book makes game set up incredibly fast.</figcaption></figure><h2>Mechanics Of Life</h2>

<p><em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> has several mechanical changes from previous editions. The first is the inclusion of a map book, which takes the place of the map tiles from previous editions. This takes away the ability to randomly generate maps and instead fixes maps to those available in the map book. There is still variety to be found, and different missions, enemies, and map placement can make the same map into an entirely new experience. The benefit of the map book is that it speeds up setup time to almost nothing, as you only have to find the map page of the quest card, set up the enemies, heroes, and items, and you're ready to play. In a game that can serve as an entry game into the wider <em>Warhammer</em> and <em>Age of Sigmar</em> settings, this change is very welcome and lets you focus on the core delivery, rather than spending time building a map out of tiles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-6.jpg?itok=6DygxOqc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-6.jpg?itok=8fs4yIAY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each characters turn in&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater </em>is driven by actions cards.</figcaption></figure><p>The second noticeable mechanical change is that actions are now cards. Each hero starts with 3 core action cards, move, attack, and aid, and each has the dual effect of letting you complete the action and providing the energy to complete other actions. Each time you use an action card, you need to expend other action cards with enough energy to complete the action, which can include the action you are completing.</p>

<p>So you can exhaust the aid card to move, then exhaust the move card to move, and then the attack card to attack, or use all 3 to attack, or any combination thereof. Characters can also gain other action cards, increasing their available energy for the turn, and actions not on cards can also be taken with special quest actions, or individual character actions detailed on their character card. This mechanic will be familiar to those who've played <em>Warhammer Quest The Adventure Card Game</em>, and was one of my favorite mechanics from the game.</p>

<p>I've always loved the action card mechanic, it makes it super clear what you can do each turn and keeps everything really clean visually, especially as you gain actions that provide energy. It really feels like leveling up your hero as they can complete more each turn. The action mechanics themselves are also really straightforward, with the number of dice to roll in an attack listed, and the number you need to roll as well. Enemies block attacks equal to their defence value, which keeps combat really quick.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-8.jpg?itok=yTIJn9Pl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-8.jpg?itok=XsGDPQ2T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Most characters in&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> have random movement values, which keeps the action tense.</figcaption></figure><p>Most of the starting characters have a random value for movement, which I was initially skeptical of, but was on board with immediately when playing. It takes away from the fixed puzzle nature of some games, where you know if you move here, you can attack or take this action. The randomness of possibly having to take 2 move actions to get to where you need to be, or having a great dice roll and getting there in 1 move, feels very heroic. It also feels very in keeping with regular board games, where your movement is usually based on a dice roll. The exception to this is Drolf, the Duardin, who has a fixed move. This feels very thematic and sets Drolf out with the fixed, determined nature of the Duardin, but also their restriction on speed.</p>

<p>Enemies are controlled with custom dice that give them a simple series of actions they carry out when activated, with stronger enemies taking multiple actions as they scale up. Their movement and attacks feel purposeful, but are quick and simple enough that you get to focus on the heroes, rather than getting bogged down in the minutia of individual swarms of enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-4.jpg?itok=WGNRjMoA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-4.jpg?itok=D34wIT77 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The 4 initial heroes of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater </em>give a solid mix of range and melee combat prowess.</figcaption></figure><h2>Heroes Of The Tale</h2>

<p><em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> features 4 heroes initially, and 3 unlockable heroes that you'll see on the box of the game, and as you put the miniatures together for the set. We'll leave you to discover the 3 unlockable heroes, but the 4 core heroes are:</p>

<ul><li>Edmark Valoran, known as the Manticore Knight, has the best defense of the heroes and has a chance to damage adjacent enemies when he blocks their hits. He starts the game with the Shield of the Manticore, which can be used to automatically block a hit before a saving throw.</li>
	<li>Bren Tylis, the Renegade Saint, gets to choose each round to reroll her move, attack, or save rolls. It's a pretty powerful ability, giving you a better chance to achieve what you need to that round. Bren starts the game with the Relics of the Past equipment card, which can be used when you discard a reward card to stop it from being discarded on a 5+, which is great for keeping some single-use items around.</li>
	<li>Inara Sion, the Cleansing Blade, has a poor defence, but a great ranged attack to keep her&nbsp;away from enemies. They also have a Barrier of Water ability on their card, which can be used like the core abilities to block hexes to enemies, and make lethal hexes safe for the heroes. Their Blade of Flowing Water equipment also lets her&nbsp;move the counter for free, without having to power the ability.</li>
	<li>Drolf Ironhead, the Grizzled Explorer, has a fixed movement, a ranged attack, and can ignore lethal hexes by sprinting through them (by spending more energy on the move card to move 6 hexes instead of the standard movement). They come equipped with the Ranger's Kit, which can let them move through blocked hexes, which is amazing for last-minute objective saves or flanking an enemy who might have your party pinned.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-5.jpg?itok=ZqPwGYau 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-5.jpg?itok=eopu3qqp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each of the 3&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> acts in the campaign are driven by the act cards. Cleanse the Spawn Pit is used as the tutorial for your first game.</figcaption></figure><h2>Standing Against The Rot</h2>

<p>The <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> campaign consists of 3 acts, and each act is made up of 15 act cards (drawn randomly from 32 for each act). Each act has a final boss (of which there are 3 possible scenarios to face them in), and another 14 cards made up of encounters, events, and rest sites.</p>

<p>This means that you could play the game through all 3 acts, deliberately using different cards for each play-through, and have 2 unique play-throughs with still a spare card and an extra boss scenario, but the randomisation element will keep each play-through unique, or if you just want a one-off game, you can use any of the acts in skirmish mode.</p>

<p>Playing through the campaign first, before embarking on skirmish mode, is worthwhile, as you unlock extra characters and rewards as you do, and it avoids spoilers in skirmish mode, should you wish to play through the entire campaign.</p>

<p>Each encounter is pretty fast to play through, and you can get through a few in an evening, or half an act if you're lucky with event and rest site cards. This is helped by the quick setup for each encounter, letting you progress onto the next quickly. There are also several storage boxes for the heroes and acts, to keep the cards tidy in the box, and help you remember where you got to if you do have to pack away before finishing the campaign.</p>

<p>I had an absolute blast with<i> Warhammer Quest Darkwater.</i> I started my journey into miniatures gaming with <em>Heroquest</em> in the early '90s,&nbsp;and I played the original <em>Warhammer Quest</em> on release a few years later, so there's always been a bit of nostalgia here for me. Having also played the last 2 iterations, <em>Blackstone Fortress</em> and <em>Cursed City</em>, and reviewing them here on the site, this has been one of my favourite dungeon crawler games to date. The setting is perfect, and it captures the oppressive rot nature of Nurgle, whilst still being accessible for gamers who might be having their first experience here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Set up is fast, and games have a great flow with straightforward AI control for the enemies. The heroes feel unique, and the campaign is fast-flowing, but long enough to give it a great sense of depth. Repeat plays are also possible with the number of act cards across the 3 acts, and randomising them when generating the campaign. Previous <em>Warhammer Quest</em> editions got multiple expansions, and I hope that we see that here for <em>Darkwater</em> too.</p>

        <p><strong>A Letter from the Developers</strong></p><p>To everyone who has been waiting for this game, we are truly sorry.</p><p>The release date has been moved to “2026.” We apologize for keeping you waiting yet again. The support we’ve received, from the excitement voiced across various communities to the feedback from players who tried the demo at events, has been a tremendous source of encouragement for our team. We are deeply grateful.</p><p>This project involves implementing an unusual system into the game. We believe this system will make the experience truly one-of-a-kind, but such an ambitious approach also presents significant challenges.</p><p>There were moments when we wondered if perhaps creating a game like this was too early for us—or even for humanity—but after much trial and error, the final vision is gradually taking shape. Because we want to present the game at its best, we kindly ask for a little more time.</p><p>Additionally, because of how the game plays, the user interface, and story all change based on the player’s actions. Which means even sharing small bits of information becomes potential spoilers. This has made it difficult to communicate ongoing progress through social media, even though development is continuing steadily each day under director EIKI.</p><p>We are eagerly looking forward to the day when we can share this game with all of you, and we hope you will look forward to it as well. Your patience would mean the world to us.</p><p>Thank you once again for your continued support of <em>EDEN.schemata();</em>.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/eden-schemata-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

        </p>Have a Doki-Doki experience with over 30 denpa songs and multiple endings.<ul><li>Q. Why did she become a hikikomori?</li><li>Q. How does anonymous online posting lead to world destruction?</li><li>Q. Does a happy ending exist for a degenerate otaku?</li></ul><p>The answers to those “Q’s” lie at the convergence of insanity and denpa psychosis.

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is just days out from launch, and in case you missed it, you can redeem the eShop version of this title with a Nintendo Switch Game Voucher. You could also grab this version with a voucher and then pay to upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition of the game.</p>
<p>This follows the news in July that Nintendo would be discontinuing Switch Online Vouchers. Although these vouchers will no longer be sold after <strong>30th January 2026</strong>, Nintendo has said it will continue to add Switch titles to the voucher catalogue throughout the same year. Vouchers will remain valid for 12 months from the purchase date.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>One of the other titles to recently join the Switch voucher program was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, which you can also pay to upgrade to the Switch 2 version. Nintendo hasn't announced if it will release a similar voucher program for the Switch 2 (<em>at least for now</em>), but if we hear anything, we'll let you know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Face the history laid upon the operating table, and the countenance of humanity.</p><p>Drift atop the records of sin humanity has left behind, and answer for the meaning of existence and salvation.</p><p>Whether in darkness or in light, walk upon the edge of humankind’s end, and bare your most human self.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>All Adrift</em> is an aesthetic epic on a cosmic scale—a fusion of literary text, painterly visuals, and the interplay of classical and modern music.</p><p>The player becomes Sian Lightchaser—a survivor of an immortal, cursed race, captured by the Arwin Empire and forced to perform surgery on the history of the universe.</p><p>She is imprisoned in the role of a Sacred Author, tasked with creating a religion to glorify Arwin’s eternal authority and the deification of its ruling class.<br>Sian drifts through a cosmos where the ending war has dragged on for four centuries beyond the armistice, repainting the history of the universe as both victim and collaborator.</p><p>This work is a narrative-driven <a title="Genres > Simulation [885 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> adventure that explores the irony of guilt and <a title="Genres > Survival [486 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> through Sian—dispatched across multiple universes to create “Arwinism” for those who massacred her own people, and compelled to confront the unfathomable vastness and histories of the cosmos as she operates on the past and present of planets.</p><p>It is not merely a “game to be played,” but a “philosophical opera” that asks how humanity survives within the indelible memory of its own sins.</p><p>…</p><p>Sian sits in the carriage, gazing out the window. A beautiful flash of gold spreads like a fracture, cracking through the white clouds, as if to swallow the entire sky, then fades. Arwin Type 38; perhaps the light shed by that terminal technology as it swept across yet another helpless galaxy. She envisions the histories erased by that fleeting light. Are those the scars of human sin, or the creases of a world fading away? Either could be true. In an age where humane reflection itself has turned into an odd taste, she plays, if only briefly, the role of an oddity.</p><p>Sian still sits in the carriage, gazing out the window. Among the guides busily selling death, one rushes toward the carriage with the vigor of a market peddler, reminding her that this planet she has just arrived on is experimenting with the entertainment of death.</p><p><strong>The Most Ecstatic Deaths: Best Selection</strong></p><p>That ironic title is brazenly stitched in bright thread across the cover the guide thrusts at her window—beside an illustration of the dead, smiling faintly as they lie in ordered rows. The headless coachman gestured threateningly for him to leave. The guide’s eyes, having found no head to glare at, briefly wandered the coachman’s body—until they caught the emblem of Arwin. The moment they did, his eyes dropped, as if to escape a gaze that does not exist.</p><p>In front of all this fuss, Sian sits in the carriage, gazing out the window. Her focus drifts indifferently to the billboard above the road.</p><p><strong>Casualties Today: 91,060,000,080</strong></p><p>Four hundred years of ceasefire, held in the name of peace negotiations—and despite centuries of propaganda declaring that “the war is ending,” countless lives still vanish each day, leaving nothing behind, consumed as numbers wielded by those who are unaccountable. Just a numbers game. An endless numbers game. A goddamn huge numbers game. As Sian stares at the board, trying to count the numbers that must have vanished during the long truce, when a sudden voice bursts from the carriage speaker, the fervent cry of the propaganda hour.</p><p>“History is written in Arwin’s handwriting!”</p><p>Lies.</p><p>“Our noble honor is born from devotion to the Empire…”</p><p>Noble lies.</p><p>“The great Arwinian does not fear death—death fears the Arwinian!”</p><p>Great, filthy lies.</p><p>“Entrust your future to the Empire!”</p><p>That one’s honest.</p><p>In this world that can reach every star, whose freedom stretches long only to narrow into a cage, Sian listens to the propaganda echoing through the carriage and thinks.</p><p>Is even this not enough? After obliterating all those peoples, after wiping out all those planets, after rendering all those lives less than mere numbers, is there still something left that must be carved away, resurrecting even this forbidden technology of cosmic surgery?</p><p>She looks at the cursed surgical instrument in her hand, the tool that can turn every life beyond the window into something less than a number. The weight of karma crushes her, suffocating every thought and feeling. Tomorrow’s throat lies in her hand. And now, it is her turn to wield it.</p><p>Surely, there is no god in such a cruel world. Certainly not. Even if there were, it would not be one from which we could hope for salvation. But that was the story up to now. What of tomorrow? At the heart of Arwin’s capital, a tower white enough to be black coils like a serpent, coveting the seat of a godless world as it creeps darkly toward tomorrow.</p><p>Above all these stories, Sian sits imprisoned in the carriage. For a while yet, she will remain so.</p><p>Ribbit!</p><p><strong>Staff</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Producer, Director, Writer, Game Design Director, Art Director, Music Producer:</strong> Bae Sang Hyun</li><li><strong>Game Designer, Programmer:</strong> Woo Gi Hun</li><li><strong>Composer:</strong> Park Na Hyun</li><li><strong>Voice Cast:</strong> <a title="Games > Mare [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mare">Mare</a> Flos, Bae Sang Hyun, Kim Han Baek</li><li><strong>Trailer Voice:</strong> Kim Sin Woo</li></ul></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/story-driven-adventure-game-all-adrift-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

The game progresses in semi-real time, and players intervene while watching over the <a title="Genres > Action [3,239 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s of the residents.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>December 31, 1988. Due to the murder of a resident “Ms. Noroi” in one of her apartment rooms, the apartment was in danger of being demolished.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>It was a story that was no stranger to “Urami-chan,” the earthbound spirit in her room. Jishibei spirits disappear when they no longer have a place to call their own. With the advice of the human spirit “Onebii,” she returned to the past and took action to change Noroi’s future.</p><p><strong>How to Play</strong></p><p>One month from the time Ms. Noroi moved in until she was murdered. The player returns to the past from the calendar of the room where the murder took place and intervenes in Ms. Noroi’s life for three hours until the resident, Ms. Noroi, returns home and goes to bed, to make her presence known.</p><p><strong>What Urami-chan Can Do</strong></p><ul><li>Call</li><li>Telekinesis</li></ul><p>After three hours, the player returns to the original time, and if something changes, the date to return is updated. By using telekinesis to cause small “anomalies” at first, the past is gradually changed.</p><p>The number of “anomalies” that can be triggered will increase as the player gains experience by surprising Ms. Noroi. If you can make a big change in the past, might you be able to change your own future?</p></blockquote><p>Watch the debut trailer below.</p><h2><span>Trailer #1</span></h2><p><iframe title="Haunted Room!

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194232,194327 @ 1764421279 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This is my final weekend before <em>all the games</em> release, so I'm determined to wrap up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> and get a run or two of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a> under my belt. Yes, these are the same two games that I have been playing every weekend for weeks now, and no, I will not apologise for that.</p>
<p>I'm already nervously eyeing all the titles I'll want to pick up in the next seven days, so I'll be trying to enjoy having some money while I can. That said, there's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/switch-2-black-friday-deals-are-a-bit-meh-but-here-are-the-best-weve-seen">Black Friday deal</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> that's looking <em>particularly</em> tempting...</p>

<p>I'd like to give <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/outlaws_plus_handful_of_missions_remaster">Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</a> a shot this weekend if I get chance – it looks so cool! Other than that, a quick dive into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> before the fourth entry drops sounds like it might be on the cards. Have a good weekend, folks!</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that last weekend I went to the 10th edition of Lisboa Games Week. As one of the leading video game culture shows in Portugal, it is always a great place to meet old friends, make new ones and play the latest upcoming chart toppers. Nintendo had the biggest show floor ever, right at the main entrance, so it was impossible to miss all that Switch 2 red-tinted area. I was surprised to have play time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>, both running their demo builds quite smoothly. The main reason that made me not stay at home was hands-on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>… and I was smiling the whole way. The latest entry in the series came out in 2007, I was an entirely different person back then. With the imminent release, I am clearing my schedule to ensure that it is all Samus Aran from next week onwards (and yes, my head is still back there, I got me a bad case of post-convention blues!).</p>
<p>My game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>. Will I be able to complete it before next week? Certainly not. Will I be redecorating the streets of Kamurochō with every street thug foolish enough to look me sideways until then? Put your money on the Dragon of Dojima, and you will never be poor again.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>Not much time for gaming this weekend, as the HOLIDAY TIME has begun. I've got a Christmas party, a Christmas craft market, a house Christmas decoration plan, and a (not-Christmas) D&amp;D session.</p>
<p>But I did just buy <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/outer_worlds_2">Outer Worlds 2</a> in the Steam Sale, like I said I would last week. So mayyyyyybe I can find the time in between all the Christmas...</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'm still playing and loving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> update has got me surveying the state of my museum. Bugs, fossils, and fish-wise, I'm 100% complete, but my art gallery is perhaps 20% finished. So, I've started hitting Redd up on Harv's Island to see about changing that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I'm dipping into the Namco DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration_-_the_namco_legendary_pack">Atari 50</a>, and the kids are intrigued by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari Damacy</a>, so it might be time for a Reroll. Have a good one, folks.</p>

			<p>It's been nearly nine years since the release of Dead Rising 4, the latest new entry in CAPCOM's quirky zombie-themed action/adventure series. </p>



<p>At the time of its launch, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-4-review-jolly-hacknslash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was reviewed favorably by Wccftech's Jorge Jimenez</a>, who gave it an 8 out of 10 rating. However, it failed to meet CAPCOM's sales projections, setting the series on a downward trend. Historic developer CAPCOM Vancouver was trying to make a different game afterward, a new IP which would have been set in an alternate version of New York, but that project <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-capcom-vancouver-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was canceled in February 2018</a> and the studio suffered a cut of 20% of its manpower.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Vancouver team had also released a PvP puzzle game titled Puzzle Fighter for mobile devices. However, shortly after the aforementioned layoffs, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-vancouver-focus-dead-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly vowed to refocus on its flagship franchise, Dead Rising</a>.</p>



<p>Even that was not enough to save CAPCOM Vancouver from the parent company's axe, which fell on September 18, 2018, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-capcom-vancouver-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down the 14-year-old studio for good</a> with a total cost for the cancelled games estimated at around $40 million. A couple of years later, a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-vancouver-wanted-to-make-new-dino-crisis-dead-rising-5-before-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the Vancouver team had indeed started working on Dead Rising 5 before its closure. The limited information available suggests that the game was intended to take place in Santa Catarina, Mexico, between Dead Rising 2 and 3, featuring the protagonist of the former game, Chuck Greene.</p>



<p>With CAPCOM finally on a hot stream of game releases in the Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, and Devil May Cry franchises, the revival of this intellectual property didn't seem to be high on their priority. Still, the Deluxe Remaster <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-coming-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was well received</a> (despite some <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-remaster-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial changes to protagonist Frank West's face</a>) and it also <a href="https://wccftech.com/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-selling-below-dead-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered solid sales</a>, according to the publisher.</p>



<p>That might have been the key to persuading CAPCOM to give the proverbial green light for a brand new game installment, which MP1st <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-dead-rising-game-development-set-in-hollywood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now reports is in development</a>. The website's sources reckon a new title has been in the works since at least 2023 under the codename 'Rec'. This upcoming entry will once again feature Frank West and is reportedly going to be a sequel to the very first installment, suggesting that it might take place after DR1 but before DR2. </p>



<p>MP1st adds that the setting will be Hollywood, more specifically, a massive film studio lot where a crazed director forces Frank and other survivors to participate in various insane trials in the pursuit of filming the so-called perfect movie. The director will also send Psychopaths to hinder Frank, including the director's right-hand man, whom MP1st adds Frank had previously saved. This Psychopath is reportedly tasked with filming everything with a bomb strapped to his chest.</p>



<p>The time limit mechanics, a key feature of the Dead Rising franchise that was, however, absent in DR4, are supposedly returning with a vengeance. For instance, the movie director threatens to blow up the entire lot if Frank and the others don't comply with his orders. Of course, Frank's camera is also returning, and franchise fans will see other characters making appearances, including Isabela Keyes.</p>



<p>If the project started in 2023, we might be at least two to three years away from a release, given the average triple-A development timeframe, so best sit tight. Still, would you be happy if CAPCOM confirmed this rumor? Let us know in the comments. </p>

As you've probably already seen, she's also joined by a team of Galactic Federation soldiers.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4-beyond-difficulty-settings-revealed-by-nintendo">same recently published article</a> on Nintendo's Japanese website, there's an official introduction to the team of soldiers who have also been transported to the same location. Throughout this new adventure, Samus will work and fight alongside all of these characters to return home alive.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series Setting Possibly Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-setting-ancient-rome-report/</link>
            <guid>1367896</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The setting and time period of Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series may have been revealed, according to a new report. Even more so, more information regarding the show’s development has emerged online.</p>



<p>Since 2007, the Assassin’s Creed series of games has been going rather strong, spanning eras of history with action-packed gameplay and gripping story. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ordered-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earlier this year</a>, Netflix announced that it’s working with Ubisoft to develop a live-action Assassin’s Creed series. Multiple ones are apparently in the works, as revealed in the blog from July, but the biggest one just cast <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-series-actor-toby-wallace-euphoria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actor Toby Wallace</a> as co-lead. Now, more information on <strong>the show’s setting has reportedly been revealed</strong>, and <strong>it’s one that fans have been asking for for a long time</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-series-may-take-place-in-ancient-rome-according-to-new-report">Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series May Take Place in Ancient Rome, According to New Report</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The report comes from <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-set-to-explore-ancient-rome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive from Nexus Point News</a>, which has previously leaked multiple game adaptations like God of War and Elden Ring. In the article, it mentions that sources have said what Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed’s setting will be: <strong>Ancient Rome</strong>. Specifically, <strong>the show is reportedly taking place between 54-68 AD</strong> during Emperor Nero’s reign. Both Nero and his mentor, Seneca, will be featured in the series. Filming is taking place in Italy, so it does line up there, if true. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the report says that Toby Wallace will be part of<strong> an ensemble cast</strong>, meaning there will be <strong>multiple leads</strong>. It’s important to note that <strong>Ubisoft and Netflix have not confirmed this news</strong>, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. Still, Ancient Rome has been asked for by fans for a long time. However, if true, it would mean players would likely not get to play in that time period like they’d hoped to. This would also mean that the show would feature an original story, which is a bit of a risky move. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see how the show shapes up.</p>







<p>What do you think of Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed setting? Is Ancient Rome a good fit? If true, are you disappointed to not see it in the games? Is doing an original story worth it? Going with an ensemble cast?

Depending on the RAM kit you want, buying it right now might be too costly to justify, an unfortunate trend that my colleague Sean Hollister <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828337/ram-memory-shortage-crunch-market-prices-central-micro-center">recently pointed out</a>. You can either wait out this period of surge pricing, or if you’re jumping into PCs for the first time and want to play games at 1080p, get a nice deal on a prebuilt gaming PC that has some decent specs for the price.</p><p>The builders iBuyPower has a couple of machines selling at a discount, including its Element SE, which is down to $999 ($300 off) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FiBUYPOWER-Element-SE-Gaming-PC-Desktop-AMD-Ryzen-7-8700F-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-5060Ti-8GB-32GB-DDR5-RGB-RAM-1TB-NVMe-SSD-ESA7N56T01%2F17048165781" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>. That PC comes with AMD’s Ryzen 7 8700F processor, Nvidia’s midrange RTX 5060 Ti (8GB) GPU, a 1TB SSD, and 32GB of that precious DDR5 clocked at 5,200MHz — all shipped in a nice tri-panel tempered glass case. Here are the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibuypower.com%2Fsupport%2Ffaq%2Fretail%2Fesa7n56t01" rel="sponsored">full specs</a>, as listed on iBuyPower’s site.</p><p>If you’re alright with stepping down to the RTX 5060, halving the RAM, and swapping out the AMD processor for the similarly powerful Intel Core i5 14400F, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fibuypower-element-se-gaming-desktop-pc-intel-core-i5-14400f-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-8gb-16gb-ddr5-rgb1tb-nvme-black%2FJ3R75JY82Z%2Fsku%2F6617835" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>’s version of the Element SE is currently on sale for an all-time low $779.99 ($260 off).

            <guid>1367890</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Up to extra 6% for subscribers</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer is joining in on the Black Friday and Cyber Monday fun with their <a href="https://seller.tcgplayer.com/cyber-weekend-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyber Weekend event</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting on November 28 at 9 am ET, trainers will get 10% back in store credit on their TCGPlayer account from whatever they buy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This promotion will be running until December 1, 11 pm ET. So if you've been waiting for your favorite chase cards to go down in value to snap them up, this is it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer does these promotions once or twice a year for a big holiday like Black Friday and Halloween, but this 10% credit offer comes while Pokémon TCG is finding a new floor. </p><div catalogid="0cc34152-a4aa-4aaf-8c84-5d8a17b23349" id="231793"><div id="231793" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>From November 28 at 9am ET to December 1 at 11pm ET</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Shop TCGPlayer Cyber Weekend</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p> 10% in store credit on all products purchased. TCGPlayer Subscribers13%+ (12% base plus 1-3% monthly loyalty bonus).</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That much is clear just by looking at the most recent Pokémon TCG set, Phantasmal Flames. But more on that later, long story short, this is a great time to pick up chase cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But which chase cards should you buy on TCGPlayer's Cyber Weekend? Well, I've handpicked some of the best cards from Mega Evolution, Scarlet and Violet, and the Sword and Shield eras of Pokémon TCG for you to catch. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Modern Chase Cards to Look Out For</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet has been one of the best era's in recent memory for chase cards with multiple banger sets, and yes I know Evolving Skies from Sword and Shield was insane, more on that later. 151, Black Bolt/White Flare, Destined Rivals, Prismatic Evolutions and Twilight Masquerade collectively hold the most expensive chase cards of this era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's great and all, but it means more money spent on catching the best cards going. Then the latest era, Mega Evolution is off to a flying start with its base set and Phantasmal Flames expansion bringing back Pokémons most popular gimmick from the main games. There's a lot to focus on, just the carousel above will proove that much, but just focus on what stands out to you and what fits into your budget.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the top 5 cards here value wise are Umbreon ex SIR, Mega Charizard X ex SIR, Mega Charizard X ex Gold Hyper Rare, Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex SIR and Mega Lucario ex Gold Hyper Rare. Even though Mega Evolution sets have dropped in value significantly since launch, they're still putting out some of the most valuable cards in modern Pokémon TCG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umbreon is never going to be knocked off the top spot, not even Charizard can do that, but it's going to be the best time to snap it up on TCGPlayer. Let's do some quick math; 10% of $1,294.99 is $129.49, which is going to be the minimum cashabck you'll recieve after purchasing Sunbreon. That means you could put that credit towards Roaring Moon ex SIR from the same set and grab it for $42.14 instead of $171.63. Oh, then you'd also get another 10% cashback from that purchase which is $17.16. It's the best kind of snowball i've ever seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But even with the cashback, Sunbreon will still cost a fortune regardless of how good the deal is, so let's pick out something that you're other half won't kill you (as much) for. Greninja SIR ex from Twilight Masquerade absolutley pops and is easily one of the best artworks in the Scarlet and Violet era. Whilst you might think $325 is steep, this card was touching $380 just a week or two ago. So getting $32.50 back as 10% cashback to effectively get this card for $292.50. Now that's a great investment, which is also the near-mint price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Scarlet and Violet Promo Cards To Catch</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Scarlet and Violet era has also been a very strong era for promo cards. This means anything from a STAFF stamped card to a Pokémon Center stamped card found inside Pokémon Center-exclusive Elite Trainer Boxes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorites from the Scarlet and Violet era is the Paldea Evolved Pokémon Center exclusive Elite Trainer Box (Takes a deep breath). It features Pikachu alongside the Paldea starter Pokémon in a "Let's go suit shopping" pose that has the power to cause genuine cardiac arrest. A stunning card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now considering the exclusive Elite Trainer Box is currently going for $500 sealed right now, the $119 price tag for the card is actually quite cheap. And when you consider the $11.90 cashback you'd get off buying the card, that's not a bad deal at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping in with the Pikachu theme, one of my favorite promos from Scarlet and Violet that I actually own is Pikachu with Grey Felt Hat. This costs even more than the ETB at $547.99 right now, which is a big drop from around $647 just days ago. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/van-gogh-pikachu-pokemon-card-value-spike-invest-trends-tcg-updated">I've written about the full story behind this infamous card previously</a>, but this is a fantastic time to get this card thanks to the extra $54.79 you'll get in cashback this weekend.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Sword and Shield Chase Cards You Can't Miss</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, we're about to talk about Evolving Skies, well done for waiting until the end of the article. I remember walking into stores on release and not being able to move for Evolving Skies boosters, premium collections and Elite Trainer Boxes, often below MSRP. It's frankly insane how much this set it worth compared to how available it used to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the home of the most valuable Sword and Shield era chase cards for the most part, including Moonbreon, Rayquazza VMAX Alt Art, Umbreon V Alt Art, Dragonite V Alt Art, most of the Eeveelution VMAX Alt Arts and the stunning Rayquaza V Alt full art. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apologies for just going mad listing cards, but this is why it's costing north of $2,000 just for a Booster Box. Of course you'd also get $200 in cashback which is awesome, but just wow. If you're looking to get some big chase cards for a steal in TCGPlayer's Cyber Weekend, start with Evolving Skies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sword and Shield isn't just about one set though, Fusion Strike, Lost Origins and Silver Tempest also have some god tier level grails. The Secret Alt Art of Gengar VMax for example is currently $730, which is over double the worth of the next Fusion Strike chase card down the line, Espeon VMAX Secret Alt Art, running at $329.58 right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for an amazing chase card that isn't going to require a remortgage, Lugia V Alt Full Art from Silver Tempest is a banger. Other than me being really proud of myself getting it for under $150 earlier this year, the mood in this card thanks to Lugia jumping out of the ocean in the middle of a storm over a fisherman is stunning. Hands down the best Lugia Pokémon Card ever printed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TCGPlayer Subscription</h2></div><div catalogid="0cc34152-a4aa-4aaf-8c84-5d8a17b23349" id="231794"><div id="231794" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>(Up to 15% Cashback for Cyber Weekend) Free Shipping and up to 3% Cashback on orders over $35</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TCGPlayer Subscription</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Free Shipping and up to 3% Cashback on orders over $35</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're planning on snapping up quite a few Pokémon cards in the sale, this is a great time to become a TCGPLayer subscriber. It costs $8.99 a month and gives users free delivers and 1% cashback regardless of the time of year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst this climbs to 3% after a years membership, subscriber will get a boosted 13% cashback over cyber weekend on top of their usual cashback. For longtime members, this could equate to 16% cashback, which is frankly insane.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For even more card recommendations in TCGPlayer's Black Friday/Cyber Weekend sale, check out our brand new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-tcgplayer-cash-back-sale-riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-2025">Riftbound</a> and Magic: The Gathering roundups as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
