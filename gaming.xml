Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">The Nintendo Switch 2 is nigh</a>. Nigh-ish, anyway. When it does launch later this year, it might start another revolution in portable gaming, as millions of people are able to play from their couch, their bed, the train, and anywhere else. That was also true of the first Switch, though, and as big a hit as it was it didn’t spark an industry-wide shift to handhelds the way some people expected. So what gives?</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>, we dig in on the state of the handheld console wars. <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a> joins the show to tell us about what we’ve learned <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc">about the Steam Deck’s success</a>, and whether the sales numbers we’re seeing reflect an exciting new market or a surprisingly static one. We also talk about why Sony and Microsoft have (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">so far</a>) avoided building Steam Deck-like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">gadgets of their own</a>, and why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad">the Windows handheld universe</a> remains a bit disappointing. We all think handheld, convertible consoles could be the future, but it might take a little longer than we thought.</p><p>After that, David reports on a trip he took to Florida to see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/sport/629858/tgl-golf-tech-espn-sports-future">behind the scenes at TGL</a>, a golf league featuring some of the highest-tech sporting gear you’ve ever seen anywhere. Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, and some of the other biggest names in golf are betting big that this combination of video games, augmented reality, and live action can be a hit both on TV and in your social feeds. But it also raises some questions, like: how do you know when you can trust the computer? And how big is a 53-foot-tall screen, really?</p><p>Finally, we answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about why you might upgrade from a normal iPad <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ipad/626647/apple-ipad-air-review-2025">to an iPad Air</a>. We’ve heard from a lot of students and note-takers the last few weeks who say the extra stylus support, and a few power-hungry apps, make the extra expense worth it.</p><p>If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started:</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Meanwhile, Game Pass Core subscribers, the tier that replaced Xbox Live Gold, are getting their library expanded to include <em>Monkey Sanctuary</em>, <em>Tunic</em>, and <em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em> starting March 26. </p><p>The bad news is that this month remains a relative bloodbath for older parts of the Game Pass Ultimate, PC, and Standard libraries.<em> Lies of P</em>, <em>No More Heroes 3</em>, <em>Solar Ash</em>, <em>Evil West</em>, and <em>Yakuza 5</em> and <em>6</em> both left last week. A whole bunch more games are leaving on March 31 as well, including<em> Yakuza Kiwami 1</em> &amp; <em>2</em>, <em>Yakuza 0</em>, <em>Yakuza Like a Dragon</em>, and <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>. The good news is that you still have 13 days left to dip into these games, including the 1930s Nazi shooting tactics game <em>The Lamplighter’s League</em>. It was Harebrained Schemes last strategy release before breaking with publisher Paradox Interactive and going independent again. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-preload-guide-file-sizes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Our preload and file size guide for The First Berserker Khazan can get you armed and ready. Before you step into the shoes of the soon-to-be-influenced general Khazan, you first need to preload the game if you’ve pre-ordered it, and you definitely need to know how much space you need.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of expectation on the shoulders of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a>. It’s one of 2025’s biggest action-adventure and Soulslike titles, and it has a lot of fans already. We know the basics of the story, we’ve seen the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-trophy-list-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy List</a>, and we also know if it’s on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-first-berserker-khazan-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass</a>.</p>



<p>But for details on the preload process and how much space Khazan requires, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-the-first-berserker-khazan">How to Preload The First Berserker Khazan</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to process. Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can preload The First Berserker Khazan approximately 24 hours before release if you have a confirmed pre-order digital purchase of the game.</strong></p>



<p>Preloading is another recent popular gaming trend. It allows you to have an upcoming game already installed on your device allowing you to play it as soon as its worldwide launch rolls out.</p>



<p>Here’s a basic step-by-step guide if you’ve never done this before:</p>



<ol>
<li>Decide if you’re playing The First Berserker Khazan on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC.</li>



<li>Head to your chosen digital storefront.</li>



<li>Find the search function and look for <strong><strong>The First Berserker Khazan</strong></strong>.</li>



<li>Choose any Khazan edition.</li>



<li>Confirm and complete your purchase.</li>



<li>Wait for the preload option to go live—we think it’s in the <strong>24 hours leading up to Early Access</strong>.</li>



<li>Click the download option once it’s available.</li>



<li>Once it’s installed, The First Berserker Khazan should be in your games library raring and ready to go.</li>
</ol>



<p>Using the Steam page as evidence, it says: “Pre-Purchase this edition and play the game starting three days ahead of full release. Starts in approximately six days.” This means you can expect the preload option to go live in the 24 hours building up to the start of Early Access.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-file-size-on-playstation-xbox-amp-pc">The First Berserker Khazan File Size on PlayStation, Xbox &amp; PC</h2>



<p><strong>The PlayStation File Size for The First Berserker Khazan is 25.820 GB, and you need at least 70 GB on Xbox and PC.</strong></p>



<p>There’s a notable discrepancy between PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, but I wouldn’t worry if you’re playing Khazan on the latter formats. <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1900166091801862261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>—a reputable source of file sizes—confirmed the PS5 file size, whereas the PC and Xbox sizes come from the official <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/the-first-berserker-khazan/9pkjwmbbgk38?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan Xbox</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2680010/The_First_Berserker_Khazan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam pages</a>.</p>



<p>Xbox and PC say you need a least 70 GB—but this doesn’t mean you need 70 GB or anything close come release. To be on the safe side, make sure you have 70 GB free, and if it does end up being far less, that’s a bonus!</p>

This is a World War I tank that has been given a Shelby makeover and it references the global conflict that three of the Shelby brothers took part in prior to the start of Peaky Blinders. There'll also be new Peaky Blinders-themed decals, inscriptions, and a specially composed soundtrack inspired by the show.</p><p>While Peaky Blinders sounds like an odd fit for World of Tanks, it's not unusual for the free-to-play game. Previous collaborations have involved rock band <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-offspring-will-play-a-show-inside-a-very-popul/1100-6469929/">The Offspring</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-adds-wwethemed-vehicles-and-crosspl/1100-6479988/">WWE</a>, and even Hollywood legend <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-enlists-arnold-schwarzenegger-for-latest-holiday-ops-event/1100-6498466/">Arnold Schwarzenegger has been enlisted</a> in the past to promote limited-time Holiday Ops events. In case you never saw it, Peaky Blinders is a British crime-drama series that ran six seasons from 2013 through to 2022.</p><p>Starring Cillian Murphy as Thomas Shelby, the show charted the rise of the Peaky Blinders street gang in Birmingham and their evolution into a well-oiled criminal syndicate. A film is also currently in the works.</p>

                <p>33 Immortals launches in early access today, March 18, and developer Thunder Lotus has provided <a href="https://thunderlotus.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/29838745552404-33-Immortals-FAQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some details about game</a>, including cross-play functionality.</p><p>33 Immortals is a roguelike action multiplayer game that supports up to 33 players in its raid missions. The game has cross-play between PC and Xbox players. Right now, the developer said that it is focusing on creating a finished product, so no other platforms or storefronts have been announced like PlayStation, Switch, or Steam.</p><p>33 Immortals is not a free-to-play game, but it will be available for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-all-these-games-very-soon-in-march-2025/2900-6328/" data-ref-id="2900-6328">Game Pass</a> subscribers. There will also be optional cosmetics in the game. Those who participated in the game's alpha and beta tests will receive a unique halo item during the early-access period.</p><p>The developer laid out a <a href="https://thunderlotusgames.com/blog/33-immortals-roadmap-release-time-and-more/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">roadmap for the game for the rest of 2025</a>. In Spring 2025, the focus will be on fixing bugs and stability issues, as well as balancing UI/UX, VFX, and overall game feel. Accessibility options, control rebinding, and graphics settings will be added too.</p><p>Summer 2025 will focus on new features, including private sessions, Dark Woods decorations, and more trainings. Players will also get the ability to descend after ascending and check out a new ordeal system.</p><p>Fall 2025 will have the game's first major update, which includes a new world called Paradiso, filled with new monsters, a new boss, and even more new features.</p><p>33 Immortals is a departure for Thunder Lotus games. The studio has dabbled in co-op with Sundered and Spiritfarer, but 33 Immortals is its first fully multiplayer game. It has one dedicated single-player game, Jotun, while Sundered and Spiritfarer can be played as single-player adventures.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Apparently it's possible to be guilty of a "hate crime to parkour." Unfortunately for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> protagonist Yasuke, he is culpable in this department, according to a couple of experts in navigating urban obstacles.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed-parkour-experts-video/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> rounded up two parkour athletes, Benj and Toby from Storror Parkour Pro, to discuss what is actually realistic in Assassin's Creed Shadows and what's nigh impossible. The pair took issue with Yasuke using his knee to ascend a ledge, laughing while addressing the problem. "You'll be canceled out of any parkour community around the world," said Benj. Toby added salt to the wound by saying, "That's a hate crime to parkour that climb up there. Yeah, that's brutal." Yasuke is one of two playable characters in the game, with Naoe serving as the more agile option.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQIPl5ss9cU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BQIPl5ss9cU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Basically, the duo explained that parkour should never include utilizing your knees to climb up somewhere. The same is true for your elbows, since those actions are terrible for your joints. Intriguingly, the franchise's iconic leap of faith is actually realistic--from certain distances. They argue jumping off from shorter distances, say no more than seven stories, could be possible with a good amount of hay. But when Assassin's Creed heroes dive off from 30-plus stories, that's a no-go.</p><p dir="ltr">Just days away from release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-can-stream-assassins-creed-shadows-if-they-buy-the-game/1100-6530144/">Game Pass Ultimate members will be able to stream Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> if they buy the game. Meanwhile, Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-support-steam-deck-at-release-ubisoft-confirms/1100-6530082/">confirmed the action-adventure title will work on Steam Deck</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-on-ps5-pro-will-have-an-extra-fancy-ray-tracing-mode/1100-6529947/">PS5 Pro owners will get an extra-fancy ray tracing mode</a>.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-feels-like-the-series-trying-to-come-to-terms-with-its-warring-halves/1100-6528968/">Assassin's Creed Shadows preview</a>. The game will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-how-long-to-beat-game-director-reveals-a-runtime/1100-6529911/">apparently take about 30-40 hours to complete the main campaign</a>, but that playtime can easily double when including side quests and other activities. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-preorder-guide-collectors-edition-release-date-bonuses/1100-6523479/" data-ref-id="1100-6523479">Assassin's Creed Shadows comes out March 20</a> on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. </p>

            <p>
In an announcement set to send shockwaves through wallets everywhere, Lego has announced it will launch Pokémon-themed sets in 2026.
</p>
<p>
Lego's reveal today offers little other than two logos sat next to each other on a website, but already the company's accountants will rubbing their paws. Oh, and there's a Pikachu tail made of Lego too. That's nice.
</p>
<p>"Electrify your imagination in 2026 and get ready to build something we've never built with Lego bricks before!" the company has teased.</p>
<p>
Pokémon has - for a long time - partnered with Mega Bloks to release various buildable sets. No longer, it appears! While Pokémon is not owned by Nintendo per se, the two companies are closely linked, and this announcement follows several <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">successful Lego ranges based around Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda and Animal Crossing</a>.
</p>
<p>
At a guess, I'd say we're likely to see buildable models of Pokémon that you can pop on your desk or in your <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/ikea">Ikea</a> kallax, rather than Lego playsets featuring Pallet Town. But I'd love an Ash Ketchum minifigure, Lego, so please do consider it.
</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Lego-related news, earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/18-lego-mario-kart-set-leaks-online">Nintendo announced The Lego Super Mario: Mario Kart - Mario &amp; Standard Kart set</a>. This particular set features a buildable Mario complete with a posable head and arms. The Nintendo mascot is sitting behind the wheel of Mario Kart's Standard Kart, described as "the most iconic Mario Kart vehicle of all".</p>
<p>Back in the world of video games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-wont-arrive-until-late-2025">Pokémon Legends: Z-A will launch for Nintendo Switch</a> (and presumably there will be a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> version) late this year. It's a bit of a longer wait than we were expecting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Arrowhead Game Studios have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond by the name of Borderline Justice, and it's ready to dispense some of the titular frontier violence later this week.</p>

<p>Landing on March 30th (that's Thursday),&nbsp;Borderline Justice follows on from recent&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbonds like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond" rel="nofollow">Servants of Freedom</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">Truth Enforcers</a>, and it's packing a new primary and secondary weapon, a new explosive, and more.</p>

<p>First up, picking up this Warbond will grant you the chance to use the R-6 Deadeye, a lever-action hunting rifle that will carry a lower rate of fire but a deadly kick. It's perfect for single targets, but it might not serve you quite as well for crowds.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond-revolver.jpg?itok=BzW_0kn1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond-revolver.jpg?itok=QvvtDEMF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Warbond gives you the chance to be an intergalactic cowboy.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the rifle, you'll also get access to the LAS-58 Talon, which is about as close to a revolver as you're going to get in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s futuristic universe. It may not have a revolving chamber, but it sure does pack a punch.</p>

<p>The new TED-63 Dynamite explosive is also part of the Borderline Justice Warbond, and you can use it either to make yourself feel like an old-timey prospector or just to blow up a horde of bugs. It's up to you.</p>

<p>Of course, like all good cowboys, you can also utilize the LIFT-860 jetpack to put you above the action. Hey, it can't all be Wild West-themed, now can it? You can also look forward to two new sets of armor, both of which have the Gunslinger passive to give you better reload speed and reduced recoil on your secondary weapon.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>news, back in January, the game's creative lead Johan Pilestedt announced that he would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">taking an extended break from work</a>. When Pilestedt returns, he says he'll be working on the new Arrowhead game.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s Borderline Justice Warbond arrives on March 20th. The game is available right now for PC and PlayStation 5, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" rel="nofollow">check out our review here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/629964/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review-nintendo-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The failure of the Wii U has turned out to be a big win for the Switch. While Nintendo’s previous console was its worst selling, it was still home to some of its most inventive games. Over the years, Nintendo has steadily brought many of them — ranging from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/13/17568040/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-nintendo-switch-review">Captain Toad puzzles</a> to various <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17301860/nintendo-switch-ports-wii-u-obsolete">Donkey Kong</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24343009/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-nintendo-switch">adventures</a> — to a much larger audience on the Switch. In fact, the Switch’s best-selling game, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/15/5714102/mario-kart-8-review">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a></em>, is an updated version of a Wii U classic.</p><p>And even now, with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">new-generation console on the horizon</a>, the Wii U still has more to give. This time, it’s an absolutely massive sci-fi RPG — and one that is just begging to be explored.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9862024/xenoblade-chronicles-x"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a> first launched in 2015. The story involves an ark-like spaceship that left Earth after an an alien invasion and eventually crashed on an untamed world called Mira. Your character is a part of the early stages of the settlement process. Much of the planet is unexplored, and the crashed ship has been turned into a city of sorts, dubbed New Los Angeles. <em>X</em> has more of a hard sci-fi setup compared to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23277681/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review-nintendo-switch">other games in the series</a>, and it’s also a standalone experience, so you don’t need to have played <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/30/16719154/xenoblade-chronicles-2-nintendo-switch">any other <em>Xenoblade</em> title</a> to understand what’s going on.</p><p>The premise is great, though the story gets pretty convoluted in a very RPG way as it progresses. But the main reason to play <em>X</em> is because of Mira. The world outside of New Los Angeles is a sprawling, strange, and seductive place teeming with alien wildlife. You’ll encounter beasts the size of dinosaurs, so gigantic that you can run under them without being noticed. There are angry monkeys that race through the world, and terrors that patrol the skies.</p><p>One of the most compelling things about the creatures in this world is that they feel like wildlife. Yes, some will attack you on sight, but most are content to leave you alone if you do the same. Mira is an incredibly dangerous place, but also one where you have the option to slow down and appreciate its beauty. As I said in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9862024/xenoblade-chronicles-x">my original review</a>, there are areas in the game that look like sci-fi staples from Pandora and Arrakis, and they’re incredible to behold, even if <em>X</em> is a decade old.</p><p>Smartly, most of the missions in the game involve further exploration, and you can expand your knowledge of the world by placing beacons that provide more detailed map information. It’s sort of like searching out towers in <em>Zelda</em>; in fact, <em>Xenoblade</em> developer Monolith Soft helped develop both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, so the similarities make a lot of sense.</p><p>The caveat is that to enjoy all of the beauty and awe <em>X</em> has to offer, you’ll need a lot of patience. Like every other <em>Xenoblade</em> game, <em>X</em> is filled with complex systems that aren’t always clearly explained, and it can require a good amount of grinding to make your character powerful enough to take on specific missions and enemies. Battles happen in real time, with your character attacking automatically, while you choose between weapons and various special abilities with their own cooldowns.</p><p>There are other things to pay attention to beyond XP, like your affinity with other characters or your proficiency in specific skills; if you ignore them, it’s easy to find yourself in a position where you’re stuck, unable to take on a necessary mission with your current build. The game also starts very slow: the first few hours can feel like an extended tutorial.</p><p>But for a certain kind of player, it’s worth pushing through the game’s fussiness. Because even now, 10 years after it debuted, there’s still nothing quite like the sense of stunning sci-fi exploration that <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> offers. You even get a mech suit eventually. The Switch version doesn’t change much, but it does make that incredible world portable, which is more than enough reason to jump in — either again or for the first time.</p><p><sub>Xenoblade Chronicles X <em>launches on the Nintendo Switch on March 20th.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>LEGO Pokémon models are seemingly in the works, as a now-removed announcement post was uploaded early to their official LEGO Mexico account on Facebook.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LEGO is one of the most popular toy production companies. It is known to collaborate with various franchises, such as Mario, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, and many more. However, one of the biggest franchises has managed to skip LEGO’s grasp for years now: Pokémon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But all that could change, as a now-removed teaser points towards an upcoming partnership announcement. Spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1je380o/lego_pok%C3%A9mon_has_been_officially_announced_coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/Legoleak</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1901974339597095025/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>), a teaser video for the LEGO x Pokémon partnership was posted early on the LEGO Mexico Facebook account, with a caption suggesting a ‘2026’ release window. The video has been removed from that account; however, you can still watch it on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1je380o/lego_pok%C3%A9mon_has_been_officially_announced_coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (at the time of writing).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 13-second teaser begins with yellow LEGO blocks coming together to form one of the most iconic tails in Pokémon: Pikachu’s tail. As electricity passes through the blocks, Pikachu uses his electric attack to illuminate two logos—LEGO and Pokémon—before vanishing into the darkness.</p>



<p>The LEGO and Pokémon partnership has not arrived sooner due to the latter’s licensing agreement with Mattel. Mattel, through its Mega Bloks brand, has sold buildable characters, play sets, building blocks, and sets for the franchise, including models for the most popular Pokémon like Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, and more. However, this new partnership could mean the end of Pokémon and Mattel’s agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pokémon TCG Pocket is getting a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-getting-a-surprise-rival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new rival in Digimon</a>. Also, Scopely acquired the Pokémon GO developer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-developer-acquired-by-scopely-for-3-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$3.5 billion</a>.

                <p>Hazelight just released Split Fiction, and the game is getting rave reviews and has sold more than 2 million copies so far. Everyone always wants to know what's next, and now director Josef Fares has confirmed Hazelight is already at work on its next project. Fares also discussed Hazelight's partnership with EA, saying the company is a good, respectful partner.</p><p>"Split Fiction is the best-received game we have done, everybody is super happy, but I'm so fully focused and excited on the next thing," he said on the <a href="https://youtu.be/G9-_n3vqsAQ?feature=shared" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Friends Per Second podcast</a> (<a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1901801846509072764" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Culture Crave</a>). "We've already started." He also confirmed work began about a month ago.</p><p>Fares didn't share any concrete information on Hazelight's next project--which is "quite early" in development--but he said the mood at the studio right now is very positive and staffers are amped for what's coming next. He said the team is feeling like they can do "way better" with the next game, whatever it turns out to be.</p><p>"It's not like we're feeling now, 'Oh, shit, how will we top [Split Fiction] or do better than this?' We just feel like... just wait until [you see] what we do next. I know it's cocky. But that's how confident we feel in what we're doing," he said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1882427844" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

including Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons (for Starbreeze), A Way Out, It Takes Two, and Split Fiction. It Takes Two has been the biggest success of the bunch, selling <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/03/06/split-fiction-josef-fares-hazelight-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23 million copies</a>. Split Fiction had <a href="https://youtu.be/QQvUgUlknis" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">almost double the budget</a> and has sold <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1900204006451925484" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2 million copies in its first week</a>.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/split-fiction-review-it-takes-pew-pew/1900-6418341/" data-ref-id="1900-6418341">Split Fiction review</a> scored the game a 10/10. The game is published by EA through its EA Originals program; it's the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-is-now-eas-no-2-game-all-time-on-steam-ahead-of-battlefield-and-fifa/1100-6529999/" data-ref-id="1100-6529999">first EA-published game to reach 90 or above on Metacritic since 2012's Mass Effect 2</a>.</p><p>All of Hazelight's games so far have been co-op titles (Brothers was a single-player game with a unique co-op element). Fares said co-op will always be part of Hazelight's DNA, but he didn't rule out the possibility of the studio changing things up. "You never know what happens in the future. It's not impossible we look into single-player as well. But it would be done in a Hazelight way, with a Hazelight twist. It's not going to be your typical single-player game."</p><p>Also in the interview, Fares shed some light on Hazelight's relationship with EA. He confirmed that Hazelight does not pitch to EA. Instead, Hazelight says to EA, "We're going to do this," Fares said. "That's it. They have zero to say about what we are doing next."</p><p>Fares said it might be true that EA is "f**king up" its partnerships with other companies, but not Hazelight. They respect us. They respect what we do. I am very clear with them that they cannot interfere with what we do."</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has announced its next wave of Game Pass titles available in March 2025, including promising-looking new British survival game Atomfall - well, if you're a PC or Ultimate subscriber.
</p>
<p>Also included in these latest additions are Mythwrecked, which is the Hades-esque adventure game from the team behind enjoyable indie Röki, and the Blizzard Arcade Collection - which includes a selection of retro classics such as Lost Vikings and Rock &amp; Roll Racing.</p>
<p>Here are the list of Xbox Game Pass additions for late March 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>Octopath Traveler 2 (Series X/S, now with Game Pass Standard) - 19th March</li>
<li>Train Sim World 5 (Console, now with Game Pass Standard) - 19th March</li>
<li>Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island (Cloud, Console, and PC) - 25th March</li>
<li>Blizzard Arcade Collection (Console and PC) - 20th March</li>
<li>Atomfall (Cloud and Console via Game Pass Ultimate, and PC) - 27th March</li>
</ul>
<p>
Tunic, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> and Monster Sanctury meanwhile join Xbox Game Pass Core, the lowest-tier subscription formerly branded as Xbox Live Gold.
</p>
<p>
As ever, as Microsoft giveth, so it taketh away. Yet more Yakuza titles are getting the chop from the Xbox Game Pass catalogue, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-march">the previous loss of Yakuza 5 and Yakuza 6 earlier in the month</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> is also going - presumably Capcom would prefer you now play Monster Hunter World.
</p>
<p>
The full list of titles leaving Xbox Game Pass on 31st March are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>MLB The Show 24 (Cloud and Console)</li>
<li>Lil Gator Game (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Open Roads (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza 0 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza Kiwami (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza Kiwami 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza Like a Dragon (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Lamplighter’s League (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Monster Hunter Rise (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.</p>
<p>For everything else in Microsoft's subscription service, you can check out our handy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-games-list-this-month-price-6400">Xbox Game Pass guide listing every title available</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Returning to a game that you love is different to rewatching a movie or revisiting a favourite book. The familiar characters and story beats are just as comforting, the emotional moments similarly cherished on repeat visits, but that interactive element, the mechanical interaction between you and the game, can wear thinner as repetitious actions finally find the limit of their interest.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xenoblade-chronicles-x">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>, a game I’ve returned to many times since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review/">its original review</a>, is a world so expansive, so populated, that it tested the relationship between player and game mechanics the very first time I played it. Fortunately, I’ve never found it wanting, and with this new Definitive Edition release you can finally experience one of the world’s best RPGs in its most complete form.</p>
<p><iframe title="How it all began... – Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition (Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pCSpEfJy7VA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Xenoblade saga, built on the foundations of the Xenogears franchise, is fundamentally a disparate collection of games, drawn together by shared thematic and narrative elements. With two numbered entries debuting on Switch alongside a Definitive Edition release of the first game in the series, Xenoblade Chronicles X was an oddity stranded on the Wii U. Thankfully it’s now being given a fresh chance to find an audience with the rest of the series on Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Set on the planet of Mira, this is humanity’s new home, having fled Earth after their home planet was caught up in a destructive war between two alien factions. The human race escaped on a series of huge colony ships, and while many were destroyed as they left the planet, The White Whale managed to make it as far as Mira, where it was finally brought down. Built from the remains of The White Whale, New Los Angeles is the new home for a race that’s desperately trying to hold onto the trappings of their former lives, despite being surrounded by danger on all sides.</p>

<p>You’re tasked with heading out across the surface of Mira to find other survivors, but before you can explore this alien world, you have to create your player. Chronicles X gives you a significant set of tools to build them, with the character design having a more realistic look than the heavy anime looks that reached their zenith with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-2-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a>. Alongside the narrative setup, it lends Xenoblade Chronicles X a completely different feel to the other games in the series.</p>

<p>Your amnesiac character isn’t really the main character though, and beyond the ability to nod and shake your head at points in the story, they are little more than an active witness to the story. However, that story, and the vibrant characters that you meet along the way, remain amongst my favourite RPG experiences. In particular, the affinity quests where you grow closer to your teammates, and the huge number of side missions, are where Monolith Soft have flexed their writing muscles, and they add depth, emotion and often a welcome dose of weirdness to the world while the main storyline hits a cavalcade of bombastic, memorable moments. For the Definitive Edition, Monolith Soft have brought in new characters, equipment and story beats that will serve to make Chronicles X as much of an adventure for returning players as it is for newcomers.</p>
<p>The planet of Mira is the true star of this alien show. Xenoblade Chronicles X features one of the greatest RPG open worlds ever created – I’d have a healthy argument that it is the best, though Breath of the Wild and Skyrim fans are welcome to submit their points. Where this world wins out is in its size, its diverse and vibrant ecosystem, and its playground nature that draws you in and spits you out a hundred hours later.</p>

<p>Just like the other games in the Xenoblade series, you can explore the majority of the world from the outset, but many of the creatures you’ll encounter will annihilate you if you stray into their field of vision. That’s true from the moment you step outside The White Whale, with herds of monsters grazing in the plains, often with an apex creature at the head of them, or it might simply be a giant monster that’s meandering around on its own. There’s an art to playing hide and seek with them, extending your research area as much as possible before a single swipe from a powerful creature sends you back to the last checkpoint.</p>
<p>One of the greatest joys in Chronicles X is seeing how far you can push things. You can run, leap and jump your way up mountains and into situations that feel as though you’ve broken the game, but it’s all part of the intended experience. It’s something that you’ll never get tired of, and just when you might be becoming overwhelmed by the sheer scale of this world, the developers through you a mecha-shaped bone.</p>
<p>Skells are Xenoblade Chronicles X’s mecha suits, and once you’ve gained the Blades’ trust – the organisation you’re working for – you’ll be able to hop in your own and explore further than ever before. These mechanical wonders significantly bump up your combat abilities, but it’s the fact that they can transform into vehicles, as well as eventually flying, that lets you explore the rest of this incredible planet, digging into every single far-flung nook and cranny. Xenoblade Chronicles X is a pure adventure, and few games can match its sense of wonder and scale.</p>

<p>While the Definitive Edition stands as a new start for the game on a console that has a much larger audience than the Wii U, there have been a variety of clear improvements made to the game that make it as much of a treat for returning fans. First and foremost, the visuals have been given an obvious tune up, with character models looking much more detailed here than in the original game.</p>
<p>It’s also so much more vibrant, where the Wii U release now looks incredibly washed out in comparison. Rounding out the most obvious changes, performance is also clearly smoother, though not without some mild hiccups when things get hectic. I do hope that the Switch 2 gives us 60fps patches for all the Xenoblade Chronicles games, but for now, 30fps remains thoroughly usable.</p>
<p>There’ve also been a host of little tweaks made to the game’s underpinnings that all serve to make the experience more fluid, or easier to understand, and the UI changes made during encounters really help to make things as clear as possible, which is especially handy when things are often descending into chaos, with multiple characters shouting instructions while a host of enemies are attacking you at the same time.</p>

<p>The iconic action palette that first appeared in the original Xenoblade Chronicles makes these interactions easier though, and I still love the MMO-like combat setup multiple games and multiple playthroughs later. As with elsewhere, it’s benefited from a little reworking, giving you extra options to heap the pain on the alien threats. If you’ve never played a Xenoblade Chronicles game before, Chronicles X Definitive Edition is an ideal starting point, and as the Switch comes to the end of its lifecycle, this is the perfect RPG swansong to go out on.</p>

						<h5>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</h5><p><span>March 20, 2025</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X has long been the black sheep of Nintendo and Monolith Soft’s ambitious JRPG franchise, partly because it opts for a harder sci-fi setting than the rest of the series, partly because it simply had the bad fortune of being released on one of Nintendo’s least successful platforms. Thankfully for hardcore fans, Nintendo is now crossing off one of the final boxes on their “Wii U ports” bingo card with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Does this tuned-up version of Xenoblade Chronicles X soar to new heights? Or is this Skell destined to crash and burn with consumers all over again? Time to assess this alien RPG once again.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X casts players as a survivor of the White Whale, an interstellar ark launched after an alien war forced humans to abandon Earth. Unfortunately, the aliens catch up with the White Whale and it crash lands on the surprisingly lively planet of Mira. After being rescued from your life pod, you soon find yourself in New Los Angeles, a spunky pop-up city built around the crashed ark's habitat unit. You're quickly recruited to join New LA's BLADE military unit under Colonel Elma and tasked with exploring Mira, eradicating threats, and discovering the location of the White Whale’s Life Hold, which is said to contain many more survivors.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X’s sci-fi setup certainly sets the game apart from other entries in the series, and the world of Mira is a rich and interesting one, with a cast of mostly likeable characters (er, and Tatsu). There are even a few decent twists later in the game, which we won't get into here, although admittedly, a lot of XCX’s minute-to-minute storytelling is fairly dry, consisting mostly of characters standing around info-dumping and repeating tired jokes. The story’s pacing also isn’t ideal, with the game often taking lengthy breaks from delivering any meaningful narrative as you’re compelled to explore Mira for hours on end.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde11.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For the majority of its runtime, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition doesn’t do that much to expand the original game’s storytelling, although there are a small handful of new playable characters and sidequests sprinkled like breadcrumbs to keep returning players enticed. Without giving anything away, XCX Definitive Edition also addresses one of the original game’s most glaring shortcomings – its incomplete, unsatisfying conclusion – by providing a new endgame. While there’s likely to be some fan debate about this new denouement, it’s certainly a meatier story bone to chew on than what Wii U players got at the time.</p>
<p>While Xenoblade Chronicles X’s story can be a bit thin at times, make no mistake, this is a dense game, packed to the gills with interlocking systems. New LA is a sprawling metropolis, consisting of several districts packed with NPCs, playable characters, vendors, and quests. Expanding Mira's map is a matter of installing data probes, which can be managed to passively produce and store various resources. Meanwhile, all your party members can be customized by assigning them different classes, skills, arts, and gear. Around halfway through the game, you’ll also gain access to towering pilotable mechs called Skells, which can be fully customized in their own right. Thankfully, all this complexity is a bit easier to digest this time around, thanks to some well-implemented gameplay updates.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X’s combat is similar to other entries in the series, with a few unique twists of its own. Your main controlled character and AI allies move and select “Arts” in real time, with many of these powerful moves requiring you to do certain things for maximum effect. XCX also introduces the unique and somewhat quirky “Soul Voice” system, wherein your allies shout out various requests ("Use a melee attack!" etc.), and if you fill those requests and properly execute a subsequent quick-time event, you'll get some sort of bonus effect. A major focus of XCX Definitive Edition is making the Soul Voice system easier to grapple with, with additions like a quick cooldown system that allows you to fire off a limited number of Arts whenever you want. This arguably makes battles a bit easier, but it also improves the overall flow of combat and allows players to better take advantage of the Soul Voice system.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde12.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ultimately, though, the most important improvement to XCX Definitive Edition’s combat is the game’s slick new UI. In the original Xenoblade Chronicles X, the screen was flooded with hard-to-follow information during combat, but this time around, the UI has been redesigned to be larger, cleaner, and more readable. The Soul Voice system feels much easier to get your head around now, with the game more clearly communicating which Arts your allies want you to use. The improved UI doesn’t just benefit combat either, pretty much <em>anything</em> that involves a menu is more readable and useable now.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Another thing that’s much better in this version of Xenoblade Chronicles X is the map. Originally, you could only access the world map on the Wii U GamePad, which was novel I suppose, but really limited the map’s functionality. Now, you can simply access the map on your TV screen, which allows for a much wider field of view and more detail. Other new map features have also been added, including the ability to track key quest-related collectibles.</p>
<p>Monolith Soft also weren’t afraid to take a scalpel to some original XCX systems. Field Skills, which required you to join a BLADE faction and level up in order to access certain treasures and install some data probes, have been more or less excised. Now, when you find a treasure or probe location, you can, 9 times out of 10, just interact with it. Some may lament no longer being able to roleplay as a faction to the same degree, but the Field Skill system always felt rather arbitrary, and removing it mainly just eliminates an extra layer of needless grind.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde13.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Don’t get me wrong; there are still a few nagging irritations left over from the original version of Xenoblade Chronicles X. Checkpoints are more sparsely placed in the open world than they ought to be, which means death sometimes sets you back quite a ways. The Skell “insurance” system, which basically gives you a mere three lives for each Skell you buy, also remains intact. That said, a few small lingering frustrations aside, this feels like a much more playable, streamlined version of Xenoblade Chronicles X.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde14.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition’s visual upgrade doesn’t deliver quite as strongly as its UI and gameplay tweaks. Most of the game’s character models have been updated, but I don’t know if they’ve been universally <em>upgraded</em> (I honestly prefer Elma’s original, softer character design). Mira itself doesn't look that markedly different, but everything is a bit sharper, and the game looks surprisingly good in handheld mode.</p>
<p>I was also somewhat disappointed that issues present in the Wii U version of Xenoblade Chronicles X, like frequent pop-in, are still present on Switch. Draw distance is definitely improved, but you'll still see enemies and objects blink into existence not that far ahead of you at times. I did also note occasional performance hiccups, although, overall, the game does run better than some other recent first-party Switch titles. Oh, and yes, the soundtrack is still a bit of a dog’s breakfast, mixing some rather good instrumental tracks with some clunkers featuring irritating repetitive lyrics. Now, make no mistake, Xenoblade Chronicles X is still rather lovely at times, with an impressive sense of scope, imaginatively rendered vistas, and some of the game’s better tunes sometimes combining to deliver striking moments.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde15.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>And really, it’s always been the world of Mira that makes Xenoblade Chronicles X a standout. A lot of the open-world design philosophies that Nintendo and Monolith Soft would later refine with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild were birthed here, and in some ways, Mira is even more interesting than Hyrule. The world is packed with mind-bending panoramas and getting to your next mission marker often feels like a puzzle to be solved, with players having to think vertically as well as horizontally. The wildlife you’ll encounter is quite the sorted menagerie as well, with not-terribly-intimidating enemies like alien boars and bugs hanging out right next to towering dinosaur-like monstrosities. Just fighting everything in your path isn't an option, and often figuring out how to sneak past a nest of particularly nasty baddies is part of the complex environmental puzzle.</p>
<p>Exploring isn’t always seamless. One of the most important innovations Zelda BotW introduced was the ability to climb nearly everything, while a lot of your time in XCX is spent gormlessly jumping against rocks and cliffs, hoping your feet will find purchase and allow you to scramble to the top. Small complaints aside, though, this is a fantastic world, and the feeling of increasing power you get as you play through the game is really unmatched in a JRPG. You feel amazing once you get your first Skell and start bounding over previously impassable obstacles, and once you gain the ability to <em>fly</em>? Forget about it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde16.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition’s core campaign is one of the least daunting in the series. If you stay focused, you can get through the game’s original dozen chapters in around 40 to 50 hours, thanks to changes designed to reduce grind. Of course, if you take all the game’s side content and newly added stuff into account, you could easily be playing for hundreds of hours. Perhaps the best testament to how well this Definitive Edition is handled is that I actually enjoyed this second playthrough of XCX on Switch <em>more</em> than my first, despite it being a less novel experience, and I think other BLADE veterans will feel the same way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-jason-blundell-new-playstation-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>veteran Jason Blundell, who's worked on some of the series' biggest games, is now heading up a new studio for PlayStation by the name of Dark Outlaw Games.</p>

<p>This news was revealed in an interview with gaming journalist Jeff Gerstmann (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/75045/call-of-duty-vet-blundell-helming-new-playstation-studio-dark-outlaw-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PCGamesInsider</a>), during which Blundell revealed that he's been "working away in the shadows" on a game that has yet to be announced.</p>

<p>Blundell goes on to say that it's a "privilege" to be able to work as part of a first-party Sony studio, although I'm pretty sure that some of Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">more recent casualties</a> might have something to say about that assessment.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-iiii-jason-blundell-firefight.jpg?itok=6K48jePQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-iiii-jason-blundell-firefight.jpg?itok=ptbBVLn6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jason Blundell has worked on some of the biggest&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games.</figcaption></figure><p>Blundell also acknowledges in the interview that Sony "doesn't set up first-party studios all the time" and says he's "excited" to be working on Dark Outlaw's debut project, although he doesn't reveal what that project is.</p>

<p>If Blundell's past experience is anything to go by, however, we can probably assume that it'll be a first-person shooter of some kind, and since he's a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>veteran with experience working on the series' Zombies modes, Dark Outlaw's game could well have live service elements.</p>

<p>Whether or not that's a logical move for Sony remains to be seen; the company's most recent live service shooter experiment, last year's&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, ended in disaster. The game was&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down in just two weeks</a> and its developer was subsequently shuttered for good.</p>

<p>This also won't be Blundell's first foray into development for PlayStation; after leaving Treyarch in 2018, he founded Deviation Games, which was working on a new IP for PlayStation. However, Blundell left in 2022, and the developer then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deviation-games-is-shut-down-before-it-can-ship-a-game-in-its-partnership-with-playstation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">closed its doors last year</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether Vonderhaar's studio will join the procession of NetEase studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">losing their funding</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">laying off staff members</a>.

It was around the time the sigil-ridden corpse hooked up to a breathing tube pooped out a slithering, smiling garden gnome, and shortly after I had to sacrifice my arms, legs, colours and voice to a bunch of hideous trees that I realised that, hang on, this isn't my current lunchtime favourite Bracket City. This is the demo for Moroi, a top-down "dark fairytale" from Violet Saint and publishers Good Shepherd, in which you are a horrible little man in a world of talking meat grinders, plughole maggots, and clamp-faced crawling things. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The friendliest the demo gets is when the duck from Sony's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Laf9vpJMDjA">old Third Place adverts</a> tears out its own chunky molars for you to glue to your sword. Suffice it to say that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> has fresh competition in the subgenre of mutilation-driven action games, though the mechanics and tone are perhaps more in keeping with the venerable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-mcgees-alice">American McGee's Alice</a>. Here's a trailer (it's an older one - there's a newer one but it has a spoilery voiceover).

<p>
The premise here is that you're a prisoner of the Cosmic Engine, "a personalized hellscape designed to distort any semblance of normalcy". You are there because you've done something really rather awful, but the Engine's denizens aren't especially inclined to fill you in. "Your name, your past: gone, but not the record of your misdeeds," explains the Steam page. "Your crimes: beyond comprehension. Your conviction: incontestable. Your sentence: eternal. The need to escape and set things right: undeniable." 
</p>
<p>
Before you can get into all that you'll need to massacre a lot of squidgy medieval thugs. Your starting weapons are a blade with a combo alt fire, and a Gatling nailgun that overheats. Fill up your Execute bar and you can slaughter people for health orbs - I didn't come across any regular healing items in the demo. It feels like a straightforward shmup: backpedal, strafe, and kite until everything is giblets. I'm far more interested in the geography and mythology of this particular nightmare frontier. 
</p>
<p>
In the demo's Sky Prison, there is a pronounced emphasis on eating or being eaten. You meet a fellow who's gnawing on his own arm - he promptly scolds you for not grasping "the beauty of my art". The aforesaid sentient bone-thresher, meanwhile, asks if it can devour you after explaining that it was thrown in jail for guzzling a chef. Being something of a people-pleaser, I said yes, but the meatgrinder spat me out because I tasted bad. Rude. These culinary matters aside, I'm keen to learn more about the opening screen, which shows a hollow-eyed pixie blowing up an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophanim">Ophanim</a> like a party balloon.
</p>
<p>
There's a slight sense of filthy-brained writers and artists engaged in ostentatious brinkmanship, striving to revolt each other at the expense of craft. Put it this way, you could upend the contents of the Sky Prison across the whole game and it'd be spilled intestines enough for most players. There's a stop-motion judder and a rotten toybox ambience to Moroi that reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-games-you-missed-in-2021-sluggish-morss-pattern-circus">Jack King-Spooner's work</a>, but so far, King-Spooner's games deploy their ugliness more purposefully. At times, this just feels like grot for the love of it, with a predictable heavy metal soundtrack. It's more butchery than surgery.
</p>
<p>
Still, I'm partial to a bit of grot now and then. Even over lunch, though I'm definitely thankful right now that I don't eat meat. Moroi hath yet no release date - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2518410/Moroi/">you can read more and find the demo on Steam</a>.

It doesn’t have the usual Pikachu/Charizard hype machine, but what it <em>does</em> have are some of the most meta-relevant cards in recent sets and artwork that absolutely slaps. The pull rates? Not great. The chase cards? Expensive. The FOMO when Roaring Moon ex keeps dodging your packs? Very real.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon US: Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Roaring Moon)</h2></div><div catalogid="311bd43a-0408-4d85-a904-50c6012d8dda" id="216918"><div id="216918" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Roaring Moon)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Iron Valiant ETB comes with a full-art Iron Bundle promo and futuristic-themed sleeves, because nothing says "Pokémon" like a robot Delibird.

You get a Scream Tail promo, Roaring Moon-themed sleeves, and the best shot at pulling a Roaring Moon ex, assuming the universe doesn’t hate you. The Roaring Moon ETB has been the hardest to find at retail price, which is why I'm hyped to find this ETB in stock. If you want it, grab it before the resellers do.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon UK: Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Roaring Moon)</h2></div><div catalogid="738405dd-7e39-45c3-8b6a-3ed6806236d5" id="216920"><div id="216920" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Roaring Moon))</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Roaring Moon ex (Special Illustration Rare) is <em>the</em> card of the set, currently sitting at around $60 on the resale market. It’s one of the strongest attackers in the game right now, and the artwork is top-tier. If you pull this, congratulations!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Groudon (Illustration Rare) is another savage looking card, hovering around $100. This is one of those cards that just <em>looks</em> valuable.
