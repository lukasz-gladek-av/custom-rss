            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-unveils-new-playing-to-win-strategy-expanding-their-reach-to-more-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hasbro has announced a new company business strategy. The toy and tabletop company behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> and Dungeons &amp; Dragons has announced Playing to Win, a strategy that will focus more on play-fueled franchises and ongoing partnerships.</p>

<h2>The Hasbro Playing to Win Strategy Announcement</h2>

<p>Hasbro's Playing to Win strategy was announced alongside their <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/32a267bf-241b-4541-91ab-7745ed17693d" rel="nofollow">Q4 and Full Year 2024 Financial Report</a>. In that report, Hasbro CEO, and AI advocate, Chris Cocks discussed areas of growth, revenue, and decline for the various IPs and studios under Hasbro's umbrella.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hasbro-financial-year-presentation-slide.jpg?itok=xeMIvhOF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hasbro-financial-year-presentation-slide.jpg?itok=bA-f6-5N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One of the major areas of growth was the franchises under the stewardship of Wizards of the Coast. Both WOTC and Digital games were up 4% YoY courtesy of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <em>Monopoly Go, </em>and strong ongoing sales of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cocks even stated that <em>Magic's</em> ecosystem remains "as healthy and engaged" as it has ever been thanks to strong set sales and Secret Lairs.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> also showed ongoing growth. The new 2024 <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Player's Handbook</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em></a>, and brand-new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/2024-monster-manual-review-we-take-look-at-some-of-dds-most-well-known-monsters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monster Manual</em></a> have been breaking sales records for the best-selling D&amp;D books ever as well as increased digital revenue through the D&amp;D Beyond marketplace.</p>

<p>Notably, while analog sales of Wizards products were down by 16%, digital sales were up 3% and digital licensing was up 7%. This does align with the rise of online TTRPG play over physical book purchases and WOTC's own investment in their own D&amp;D-focused virtual tabletop, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-direct-2024-highlights-future-of-dd-and-showcases-project-sigil" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sigil</a>.</p>

<p>Within this financial report, Cocks discussed Hasbro's Playing to Win business strategy. Simply put, the plan involves Hasbro investing hard on their play-first franchises and partnerships, increasing play and appeal to older fans, expanding reach to emerging markets, and building more videogames with their IP.</p>

<p>The first part of this strategy is self-evident in Hasbro's toylines. Their toy robot franchise, <em>Transformers</em>, continues to sell to its target demographic of children, bolstered by the recent <em>Transformers One</em> feature film.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hasbro-magic-the-gathering-financial-slide.jpg?itok=hMFKzq4N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hasbro-magic-the-gathering-financial-slide.jpg?itok=DjYRirT_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As for partnerships, the company has plenty. In addition to the recent <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-magic-gathering-crossover-brings-classic-art-and-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">crossover with <em>Final Fantasy</em></a>, the popular card game will be crossing over with Marvel's Spider-Man in 2025 alongside a third unannounced Universes Beyond set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Expanding their reach to emerging markets are covered with the recently announced <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> movie coming courtesy of Legendary Pictures and a new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> TV show by Netflix and executive producer Shawn Levy.</p>

<p>Finally, building new videogames based on Hasbro's IP aligns with the announcement that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/space-marine-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2</em></a> developer Saber Interactive is working on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new AAA game</a> based on a Hasbro franchise. Given Space Marine 2's gameplay is full of high-octane action, there's a strong chance this game will align with Hasbro's appeal to older fans.</p>

<p>In short, the Playing to Win strategy seems to be the company leaning more into digital sales, leveraging partnerships with other studios for multimedia projects, and investing in their bestselling franchises.</p>

            <p>
Developer MachineGames' steady finessing of last year's stellar <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> continues today with the launch a third major update for the acclaimed third-person action-adventure. This time around, there's support for a range of new graphics features on PC - including DLSS 4 - as well as the usually array of bug fixes and more.
</p>
<p>
Starting with those graphics features, there's that DLSS 4 support, giving PC players access to the likes of transformer-based Multi Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, and updated versions of DLAA and DLSS Super Resolution - provided their hardware supports them.
</p>
<p>
Update 3 also includes a new option for ray-traced shadows that utilises all light sources within a player's surroundings (as opposed to just the sun) when Path Tracing is enabled. Additionally, Path Tracing is now available on Intel and AMD GPUs, and there's support for AMD 3.1 upscaling and frame generation, as well as Intel XESS 1.4 upscaling.

<p>
Away from the PC-specific new features, all platforms get an <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/19eQtJoGEbNeavznlgvNMH/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3">extensive helping of quality of life improvements and bug fixes</a>. Repair kits can, for instance, now be used directly from the inventory, rather than only after selecting a broken weapon or tool.
</p>
<p>
And as for what's next, other than Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's still undated PS5 release, MachineGames says Nvidia RTX hair support is coming in a future update, and it's also looking into adding support for community requested features such as HUD modification.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if you've read all this and somehow still don't know what an Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is, allow me to point you toward <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's five star review</a>, which called it a "stealth action tour de force" and a "bold new era for MachineGames". That was before we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">crowned it our Game of 2024</a> too. And finally, Update 3's patch notes (spoilers ahead):

<li>Improvements to combat and stealth music transitions, to make them more seamless</li>
<li>Added sound for heavyweight enemies breaking out of a clinch</li>

                <p>There's a famous line in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings where Gandalf the Grey explains that a wizard is never late or early. Instead, "he arrives precisely when he means to." Video games, on the other hand, are another matter. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game/" data-ref-id="5000-604117">Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game</a> has been delayed again.</p><p>The game's developers, Private Division and Wētā Workshop, jointly announced that Tales of the Shire will now be released on July 29. Prior to that, Tales of the Shire was delayed from its 2024 release window and was scheduled to land on March 25. Now, fans will just have to wait until summer to move into the virtual Shire.</p><p>In the statement below, the given reason for the delay is that the devs want to ensure "the same cozy experience" is available on all platforms. The note also states that the developers want the game "to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4447318-talesoftheshirenote.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447318" data-ratio="1" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4447318-talesoftheshirenote.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447318"></a><figcaption>The complete message from Tales of the Shire developers Private Division and Wētā Workshop.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4447318-talesoftheshirenote.jpg"></figure><p>There will be no epic quests or ring-tossing into Mount Doom in this game. Tales of the Shire is all about the tranquil lives of Hobbits when they aren't out saving the world or having adventures. Truthfully, Bilbo and Frodo Baggins--as well Sam, Pippin, and Merry--were always outliers among their people. Most of the Hobbits prefer to stay at home in the Shire.</p><p>This game will allow players to create their own Hobbit character, and put together a beautiful home for them. Players can also enjoy simple Hobbit tasks like farming, gardening, decorating, and trading for rare items with fellow residents of the Shire.</p><p>Tales of the Shire will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC .

Hopefully the final version of the game will deliver those adjustments.</p>

		<p>Hasbro and Saber Interactive have announced a new partnership to develop a new AAA game from one of the toy giant’s “tentpole IPs”.</p>
<p>Given how big Hasbro is and how many toy ranges and properties they produced, that could be pretty much anything. Hasbro owns Dungeon &amp; Dragons, Transformers, Magic: The Gathering, Monopoly, GI Joe, Battleship, Risk, Jenga, and so, so much more.</p>


<p>Of course, Saber is now best known for their excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, which launched to plenty critical and fan praise last year, and their surprising World War Z adaptation before then. We know their strengths as developers, and the technical prowess of their game engine to throw hundreds or thousands of individual enemies around on screen. It was great when used for a zombie shooter, and the perfect for depicting the Tyranids of 40K.</p>
<p>“We have many new digital collaborations in the works, but I’m especially excited to announce this one today, being a personal fan of many of this team’s games,” Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said in an earnings call. “Hasbro and Saber Interactive will be collaborating on an all-new video game partnership developed by the team behind 2024’s megahit, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Combining high-octane single-player action and amazing multiplayer with Saber’s Swarm tech, this new AAA title, based on one of our tentpole IPs, is sure to be a hit.”</p>
<p>Joining all of the dots, the answer’s pretty obvious.</p>

<p>Saber is clearly making <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/25/larian-boss-says-wizards-of-the-coast-not-to-blame-for-them-moving-on-from-baldurs-gate/">Baldur’s Gate 4</a>.</p>
<p>(Actually my money is on Transformers)</p>
<p>Answering questions, Cocks said that this would be a co-publishing deal, and that it’s specifically tapping the Space Marine 2 team to make the game – which was developed by the company’s main studio in Saint Petersburg, Russia. This sadly seems to reduce the odds of a Space Marine 3 happening, unless that project is already underway and the Hasbro collaboration scheduled to come after that.</p>

And it’s in here that we got out latest piece of evidence that a new <em>Tony Hawk </em>video game is soon to be announced. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>Charlie Intel </em>on Twitter</a></span>, in the new Grind map, you can find a skate shop area and in there you can spot a small poster that clearly includes the OG <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater </em>logo as well as a date: March 4, 2025. In response to the teaser, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tonyhawk/status/1892622967579832757&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tonyhawk/status/1892622967579832757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tony Hawk himself simply replied with eyeball emojis</a></span>, seemingly confirming that, yeah, this is for sure a teaser for a new game. (Xbox on Twitter also replied with the same emoji.) </p><p>Why did this appear in a <em>Call of Duty </em>game? Well, remember that before Activision was a <em>Call of Duty </em>machine, it published all the past <em>Tony Hawk</em> games. So this seems to be a bit of corporate synergy. How fun!</p><p>This is just the latest (and most concrete) evidence of a new <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-new-game-remaster-leak-confirmed-1851765242&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-new-game-remaster-leak-confirmed-1851765242">Earlier this week</a></span> a skateboarder who appeared in the last game, 2020's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://eneba-games.sjv.io/09da5O&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://eneba-games.sjv.io/09da5O" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2</em></a></span><em>,</em> claimed he’s appearing in a new <em>Tony Hawk</em> “remaster.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-activision-new-game-confirmed-thps-1851646946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-activision-new-game-confirmed-thps-1851646946">And in 2024</a></span>, Tony Hawk himself claimed the series had a future and that he was working with Activision again. </p><p>And on top of all that, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Wednesday, it was reported</a></span> that Microsoft (which owns Activision) was planning to announce and release a new <em>Tony Hawk </em>game in June as part of a yet-to-be-announced summer event.

Included with an ammo chest of new features, weapons, and more content was the return of the fan-favorite skate-themed map, Grind. The skatepark arena has been brought back mostly as fans remember it, with one exception being a giant, in-game TV screen featuring a very Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater-looking logo and a date of March 4, 2025.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Looks like a teaser for something related to Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater has been found in Black Ops 6’s Grind MP map!</p><p>Announcement on March 4. 👀 <a href="https://t.co/8efl6Qansl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8efl6Qansl</a></p></div>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It stops short of being in-your-face but is still undeniably an eyebrow-raising reference for fans who have been on the lookout for another entry in the Pro Skater series. Rumors that another installment could soon be announced began earlier this week when fellow skater Tyshawn Jones let it slip that he would soon be featured in an upcoming Tony Hawk video game (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-skater-claims-hes-in-a-new-tony-hawk-remaster-about-to-come-out/#google_vignette" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m in a Tony Hawk coming out, so that’s cool,” Jones said during a conversation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3umK3xG7Ly4&amp;t=1s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Breakfast Club podcast</u></a>. “They got a new one they remastering so that’s about to come out. I was in the last one.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a curious comment that had fans excited, with today’s newly revealed Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater Black Ops 6 Easter Egg letting them know when they can expect to learn more. Unfortunately, there’s no telling what exactly that March date has in store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision tried to breathe life into the franchise with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 5</a> back in 2015 but has yet to release another new numbered entry since. However, in 2020, fans received the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2">Pro Skater 1 + 2 remakes</a> from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-developer-vicarious-visions-blizzard-entertainment">Vicarious Visions</a>. That means it’s been five years since a Tony Hawk game hit store shelves. With so much evidence lining up for a big reveal next month, it seems the wait may soon be over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to see what that March 4 reveal has lined up, you can read up on a few of the other skateboarding-themed inclusions in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 2 Reloaded, including a pack of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activisions-costly-call-of-duty-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-crossover-has-some-players-saying-black-ops-6-should-just-go-free-to-play-at-this-point">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cosmetics that have some fans upset</a>.

Although there are a handful of crash fixes, there aren't many major issues at all in this patch, which Warhorse is calling Hotfix 1.1.2. Instead, the most exciting revision comes in The King's Gambit, where players can now keep the wine flowing for the king.</p><p>As related on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/1imfa12/kcd2_cant_pick_up_white_wine_during_the_kings/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, some players ran into an issue in The King's Gambit where the option to pour wine for the king disappears. When the king asks to switch from red wine to white, players failed the task when they couldn't fulfil that simple request.</p><p>Warhorse shared the Hotfix 1.1.2 breakdown on <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/hotfix-1-1-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. According to the developers, the primary adjustments include stability improvements and quest fixes. There's also a specific fix for the game on the Epic Games Store. Taken together, these changes may not seem very significant, but they're meant to help players have a more refined experience.</p><p>So far, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has been a massive hit for Warhorse Studios. It sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-tops-1-million-copies-sold-in-a-single-day/1100-6529264/" data-ref-id="1100-6529264">1 million copies in its first 24 hours</a>, and recently passed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-studio-reports-its-approaching-2-million-sales/1100-6529486/" data-ref-id="1100-6529486">the 2 million mark</a> as well.

                <p>EA and Hazelight Studios have <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/it-takes-two/about/friends-pass" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed information</a> about how Split Fiction's Friend's Pass and cross-play between different platforms work. There's even a free trial for players who don't own the game.</p><p>Similar to Hazelight's previous co-op games like It Takes Two and A Way Out, Split Fiction also offers a Friend's Pass. This allows players who bought the game to connect with someone who doesn't have a copy, and play through the game in its entirety. But this time, Split Fiction's version has some expanded features that weren't in those previous games, such as cross-platform play.</p><h2>How does Split Fiction's work?</h2><p>The first step is that one person has to own the game, whether it'd be a physical or digital copy. The next step is to have a buddy download Split Fiction's Friend's Pass on their chosen platform, whether it'd be PC, PlayStation, or Xbox through their respective digital storefronts. Just be aware that if you and your friend are playing on different platforms, for example PC and PlayStation, both of you need an EA account.</p><p>Next, the person who owns Split Fiction should send an in-game invite to their friend, whom then accepts the invite. Once that step is completed, both players can play through the entire game together.</p><p>What happens if neither of you own the game? No problem. The Friend's Pass offers a free trial for both players which includes the opening stages of Split Fiction. Both players will need to download the Friend's Pass version of the game, and once either of you purchase the full game, progresses can be continued.</p><p>Another aspect to note is that in It Takes Two and A Way Out, the player who was on the Friend's Pass version did not unlock trophies or achievements on their platform, while the one who owned the game did. At least in A Way Out, if the player on the Friend's Pass decides to purchase the full game later on, <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/a-way-out/a-way-out/play-a-way-out-with-the-friends-pass/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">they will retroactively earn the trophies and achievements</a> they would have unlocked while on the pass. It's unknown whether this is the same case for Split Fiction.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AAzbMPitPI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4AAzbMPitPI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>How does cross-play in Split Fiction work?</h2><p>It Takes Two and A Way Out didn't have cross-play, meaning that both players had to be on the same platform in order to play with each other. However, It Takes Two had cross-gen play, meaning that PS4 and PS5 players and Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S players could play with each other as long as they were on the same platform family.</p><p>Split Fiction is only on current-gen consoles, so cross-gen play doesn't exist. However, Split Fiction now offers cross-play, meaning that PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S players can all play together. Cross-play requires both players to sign up for separate EA accounts each, which you can <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help-home/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">make for free</a>.</p><p>Hazelight also has a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/hazelight" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord server</a> with a channel called "Looking for Player" for those who want to play Split Fiction with but don't have anyone available to arrange game sessions.</p><p>Split Fiction launches on March 6 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

			<p>Today, Hazelight Studios announced that their highly anticipated new adventure game Split Fiction will be playable through crossplay across all platforms. This greatly enhances any player's ability to play with their friends since Split Fiction, like Hazelight's prior games, is co-op only.</p>
<p>But there's more. While the studio's previous games also implemented free passes for friends, enticing a casual gamer to play with a more hardcore gamer who bought the game, this time there's an evolution of that.</p>
<p>Through the Friend's Pass Trial, even if neither player owns a copy of Split Fiction, they can still experience a trial version using the Friend's Pass. Once they both download and launch the Friend's Pass version of the game, they will unlock the opportunity to invite each other to play the opening stages of the game together. If they like the game, they can progress if just one of them purchases a full copy of the game, which will be priced at $49.99 when it launches on March 6 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store and the EA app.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | How to Invite a Friend for Free with the Friend's Pass" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AAzbMPitPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Josef Fares and his team garnered widespread acclaim, especially with their latest title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Takes Two</a>, which won several Game of the Year awards. Split Fiction is also about a duo, although a very different one.</p>
<p>This time, players will step into the roles of Mio and Zoe. They're both writers, although one writes sci-fi, and the other fantasy, and they have wildly different personalities. They both find themselves trapped in their own stories after being hooked up to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas. Relying on each other to escape with their memories intact, they work together to master a variety of skills and overcome various challenges as they jump between sci-fi and fantasy worlds in what Hazelight promises will be an unexpected tale of friendship. The full PC system requirements for Split Fiction are available below.</p>

It just might mean you need to have two versions of the game installed depending on who you are playing with, which sounds kind of silly even if I understand why.</p><p>Regardless of that hang-up, its nice to see Rockstar Games finally getting around to updating the PC port of<em> GTA V</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006">even if we are likely less than a year away from the release of <em>GTA 6</em></a></span>.

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Those little <em>Among Us</em> beans are being transported to a new dimension<em>.</em> Developer Innersloth has announced a new game called <em>Among Us 3D</em>, which is exactly what it sounds like: the hit multiplayer deduction game, but played in a three-dimensional world from a first-person perspective.</p><p>If that sounds familiar, it’s because that’s what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/11/23392699/among-us-vr-meta-quest-2-release-date">the VR version of the game was when it launched in 2022</a>. <em>3D</em> will make that experience playable without the need for a headset. With the launch of <em>Among Us 3D</em>, the VR version will be rebranded, and the new release will unite players across both PC and VR through cross-play.</p><p>The studio says that this “will allow Steam PC users to join cross-platform lobbies with VR players on Meta Quest, Steam VR, PlayStation VR 2, and PICO.”</p><p>It’s not clear yet when the 3D game will be launching, but the studio says that it’s coming soon on Steam. A demo will be available as part of Steam Next Fest on Monday. And while the original 2D version of <em>Among Us</em> will still exist, there will be no cross-play between it and the first-person edition.</p><p>As part of the announcement, Innersloth also revealed a new in-game currency called “stardust,” which will be used to buy cosmetics in <em>Among Us 3D</em>. The studio specified that the currency won’t be used for purchasing any actual game modes or features. Here’s the full roadmap for what has been announced so far:</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
