<p>Ready for Black Friday? With Christmas just around the corner, many gamers are trying to grab the best deals possible. Like every year, Xbox has quite a few deals people can choose from. Here are the best Black Friday Deals for Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-xbox-series-x-s-black-friday-deals">Best Xbox Series X|S Black Friday Deals</h2>



<p>Excited to find the best Xbox Series X|S deals this Black Friday? Well, Xbox will be doing quite a few deals for Xbox Series X|S systems, controllers and games.</p>



<p>However, no actual Black Friday deals have been released by the company, many are already speculating that the system will have huge bundle deals at stores like Walmart, Target, Best Buy and more.</p>



<p>Every year, too, many of these popular retail stores have a bunch of different discounts on games. With popular titles like Call of Duty just releasing a new game, gamers should expect to see deals revolving around the games to release on Black Friday.</p>







<h2 id="h-current-xbox-series-x-s-deals">Current Xbox Series X|S Deals</h2>



<p>Luckily, Xbox has a ton of deals already in its store, meaning gamers can indulge in the Black Friday festivities early on. Below is a list of current Xbox deals gamers can grab in the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/promotions/sales/sales-and-specials">Microsoft store:</a></p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X ($50 off)</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The page also has quite a few games for sale, too. However, the majority of these games for sale are not big titles. The big titles, like Call of Duty and more, will not be released until Black Friday.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-black-friday-deals">How to Get Black Friday Deals</h2>



<p>Luckily, Black Friday deals are not as difficult to come by as they were in the past when you had to wait outside a store until midnight. Many retailers, like Walmart and Target, will release their deals earlier in the day on Thanksgiving, giving consumers the chance to grab whatever their heart desires early on.</p>



<p>Still, many deals, especially on Xbox games and systems, will go incredibly fast, so be prepared to have your money out.</p>

Meanwhile, those playing Cataclysm Classic will progress on to Mists of Pandaria in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard announced the news as part of its Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct, along the way confirming in advance the new vanilla servers (minus the fresh Hardcore servers that are also coming) will automatically progress to The Burning Crusade Classic when the time comes. Blizzard said that just because TBC is already confirmed doesn't necessarily mean these new servers will keep moving forward all the way to Cataclysm (the expansion players who have kept progressing from WoW Classic's 2019 launch servers are currently on), but it's hard not to get some sense of deja vu.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYGvtbrDiiw" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uYGvtbrDiiw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with GameSpot, WoW Classic lead software engineer Nora Valletta and software engineer Kevin Vigue offered more details on what players starting from scratch on the fresh servers can expect, their thoughts on moving on to Mists of Pandaria, and what the team has learned from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">more experimental swings like Season of Discovery</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard is using advances in server technology to have larger realms that can hold more players but fewer realms overall for this batch of new servers. In a departure from normal, there will not be dedicated role-playing or RPPvP servers as has usually been the case in the past, Valletta confirmed. Quality-of-life improvements, like the world buff-saving Chronoboon Displacer, faction balancing on PvP realms, and updates to make the original game's punishing Honor PvP rank system less punishing, will be present at launch for these new servers, as will a ban (at least in North America and Europe) on the controversial practice of GDKP runs--something Blizzard first implemented in Season of Discovery. In a change from 2019, the game's first raid, Molten Core, won't launch for a few weeks. The new servers will additionally have a group-finder tool (similar to one that appeared in TBC, Vigue said) to help players find groups without the need of an add-on.</p><p dir="ltr">A recent, unpopular change that saw Blizzard update the guild interface in WoW Classic and Season of Discovery to a more modern version will be reverted come the rollout of the new fresh servers, Vigue announced. Players will instead have the option of choosing between the more modern UI or its original appearance: a choice Blizzard doesn't want to make a habit of offering but said felt right in regards to guilds.</p><p dir="ltr">"We realized, especially once we saw the community reaction, 'Yeah, there is something really nostalgic about the original UI and how it's presented and what it means for that game experience,'" Vigue said.</p><p dir="ltr">Adding to the sense of we've been here before is Blizzard's announcement that Cataclysm Classic servers will move on in Summer 2025 to yet another "new" expansion, 2012's Mists of Pandaria. Players may have already revisited Mists of Pandaria as part of modern WoW's Mists of Pandaria Remix event earlier this year, but Valletta and Vigue said they think the two experiences are different enough to warrant another go around.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4399083-wowclassic2025roadmap.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399083" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4399083-wowclassic2025roadmap.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399083"></a><figcaption>WoW Classic's 2025 roadmap.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4399083-wowclassic2025roadmap.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Mists of Pandaria Remix used the expansion as backdrop for players to collect exclusive cosmetics and gain new overpowered abilities that could almost one-shot even the game's toughest bosses, but it still played like modern WoW, with all of its current class design, talents, and abilities. Mists of Pandaria Classic will instead play as it did when it first launched over a decade ago. Vigue and Valletta also raised the point that every expansion was some WoW player's entry point into the MMORPG, and so Mists of Pandaria is, for some people, their "classic." It's an expansion that was perhaps under-appreciated in its time, but players now have fond memories of.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think the fact that MoP Remix was so well received speaks to…how much people love Pandaria as a continent and as an expansion," Vigue said.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the currently ongoing WoW Classic Season of Discovery, Blizzard's more experimental take on original WoW that was released towards the tail end of 2023, there's still some new content coming down the pike. The game's Naxxramas update will arrive later this winter. In addition to vanilla WoW's final raid, it will add new "instanced" content in the form of a new encounter against the Scarlet Crusade as well as the Karazhan Crypts, which Blizzard originally teased back when it first announced Season of Discovery at BlizzCon 2023. Vigue and Valletta wouldn't say whether the new content will be in the forms of raids, dungeons, or a combination of both, and instead said players will have to "discover" what's in store themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">Vigue and Valletta also wouldn't comment on what may come next after Season of Discovery--the "team's always cooking," Valletta said--but did say they have learned a ton from the seasonal server in regards to how to create new content for a 20-year-old game while still trying to maintain its original feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've found Season of Discovery to be incredibly successful," Valletta said. "I think part of what made it successful is that sense of…[the new content] is very much down to earth. It wasn't massive, universe-ending world threats. It's you, yourself, as that character in that world…You're not some mighty fine champion hero who everybody knows and everything revolves around you, right? You exist in the world but the world is the main character, and you're part of that."</p><p dir="ltr">All the WoW Classic news was just one part of the Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct. Blizzard also launched new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-1-and-2-remastered-make-up-a-new-warcraft-battle-chest-available-today/1100-6527719/" data-ref-id="1100-6527719">remastered versions of Warcraft 1 and 2</a>, announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hearthstone-2025-roadmap-includes-starcraft-crossover-and-a-return-to-ungoro-crater/1100-6527722/" data-ref-id="1100-6527722">StarCraft mini-set for Hearthstone</a>, and more.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-176391">Hearthstone's</a> next mini-set is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-20">StarCraft</a> crossover: one that will reimagine the various units of Blizzard's beloved sci-fi RTS in card form. In addition to this, Blizzard announced an entire year's worth of Hearthstone expansions in one go and a dramatic change to the game's Arena mode, giving players a full picture of what to expect in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, Blizzard made the bold move of announcing a StarCraft crossover during its Warcraft 30th anniversary direct--a livestream that also celebrated 10 years of Hearthstone. The crossover is the largest mini-set Blizzard has ever done for its digital card game, with 49 total cards.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFFB2ysJLTQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LFFB2ysJLTQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">To learn more, GameSpot sat down with Hearthstone senior game designer Cora Georgiou and game designer Leo Robles Gonzalez ahead of the direct to talk about what it was like adapting StarCraft into card game form, the upcoming changes to Arena, and all of the expansions coming next year.</p><p dir="ltr">Gonzalez said the development team is trying to be a bit more "adventurous," given that the game is a decade old and its players are eager to see new things. That's one of the reasons it went big on the upcoming StarCraft mini-set.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think we're trying to swing pretty hard here," Gonzalez said. "It's the first time we've ever done something this deeply outside of Warcraft."</p><p dir="ltr">Different classes will be able to use a specific StarCraft hero. Each StarCraft faction will have its own set of cards, some of which can be used by any class and others that are class-specific. Warriors, Paladins, and Shamans, for example, can use Jim Raynor and take full advantage of Terran cards, while Death Knights, Hunters, Warlocks, and Demon Hunters can embrace the Zerg swarm with Kerrigan. Meanwhile, Mages, Priests, Rogues, and Druids can use the powers of Artanis, with a focus on powerful, high-mana-cost Protoss units that can be made cheaper.</p><p dir="ltr">Gonzalez said adapting StarCraft into the card game wasn't all that different from adapting Warcraft (both involve lots of research). The main difference was instead of looking to specific characters for card ideas, the team had to draw inspiration from StarCraft's iconic units. Gonzalez said it was also important to capture that feeling of StarCraft's gameplay.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4398546-hsheroesofstarcraft-kerriganqueenofblades.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4398546" data-ratio="1.1111715139984" data-width="3679" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4398546-hsheroesofstarcraft-kerriganqueenofblades.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4398546"></a><figcaption>Kerrigan will be usable by Death Knights, Hunters, Warlocks, and Demon Hunters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4398546-hsheroesofstarcraft-kerriganqueenofblades.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"The gameplay of it--there's micro and there's macro--and it was really important to us to make sure that the macro of, 'What is your game plan overall with one of the three factions'... does that feel quintessentially like them?" Gonzalez said. "That's not something we had to super duper think about with the average Warcraft character."</p><p dir="ltr">The Heroes of StarCraft mini-set will release in January 2025, but the StarCraft crossover was just the tip of the iceberg when it came to Hearthstone announcements. Blizzard also revealed a full 2025 roadmap with three upcoming expansions, as well a major shake-up to the game's Arena mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Arena, Hearthstone's premium draft mode, has been largely unchanged since the game launched in 2014, but that will be changing soon. In the first half of 2025, Blizzard will change Arena in a big way by introducing two versions of Arena to choose from. Normal Arena will be similar to what exists now but sport faster runs while still letting players flex their competitive deck-building muscles. Another new version of the mode, the Underground Arena, will take things even further. The Underground will include players of all skill levels (in contrast to Normal Arena, which will still use a win-based matchmaking system), longer runs, and a new feature called "re-draft on loss" that lets players re-draft cards and edit their deck before going again in order to up their chances of winning. Both Arena modes will have their own ranked system.</p><p dir="ltr">Georgiou said the splitting of Arena into two modes came as a result of wanting to create an easier entry point for newer players while simultaneously giving existing Arena players more challenge and higher stakes. The mode is currently difficult for new players to dive into because of how heavy the competition can be, as many who specialize in Arena have been playing since Hearthstone first released.</p><p dir="ltr">"It was really to raise that ceiling for players who want that but also lower the floor a little bit so Arena can be a place that is welcoming for all types of players again," Georgiou said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4398547-hs_2025_roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4398547" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4398547-hs_2025_roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4398547"></a><figcaption>Hearthstone's 2025 roadmap.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4398547-hs_2025_roadmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Hearthstone's first expansion set for the new year, Into the Emerald Dream, will transport players to the idealized, natural version of Azeroth as druidic defenders of the dream battle against the forces of the Old Gods. It's something the Hearthstone team has long had in its "back pocket," Georgiou said, and always knew would eventually be an expansion. It was actually in the running to be released last year, but the team pivoted to avoid stepping on the toes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: Dragonflight's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-heads-to-the-emerald-dream-for-its-next-update/1100-6517531/" data-ref-id="1100-6517531">Emerald Dream-themed update</a>. The expansion's mini-set, Druids of the Flame, will add the faction of corrupted elemental druids to further stoke the fires of battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Its second expansion of 2025 is actually a sequel, a first in Hearthstone history--The Shrouded City. This set picks up where 2017's Journey to Un'Goro set left off, as the explorer Elise hunts for a lost Tortollan city, with a Tortollan-themed festival mini-set coming later. The Hearthstone team actually invented the Tortollan race for the original Un'Goro set (which would later be added to WoW), and the upcoming expansion provided a great opportunity to further flesh out the backstory of the Tortollan and "peel back" some of the layers of the original Un'Goro expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">"To be able to revisit an area that is so compelling that had so much that wasn't explored before, and to be able to look at it in a new light, I think will be really, really fun," Georgiou said.</p><p dir="ltr">The third and final Hearthstone expansion for 2025, Heroes of Time, will explore alternative versions of Azeroth's past, where players will find versions of legendary heroes as players "have never seen them before." That will all lead to an epic battle at the end of time with the corrupted leader of the Infinite Dragonflight, Murozond. Given how much of an emphasis WoW has put on the Bronze Dragonflight and Chromie in recent years, it's a little surprising Hearthstone hasn't dived deep on alternate timeline shenanigans yet. But that's worked out in the team's favor.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think doing it when there is so much to pull from in Hearthstone's past feels like the perfect, pun half-intended, time to do it," Gonzalez said. "There's so many characters our fans love and characters from Warcraft that our fans might not even be super exposed to that are in that thematic bucket. It's a really rich theme."</p><p dir="ltr">In other Warcraft news, Blizzard announced as part of the direct that its newly announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-1-and-2-remastered-make-up-a-new-warcraft-battle-chest-available-today/1100-6527719/" data-ref-id="1100-6527719">remastered versions of Warcraft 1 and 2</a>, as well as a major 2.0 update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warcraft-iii-reforged/" data-ref-id="5000-504202">Warcraft 3: Reforged</a>, are all available now.</p>

                <p>EA Sports has announced a multi-year deal with the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL) to bring the upstart league's players and teams to NHL 25.</p><p>The PWHL comes to NHL 25 on December 5 with all six teams--these include the Boston Fleet, Minnesota Frost, Montréal Victoire, New York Sirens, Ottawa Charge, and Toronto Sceptres.</p><p>These teams can be used in Play Now, Online Versus, Shootout, and Seasons. PWHL uniforms will be accessible in World of Chel and Hockey Ultimate Team. EA warned that not all player likenesses will be available right away, saying it will "continue to add more" players over time.</p><p>PWHL integration in NHL 25 also includes the Walter Cup--the PWHL's version of the Stanley Cup.</p><p>NHL 25 isn't the first NHL game to feature women, as this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nhl-22-adds-first-ever-playable-womens-teams-in-new-update-today/1100-6499998/" data-ref-id="1100-6499998">actually began with NHL 22 when EA struck a deal with the International Ice Hockey Federation</a>. Sarah Nurse was on the cover of the following year's game, NHL 23, alongside Trevor Zegras.</p><p>EA's other sports games have added women over the years, too, now spanning EA Sports FC, UFC, and PGA Tour. The PWHL is now in its second season. The Minnesota Frost won the inaugural Walter Cup.</p><p>Beyond the introduction of the PWHL, EA is releasing a major update for NHL 25 this holiday, and one of the most exciting pieces of it is the introduction of the NHL Arcade event series. Beginning November 15 through World of Chel, this is an arcade-style, three-versus-three mode featuring a Big Head mode and power-ups like Supershot and Super Speed, along with big and small goalies.</p><p>The action takes place in a bespoke rink with no glass and no rules. It's not quite like the NHL Hitz days of yesteryear, but it might help satisfy the itch.</p><p>NHL 25 is also introducing the 4 Nations Face-Off in 2025. This is a round-robin tournament featuring players from the USA, Canada, Finland, and Sweden. There will be a dedicated mode for this, and each nation's uniforms will come to the game across a variety of modes. The real-world 4 Nations Face-Off takes place in February 2025, so the update for NHL 25 will likely go live around then.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4399082-holidayupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399082" data-ratio="0.56287878787879" data-width="1320" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4399082-holidayupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399082"></a><figcaption>NHL 25 gets a big holiday update soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4399082-holidayupdate.jpg"></figure><p>Additionally, EA is trying to lure players back to NHL 25 by offering free content to everyone who simply logs in between November 15 and January 2. Everyone who does so will get six vanity items for the arcade mode, along with a special pack for the Road to 4 Nations content that's redeemable immediately. Players will also get a PWHL 83 OVR team building choice pack that will become redeemable when the PWHL integration goes live on December 5.</p>

While players will have the option of playing each game with their original visuals (something that can be toggled on and off in real time) the remastered versions also include new, hand-drawn visuals that help make each game's units more sharp and defined while still retaining their classic feel.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZ2jiW95qo" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ryZ2jiW95qo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Warcraft 1's controls have been updated to support modern-RTS staples like right click to move, box unit selection, and a faster game speed. Both games have received various UI and UX adjustments as well, like unit health bars, tooltips, increased unit selection, and a mission select. Warcraft 2 will still support multiplayer and all legacy custom maps will be fully compatible with this new version of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Warcraft 3: Reforged, the maligned remaster that released in 2020 to negative reviews and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-3-reforged-a-victim-of-mismanagement-pressure-from-activision-and-budget-cuts-report/1100-6494287/" data-ref-id="1100-6494287">reportedly suffered from budget cuts and a rocky development</a>, is also receiving a major 2.0 update today. The update improves the game's environments and lighting, as well as overhauls its UI. It also adds hotkey customization and a revamped ladder system.

            <p>
Almost exactly eight years since Blizzard <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-isnt-planning-to-remaster-warcraft-1-and-2">said</a> it wasn't planning to remaster Warcraft 1 &amp; 2 because they're "just not that fun any more", the studio has announced it's doing just that - and both spruce-ups are available today as part of Warcraft's 30th anniversary celebrations.
</p>
<p>
The original Warcraft helped catapult Blizzard into the big leagues when it launched back in 1994, with Warcraft 2 quickly emerging to sate its growing fanbase the following year. And the studio's newly announced remasters promise a range of enhancements to the games' classic real-time strategy action, starting with new hand-drawn visuals - said to capture the originals' art style - which can be toggled on and off in real-time.
</p>
<p>
As for Warcraft 1 specifically, Blizzard has added "modern controls", including right-click move, bounding box select, and a faster game speed. That's on top of the UI and UX improvements - including tool tips, health bars, mission select screens, and increased unit select - that've been implemented across both titles. Additionally, Warcraft 2 Remastered retains the original's multiplayer, and all legacy custom maps are fully compatible and playable in the new version.

<p>
Warcraft 1 Remastered and Warcraft 2 Remastered are available for PC via Battle.net right now (there's no word on whether they might eventually show up on other stores), costing <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-gb/product/warcraft-1-remastered">$9.99</a> and <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-gb/product/warcraft-2-remastered">$14.99</a> respectively. Additionally, there's a <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-gb/product/warcraft-remastered-battle-chest">Battle Chest bundle</a>, priced at $39.99, featuring the new remasters and Blizzard's much-maligned <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warcraft-iii-reforged">Warcraft 3: Reforged</a>. 
</p><p>
Despite the latter's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-3-reforged-houses-a-fantastic-rts-but-blizzard-has-fluffed-the-remake">terrible launch reception</a>, Blizzard has continued to improve the title since its arrival in 2020, with today bringing a new 2.0 update for all players. This includes overhauled environments and lighting, a revamped UI, up-rezzed HD versions of all classic Warcraft assets, plus a range of quality of life improvements - in-game hockey customisation and revamped ladder were mentioned - and "much, much more".

At the beginning of the game’s final set of missions, the player will choose either the elven warrior or dwarven rogue to lead a second team as the party assaults the tyrannical elven gods’ base on Tearstone Island. Eventually, as you finish a boss fight against the blighted elven god Ghilan’nain, the leader you choose will sacrifice themself to create an opening for the killing blow. They’re impaled by the elf’s tentacles and fall into a chasm,presumably killed in action. Some fans, however, are holding onto hope that the doomed character could be found alive in the next <em>Dragon Age</em> based on a few key clues.</p><p>The main reason for this is because the game itself gives BioWare an out to bring either character back. There are references to there being “no trace” of a body after the fight, implying that they might have survived and disappeared somehow. Could they have been scooped up by some other entity we don’t know about? Maybe they patched themselves up and are alone trying to make their way back to the team? It’s certainly possible, but all we can do is speculate right now, and that’s enough to give <em>Dragon Age </em>fans some hope.</p><p>Some datamined content also gives fans another reason to hold out hope. Dataminers have found letters you seemingly were able to read at some point after this quest that imply that no matter the choice you make, someone is hopeful that Davrin or Harding is alive and out there. A letter Harding sends to her mother if Davrin sacrificed himself hopes that he and his griffon son are “not dead, just gone, for now.” The letter you get if Harding leads the team is from her mother, who says she has to believe she’ll “see [her] daughter walk through [her] front door again. One day.” As of this writing, these are presumed cut or bugged, but they’re a slight glimmer of hope that Davrin or Harding could show up in whatever the fifth <em>Dragon Age </em>game turns out to be.</p><p>It’s an interesting theory, and it would be a compelling spin on the final hours of <em>The Veilguard</em>, which can end with any combination of your party dying in the last mission. In a roundabout way, the one “death” that seems unpreventable could turn out to be the thing that ensures they make it to the next game. But it’s all speculation and we’ll have to sit with it for a while because BioWare <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has no plans to make DLC for <em>The Veilguard</em></a></span><em> </em>as it focuses on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958">fifth <em>Mass Effect</em></a></span>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA Sports and the Professional Women’s Hockey League (PWHL) <a href="https://www.thepwhl.com/en/news/2024/november/13/pwhl-to-be-featured-in-ea-sports-nhl-25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">have announced</a> that the league will be coming to NHL 25 in December.</p>



<p>Starting December 5, all six PWHL teams — Boston Fleet, Minnesota Frost, Montréal Victoire, New York Sirens, Ottawa Charge, and Toronto Sceptres — will be added to the game to play in a number of modes. Those include Play Now, Online Versus, Shootout and Season. In addition to being playable in modes, PWHL content will be added to the World of Chel as well Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT).</p>



<p>The launch comes alongside the start of the PWHL’s second season.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to bring the PWHL into NHL 25 as part of a massive holiday update, giving players all-new ways to play, starting in a couple of days with the frenetic energy of NHL Arcade through to the launch of 4 Nations Face-Off in the New Year,” NHL 25 Executive Producer Bill Dollar said.</p>



<p>Women’s hockey has been a growing presence in the EA Sports NHL series for a number of years with international teams being a part of the last handful of games. The PWHL marks the first women’s league to be added to the franchise. In the past, EA Sports did speak with the NWHL about possible inclusion, but no deal was ever reached.</p>



<p>As far as this update is concerned, not all likenesses will be scanned and into the game when the update comes. That said, there is a plan to add more via updates to NHL 25.</p>



<p>In addition to the PWHL, EA Sports announced that the Four Nations Tournament and a new Arcade mode are both coming to NHL 25.</p>



<p>What do you think of the PWHL coming to NHL 25? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-all-that-glitters-are-pixels<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To the average gamer, 1988’s <em>Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation</em> may seem like just another <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/history-dragon-quest" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest</em></a> game that was released for the NES. In fact, the original "<em>Dragon Warrior III,</em>" as it was known in the West, didn’t really take off outside of Japan, but the game’s impact on the future of gaming is significant. It was the first mainstream game to have such a versatile job system, feature a day and night cycle, and let you swap your party members in and out.</p>

<p>As a newcomer that’s been a fan of the franchise since <em>Dragon Quest XI</em>, the NES trilogy has been one that I’ve never been able to get into. While grinding for hours to level up and clear a dungeon was the norm back in those days, it’s an absolute slog to do so today. And so, I moved onto trying out the more recent titles and remasters.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20241025214621_1.jpg?itok=gaBryHuW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20241025214621_1.jpg?itok=Geq7gWKk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I was elated beyond measure when <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> was announced. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/octopath-traveler-ii-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Octopath Traveler</em></a> series is one I hold close to my heart, so <em>Dragon Quest III</em> getting the HD-2D treatment felt perfect. Not to mention, <em>Dragon Quest</em> fans have been getting crumbs in the form of low-budget <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-quest-treasures-review" rel="nofollow">spinoffs</a>. A remake was definitely in order. Needless to say, I went into <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> with a lot of excitement and expectations, but what was to follow was pretty…underwhelming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s no doubt about the fact that graphically, this game is gorgeous. The HD-2D look is a wonderful visual facelift from <em>Dragon Quest III</em>’s 16-bit pixel art. From the very moment you’re plopped into the game as the main character, you’re surrounded by lush greenery and flowing waterfalls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A mysterious voice asks you some very thorough questions to determine your character, and by thorough, I mean questions like, “Do you believe the world to be filled with more sadness than with joy?” I was not expecting to be asked that on a Tuesday morning, that’s for sure. Depending on your characters, you get assigned a personality type, something that’s significant to the way your character’s abilities grow, but more on that later.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20241025223449_1.jpg?itok=MHTUuzhK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20241025223449_1.jpg?itok=KemdvhRv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You later awake on your 16th birthday, and have an audience with the King of Aliahan. Your father is the legendary warrior, Ortega, but after he perishes in his quest to destroy the evil Baramos, it’s time that you assume his mantle. And so, you go and find some party members to recruit, or in my case, create.</p>

<p>The original <em>Dragon Quest III</em> was praised for letting you choose which class of characters you could hire. Later, once they reach level 20, you can change their class again and go back to level 1 while still retaining your spells and abilities. <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> takes this a step further and gives you 5 additional seeds with which you can increase their default stats. Additionally, the remake gives you the option of the new monster wrangler class. I had a monster wrangler in my party throughout the game, and they definitely became my most useful character.</p>

<p>Back to the personality type system, it felt like more of a hindrance than anything, as it added nothing to the game apart from changing how your character’s stats evolved. You’ll be able to randomly find books in chests and bookshelves throughout the game, and having a character read them will alter their personality, but you don’t get to know how that affects their stats. I ended up just giving my characters books to read according to what personalities I had imagined them to have. Yes, you can even change the protagonist’s personality, so the quiz in the beginning feels a bit redundant.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20241025233728_1.jpg?itok=v02lvbas 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20241025233728_1.jpg?itok=pheuSFSz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I don't want to sugarcoat it, this game is an absolute snoozefest when it comes to combat. I mentioned earlier that the NES games were simply too boring for me to get into. Well, <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> follows the same framework of the original’s combat. Turn-based combat and random encounters are really no problem for me when it’s well-executed, but <em>Dragon Quest III</em>’s combat feels ancient. I was really hoping that the remake would bring some intuitiveness into the game, such as <em>Dragon Quest XI</em>’s pep powers, but it’s barebones traditional JRPG combat.</p>

<p>While that wouldn’t be so bad, there’s a bunch of quality-of-life improvements that are definitely missing. For starters, the lack of a turn indicator is a huge inconvenience, especially when a single enemy can end up attacking three turns in a row and kill your healer. Any strategies that you might want to execute just end up being thrown to the winds.</p>

<p>Also, the fact that you need to assign items to your party members is a completely unnecessary chore. The item bag exists for a reason! It makes complete sense to be able to use it in combat, but I guess I’ll die just because I didn’t have any medicine on me at the time. Sure, there are other quality-of-life features, such as being able to adjust the battle speed and three different difficulty settings, but the game definitely needs a lot more to make the combat palatable for the modern day.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20241111182315_1-large.jpg?itok=hAJ0Dnqe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20241111182315_1-large.jpg?itok=UaiVaEid 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are also monster arenas where you can make the monsters you’ve rescued take place in tournaments against other monsters, but even that ended up being a bit of a disappointment. You can only advise your monsters as to how they should fight, so one might have to ‘Fight wisely’ while the other needs to ‘Focus on healing.’ These weren’t particularly fun as I would much rather be able to give them commands à la Pokemon, so I only went to the arenas a couple of times when I needed the money to buy some new equipment.</p>

<p>There’s not really a whole lot of changes going on in the story department either. <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> follows the same story as the original with a few additional scenes featuring the Hero and their father. For how long this game is, I was really hoping it wasn’t just tidbits of story every 10 hours or so. I can see how narratively all the twists and turns in the game would have made this game a real masterpiece in 1988. Even for today’s standards, it’s a decent story, but nothing to write home about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the game sort of makes up for that though, as it’s a beautiful world to be in. I had a blast exploring each town and taking in the details. The little birds that fly away as you walk near them, the glowing plants at night in the Faerie Village, and even the damp caves that lurk below. The addition of voice acting is welcome, and whether big character or NPC, the performances are superb. While all of the music is reused from the original, the symphonic arrangements are soothing, although the battle theme did get on my nerves around the 20-hour mark.</p>

<p>There's a lot to love in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>. The spritework is fantastic, the music is soothing, and it's a world that you want to live in and explore. That being said, there's just as much to loathe. Given the number of random encounters you'll have to face, the combat holds back the game a lot. It also feels like a missed opportunity to expand upon the original's story. By today's standards, the game feels dated, much unlike the game from 1988 that lit a fire under gamers and developers alike.</p>

<p>Everyone’s expectations for remakes are, of course, different, but I was hoping for more than just a fresh coat of paint from the <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>. For fans of the original, I’m sure the game will meet their wishes, but it’s not a game I’d recommend to newer fans or to today’s JRPG aficionados looking to get into the franchise.&nbsp;</p>

The action involves workers in ZeniMax offices in Texas and Maryland, who do quality assurance work for games including<em> Fallout</em> and <em>Elder Scrolls</em>. Workers are striking over claims that ZeniMax leadership has failed to address employee issues regarding remote work and outsourcing. </p><p>“Today, we are on strike,” <a href="https://x.com/ZeniMaxWorkers/status/1856714377992278336">ZeniMax Workers United posted on X</a>. “We are not afraid to do what’s necessary to make sure that Microsoft meets us at the bargaining table over key issues like remote work options and outsourcing.”</p><div><p>ZeniMax Workers United is made up of approximately 300 quality assurance testers. When the union <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23537455/microsoft-has-formally-recognized-the-zenimax-union">was formally recognized in January 2023</a>, it became parent company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/5/23495139/microsoft-union-zenimax-bethesda-cwa">Microsoft’s first union</a> and, at the time, was the largest video game union in the United States. Just a few months later in March, that title was eclipsed by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094602/activision-blizzard-qa-workers-unionizing-microsoft">600 members of Activision Quality Assurance United</a>, another union under Microsoft’s corporate umbrella.</p></div><p>Remote work policies seem to be a major sticking point for Microsoft’s video game unions. In the immediate outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic, many video game companies instituted flexible work-from-home policies that they’ve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24290345/return-to-office-mandates-amazon-productivity-remote-work-hybrid-decoder-podcast">recently begun rolling back</a>. In October of this year, Activision Quality Assurance United held a rally outside their offices in Texas, California, and Minnesota <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/cwa-members-activision-qa-rally-remote-work-options">to protest Microsoft’s restrictive return-to-office polic</a>y that, according to workers, failed to accommodate workers with medical issues or doctor recommendations. The Communications Workers of America (CWA), the organizing committee that supports ZeniMax Workers United along with multiple video game unions in the US, has also filed an unfair labor complaint with the National Labor Relations Board over contracting out work without notifying the union.</p><p>There have been several video game-related strikes in the US in recent year. In 2021, workers at Raven Software — a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard before its eventual acquisition by Microsoft — participated in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820549/activision-blizzard-raven-software-layoffs-walkout-call-of-duty">a walkout</a> that turned into a five-week strike after several employee contracts were not renewed. After that strike, workers at Raven Software <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/21/22894964/activision-blizzard-raven-software-employees-create-game-workers-alliance-union">organized and won one of the first video game unions at a AAA game publisher</a> in the country.</p><p>In July of this year, voice actors and motion performers covered under SAG-AFTRA’s interactive media agreement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24206357/video-game-performer-strike-sag-aftra">went on strike</a> to protest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213808/video-game-voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra">worker protections regarding AI</a>. While SAG-AFTRA and the video game companies that make up the interactive media agreement bargaining committee <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270821/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-resume-negotiations">have returned to the negotiation table</a>, the strike continues. </p><p>ZeniMax Workers United strike will not last as long as SAG-AFTRA’s or Raven Software’s, with workers striking today until 6PM ET. In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, Microsoft spokesperson Becca Dougherty wrote, “We respect our employees’ rights to express their point of view as they have done today. We will continue to listen and&nbsp;address their concerns at the bargaining table.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He also suggested that even <em>Halo </em>could make the leap, adding:  ‘It’s too early to make any sort of decision on the next version of <em>Halo</em>.” </p><p>That’s not a yes, but the fact that he’s openly talking about <em>Halo </em>on PlayStation is pretty remarkable considering how important the franchise has been to Microsoft for over 20 years. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-ceo-halo-ps5-more-multiplatform-games-1851482805&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-ceo-halo-ps5-more-multiplatform-games-1851482805">A report in May</a></span> claimed that Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, was pushing for more Xbox games to make the transition to PlayStation and Switch.

According to Spencer, “The Xbox business has never been more healthy.” But there’s always room for more growth and bigger numbers when you are part of a massive corporation. And if that means putting Master Chief on PS5, then that will happen sooner rather than later. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We probably won’t see it anytime soon, but the whole <em>Resistance</em> trilogy deserves a remaster collection on modern platforms.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>The classic PC games market is "in a sorry state," according to DRM-free and classic-minded storefront GOG. Small games that aren't currently selling get abandoned, and compatibility issues arise as technology moves forward or as one-off development ideas age like milk.</p>
<p>Classic games are only 20 percent of GOG's catalog, and the firm hasn't actually called itself "Good Old Games" in 12 years. And yet, today, GOG announces that it is making "a significant commitment of resources" toward a new GOG Preservation Program. It starts with 100 games for which GOG's own developers are working to create current and future compatibility, keeping them DRM-free and giving them ongoing tech support, along with granting them a "Good Old Game: Preserved by GOG" stamp.</p>

<p>GOG is not shifting its mission of providing a DRM-free alternative to Steam, Epic, and other PC storefronts, at least not entirely. But it is demonstrably excited about a new focus that ties back to its original name, inspired in some part by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/5-years-after-it-was-yanked-off-stores-gogs-bringing-underrated-spy-rpg-alpha-protocol-in-from-the-cold-with-fewer-crashes-and-new-achievements/">its work on </a><em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/5-years-after-it-was-yanked-off-stores-gogs-bringing-underrated-spy-rpg-alpha-protocol-in-from-the-cold-with-fewer-crashes-and-new-achievements/">Alpha Protocol</a>.</em></p>
<p>"We think we can significantly impact the classics industry by focusing our resources on it and creating superior products," writes Arthur Dejardin, head of sales marketing at GOG. "If we wanted to spread the DRM-free gospel by focusing on getting new AAA games on GOG instead, we would make little progress with the same amount of effort and money (we’ve been trying various versions of that for the last 5 years)."</p>

<h2>Getting knights, demons, and zombies up to snuff</h2>
<p>What kind of games? Scanning the list of <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program">Good Old Games</a>, most of them are, by all accounts, both good and old. Personally, I'm glad to see the <em>Jagged Alliance</em> games,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Warcraft I &amp; II</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Keeper</em> <em>Gold </em>and&nbsp;<em>Theme Park</em>,&nbsp;<em>SimCity 3000 Unlimited,&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Wing Commander</em> series (particularly, personally,&nbsp;<em>Privateer)</em>. Most of them are, understandably, Windows-only, though Mac support extends to 34 titles so far, and Linux may pick up many more through Proton compatibility, beyond the 19 native titles to date.</p>

rel="nofollow ">working on realistic hair tech</a> for a while now, but the engine's progress truly shines in Veilguard, and it's not simply due to the number of hairstyle options or the amount of hairs on each character's head--length plays a major role, too. The Veilguard features a number of waist-length hair options (curly or straight) that move in combat, realistically responding to momentum, wind, blasts of magic, changes in direction, and other variables. But getting there wasn't easy.</p><p dir="ltr">"With hair attachments that move seamlessly and the decoupling of simulation and render tessellation, this is the first EA game to offer such detailed, physics-driven long hairstyles," the blog post explains. "The Frostbite team increased maximum hair length from 63 points to 255, and implemented a new system for complex hair structures like braids."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4399041-hairguard.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399041" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4399041-hairguard.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399041"></a><figcaption>One of Veilguard's longest hairstyle options sees Rook's hair hovering just above their hips.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4399041-hairguard.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Changes to the Frostbite engine's lighting also played a major role in mastering Veilguard's hair physics, but it wasn't all fun and games--BioWare faced various challenges while working to perfect the way hair moved in-game. The main culprit? Horns.</p><p dir="ltr">"While Strand Hair is present in other EA games, the BioWare team had to push the limits even further for Dragon Age: The Veilguard," the post continues. "For example, implementing Strand Hair technology for characters who have waist-length hair with horns on their head presented some unique challenges."</p><p>Veilguard's beautifully rendered hair options haven't been overlooked by players, many of whom are very <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonAgeVeilguard/comments/1gndrbl/the_best_hair_to_date_in_dragon_age_the_veilguard/" rel="nofollow ">pleased with the game's well-animated cosmetic offerings</a> and spent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-streamer-spent-almost-a-whole-day-making-sure-her-rook-was-a-smokeshow/1100-6527593/">hours perfecting their Rook</a> in the game's character creator. In a medium where "long hair" often translates to "shoulder-length at best," Dragon Age: The Veilguard seems to represent the industry's first major step in finally perfecting the art of realistic, complex hair structures in games. That's good news for everyone, especially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect/">Mass Effect</a> fans, who will likely have access to similarly realistic hair options when the next entry in the franchise finally arrives.</p><p>For more info on BioWare's latest fantasy RPG, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard review-in-progress</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-is-still-in-amazon%E2%80%99s-secret-level-show.1034895/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/concord-amazon-secret-level<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest round of hype for <em>Secret Level</em>, Amazon’s show based on various video games, is here, ahead of the show’s official premiere on December 10. Both an interview with the creator and a new trailer have answered the lingering question of whether <em>Concord</em> will still be featured: awkwardly, but maybe thankfully, yes.</p><p>To quickly recap:<em> Concord</em>’s servers were <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taken offline</a> less than two weeks after the game launched in August, and Sony ultimately <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-firewalk-studios-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed developer Firewalk Studios</a> in late October after seemingly completely <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing faith</a> in a studio it poured gallons of money and hype into. Some of that hype was in the form of its inclusion in <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/secret-level-reveals-featured-games-premiere-trailer-1236045052/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, which you could see as an odd choice given that, at the time the show was announced, <em>Concord</em> was newly out, and the most we’d seen of the world Sony and the show’s creators were banking on was an awkwardly-received <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnStS9d2xg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cinematic trailer</a>.</p><p>Despite all that, in the newest <em>Secret Level </em>trailer, you can catch a glimpse of <em>Concord</em>, most clearly through the word "Concord" showing up on screen. This is, interestingly, separate from another episode apparently focusing on PlayStation more broadly.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Secret Level - Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SvY9Uq7I30Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/tim-miller-secret-level-prime-video-1235161263/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a>, <em>Secret Level</em> creator Tim Miller addressed the issue. Rolling Stone writes that “it was never an option to kill the [<em>Concord</em>] episode… there was no way for Miller to know what that eventual fate [of the game and studio] would be during the three years it took to produce <em>Secret Level</em>, nor had it ever been a consideration to remove the episode from the anthology.”</p><p>Miller says:</p><blockquote><p>There was no nicer, more invested group of developers than the team on <em>Concord</em>… I honestly don’t understand why it didn’t work. I know that they were trying to do the best they could, and they were a talented group of artists, so I feel terrible for that…</p><p>I don’t feel bad that it’s a part of the show, because I think it’s an episode that turned out really well, and you can kind of see the potential of this world and the characters… If it’s the remaining vestige of that product, I hope the developers feel that it’s in some way worthy, just a little bit, of the blood, sweat, and tears they put into it.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>I find the vibes very weird here, but I don’t necessarily think this is a bad thing. If something of the game can live on, if Miller and ::shudder:: Amazon can believe in <em>Concord</em> in a way Sony wouldn’t, I hope that brings some positive feelings and closure to the folks from Firewalk. But it also feels like one more reminder of how weird the situation around <em>Concord</em> was, proof of how much Sony was putting behind the game until it so abruptly wasn’t, and another crack in the foundation of Sony’s focus on live service despite the cost and risks.</p><p>And it’s hard not to grimace at Miller’s mention of <em>Concord</em>’s “potential” given everything that happened. At a <a href="https://collider.com/secret-level-episode-descriptions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Comic-Con panel in October</a>, before it was clear to the public the game wasn’t coming back, <em>Secret Level</em> co-creator Dave Wilson reportedly described the <em>Concord</em> episode as “the last ride of Captain Cassidy and the freegunners,” which, well, yes. But even this quote speaks to the tragedy of <em>Concord</em>’s life–what emotions are we expected to have about the “last ride” of characters few people even got to know?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Like I said, I hope <em>Concord</em>’s creators feel good about this version of their work seeing the light of day. I look forward to feeling very weird about the episode when the show comes out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Fans believe that whatever you pick in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>'s pack opening carousel, you'll get the same cards regardless.
</p>
<p>
That's right: carefully choosing the booster pack you want to open from the game's carousel doesn't matter. 
</p>
<p>
Whether you're looking for a bent corner, crossing your fingers or dropping lots of real-world money on the game versus playing for free, the cards are all the same - and actually pre-determined. Choice is an illusion! 
</p>
<p>
Where's the evidence? Well, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJhGaOrd1qU">Rustywolf</a> has come up with this convincing video where he shows a script he's authored that sniffs data packets sent by Pokémon TCG Pocket to the game's servers. 
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, you can see that pack opening data is determined as soon as a pack is purchased, before the user picks the on-screen booster they want to open or sees any of its cards. 
</p>
<p>
The video below shows this all in action, with card IDs received from the game's server and able to be cross-referenced with the game's card database - revealing the cards you'll get whatever pack you pick before you've even picked it.

					<p><span>Few Japanese role-playing games have been as influential to the genre as a whole as the first four Dragon Quest titles originally released for the Famicom/NES. While it may seem strange to start a new trilogy with the third entry, Square-Enix has a very good reason for beginning the Erdrick Trilogy with what used to bear the Seeds of Salvation moniker. Whether this is your first time playing Dragon Quest III or your thirtieth, there’s enough here to make it feel like a fresh experience.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Dragon-Quest-III-HD-2D-Remake-King-1456x819.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake opens with a familiar premise to the NES original. As the son or daughter of the famous warrior Ortega, you’re tasked by the King himself to pick up in your father’s shoes after he disappears on a journey to slay the great evil of the world, Baramos. This simple narrative tale harkens back to a time when the big bads were front and center and venturing out to slay them was a task often reserved for a coming-of-age tale.&nbsp; Players won’t have to venture out alone as they did in the very first Dragon Warrior title. Instead, adventurers just need to stop at the local tavern conveniently located in the Hero’s hometown and make a call to action to pick up three more folks to tag along for the trip.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While the player’s role is set in stone as the eponymous Hero, the three that come along are free to pick up any one of eight initial classes to fit the ideal party role. While only seven base classes were available in the original release of Dragon Quest III, Square-Enix has introduced a new Monster Wrangler class first featured in later Dragon Quest titles to the roster of available professions. This new class takes advantage of meeting and befriending more than a hundred different monsters scattered throughout the landscape and rather than using them in individual combat, they merely increase the effectiveness of just a small handful of the class’ signature attacks. The other purpose for recruiting these monsters is to do battle in the Monster Arenas that are found in various cities and provide a great source of income assuming the monsters are strong enough to win. These monsters don’t gain levels in the traditional sense and only get more powerful as players recruit more monsters of the same subspecies. It’s ideal to keep one of these Monster Wranglers in the party at all times, given their combat potential, but also to sneak up on pacifist monsters and recruit them to your cause without them running away from smelling the player’s powerful stench.</span></p>

<p><span>One of the things that made Dragon Quest III such a memorable title in its original release was the open-ended design of the adventure once players secure themselves a boat. As players get more comfortable in their adventure, suddenly the guardrails are taken off and players are given the chance to explore the world as they see fit in order to acquire six mythical orbs needed to secure a path to the game’s main antagonist. There are a plethora of side quests, main story missions, and collectible diversions along the way for players who aim to seek everything out and unlock the platinum trophy. Think along the lines of 110 Mini Medals and even more monsters to recruit for the battle arena. Pro Tip: try to collect and hold onto five Hardwood Headgear along your journey. You’ll thank me later.</span></p>
<p><span>Dragon Quest is one of the purest and most perfect versions of turn-based JRPG combat, and the HD-2D Remake of Dragon Quest III is no exception. There are no fancy gauges to clutter the screen or combination attacks that need advanced preparation. Instead, players give out commands to each of their four party members individually and watch as turns play out simultaneously based on which attacker has the highest agility stat. Unlike the original game, there’s a significant amount of bloat to the outgoing damage that players give and health pools to the tune of sometimes ten times what the original enemy list had in both the NES and SNES versions of Dragon Quest III.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DRAGON-QUEST-III-HD-2D-Remake-Baramos-Fight.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>By the time I nearly cleared the postgame of Dragon Quest III (neither Pachisi nor the Monster Medals made their return, but Xenlon and his list of wishes did), my Hero was just shy of level 60 with all three party members in their mid-30s on their third or fourth class change. The added stats and having access to nearly every skill/spell across the whole party was definitely beneficial, especially given how prone enemies in the late game are to unleashing critical attacks, inflicting status effects, or even outright killing a character.</span></p>
<p><span>Depending on your tolerance for punishment, all three difficulty settings are available from the adventure’s onset, whether you’re craving a much more challenging Draconian Quest or want to take it easy and just enjoy the story with Dracky Quest. I will admit that Dracky Quest is one of the series’ easiest difficulty modes to date, with enemies literally unable to kill a party member no matter how hard they try and simply reduce their HP to 1. If you’re in a lengthy dungeon and out of restoration items, you could consider taking the easy way out and flipping the difficulty mode just long enough to make it back to the overworld and save an expensive trip to the church to revive your party.</span></p>

<p><span>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has been given a complete graphical overhaul, instead giving the iconic RPG a makeover in the same vein as Square-Enix’s Octopath Traveler and other similar titles. The entire world is brightly colored and blooming with light. Even if you’re intimately familiar with every step retracing Ortega’s journey, the complete reimagining of the adventure makes this feel like a brand new adventure rather than just another release of Seeds of Salvation. All I can say now is that I can’t wait to go through Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake next year.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/inside-asmodee-us-gm-julien-sharp-talks-running-business<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every day, millions of gamers around the world sit down at the table and crack into a board game with friends and loved ones. And while we maybe, <i>maybe</i>, think about the game’s designer or artist from time to time, it’s rare that we think about all the other people involved in bringing our favorite games to life! That’s why I’m starting <b>Inside Asmodee</b>, an ongoing series of interviews with employees across one of the world’s largest gaming distributors. For our first in the series, I got the chance to chat with Julien Sharp, General Manager, U.S. of <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Asmodee Group</a>!</p>

<p>Meeting over Zoom before she headed off for a vacation, we spent some time catching up (we’d previously met for coffee while Sharp was in NYC on business several months prior), before diving in.</p>

<p>“I’m really excited to do this with you, Giaco,” she said, because, “it’s kind of an intro to a business that a lot of people don't really even think about.”</p>

<p>For me, the entire point of this article series is to, A. get to know the people who work at a company as big as Asmodee, and B. Find out what exactly it is that they do there, and find out how what they do helps get games to the table.</p>

<p>It’s time we give profiles, and shine a spotlight, on the gaming industry in much the same way other industries are covered in the media.</p>

<p>“There's a person that is making and designing these games,” explained Sharp, “but then there's also a person that wants to play those games, and they can't get to each other and connect without what we do at Asmodee.”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inside-asmodee-julien-with-the-catan-studios-team.jpeg?itok=UgjTo3hZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inside-asmodee-julien-with-the-catan-studios-team.jpeg?itok=3q9OZNkU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Julien and the Catan Studios Team playing a giant game of <em>Catan</em>.

<p>But what does it mean when we say Julien Sharp is the General Manager, U.S. of Asmodee Group? “In our company,” she said, “we call this role a Country Manager, but here in the U.S., people might know it more as a GM. It's also kind of akin to a CEO role as it relates to our territory, too.”</p>

<p>Julien explained that the crux of her job relies on maintaining a 360-degree view on the four main pillars of the distribution business: Sales, Commercial, Purchasing, and Logistics.</p>

<h2>The Four Pillars of the Business</h2>

<p>Sales covers everything from, “mass market to Amazon, and our hobby sales,” Julien explained, “which is the network of over 3,500 local game stores, where people who play games for a hobby go and sit at tables, play and purchase games, and meet their community.</p>

<p>“Our Commercial side includes marketing,” she said, but she explains that Commercial also includes their relationships with the myriad game design studios that create the games that Asmodee distributes. “We have our first-party studios, and then we also have our partner or third-party studios, which are outside companies we don't own, but we distribute their games in the U.S. So our commercial side manages all those relationships <i>and</i> all of our marketing.”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inside-asmodee-julien-in-the-warehouse.jpeg?itok=kQRSXNTX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inside-asmodee-julien-in-the-warehouse.jpeg?itok=tSafx0Oc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Julien Sharp in the Minnesota warehouse with members of the Logistics and Distribution team. Image: Julien Sharp.</figcaption></figure><p>Purchasing includes all of the company’s purchasing and, importantly, reorders. “We have to look at all the forecasts and following trends of how the sales are going,” Sharp said, “to know when we need to reorder. There’s a balance, we have to make sure we don't over order, but also that we don't <i>under</i> order and not order enough for demand and run out early, right? Because that's not fun. When we don't have games to sell, we miss inventory turns, and that's <i>not</i> good.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We have to look at all the forecasts ... to know when we need to reorder. There’s a balance, we have to make sure we don't over order, but also that we don't <i>under</i> order...”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, the fourth pillar of the role revolves around Logistics. This includes both the front office, but also an entire distribution facility. “Our facility is hooked onto a very big warehouse,” Sharp said.</p>

<p>"Our facility, when you walk around the warehouse and office one time, is a half mile. So it's quite big, and because of the hobby businesses, year round, we have semi trucks coming in and going all day long. And we have many, many bays that are bringing games into us that we have ordered and picking up games that we have sold out. So it's a full-out logistics operation, and I need to keep my eye on all of those pieces and be able to dive down if there's a problem in them.”</p>

<h2>Managing at the GM Level</h2>

<p>At this point I joke sarcastically about how <i>simple</i> this all sounds, but Sharp isn’t phased by the workload or the need to oversee four very disparate areas of the business.</p>

<p>“I believe in a strong team,” she emphasized, “and I have VP level people that run all four of those areas, the sales, the commercial, the logistics, and the purchasing. They are experts in their field, and they know their their business. They run their teams, I come in if they need help, or if there’s a big, overarching decision that could impact multiple areas of the business."</p>

<p>But even with leads reporting up to her across these four areas of the business, Sharp prides herself on knowing a little bit about every single part of each area. She said that she needs to understand all aspects of the business so that she can properly staff, “but I also have to know enough to be able to speak to it if I'm needed. So this role is kind of a generalist.”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inside-asmodee-julien-giving-a-presentation-with-her-dog-simey-looking-on.jpeg?itok=3BlIS5zC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inside-asmodee-julien-giving-a-presentation-with-her-dog-simey-looking-on.jpeg?itok=wap1jyxU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dogs are welcome at the Asmodee offices, and Julien Sharp's dog Simey watches on as Julien leads a Town Hall meeting. Image: Julien Sharp</figcaption></figure><p>Sharp said her beginnings, which included owning her own game company (Funnybone Toys, acquired in 2017 by <a href="https://foxmind.com/" rel="nofollow">Foxmind</a>), have helped her understand all the different nuances of a gaming company. From stickering her games in a Wisconsin warehouse before Barnes &amp; Noble would put them on shelves, to sending out advanced shipping notices to big box retailers, Sharp's seen it all.</p>

<p>And now, as she takes a more top-down view of the business, one of the things she’s most keen to relate to me is her open-door policy. In what sounds like a truly meeting-heavy workload, Julien excitedly recounts that she has one-on-one meetings with her direct reports weekly, and up to two to three levels down from that every few weeks. She also takes pride in the aforementioned open-door policy, where anyone from the company can come in and pick her brain if the door’s open.</p>

<h2>A Day in the Life Inside Asmodee</h2>

<p>Next, I really wanted to get into the nitty gritty and find out what an average day is like for Sharp, so she pulled up her work calendar for a random Wednesday a week prior, and walked me through it.</p>

<p>“I had a touch base with marketing,” she began, “the regional manager of all Europe who's running some global programs. I met with our legal team. I did some financial projection scenarios coming up for the next three years with my senior team — we're working on doing our budget for next year. So we’re also figuring out how many games we are going to buy from each studio.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suddenly, she lit up, “Oh! And I walked three laps around the building, we're having a walking contest right now. And so I walked three laps, which is a mile and a half. That was pretty fun!” From there, she recounts business reviews with the head of finance, a look at their trade show presence, more one-on-ones, and so on.</p>

<p>“I guess that's the biggest part of what a day is for me,” she explained, “finding any fires that I need to put out - though there's been less and less of that, which is really great, but also keeping an eye on what's going to impact us next year. It's a lot of review, and then I get that pulse from the one on ones that I have.”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inside-asmodee-lino-lakes-office.jpg?itok=jf1EsNF6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inside-asmodee-lino-lakes-office.jpg?itok=2q2xzemJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An image of the Lino Lakes Asmodee offices. Image: Asmodee USA.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Makes An Asmodee Game Feel Like An Asmodee Game?</h2>

<p>Next up, I wanted to dig into the overall approach to game acquisition, design, and marketing to find out if there was a throughline through the games in the Asmodee family.</p>

<p>“Remember, we are a distributor,” Sharp said, “so we distribute our own made games, <i>and</i> we distribute third-party games. And the mentality of the third party is: what is missing from our offerings.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>She explained that for their own games, “what we did internally is divide our games into three verticals, and those verticals are Social, which is kind of party games. Then in the middle we have catch-all tabletop games, games in a box, that aren't necessarily party games. And then we have what's called our lifestyle games."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"And the lifestyle vertical... that's where the secret sauce is in this business."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"And the lifestyle vertical is really interesting, and that's where the secret sauce is in this business. That’s our trading card games, which are like our <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-unlimited-review-trading-card-gamings-new-hope" rel="nofollow">Star Wars: Unlimited</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/altered-tcg-review-world-of-potential" rel="nofollow">Altered</a></em>, games that you can continue to buy new packs of and build your decks and play, and of course our miniatures. Miniatures like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/star-wars-shatterpoint-first-impressions" rel="nofollow"><i>Star Wars: Shatterpoint</i></a>, where you take the the plastic molds out of the box, you have to build your miniature, and then you have to paint your miniature.”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-shatterpoint-sprues.jpg?itok=nYLiYVcc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-shatterpoint-sprues.jpg?itok=km3Lb-EN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An image from our&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Shatterpoint</em>&nbsp;first look article, showing the hobby or "lifestyle" nature of the game. Image: Giaco Furino.</figcaption></figure><p>As you can imagine, each of those verticals needs to be marketed totally differently. But as to what makes an Asmodee game feel like an Asmodee game, even when they’re coming from multiple publishers and fit into different verticals, is the quality.</p>

<p>“I will say that I've never seen a company, and I've worked for many, including my own,” Sharp said, “that can create a marriage of what’s outside the box and what’s inside.” She explained that it’s that perfect blend of tight mechanics, high-quality design, and evocative artwork that sets an Asmodee game apart.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We're in the business of selling games, but it makes it really fun to sell when you know that from the moment you look at it to the moment you open it and play it, that it's got that same quality. And that's what I think sets Asmodee games apart.”</p>

<h2>Staying Nimble in a Shifting Business Landscape</h2>

<p>Next, I wanted to hear about how she helps steer the sales and other business orgs through an ever-shifting landscape. When gaming trends and fads rise and fall like the tides, how does Asmodee stay afloat?</p>

<p>“This is a constant theme of every single day, every single week, month, and year of this job. What is a fad? What is a trend that has some staying power?” She explained that because of the nature of game production, you can’t really take a chance on a fad.</p>

<p>“You sell a year in advance for what's coming out for the next, so our fall pitches for 2025 are done. You always have to look at what's coming, what's trending, what relationships and partnerships are you doing? It's meeting with the studios. It's meeting with our marketing team, looking at our our data, marketing data, Point Of Sale data, what's selling, what's hot, what's not.”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inside-asmodee-julien-and-team-playtesting-duck-and-cover.jpeg?itok=XJdp4ocY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inside-asmodee-julien-and-team-playtesting-duck-and-cover.jpeg?itok=zRmhcv6R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Playtesting incoming games helps the team get familiar with the product. Image: Julien Sharp</figcaption></figure><p>Sharp stressed, however, that they’re not the <i>designers</i> of the games themselves, but “that doesn't mean we can't impact and ask for things we see. So we are very involved in saying ‘we have a hole here that could be filled,’ and I get very involved in executive-level meetings looking at staffing from a global perspective, all toward making sure that we have the right game at the right time.</p>

<p>“We see the market here in the U.S. and we're stewarding that knowledge and putting it up the chain, that way our game design studios, and our heads of these different verticals can get the right product into the U.S.”</p>

<h2>Women in Toys and Giving Back</h2>

<p>I also wanted to get a chance to speak to Sharp about her role in <a href="https://www.womenintoys.com/" rel="nofollow">Women in Toys</a>, a non-profit organization and global community that champions and advocates for the advancement of women in Toys, Licensing, and Entertainment through leadership, networking, and educational opportunities.</p>

<p>“I’m at a point in my career where I can give back a little more,” Sharp explained, “you know, for the next generation of people coming in. So I was thrilled to be asked last year to sit on the board. I'm on a three-year appointment to the board of Women in Toys. There wasn't as much board-game representation there, so I work with a team of gamer gals that are in different areas trying to build the board game awareness a little more at Women in Toys, which is really exciting.”&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I work with a team of gamer gals that are in different areas trying to build the board game awareness ... at&nbsp;Women in Toys..."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“What I love about WiT, though,” Sharp said, “and that I think is just incredible, is that they have a scholarship program, and I'm on one of the committees that reviews scholarship applicants and helps pick the recipients. The idea of giving a chance for women to get into board games via this scholarship is really exciting. So I love doing that.” Along with Women in Toys, she also helps as part of the judging panel for young inventors with the resource/networking hub <a href="https://peopleofplay.com/about" rel="nofollow">People of Play</a>.</p>

<h2>Finding Work in the Gaming Industry</h2>

<p>To cap off our conversation, I wanted to get Sharp's advice for people looking to get into the gaming industry. “I love this question,” she exclaimed, “and this is really the purpose of what we're doing together in this series.”</p>

<p>She said that while there are more programs than ever to study game design, and even art and illustration for games, that’s not the only way to <i>be in the industry</i>. “If you get your general business degree, look who's working in games right now?” I get her point, people with business degrees are still needed in the industry.</p>

<p>“On my team, there are people in the warehouse that are working in games, there are people in PR that are working in games. There are people working in marketing, people working in sales,” she pauses here for emphasis, and I have to admit I’m whipped up right along with her. “They could be selling pet supplies, they could be selling picture frames, they could be selling furniture, but sales are sales, and they're selling board games.”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inside-asmodee-julien-with-it-team.jpeg?itok=VvyYJprA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inside-asmodee-julien-with-it-team.jpeg?itok=mvMn4tsJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Julien Sharp with a visiting IT team, just one of the many ways to get into the Tabletop industry. Image: Julien Sharp.</figcaption></figure><p>“There's a lot of ways to get into games. Our head business analyst, he plays! He built incredible <i>Star Wars: Unlimited </i>decks! He plays every game. There isn’t a game that comes through that he doesn't play. And he's our business analyst, right? So there's a lot of ways to get into the game industry.”</p>

<p>And Sharp emphasized that Asmodee <i>wants</i> their employees to play. “We give a huge discount to employees,” she explained, “I mean, that's the coolest perk you get. I can't believe some of the games I've been able to buy at an incredible discount. So you can come in and be a business person, or work in PR, or marketing, and come in and get into the board game industry and work at getting our games en route to market. We have all the elements of any other business entity, so you don't have to be an expert in board game design to get in to working games.”</p>

<h2>What’s Julien Playing?</h2>

<p>Before we wrapped up, I had to know what Sharp, with all this access to Asmodee’s gaming library, was playing right now. First, she said she’s totally in love with one of their third-party games which hasn’t hit the U.S. yet, <a href="https://captain.games/en/games/duck-and-cover" rel="nofollow"><i>Duck and Cover</i></a>.</p>

<p>“I love it. It's really, really fun. It's a quick game, just three rounds, and you're trying to get the lowest score. So that's a little counter intuitive.” But Julien has also been really getting into <i>Star Wars: Unlimited</i> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/altered-tcg-review-world-of-potential" rel="nofollow"><i>Altered</i>, the newest Asmodee Trading Card Game</a>.</p>

<p>“They couldn't be more different from each other,” Julien says of <i>Unlimited </i>and <i>Altered</i>, “but they're two fabulous games. I went to England for a work trip this summer and went to <i>Star Wars: Unlimited</i> pre-release event at a local game store,” and since then she’s been bit by the <i>Unlimited </i>bug (I’m also afflicted).</p>

<p>“I also really love <i>Altered</i>,” she said. “It's a different philosophy. The art is incredible, and the gameplay is really, really neat. So I hope that people will fall in love with that as it starts to ship out. Those are my picks this year.”</p>

Thanks so much to Julien Sharp for taking the time out to talk with us, and give us an insider’s view into what it’s like running so many facets of a gaming company. We’ll continue our series throughout the year with designers, marketing professionals, shipping logistics managers, and more to ensure we’re getting a full 360 view Inside Asmodee!</p>

            <p>Over the years, game retailers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/gog">GOG</a> have drifted from almost purely offering classic oldies to welcoming more and more modern blockbusters onto their storefront. In one sense, they've turned from a game preservation champion into a slightly dustier, DRM-less Steam. Now, though, GOG have declared a renewed focus on not just selling aged games, but on tweaking more of them to work on non-aged hardware. And you'll be able to tell which games have got this restoration treatment from a fancy badge plastered on top of them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The GOG Preservation Program, as the endeavour is being called, is an extension of the store’s previous efforts in restoring older games (see their recent fix-ups of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidians-espionage-rpg-alpha-protocol-returns-to-store-shelves-after-four-years-in-license-hell">Alpha Protocol</a> and the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-3-is-now-available-via-gog-following-the-arrivals-of-its-predecessors">Resident Evil trilogy</a>). It's also combined with elements of Valve’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-interview">Steam Deck Verified</a> system, which conveys whether a game performs well on the handheld. </p>
<p>First, GOG’s in-house software boffins set about squishing all the bugs and adding all the missing features (modern video codecs, Windows 10/11 compatibility, etc) that might prevent them from playing nice with an up-to-date PC. Then, the games that graduate this process get a certified "Good Old Game" badge on their store listing, showing at-a-glance that they’re ready to play without needing a bunch of unofficial patches or mods.</p>
<p>Badged games will also be "the most complete version available," in terms of DLCs, expansions, and even the availability of manuals and alternative languages. They’ll also come with offline installers and, of course, no DRM.</p>

<p>To kick things off, over 100 games are being relaunched with Good Old Game status. These include Resident Evils 1, 2, and 3, the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo">Diablo</a> (and its Hellfire expansion), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</a>, both OG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallout</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-curse-of-monkey-island">The Curse of Monkey Island</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/x-com-ufo-defense">X-COM: UFO Defense</a> and dozens more classics. Is it bad if I say I’d be particularly keen on playing an updated New Vegas over this (considerable) batch of <em>old</em>-old stuff? If anything, its relative newness makes me extra mad that I need to mod it so hard just to avoid my post-2008 graphics card breaking the framerate-based physics and sending my Courier whizzing about like they’re on rocket-strapped Heelys. Anyway, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yA9kOZBT5pvBRABFBIjITmS8ZdV3QMgPl2emR5dqbv8/edit?gid=0#gid=0">read the full list here</a>.</p><p>"Our goal is for all games, whether recent or classic, to eventually become part of the Preservation Program," sayeth GOG themselves. "There is a long backlog of classic games available on GOG that may already qualify for the program, but our Team has not been able to confirm that yet. We aim to support as many games as possible, but it's not always entirely up to us."</p>
<p>Indeed, restoration projects like this require the original developers/publishers giving permission to poke around their games’ code, and you can probably imagine how that isn’t always forthcoming. And those on the game-making side won't be the only ones thinking about the bottom line: GOG ultimately exist to sell games, not immortalise them in museums, nor hand them out to people who owned an original CD-ROM copy back in yesteryear.</p>
<p>Still, on balance it’s probably better that someone profits off a healthy game preservation pipeline than to not have one at all, so it's hard to complain that much about this unusually niche-facing turn back towards GOG’s roots. It's a timely move too, considering disgruntled players have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-is-being-sued-over-the-crew-in-a-lawsuit-that-compares-the-server-shutdown-to-a-bumperless-pinball-machine">resorted to suing publishers</a> for yanking games into unplayability through server shutdowns. Hopefully GOG persevere through any naysaying and can keep producing these offline-compatible, preservation-friendly semi-remasters for a good long while.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
