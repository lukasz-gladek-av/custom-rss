<p>This is the first major patch for Space Marine 2 since its launch on 9th September – outside of a quick hotfix a couple days after release. The game has proven to be a big hit for Saber Interactive, Focus Entertainment and, of course, for Games Workshop, having sold 2 million copies in that first full day of release!</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">our Space Marine 2 review</a>, Dom said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-woes-mount-with-investor-and-strike-threats.993048/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like Ubisoft's troubles are far from over. After admitting to an unsatisfactory financial performance for the first half of the year in a statement yesterday, the studio is now facing a potential employee strike, as well as mounting investor gloom.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ubisoft announced it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">delay&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>until February next year</a> to add extra polish. The company also admitted that&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>hadn't been as successful as it would like, so that makes two major releases that aren't quite panning out the way Ubisoft might want.</p>
<p>Now, French union STJV is <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/09/call-for-strike-for-all-french-ubisoft-entities-on-october-15-16-and-17-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">calling for</a> French Ubisoft employees to strike over the studio's decision to force a return to the office for three days a week, which STJV says was a decision "made without any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers' representatives".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-ubisoft-yasuke-naoe.jpg?itok=tVHjKZBm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-ubisoft-yasuke-naoe.jpg?itok=R73ITjZo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has been delayed, but Ubisoft's troubles don't end there.</figcaption></figure><p>STJV is also calling for "an immediate increase in salaries to compensate for the drop in our living standards in recent years", as well as an end to Ubisoft's gender pay gap, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/french-union-solidaires-informatique-sues-ubisoft-over-harassment">recurring problem for the company</a> in recent years.</p>
<p>That's not all, though. Earlier this month, activist investment company AJ Investments <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change">called for Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot to step down</a>, as well as other sweeping changes to the company's corporate structure and strategy.</p>
<p>Now, according to a letter shared with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ubisoft-activist-investor-says-it-has-support-10-shareholders-management-tussle-2024-09-26/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, AJ Investments says it has the support of 10% of Ubisoft's shareholders, calling once again for management to "allow the sale of the company to third parties or private equity firms at a fair price".</p>
<p>It's another headache for a studio that arguably can't afford many more before something major has to give. Pirate game&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones</em>, which was infamous for its prolonged development time, launched this year to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/skull-and-bones-review-dead-and-buried-already">not very much fanfare at all</a>, and other recent Ubisoft releases haven't exactly thrilled either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skull-and-bones-ubisoft.jpg?itok=iIxp3PWf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skull-and-bones-ubisoft.jpg?itok=lPU5W1ui 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft hasn't released&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>sales figures, but it doesn't look great for the game.</figcaption></figure><p>It remains to be seen what awaits Ubisoft on the horizon; there's every chance that its pivot away from Season Passes and its decision to release PC games day-and-date on Steam will turn things around for the company.</p>
<p>One thing's for sure, though; Yves Guillemot's studio needs hits, and it needs them quickly to stave off challenges from what appear to be increasingly agitated investors. It also likely needs to engage in open dialogue with employees and unions to see off mutiny on that front. Stay tuned for more.</p>

In this magic-filled romp, you’ll take on the role of Zelda herself, rather than series protagonist Link. And as such, it plays differently too, Zelda able to summon defeated enemies and items to aid her with exploration and combat. If you’re looking to dive in and see what this fresh take on an established line of games looks like, here are all the details on <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195719" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="195719,195755,196394" data-current="195719"><div><p>Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21229.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h60955"><a id=""></a><strong>How long is <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>?</strong></h2><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, like most games in the series, determines your time spent in the game based on how fast you are at solving puzzles—and how much side-content you want to finish, of course. However, a playthrough of just the main story, with minimal optional detours, should take on average around <strong>15 hours</strong>.</p><p>Zelda’s ability to summon the echoes of enemies and items to help with fights and solve puzzles is a lot of fun, but not all of them are required to beat the main story—meaning there’s a lot of extra stuff to find and do. If discovering everything is your goal, this will require diving into optional dungeons scattered throughout the map, defeating bosses you might’ve otherwise never faced, and completing a wide variety of side-quests.</p><figure id="" data-id="fac884f3de8423195b2d0fb4629913d8" data-recommend-id="image://fac884f3de8423195b2d0fb4629913d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda summons a slain foe in a puzzle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zelda summons a slain foe in a puzzle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fac884f3de8423195b2d0fb4629913d8" data-recommend-id="image://fac884f3de8423195b2d0fb4629913d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda summons a slain foe in a puzzle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Many of the echoes (summons) earned in these optional locations can massively improve your ability to move around the map, or more easily complete puzzles. As such, you can (and should) go out of your way to collect all the possible combinations if you want to get the most out of the game. Aiming to collect all of the echoes and complete all of the side-quests in the game can take up to <strong>25 to 30 hours</strong>.<br></p><h2 id="h60956"><a id=""></a><strong>Can you use a sword in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>?</strong></h2><p>While Zelda’s primary method of combat includes summoning enemies to fight on her behalf, you might be surprised to hear that you <em>can</em> actually summon a sword, too! Doing so grants you the swordfighting form, letting you function similarly to Link in combat as you slice and dice through your foes. However, this form uses energy that can run out fairly quickly, and will require you to collect orbs to replenish it, so you’ll want to save its use for scenarios where it really matters.</p><h2 id="h60957"><a id=""></a><strong>Does <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> have fast travel?</strong></h2><p>All of the cool echoes you find exploring can make for faster and easier movement around the map, but even so, long-distance journeys can take a while. There’s some good news: <strong>the game offers fast travel</strong>. You can use waypoints across the map to quickly move to previously-visited locations, cutting your travel time by a significant amount.</p><h2 id="h60958"><a id=""></a><strong>Does <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> have difficulty modes?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="610dfb083b8f2cec6584e3d3c7444068" data-recommend-id="image://610dfb083b8f2cec6584e3d3c7444068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda's very happy about a moblin find." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zelda's very happy about a moblin find." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="610dfb083b8f2cec6584e3d3c7444068" data-recommend-id="image://610dfb083b8f2cec6584e3d3c7444068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda's very happy about a moblin find." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes! <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> features two difficulty modes: Normal and Hero. The former provides the standard experience that most players are likely to want to play. However, the latter features multiple changes that make things more challenging, such as Zelda taking increased damage from enemies, and no hearts being dropped in the overworld for quick health regeneration.</p><p>It’s important to note that you can change the difficulty in the menu at any time, so if you start on Hero Mode and find it too challenging, you can always bump things down a notch to make it a bit easier on yourself.</p><h2 id="h60959"><a id=""></a><strong>Does <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> have co-op?</strong></h2><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is a single-player game, so it does not offer any type of couch or online cooperative play. Players assume the role of Zelda exclusively throughout the game, and thank goodness Tingle doesn’t seem to be around. However, due to having the ability to summon foes to aid you in battle, it can sometimes feel like you’ve got friends helping out—because you kind of do! Just, not human friends.</p><h2 id="h60960"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> any good?</strong></h2><p>Thank goodness, the answer is yes!

While the regular PS5 Pro costs $700, this anniversary bundle has a higher price tag due to it including a number of extras, like a disc drive cover, an extra DualSense Edge controller, PlayStation shapes cable ties, and more.</p><p>There is one single listing on eBay for the bundle priced at an astronomical $10,000, enough cash to buy 14 regular PS5 Pro consoles and still have change left over for a few games. It's worth noting that what these sellers are asking for the PS5 Pro bundle and what they could eventually sell for are two different things entirely, as several of these listings include eBay's "Best Price" feature that allows a potential buyer to haggle with a seller on the price.</p><p>If you're after a regular PS5 Pro, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorder-guide-price-release-date-amazon-best-buy-walmart/1100-6526406/" data-ref-id="1100-6526406">you can preorder one starting today</a> from PlayStation Direct and at major retailers starting October 10.

            <p>Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime left the company he started up in 1991 with his university classmate because he was tired of constantly butting heads with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a>.</p>
<p>An excerpt from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-25/book-excerpt-play-nice-the-rise-fall-and-future-of-blizzard-entertainment">Bloomberg</a> reporter Jason Schreier's upcoming book Play Nice: The Rise And Fall Of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/blizzard-entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> has shed more light on Morhaime's departure from the company in 2018.</p>
<p>According to Schreier, the Blizzard co-founder was tired of fighting the former Activision CEO on a myriad of issues. Problems reportedly began around six years after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-and-vivendi-to-merge">Blizzard and Activision merged to become Activision Blizzard</a>, with the cancellation of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> successor project known as Titan.</p>

<p>Following this cancellation - which was said to cost Blizzard around $80m - Activision moved to assert more control over the Diablo maker, and in 2013 Kotick made a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-buys-independence-from-vivendi">deal to buy Activision Blizzard's independence from Vivendi</a> (Blizzard's then parent company). Following this, Blizzard was encouraged by Activision execs to hire chief financial officer Armin Zerza to "keep costs in check", with Kotick clearly bitter about Titan's cancellation.</p>
<p>Zerza - who had previously worked in the marketing and distribution of products such as detergent and shampoo - came on board in 2015, with the CFO soon looking to nix events such as the company's annual BlizzCon event due to low profit margins.</p>
<p>"Before Zerza, the company was run by Blizzard lifers and video game enthusiasts, but the CFO brought a completely different mindset," Schreier's book reads, adding Blizzard employees would scoff behind the CFO's back due to his "inability to understand the video game industry".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kotick believed Blizzard was letting down its community by not releasing games and content more frequently, but said he wouldn't force the developers to release a title before it was ready for launch - something Morhaime along with his own inner circle were said to consider contradictory. "Kotick celebrated when Blizzard produced a new hit but failed to grasp what it took to create one."</p>

</figure>
<p>Morhaime continued to battle Kotick in the subsequent years, arguing for the importance of departments such as customer service and Blizzard's cinematics team (which made short films based on the company's games), as well the matter of employee bonuses. Kotick reportedly felt the teams who delivered the largest profits should get the biggest bonuses, while Morhaime believed this would stifle creativity and the entire company should benefit from profit sharing.</p>
<p>Morhaime reportedly felt Blizzard was losing its independence for many years, but following a meeting of Activision, Blizzard and King leaders in 2018 themed around unification - or "One ABK" - Morhaime wrote a lengthy email to Kotick. In this email, Morhaime said that Blizzard had reached a tipping point.</p>
<p>"I believe that preserving Blizzard's culture and magic is a necessity for preserving <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>'s advantage of having an organisation that can attract and retain the best creative talent in the world and that can consistently produce the highest quality games and experiences," he wrote. "It has been increasingly hard for me to provide Blizzard leadership and staff confidence that Blizzard has a stable future."</p>
<p>Morhaime had actually submitted a resignation letter prior to this meeting, in 2017, but was convinced by Kotick and others to remain at the company. However, in 2018, Morhaime ultimately announced he was stepping down from his position at Blizzard. While <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/22549840/message-from-mike-morhaime-and-j-allen-brack">publicly</a> Morhaime made no mention of his ongoing disagreements with Kotick and Activision, those who knew him personally reportedly knew this to be a key reason for his departure.</p>

<p>Following Morhaime's resignation, in 2021, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-california-sues-activision-blizzard-over-frat-boy-culture">State of California sued Activision Blizzard over allegations of a "frat boy" culture</a> that created "a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women". Despite no longer being part of the company, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-blizzard-boss-mike-morhaime-on-allegations-i-am-ashamed">Morhaime released his own statement</a> at this time, writing: "It is all very disturbing and difficult to read. I am ashamed. It feels like everything I thought I stood for has been washed away."</p>
<p>In October last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft purchased Activision Blizzard for the sum of $68.7bn</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-boss-bobby-kotick-departs-in-just-a-few-days">Kotick subsequently departed the company</a> at the end of December.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/merge-games-shuts-down<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Smalland: Survive the Wilds&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX&nbsp;</em>publisher Merge Games has announced it's shutting down, putting an end to a 15-year journey in the games industry.</p>
<p>Posting <a href="https://x.com/MergeGamesLtd/status/1839264412579831900" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Merge announces that it's closing down, although it doesn't disclose a reason in the post. However, in all likelihood, the closure of Merge is related to the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/maximum-entertainment-merges-six-games-divisions-under-parent-brand" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unification of all of parent company Maximum Entertainment's divisions</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>In its post, Merge says its team started "from a tiny, cramped attic" and grew to "a tight, multi-disciplined 22-person team", bringing "hundreds of indie gems to storefronts around the world". Rather poignantly, Merge says its team "loved every moment of it".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merge-games-smalland-frog.jpg?itok=nVt9Jhx2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merge-games-smalland-frog.jpg?itok=9lnEW4cH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Merge Games is responsible for games like&nbsp;<em>Smalland: Survive the Wilds</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Merge continues by thanking its fans for their support and asks that if you see a former Merge employee or interact with them, "just know that they're an incredible person who worked their hardest".</p>
<p>With regards to Merge's upcoming releases, which include narrative adventure&nbsp;<em>Spirit of the North 2&nbsp;</em>and cozy farming RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pixelshire-is-cute-farming-rpg-coming-in-2023"><em>Pixelshire</em></a>, the studio <a href="https://x.com/MergeGamesLtd/status/1839266756545671227" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> its slate will "be managed by [its] parent company, Maximum Entertainment".</p>
<p>It's not clear whether all of Merge's employees will be laid off or whether they'll be absorbed into Maximum Entertainment, although the wording of Merge's post suggests that its staff might be out of a job now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merge-games-pixelshire.jpg?itok=mLjA7iIl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merge-games-pixelshire.jpg?itok=NWXIgyJS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Merge's upcoming releases, including&nbsp;<em>Pixelshire</em>, will be handled by Maximum Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>Merge is just one of a number of studios that have been shut down or significantly downsized in the industry in recent months. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/risk-of-rain-2-hopoo-games-valve"><em>Risk of Rain 2</em>'s Hopoo Games</a>,&nbsp;<em>Doom 3 VR&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-3-vr-developer-archiact-shuts-down">Archiact</a>, and (allegedly)&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Risen&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report">Piranha Bytes</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Of course, it's possible that Merge's shutdown has been on the cards since February's Maximum consolidation, and it's fair to say that the above studios don't all have the same reasons for shutting down. Still, today, we mourn the loss of a fascinating little publishing house. Stay tuned for more.</p>

This means a game that doesn’t exactly push graphical boundaries is seeing its framerate leap about uncomfortably, despite running smoothly on PS5 and Xbox Series.</p><p>This matched my own initial experiences. My PC is a few years old now, but remains a decent AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, with 32 MB RAM, and a GeForce RTX 3070. Despite the first playable section of the game running at a smooth 60 FPS, as soon as I was in the first busy combat, it was jumping all over the place, rarely dipping below 40, but changing so frequently as to be extremely distracting. (I’m no framerate weirdo, and would be very happy to play at a steady 40 FPS, but the jittering between is the issue.)</p><p>The demo also lacks a large number of standard PC graphics settings, without even options for anti-aliasing, which suggests a dubious port of the console version, for the demo at least. It’s something PC players see too often, where vital settings required to play properly on the wheezing towers are missing. It also raises concerns for those hoping to play the full game on their PC in three weeks’ time. We’ve reached out to Sega and Atlus to ask about all this.</p><h2 id="h85231"><a id=""></a>Possible ways to fix <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>’s performance issues</h2><figure id="" data-id="a8e824aa2610be7d0636caa744571a8a" data-recommend-id="image://a8e824aa2610be7d0636caa744571a8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Rendering Scale options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Rendering Scale options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8e824aa2610be7d0636caa744571a8a" data-recommend-id="image://a8e824aa2610be7d0636caa744571a8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Rendering Scale options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, some are suggesting some solutions. Reading through Steam reviews of the demo—which are currently a mix of people furious about how badly it runs, and other people telling them that they’re wrong—it seems the most frequent solution on offer is to reduce the game’s rendering scale. Which sounds like a bummer of a fix, until you learn that the game is frequently defaulting to 125 to 150 percent in the first place. My own launched at 125 percent.</p><p>And yeah, it worked. I put it down to 100 percent (of what? I’m honestly not sure—I feel like more than 100 percent should have had the game hanging out the sides of my monitor, but the options go from 50 percent to 200), and then I was hitting a solid 60FPS in busy streets packed with dozens of NPCs.</p><p>In fact, after changing this I was able to put Texture Quality up to High and didn’t see any performance knock at all. And this is all running at 2560x1440 in a window.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/metaphor-refantazio-demo-launches-on-pc-to-framerate-woes-but-fans-are-already-cracking-fixes-for-the-new-jrpg/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/metaphor-refantazio-demo-launches-on-pc-to-framerate-woes-but-fans-are-already-cracking-fixes-for-the-new-jrpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GamesRadar</em></a></span> also spotted <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaphorReFantazio/comments/1fpnsne/metaphor_refantazio_pc_stuttering_fix/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaphorReFantazio/comments/1fpnsne/metaphor_refantazio_pc_stuttering_fix/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Reddit thread</a></span> that suggests a slightly harder-core solution (pun so very much intended). With the game running, open Task Manager (Ctrl Shift Esc is a neat shortcut for this!), choose the Details tab, then right click on METAPHOR.exe and choose “set affinity.” Deselect all the cores but one, hit OK, then do it again and re-select all the cores. Apparently this will help if rendering scale does not. I tried it too, and yeah, I then put my rendering scale up to 150 percent, and my framerate hovered between 55 and 60. Which is good enough for me!</p><p>Hopefully, by the time the game comes out October 11, the PC version will feature a far better suite of options, including standards like anti-aliasing, DLSS, etc, and have any core use bugs ironed out. In the meantime, these fixes worked for me and others.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been revealed that Black Myth Wukong sold 20 million units in its first month across the PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>



<p>The information comes from Ken Kutaragi at the Toyko Game Show (via <a href="https://x.com/deantak/status/1839133380891300082/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dean Takahashi</a>), in which a presentation slide reveals that Black Myth: Wukong sold 10 million units in its first three days and 20 million units in one month. The game also saw three million concurrent players across all platforms.</p>



<p>Interestingly, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2358720/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamID</a>, just over 2.4 million of these concurrent players were on PC (assuming this was the 3 million peak), meaning that around 600,000 players were on PlayStation 5. That means that according to these numbers, at least for the concurrent number at least, about 80% of Black Myth: Wukong’s players were playing on PC.</p>



<p>20 million units in one month puts Black Myth: Wukong firmly in one of the top spots as one of the fastest-selling games to date.</p>



<p>According to review aggregator Metacritic, the game received generally favorable reviews from PC and PlayStation 5 users, with an 81/100 score for PC and 75/100 on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>According to analyst&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DanielOlimac/status/1835067614118527363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1835067614118527363%7Ctwgr%5Ed1ce3b33a730825310523a25d786dc3b5b5b2039%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.geekinout.pt%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daniel Camilo</a> (who also reported the 20 million number a few weeks ago), <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-coming-early-2025-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLC for Black Myth: Wukong</a> is expected to release sometime around Chinese New Year.</p>

                <p>Nintendo visionary Shigeru Miyamoto has commented on the company's stance regarding artificial intelligence, saying the Mario maker aims to "go in a different direction."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, Miyamoto said Nintendo is often perceived as a company that bucks trends and does its own thing only for the sake of it. But that isn't true. It's an intentional effort to be different, Miyamoto said. And the same thinking applies for AI--whereas plenty of companies are adopting and embracing it, Nintendo may not.</p><p>Miyamoto said Nintendo's ambition is "trying to find what makes Nintendo special." He added: "There is a lot of talk about AI, for example. When that happens, everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction."</p><p>Earlier this year, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa explained that AI could be used "in creative ways" but there were also "issues with intellectual property rights" to deal with.</p><p>"Generative AI, which is becoming a big topic recently, can be used in creative ways, but we recognize that it may also raise issues with intellectual property rights," <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Furukawa said</a>. While Nintendo is open to "utilizing technological developments," it is currently relying on its experienced employees to develop unique games.</p><p>"We have decades of know-how in creating the best gaming experiences for our players. While we are open to utilizing technological developments, we will work to continue delivering value that is unique to Nintendo and cannot be created by technology alone," Furukawa said.</p><p>Nintendo's stance on AI is indeed different from some of the video game industry's other major players. Electronic Arts boss Andrew Wilson believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-drive-microtransaction-sales-help-games-get-made-faster-no-comment-on-human-impact/1100-6521669/" data-ref-id="1100-6521669">AI could be used to develop games more quickly</a>. Microsoft, meanwhile, is heavily invested in AI and has said AI will be featured in every product it makes going forward, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exec-believes-ai-will-be-a-major-inflection-point-for-gaming-but-says-nothing-about-human-impact/1100-6519555/" data-ref-id="1100-6519555">including Xbox</a>, and Ubisoft plans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-trying-to-make-ai-npcs-that-have-real-conversations/1100-6521970/" data-ref-id="1100-6521970">create AI NPCs that players can have conversations with</a>.</p><p>AI technology, of course, has been used in game development for decades--but what's new and different in recent years is what's referred to as generative artificial intelligence. Many remain concerned that growth of the generative AI market could lead to job losses, and companies like EA and others have admitted this is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/">legitimate concern</a> in the short term. In the longer-term, people like Wilson of EA and others believe generative AI will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-future-could-be-a-bigger-seamless-world-and-more-players/1100-6525024/" data-ref-id="1100-6525024">similar to previous labor revolutions that had short-term job losses and long-term growth.</a></p><p>The video game industry has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">faced brutal layoffs in 2023 and 2024</a>, though what role advances to artificial intelligence technologies has had on these cuts is unknown.</p><p>Nintendo is gearing up to announce its next console, presumably <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">the Switch 2</a>, and a reveal is expected soon or perhaps near Nintendo's next earnings briefing in November as some have speculated.</p>

            <p>Bravely he stood, alone on his hill, unwavering in the face of backlash: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> should have just let Frog be a talking frog instead of being a knight turned into a frog. So, trash game. Fortunately, I can finally experience what it’s like to actually enjoy Chrono Trigger - Canadian Studio Riyo Games are making what they describe as a "spiritual successor". It’s called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/threads-of-time">Threads Of Time</a>, it’s "aided by legendary developers and composers from Japan who have helped define Xenoblade Chronicles, the Mana series and more," and it looks beautiful.

<p>News of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has actually been floating around for a while now, with Riyo sharing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/130m08j/my_dream_of_20_years_is_coming_true_im_making_a/">a little snippet</a> on Reddit a year or so ago. Even in such a small clip, you can see how lovely it looks. Here’s some words from the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>Threads of Time features gorgeous 2.5D pixel art powered by Unreal Engine 5 that instantly transports you across breathtaking locales through the ages. Explore different eras, assemble your party and restore the ancient order of the Time Knights. From the majestic age of dinosaurs to the distant future teeming with mechanical marvels, every era is packed with adventure and secrets waiting to be unearthed. As you navigate this vast tapestry of history, uncover a sinister plot threatening to unravel the very fabric of time as told through striking anime cutscenes.</p></blockquote>
<p>A Steam page is supposed to be up today, but it isn’t showing up right now. Maybe it was only a frog pretending to be a Steam page. Who knows! Here are some features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>Time-Traveling Adventure: From an age where dinosaurs roam to the far-flung future and alternate realms in between - travel across fantastic and distinctive time periods, and discover the threads that bind the ages. Uncover an epic tale of interwoven fates, and secrets that shaped civilizations…and follow the threads of a sinister plot that traverses the tapestry of time.</p></li>
<li><p>Timeless Turn-Based Combat: Weave together powerful attacks in visually dynamic, strategic turn-based battles. Bend time to your will, unravel enemies’ defenses, and unleash your party’s full potential through devastating team combos.</p></li>
<li><p>Heroes From Across Ages: Assemble a party of charismatic and unique characters recruited from different eras. Restore the ancient Order of the Time Knights and unite heroes from across epochs to defend the timeline from impending chaos and corruption.</p></li>
<li><p>Retro Charm Meets Modern Visuals: Step into vibrant worlds powered by Unreal Engine 5, meet lovingly hand-crafted 2D characters and experience the timeless charm of pixel art as you explore through the ages. Threads of Time captures the essence of your favorite retro RPGs, wrapped in a new and immersive adventure.</p></li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>“I'm distracted by them using "AD" and "BC" though. Christ exists in this fiction? So did God invent magic, then? Was Jesus a wizard? Tell me more plz,” mused Graham in Slack. It’s been a while since I’ve played Chrono Trigger (which I enjoyed, before you go feral on me in the comments), but some searching tells me the ‘B.C’ in that stood for ‘Before Cedric’. Will Threads Of Time also feature a Cedric? What if it's Jesus transformed into a Cedric? I await these answers longingly.</p></div>

<p>Merge Games has announced that it will be closing down after 15 years of publishing games.</p>



<p>The announcement came earlier today on <a href="https://x.com/MergeGamesLtd/status/1839264412579831900">X</a> (formerly Twitter), which read,</p>



<p>“Hello! After 15 years, Merge Games is closing down.</p>



<p>Starting from  tiny, cramped attic and growing to a tight, multi-disciplined 22 person team, we’ve brought hundreds of indie gems to storefronts around the world and loved every moment of it!</p>



<p>We couldn’t have done it without people passionate about indie games, from all of our developers all the way to you folks, the players!</p>



<p>If you see someone from Merge, just know that they’re an incredible person that worked their hardest.</p>



<p>Thank you for many years of gaming!”</p>



<p>Since its inception, Merge Games has published various games, including Dead Cells, Small and Survive the Wilds, Bramble: The Mountain King, TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, and more. However, its parent company, Maximum Entertainment, will now manage any upcoming releases that were under Merge Games before its closure.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Funko Fusion Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/26/funko-fusion-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/funko-fusion-review.992946/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/26/funko-fusion-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Funko’s remain an ubiquitous part of the shopping landscape, row after row of plastic figures styled after every popular franchise in the world languishing on shelves in every supermarket, toy shop and place of geekdom. Collectable, displayable, and kind of cute in their own way, they also don’t <em>do</em>&nbsp;very much, and their pervasive presence and plastic build mean that they’re edging ever closer to being throwaway tat. Funko Fusion is the company’s attempt to ‘do a Lego’, taking their real-world products and popping them into a video game. These Funkos definitely do something, but whether it’s enough to change people’s mind about them remains to be seen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Funko Fusion - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2ATcFLgSMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The biggest question that arises from playing Funko Fusion is a simple one: who is this really for? It draws together a disparate batch of franchises – Jurassic World, He-Man, Scott Pilgrim, The Umbrella Academy, Battlestar Galactica, The Thing and Hot Fuzz are your starting points – and tasks you with saving this plasticky multiverse from the forces of evil who are set on destroying it. You do that by mostly beating, bashing and shooting your way past a host of enemies, while solving the occasional puzzle, and if the team were hoping to emulate the Lego games, they’ve mostly got it right.</p>


<p>It’s probably little surprise to find this vein of child-friendly action games running through Funko Fusion, as 10:10 Games was founded by former Traveller’s Tales team members Arthur Parsons and Jon Burton. The biggest issue here is that barring Jurassic World, the majority of franchises here are aimed at people in their 30s and 40s, running the gamut of old-school names through to a worrying vein of horror titles like Child’s Play. Hell, it’s not even the most recent Battlestar Galactica (which is already 20 years old), it’s the original 1970s one, which came out before I was born. And I’m old.</p>


<p>All this means that, bizarrely, Funko Fusion is rated 16. It is not for children. But, the only people who have been really excited to play it have been my children – aged 8 and 13 – and predominantly because it has dinosaurs in it. We started with Jurassic World, but the moment I moved onto He-Man – the only other clearly child-friendly franchise here – their interest swiftly waned.</p>
<p>That was probably the right thing to happen, as the scary, slightly vicious streak that also runs through Funko Fusion from the outset had me questioning my parenting choices. The vinyl is melted right off the bones of a cute fox character early on, and that underlying darkness is only enhanced by the arrival of Chucky, M3GAN and characters from The Walking Dead as you head deeper into the plastic depths of Fusion’s worlds.</p>

<p>Again though, Funko Fusion <em>looks</em> like a kids game, and it’s an excellent-looking one at that. The plasticky stars look very much like their real-world counterparts, and each franchise-specific location manages to capture the look, feel and nostalgia of those original titles. The strains of recognisable themes helps as well, but having taken the original Lego route of forgoing dialogue, and relying on slapstick humour – oh look, their head’s come off and now they’re covered in poo! – means that again, this feels like a kids game that’s not for kids.</p>
<p>“But games can just be fun!” a corner of the internet will cry. Yes, they can be fun, and Funko Fusion broadly is. I like a good spot of nostalgia as much as the next guy, and seeing the DeLorean from Back to the Future appear or Masters of the Universe’s Snake Mountain in 3D, made a ton of feelings bubble up to the surface – not least wondering whatever happened to my original Castle Greyskull. It’s light, and fairly inconsequential, but enjoyable nonetheless.</p>

<p>The combat here is straightforward, but when I started out with my review it was actually surprisingly tough. So much so that 10:10 Games has already patched it to make it easier, raising further questions about who they’re targeting. For kids raised on Fortnite and Lego games, there’s little here that will surprise them, but it’s solid and engaging enough as you wonder what the next little Easter Egg will be.</p>
<p>The most criminal exclusion at launch though, is the lack of cooperative multiplayer. <a href="https://x.com/FunkoFusionGame/status/1831347215928807428">It’s coming in updates</a> through October and November for various world, just in time for Christmas, but if ever a game screamed out for playing with friends it’s this one, particularly if they share the same sense of nostalgia for these franchises.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/26/time-travelling-rpg-threads-of-time-revealed-at-tgs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the few notable announcements from the Xbox Tokyo Game Show stream was the reveal of Threads of Time, a time-travelling JRPG that is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Threads of Time | Announce Trailer EN" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tRMgzkwumfc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A time-skipping adventure, Threads of Time will take players from the prehistoric land of dinosaurs (where humans and dinos coexist like it’s The Flintstones) through to the far future. The Watcher of Time guides you through these disparate ages, as you look to assemble a team to restore the Order of the Time Knights, hoping to foil a plot that threatens the fabric of time itself.</p>

<p>Threads of Time takes liberal inspiration from classics of the JRPG genre –&nbsp;most specifically Chrono Trigger – in particular with the visual stylings that feature a 2.5D pixel art style not too far removed from Square Enix’s HD-2D games, though arguably with even more cinematic flair. It’s leaning on Unreal Engine 5 to achieve this.</p>

<p>The turn-based combat has a focus on building up combos, forcing you to think a bit more strategically as you face off against such enemies as Fenrir, the wolf of legends, and Ruin, a massive robotic behemoth in the far future.</p>
<p>It looks really interesting and is a game we’ll certainly be keeping an eye on. Threads of Time is in development at Riyo Games, with Humble Games set to publish.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-120-fps/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-has-no-trouble-pushing-120-fps-gameplay-even-without-optimization-and-pssr-%E2%80%93-rumor.992940/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-120-fps/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro will apparently have little trouble running games at 120 FPS, according to a new report.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a> Broken Silicon podcast, host Tom confirmed to have been sent footage of a game running on PlayStation 5 Pro from an unnamed developer. This game ran with dynamic resolution averaging 1440p resolution, going as high as 1600p and as low as 1300p, at around 50 FPS, but unlocking the framerate brought the average framerate up to 100 FPS and above, without any sort of PS5 Pro optimization. With more work and the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, the developer felt confident they would have the game running at 1440p, 1600p resolution, and locked 120 FPS, which is definitely impressive for a console. The developer is also gearing to test out 4K@60 FPS resolution, which they feel confident they can achieve.</p>

<p>Following the PlayStation 5 Pro reveal, Sony allowed several outlets to check out the system. Among them was Digital Foundry, who outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-digital-foundry-hands-on-delivers-first-impression-on-pssr-ray-tracing-improvements-and-more/">yesterday</a> the improvements for many different titles, highlighting how, in many ways, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vast-improvement-playstation-5-pro/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> is the poster child for the console, mostly due to the poor image quality the game sports on the base model in Performance Mode.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th, 2024, worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fatal-fury-city-of-wolves-street-fighter-crossover</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-street-fighter-crossover-announced.992937/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fatal-fury-city-of-wolves-street-fighter-crossover<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SNK has announced that two&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>characters are making their way into the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>, which is currently due to launch in spring.</p>
<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/SNKPofficial/status/1839263065369620722" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter</em>'s iconic characters Ken and Chun-Li will make an appearance in&nbsp;<em>City of the Wolves</em>. I guess this is SNK returning the favor to Capcom after <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1839077427617661290" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Terry Bogard was featured</a> in&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>.</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>is still some way from being released, SNK doesn't give much away about exactly how Ken and Chun-Li will play in the game, but I'm guessing they'll be pretty similar to the way they appear in&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-street-fighter-crossover-combat.jpg?itok=n3b7ksGc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-street-fighter-crossover-combat.jpg?itok=HXd5loBW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>is getting two&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>characters.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether this is the full extent of the&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>crossover, or whether more&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>characters will arrive via DLC, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>We also don't know whether&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury&nbsp;</em>will make reference to the conclusion of Terry Bogard's story in&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>, whereupon he battles Ken as his final opponent. The two have an ongoing rivalry in crossover series&nbsp;<em>Capcom vs. SNK</em>.</p>
<p>In any case, you can check out the trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>crossover right here. It doesn't give a whole lot away, though.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>is, it's the first new mainline entry in the&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury&nbsp;</em>series of fighting games since 1999's&nbsp;<em>Garou: Mark of the Wolves</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-review-switch-1851657826<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How do you follow up on some of the most critically acclaimed games of the past decade? Many thought that Nintendo couldn’t surpass the sheer open-world wonder and physics toy-box creativity that made <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild such a revelation</em>. However, Nintendo seemed to do just that with <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, introducing a host of new ways for players to interact with the world and expanding the already vast realm of Hyrule both into the skies above and into the depths below, arguably improving so much on its extraordinary predecessor as to make it obsolete.</p><p>In between those two games, we also got <em>Link’s Awakening,</em> a 2019 remake of a classic Game Boy adventure that replaced the original’s pixel art with toy-like and dioramic visuals, trying to recreate the retro feel for a modern age. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> takes that same charming art direction and applies it to a completely original story featuring our beloved Hyrule princess, Zelda. It also attempts to combine the player-driven creativity and problem-solving from both <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>with classic top-down <em>Zelda</em> gameplay, and it works! Mostly.<br></p><p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s story finds Hyrule threatened by dark rifts engulfing the land, trapping its inhabitants, including our usual green-tunic-wearing hero Link, in a frozen time-space continuum. Zelda, with her fairy-like companion Tri, set out to dispel these rifts and set those trapped free. With Link himself imprisoned in one of these rifts, it falls to Zelda, in a first for a mainline game in the franchise, to rescue the land herself.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="42b0a609acf664865f259f15676c6a70" data-recommend-id="image://42b0a609acf664865f259f15676c6a70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda, standing on a rocky outcropping over a lake, looks toward a castle in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zelda, standing on a rocky outcropping over a lake, looks toward a castle in the distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42b0a609acf664865f259f15676c6a70" data-recommend-id="image://42b0a609acf664865f259f15676c6a70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda, standing on a rocky outcropping over a lake, looks toward a castle in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The main difference between playing as Zelda and stepping back into Link’s boots is that she doesn’t fight enemies directly with your typical sword and shield, at least most of the time. With Tri’s magic, Zelda is able to create “echoes,” which are clones of items and monsters she’s encountered throughout Hyrule. She can summon things like beds, tables, and chairs, but also creatures like electric-force-field-inducing blobs and goblins with spears (or moblins, in the Hyrule parlance). This is where <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s freeform creativity comes into play.<br></p><p>When traversing the game’s dungeons and puzzles, my go-to strategy was always to stack beds on top of each other, forming a makeshift bridge to cross wide gaps. It was similar to a strategy I used in <em>Tears of the Kingdom,</em> where I would just stick logs together to make a bridge. While this frequently helped me in the early game, I eventually had to think more creatively in later dungeons. For example, when gaps were too wide for my bed bridge, I stood at the edge of my incomplete creation and also used an echo that, when picked up, blew a windstream opposite of Zelda’s direction that propelled her far enough to reach the other side. When your solutions actually end up working, there’s a huge sense of accomplishment, and <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> provides those feelings in spades, making you feel satisfied and confident throughout.<br></p><p>When <em>Echoes </em>begins, Tri’s magic is limited so there’s a hard cap on how many echoes you can have out at a time. But the game’s progression system feels quite natural; as Tri becomes more capable, she and Zelda clear more rifts throughout the story and the cap increases, allowing Zelda to summon more echoes at once.<br></p><p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> feels something like a puzzle game, reminiscent of those older series entries that had intricately constructed dungeons you had to not just fight your way through but to solve, and in this game, you can progress through them with her echoes, which almost act as the key, traversal-aiding items that you’d otherwise obtain in games past.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="9a8309b085013f106b26e8f53ce4569b" data-recommend-id="image://9a8309b085013f106b26e8f53ce4569b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda looks up, smiling, while a blue frog-like creature glows above her and text reads, &quot;You learned the Drippitune echo!&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zelda looks up, smiling, while a blue frog-like creature glows above her and text reads, &quot;You learned the Drippitune echo!&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a8309b085013f106b26e8f53ce4569b" data-recommend-id="image://9a8309b085013f106b26e8f53ce4569b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda looks up, smiling, while a blue frog-like creature glows above her and text reads, &quot;You learned the Drippitune echo!&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To further maintain that classic <em>Zelda</em> feel, our intrepid heroine has limited access to Link’s iconic swordfighter repertoire. For a limited time, she can enter a “swordsman mode” that lets her swing a sword, shoot arrows, and throw bombs, all of the things Link could do when he was the protagonist. At times, this felt like a concession to longtime Zelda players who just want to return to Link’s gameplay. In the context of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s mechanics, it feels quite overpowered, even if it’s only active until Zelda’s energy meter runs out. Part of Zelda’s fighting style involves using the echoes to do the dirty work for her. That means risking your bomb-making fish echo being destroyed by an enemy before it can go off. The swordfighter mode essentially becomes like a “press to win” button because Zelda can just spam bombs. Additionally, Zelda can continually down smoothies that she can make with various ingredients throughout Hyrule to recharge her energy meter. This method effectively lets her enter and stay in swordfighter mode more frequently and for longer. As a result, this unfortunately ends up trivializing most of Zelda’s arsenal of echoes, as swordfighter mode makes quick work of even bosses.<br></p><p>Combat is at its best when you rely on echoes, and finding new echoes is half the fun of actually using them. Every time I defeated a new enemy, I was excited to scan them and create echoes of them. It felt like I was playing <em>Pokémon</em>, trying to collect as many as I could. However, that leads me into <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s most prominent issue: echo management.<br></p><p>There are dozens upon dozens of these echoes, and it’s a total pain in the butt to cycle through your entire list of all of them while looking for the particular one you need for your particular situation. There are some helpful sorting tools, such as being able to organize by your most recently used or the latest one you acquired, but I wish the game allowed you to manually organize your collection of echoes.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="0f0bf351028f658f36b8e32eeb06f452" data-recommend-id="image://0f0bf351028f658f36b8e32eeb06f452" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows collected echoes, sorted by Last Used, with a Bombfish echo highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu screen shows collected echoes, sorted by Last Used, with a Bombfish echo highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f0bf351028f658f36b8e32eeb06f452" data-recommend-id="image://0f0bf351028f658f36b8e32eeb06f452" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows collected echoes, sorted by Last Used, with a Bombfish echo highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Exploration also plays a huge role in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>. The map looks a lot like that of <em>A Link to the Past</em>, feeling like a sort of homage to the franchise’s past. The game is surprisingly long as well, taking about 25-30 hours to just complete the main story. It’s filled with dozens of side quests and optional dungeons. Some of these side quests are quick and easy, like finding and killing a monster that has the ability to summon rain and showing it to a local townsperson, or searching for missing chickens scattered throughout a town and putting them back into a farm. Others, meanwhile, are quite elaborate, including a multi-step one in which you’re eventually rewarded with the powerful ability to build robots that have humongous AOE attacks. They’re a huge boon, especially in boss fights.<br></p><p>I felt like the rewards you get for completing side quests are much more worthwhile than in most role-playing games. While you’ll probably just earn more rupees to spend at shops, you’re also likely to encounter a new echo along the way that could prove helpful later on. In fact, some of the most useful echoes are stowed away in optional dungeons, which makes exploration even more rewarding. Early on, I came across a giant plant that could propel itself into monsters, constantly dealing damage with its appendages. It was an incredibly powerful echo at that point in the game, and let me steamroll many of the early game bosses.<br></p><p>While exploration is fun and rewarding, I do wish Zelda’s running speed was faster. She runs abysmally slow and it’s incredibly frustrating. She has a little spin move that doesn’t do any damage, but when combined with running, actually makes her move much more quickly than her usual sprint. So I was constantly mashing the right bumper button while moving to break into a makeshift spin-dash whenever I was running out in the wild.<br></p><p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> successfully combines the feel of earlier <em>Zelda</em> games with the new creative direction that the modern entries have been going in. By fusing the classic key item progression of older Zelda games with the more modern, player-driven problem-solving of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> and <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> creates something both familiar, yet distinct from every other game in the series so far. Also, our long-suffering Hyrulian princess finally gets some time in the spotlight, and that is a welcome change of pace.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Employees at Ubisoft’s French offices are being urged to strike over the company’s recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-mandating-3-days-in-office-for-all-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global return to office mandate</a>.</p>



<p>STJV (Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo) made calls for a strike over a <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/09/call-for-strike-for-all-french-ubisoft-entities-on-october-15-16-and-17-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">three-day period in October</a>. According to the union, the decision to mandate a return to office policy without “any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers’ representatives.”</p>



<p>“After more than five years of working efficiently in the current remote-work context, many of our colleagues have built or rebuilt their lives (family life, housing, parenthood, etc.) and simply cannot return to the previous working conditions,” the union’s statement reads. “Our employer knows this perfectly well.&nbsp;The consequence of its decision will be the loss of our colleagues’ jobs, the disorganization of many game projects, and the drastic increase in psychosocial risks for those who remain.”</p>



<p>As far as what they are looking for, STJV says its demands are clear. They want a “formal agreement on remote work” as well as an increase in all salaries to “compensate for the drop in our living standards in recent years”. Lastly, they say they want to company to implement true “social dialogue” instead of a system where “management seems indeed to confuse monologue with dialogue”.</p>



<p>STJV is asking for all France-based employees to strike from October 15-17.</p>



<p>The calls for a strike come while Ubisoft is facing its most tumultuous time in recent history. The company announced on Wednesday that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> until February while also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealing an investigation and review</a> of the company was set to take place. On top of that, its stock prices have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-11-year-low-after-assassins-creed-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fallen to 11-year lows</a> due to changes in financial targets for the year.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you make of Ubisoft employees being encouraged to strike in October? Join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/505/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <p>Threads of Time is a newly revealed retro style RPG described as a spiritual successor to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>.</p>
<p>The game was shown today by Xbox at the Tokyo Game Show, and is being developed by Canadian studio Riyo Games.</p>
<p>This is the studio's first game, though its developers have experience from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a>, and Tomb Raider. What's more, development has been aided by "legendary developers and composers" from the Xenoblade Chronicles and Mana series.</p>

<p>As you can see from the above trailer, it features a gorgeous 2.5D style that blends pixel characters with 3D effects, classic turn-based battles, and is heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger with its time travelling plot.</p>
<p>It begins in prehistory with battles against dinosaurs, but also includes a dystopian cyberpunk city, an apocalyptic future, and a fantastical past of airships and magical creatures.</p>
<p>If all this sounds familiar, it certainly has shades of Sea of Stars from developer Sabotage Studios - also based in Canada. That game was similarly a love letter to Chrono Trigger and had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/composing-nostalgia-how-sea-of-stars-revisits-the-past-through-music">music from that game's original composer Yasunori Mitsuda</a>.</p>
<p>The release date for Threads of Time is yet to be revealed, but it's set to launch on Steam and consoles (including Xbox), and is available to wishlist now.</p>
<p>Until then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-free-carnival-themed-dlc-throes-of-the-watchmaker-revealed">Sea of Stars will receive free carnival-themed DLC</a> Throes of the Watchmaker in Spring next year.</p>
<p>What's more, Xbox also announced a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-brings-mana-and-final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-to-xbox">Square Enix games are now available Xbox consoles</a>, including the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Available as a bundle or individually, the Final Fantasy I – VI Pixel Remaster series was first released through 2021 and 2022 for PC and mobile, retaining the graphics of the original releases but bringing some solid enhancements and quality of life improvements along the way – though it’s also fair to say that not everything was perfected, such as <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11522-how-to-fix-that-awful-font-in-the-final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-games-on-pc">an odd font choice</a>. They then arrived for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch in 2023, and it’s great to have them on Xbox in 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Legend of Mana | Xbox Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y8CKJYTD-XY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The same can be said of having more of the Mana series on Xbox, as well. Legend of Mana is another pixel graphics remaster that brings the 1999 game to modern platforms, while Trials of Mana was giving a full 3D remake treatment in 2020.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Trials of Mana | Xbox Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/noste-L_SoY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/22/trials-of-mana-remake-review/">Trials of Mana remake review</a>, Miguel said, “Trials of Mana is an exciting new step for the Mana series, breathing new, fully 3D life into a SNES classic that was left inaccessible to English fans for decades. The inventive and memorable story of the original game blends perfectly with the flashy new real-time combat system, and while muddy textures and a lack of co-op prove to somewhat sour the experience, this is still a stellar action RPG remake that anyone can get a kick out of.”</p>
<p>Well worth checking out, in other words.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/square-enix-brings-9-of-its-old-rpgs-to-xbox-8-available-today/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As per the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-rumors-intensify-ahead-of-tgs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a>, Square Enix has indeed announced some new Xbox ports during the Tokyo Game Show 2024 broadcast. However, they're all for old games. Anyway, nearly all of them are available today on Xbox, and some are included with the Game Pass subscription.</p>
<p>To start with, Square Enix has ported the so-called <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-series-sales-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters</a>, which include all mainline games from the first installment to the sixth. Here's an overview of some of the improvements in these remasters:</p>
<p><em>New pixel art optimized for HD displays, rearranged soundtracks, and several quality-of-life features, including multiple font options, the ability to switch back to the old soundtracks, the ability to boost experience gains for faster leveling, turn off random enemy encounters, and even auto-battle.</em></p>
<p>Trials of Mana and Legend of Mana are also out today on Xbox and included with Game Pass. Trials of Mana launched nearly four and a half years ago, with the remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/trials-of-mana-from-snes-to-switch-this-sword-still-shines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earning an 8.5/10 score on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>Even if you already know the story beats by heart and can recite the optimal path to beat all eight Benevodons by heart, Trials of Mana still feels refreshing enough to be considered a brand new game. If you've already paid off your Nook loans and are itching for a new single player RPG to enjoy at home, Trials of Mana is a modern classic worth considering.</em></p>
<p>Legend of Mana is a remaster of the 1999 game that originally launched on the first PlayStation console. Lastly, Square Enix confirmed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-gamescom-hands-on-pixel-excellence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Quest III HD-2D REMAKE</a> will launch on Xbox Series S|X on November 14 in addition to the previously announced platforms.</p>
<p>However, it's hard not to be disappointed with today's news. Not only did Square Enix not announce Final Fantasy XVI, they didn't even port the latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/visions-of-mana-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visions of Mana</a> game. Of course, these ports could still be announced at a later date, but for now, Xbox fans will probably still feel like second-class users.</p>
