<p>Whiskerwood is a game not just about building cities, managing resources, and setting up supply lines. It is a game about rebellion, with the cat overlords demanding more and more from the mice everyday. The choice players will have is whether to continue trying to meet the demands or look to break free of the system.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Turtle Beach Racer Wireless Wheel Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/07/turtle-beach-racer-wireless-wheel-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/turtle-beach-racer-wireless-wheel-review.1346989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Steering wheels have to be one of the most inconvenient of gaming peripherals. There’s cables dragging everywhere, clamps for nearby tables or desk that never quite sit right, or the space needed for a full stand or seating rig, if you’re truly going to commit. Equally, there are few add-ons that make games as gratifying to play. Hurtling around a race track while you feather the real-world throttle, using your paddles to gear change, all the while fighting against the bucking realism of force feedback, can make you feel like a virtual Colin McRae or Max Verstappen. If you’re into racing games, they make themselves more or less essential.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Racer Wireless Racing Wheel Trailer (All-In-One Race Setup)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgYiX1GEsqM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Turtle Beach know all this, and with the Racer Wireless Wheel for Xbox, PC and Android, they’ve tried to make a steering wheel that’s easier to live with. It’s one that’s designed to slot into your gaming life – and your living room – with a practised ease, parallel parking its way into your heart. Largely, they’ve achieved that.</p>


<p>The first thing you’ll think when you grab it out of the box, is just how good it feels. This is a premium-feeling wheel, despite coming in at £139.99/$179.99. It is largely made from a combination of matte and gloss black plastic, with some rubberised grip sections on the left and right of the wheel, but it’s solid, clean-feeling plastic, centred by a bright yellow cut-out at the top of the wheel, to provide a modicum of colour and pizazz.</p>


<p>While most wheels immediately have you looking for the nearest desk or table edge, the Racer Wireless Wheel gives you more options, starting with some metallic lap tray inserts. These slide into place at the bottom of the wheel, and you lock them with the same rotating mechanisms on the top of the device that you use for the deck clamps. The underside of the curved metal has rubberised grips, and once you’ve got it set in place on your lap, it mostly stays where you want it to be, thanks in part to the grips and thanks in part to the pleasing amount of weight in the main body.</p>
<p>The weight plays a role in making the Racer Wireless feel like a premium product, but it certainly helps it to behave more like a traditional wheel, even when it’s not attached to anything. Thankfully, you can lock it into place in a table with the simple clamps, and things feel exactly as you’d hope they would with it secured in place.</p>
<p>Serious racers will then ask, where are the pedals? The answer is, there aren’t any, with the Racer Wireless wheel dealing with accelerating and braking by mapping it onto some analogue paddles. You’ll notice that this completely does away with manual gear shifts, but it’s best to remember just who this wheel is aimed at: casual racers who want to feel more connected to their racing games. For that, it does a great job, injecting fun and a dose of realism in equal measure.</p>

<p>The lack of pedals makes the setup that much more streamlined and simple to use as well, and it makes the Racer Wireless a unique option. There’s an accessibility angle here as well, where this control set up makes it more suitable for games with &nbsp;a disability or injury that would make pedals difficult or impossible to use.</p>
<p>Across the face of the wheel, you’ll find all of the central inputs you need, and they feel solid and well-made – particularly the D-pad. I had no problem cruising through menus and making changes to the options in Forza Horizon 5, and other than the occasional moment where you might lose the touch memory of where some of them are, like the dinky shoulder buttons, they do exactly what you need them to do.</p>
<p>There are two customisable function buttons on the left side of the wheel, which can replicate any of the other main inputs, as well as a multifunction button that opens up the Racer Wireless’ other abilities, particularly its audio controls via the 3.5mm socket. You’re getting a full suite of Turtle Beach audio options, including four EQ’s and then various adjustments to mic monitoring and the like, though you’ll need the app to get to all of them.</p>

<p>You can make a bevy of adjustments to the wheel’s performance via the Turtle Beach Control Center 2 app – available for both Xbox and PC – from updating the firmware for both your wheel and the wireless dongle, to digging into the nitty-gritty of the wheel’s setup. I made the change from 360-degree rotation to 180-degree here, and it made a huge difference to my interactions with the wheel, as it felt so much less cumbersome to turn when not attached to a desk.</p>
<p>You can also alter the input levels for both the left and right paddles, and the wheel itself, adjusting deadzones for all three, as well as choosing between standard, precision and fast response times. I found that Fast suited me well enough, and made the Racer Wireless feel massively responsive, if a bit twitchy at times. It’s great to have that level of granularity though, in something that is more or less aimed at the more casual racer.</p>
<p>In keeping with the more casual, no-frills approach, there’s no force feedback or vibration, but you might not miss it once you start hammering around the track. Without those features, the Racer Wireless is capable of up to 30 hours of battery life, and that played out in our testing. In fact, it also holds onto its charge remarkably well too, and after returning from a week’s holiday, it had lost just a couple of percent.</p>

<p>The clear thing that was apparent from my time with the Racer Wireless wheel, was just how much fun I was having. It isn’t a one-to-one recreation of driving – far from it – but it does make racing games like Forza Horizon 5 come alive when you’re comparing it to a controller. It’s straightforward, and nearly as easy to pick up and play with as a regular controller. While I did once lose the 2.4Ghz dongle, there’s a handy slot in the base to keep it in when not in use, and you can always opt to go wired instead.</p>
<p>There was the occasional niggle. The selector switch at the side gives you two Xbox options, one for a wheel, and one for a controller where there’s no steering wheel option, but in F1 2025, it wouldn’t recognise either for driving the car. There is a sturdy list of supported games for both Xbox and PC, but F1 2025 isn’t currently listed, despite the previous two entries being there. Here’s hoping that more games are added in the near future.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Arc Raiders Selling $10 Chicken Helmets Reminds Players, Yup, It’s A Live Service Game Alright]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-10-chicken-helmet-paid-cosmetic-item-skins-pricey-expensive-2000642065</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-selling-10-chicken-helmets-reminds-players-yup-it%E2%80%99s-a-live-service-game-alright.1346977/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Online PvPvE survival extraction shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174"><em>Arc Raiders</em> is very good</a>. But since launching last month, players have started to grow frustrated with the paid multiplayer game’s pricey cosmetics. And a silly helmet for a chicken is perhaps the best example of how paid skins and cosmetics can go oh so wrong, even in otherwise great games.</p> <p>On November 6, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oq8xpx/charging_10_for_a_chicken_helmet_that_you_only/">a post about a new cosmetic item for a chicken exploded in popularity on the <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ subreddit</a>. In the game, each player has a chicken named <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Scrappy">Scrappy</a> who periodically provides them with random resources between matches. This chicken can only be seen in one menu of <em>Arc Raiders</em>, and yet, developer Embark has already created at least two different paid cosmetic looks for Scrappy. The newest chicken skin for sale is an old-fashioned diving helmet. This helmet alone costs 700 Raider Tokens, which translates to about $7, though due to the way the currency is sold in bundles, you’ll have to spend $10 to get that many tokens. The post about the helmet reached over 7k upvotes by Friday.</p>

   <p>Reaction to the helmet is a bit all over the place. Some players think it’s very dumb, but don’t mind because it doesn’t affect the game. Others feel like Embark is being greedy for charging so much for something that players will rarely see. There’s also a lot of confusion over why the cosmetics in <em>Arc Raiders</em> are so expensive. Keep in mind this isn’t a free-to-play game like <em>Fortnite</em>. To play <em>Arc Raiders</em>, you gotta spend $40. Some players assumed the fact that it’s a game you buy would shield it from free-to-play cosmetic guff, but this chicken helmet has made it clear that won’t be the case.</p>

 <p>“I understand this is a live service game, being supported for 10 years. But this is a bit ridiculous,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oq8xpx/comment/nnhcsdy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said one user.</a> “Considering half the skins aren’t even a different base model and are priced half the cost of the damn game. It’s okay to speak up about these things, because ultimately greed destroys companies — even if just silly cosmetics.”</p>

   <p>That’s the other problem with this new chicken helmet. While it can be bought separately, it is also included in a cosmetic bundle that features an outfit for your in-game character. However, a lot of players noticed that this “new” skin looks nearly identical to a previously sold cosmetic outfit. This has led to some players claiming that Embark has done a mere palette swap and is charging players roughly $15 for the privilege of buying a similar skin all over again.</p> <p>I doubt these pricey and somewhat ugly skins and items will sink<em> Arc Raiders</em> anytime soon. The game is one of the most-played titles on Steam right now and shows no sign of slowing down. But these expensive cosmetics are a reminder that, somehow, <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">we are truly in an era where a $15 to $20 skin is not just common</a>, but something most players seem to ignore or even accept. Just a few of these skins add up to the total price of <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which is wild. But if people are buying them… well.</p>

              <p>Almost nobody buys $4,000 laptops. They’re amazing on paper, sure, but they’re also out of reach for most people. That’s why <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5391/">when Dell’s Inspiron 16 laptop (1TB SSD, 32GB DDR5 RAM) suddenly drops to $999 from its regular $3,999 price</a>, it makes noise. You’re getting a powerful machine at a quarter of its usual price which is why this deal (freshly posted on Amazon for Black Friday) isn’t likely to last long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5391/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Serious Laptop for Real Work and Play</h2>
<p>This laptop isn’t a lightweight in any sense other than how easy it is to carry: It’s designed to <strong>crush productivity tasks</strong> while staying flexible enough for entertainment, content creation or business use. At its core, you’ll find <strong>Intel’s new Core 7 150U processor</strong> which runs up to 5.4GHz with 10 cores and 12 threads. That’s a lot of power for something you can carry around all day, and you can feel it in how it handles demanding workloads or 4K streaming with zero slowdown. Paired with integrated Intel graphics, it provides a smooth experience without draining your battery too fast.</p>



<p>Dell gave this model the specs to back up that performance promise: You get <strong>32GB of high-speed DDR5 RAM</strong> to keep things running smoothly like editing video, compiling data, and jumping on a video call-all at the same time. Plus,<strong> 1TB of lightning-fast SSD storage</strong> means your laptop boots instantly, and apps open in seconds. There’s no noise, no lag, and minimal heat.</p>
<p>For one, the design itself looks and feels premium. The <strong>screen is a 16-inch touchscreen with Full HD+ resolution</strong>, supported by IPS and WVA technology, meaning users will get more vivid colors and wider viewing angles ideal for either presentation work or creative sketching. With 300 nits of brightness and anti-glare protection, you can confidently work in bright cafes or by a window without any reflections getting in the way.</p>



<p>Connectivity is another area where this laptop doesn’t compromise. It comes with all the right modern ports — USB-C, HDMI, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.3 — which means pairing devices or hooking up monitors is fast and painless. The HD webcam and noise-canceling microphones make every virtual call sharper and more professional, while the backlit keyboard keeps late-night typing sessions comfortable.</p>
<p>For its class, battery life holds up solidly enough that getting through a full workday or cross-country flight without scrambling for an outlet is quite achievable. It comes with <strong>Windows 11 Pro installed by default</strong> and keeps the system stable and secure-a nice touch for those who rely on their machine daily for professional use.</p>
<p>It isn’t shy about discounts, though: Amazon has now dropped this Dell Laptop to an all-time low of $999 for Black Friday, a full 75% off its usual price. Black Friday deals this deep don’t stay live for long and this one might vanish as quickly as it appeared.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/echo-show-5-is-back-to-its-black-friday-record-low-amazons-smart-display-now-costs-pennies-2000642078</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/echo-show-5-is-back-to-its-black-friday-record-low-amazon%E2%80%99s-smart-display-now-costs-pennies.1346971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s something addictive about smart displays once you start using one: You can check the weather, set alarms, play your favorite playlists, video call friends or peek into your connected cameras-all with a quick voice command. The Amazon Echo Show 5 nails that balance between screen and speaker and makes it one of the easiest smart home upgrades you can get. Now<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5390/"> it’s dropped to a record low of $59, down from its regular $89 price</a> which makes jumping into the Alexa ecosystem even more tempting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5390/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Than a Smart Display</h2>
<p>Amazon designed the Echo Show 5 to do everything your old smart speaker can’t: The <strong>5.5-inch display may sound small, but it’s key to transforming how you interact with your assistant</strong>. You can glance at the time, watch your favorite Prime Video series, follow step-by-step recipes or see who’s at the door when paired with compatible cameras. It’s like having an assistant that also gives you context-perfect for those times when hearing isn’t enough.</p>



<p>This generation takes the experience up a notch: The sound is clearer, with twice the bass of older models, meaning your playlists and podcasts actually sound like something worth playing out loud. You can stream directly from Amazon Music, Spotify or any connected app with a nice balance between rich low tones and crisp vocals. And when it’s sitting idle, the screen doubles as a digital photo frame. You can set it to display your favorite pictures or even invite family members to share their own directly to your device. It includes <strong>unlimited cloud photo storage for Prime members</strong>, so it’s as much of a family hub as it is a gadget.</p>



<p>Then there is the way it doubles as your <strong>smart home control center</strong>: You can dim the lights, turn up the thermostat, or get a glimpse of what’s happening on the security feed-all with your voice or a tap. If you have compatible Ring doorbells and cameras, you’ll be able to view real-time footage right from the display. Alexa routines can automate your mornings, too: wake up to gradual light, a daily news briefing, and a playlist softly fading in before breakfast.</p>
<p>With Amazon, privacy remains front and center here. The Echo Show 5 incorporates several layers of protection such as a physical camera shutter and a microphone/camera off button. It is up to you when it’s listening and when it is not. The 2MP camera keeps you in touch through video calls using the Alexa app or another Echo device. It serves as a quick way to check up on family or roommates without opening up your phone.</p>

                <p>Following in Florida's footsteps, Texas's attorney general has sued Roblox Corporation, the developer of the multiplayer online game creation platform <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a>, for "flagrantly ignoring" laws and exposing children to "sexually explicit content, exploitation, and grooming."</p><p>Ken Paxton, a Republican who's been Texas's AG since 2015 and is making a bid for U.S. Senate, <a href="https://x.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/1986529630124126245" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced the lawsuit in an X post</a> on November 6. In the documentation, his office claimed Roblox Corporation was "flagrantly ignoring state and federal laws while deceiving parents about the dangers of its platform."

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>miHoYo, the developer behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a>, and other gacha titles, has released a teaser video for its upcoming Unreal Engine 5 project. It's a fantasy MMO which, you guessed it, makes use of AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mihoyo-is-working-on-new-open-world-game-mmo-pvp-ue5-ai.1346665/">Spotted by users on ResetEra</a>, miHoYo's hiring department posted a video and additional project information on Xiaohongshu (a Chinese social media platform). The post lists out a number of key quirks of the game, including MMO, PvP, Open World, "Artificial Intelligence Stimulated Eco System", All-Terrain Battle AI, and "Intellectual NPC".</p>
<p>It's worth noting that these are translated, and therefore the exact wording must be taken with a grain of salt. However, it does provide some manner of insight into one of miHoYo's big upcoming projects. First of all, one immediate thing one can see from the post is that the aesthetic of this mysterious new project isn't miHoYo's typical anime style. Instead, you see the obvious marks of Unreal Engine 5.</p>

</figure>
<p>What might raise an eye brow is the mention of AI there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-studio-uses-ai-technology-to-smoothen-development-process">which miHoYo has used in the past in Zenless Zone Zero to "smoothen" the development process</a>. The company has previous drawn a line in the sand when it comes to AI art and voicework, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players">claimed it had AI voice protections in its contracts</a> when a contract dispute led to the recasting of SAGAFTRA members.</p><p>This post appears to indicate a continuation of miHoYo's approach to AI in game development, though obviously the full extent of its use remains unclear. We don't know the name of the game, when it'll be coming out, what the gameplay will actually look like... It's a big question mark over the company's line-up at the moment.</p>
<p>What isn't a mystery are some of the other games miHoYo is working on, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/honkai-nexus-anima-revealed-a-spin-off-creature-collector-from-genshin-impact-studio">including a monster-collection game called Honkai: Nexus Anima</a>. For now, we'll have to just hunker down and wait for more information as to this new project.</p>

		<p>OwlCat Games has released the main theme song for The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, with the theme being composed by Paweł Perepelic. It has quite the epic sound to it and does capture some of that The Expanse feeling, delving into something that seems hopeful and inspiring but ending slightly on a mournful note. Have a listen for yourselves.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Expanse: Osiris Reborn — Main Theme" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9PqNeoff3NI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here’s a little bit of blurb to establish the setting of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn:</p>
<p><em>You play as a Pinkwater Security mercenary whose brief shore leave on the asteroid Eros spirals out of control. Trapped in a deadly lockdown and drawn into a solar system-wide conspiracy far beyond your control, you’ll have to adapt, survive, taking command of the most advanced ship in the whole of the solar system. Gather a crew and find your own path through the web of lies to leave your mark on the solar system.</em></p>
<p>This puts the game’s setting right at the start of the sci-fi series’ timeline, running in parallel to the adventures of the crew of the Rocinante during the first and second seasons of the TV series. You can choose to be from Earth and Mars, or be a Belter. You will need to use different skills in combat and outside of it. In combat, the action will be that of a third person shooter but with tactical elements as you will need to use tactical items and the skills of your crew to get the upper hand. The crew will be incredibly important to the story and the way events can unfold. Each person you pick up has their own goals, motivations, and history to unpick, which you may discover while living together on the ship, which is called Gemini. Uncovering the layers of your crew and the secrets of the wider Expanse universe, and by doing so the paths that open to you can and will change.</p>

<p>There are four versions of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn including the standard edition, the deluxe edition, the Miller’s Pack, and the Collector’s edition. What is worth noting is that the game will not be getting a physical release. The standard edition is priced at $49.99 which includes the game, an early adopter item and a Discord role.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deluxe Edition ($59.99) – </strong>All standard edition items plus name in credits, Miller’s OPA Heavy armour, and UN Spec Ops assault rifle.</li>
<li><strong>Miller’s Pack ($79.99)&nbsp;</strong>– All standard and deluxe items plus digital Artbook, digital soundtrack, Hall of Fame, Miller’s Casual outfit, Miller’s revolver, exclusive beta access.</li>
<li><strong>Collector’s Edition ($249.99)&nbsp;</strong>– All the items from the other editions plus a physical Gemini ship model, a physical Gemini medallion, printed artbook, three embroidered patches, and stickers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn will be released for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis 5</a> has its first public patch, which encompasses over 350 fixes. Among the bigger things it smacks with the heal-o-spanner (an actual game development tool, traditionally carved from the base of a Taito arcade machine) is the Steams achievements system, which will no longer shower players in plaudits they haven't earned. On the plus side, you'll now earn achievements even if you activate the "allow ahistorical" game rule.
</p>
<p>I grasp at those relatively intelligible nuggets like somebody lunging for the doorhandle in a room full of bees. I do not play Europa Universalis 5. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/europa-universalis-5-review">That review gig</a> went to Brendy, who was anointed many months ago as our human sacrifice to this particular god of grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>. Brendy is now more number table than man. He bleeds - erm, well, I can't even say what he bleeds, because I'm not hip to the Europa Universalis terminology. As such, I'm a poor choice to write up the game's first set of patch notes, but what can you do. Here are the apparent highlights, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3450310/view/589535332141105331?l=english">as detailed on Steam</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Fixed more than 350 bugs (not counting Translation-related number of errors fixed, which you can find in its own section)</li>
<li>Fixed the scope type for Achievement triggers, which was triggering several errors, along with many other minor fixes to them; also, activating the "Allow Ahistorical" game rule now doesn't block getting Achievements</li>
<li>Fixed several CTDs</li>
<li>Made several fixes to Personal Unions, especially to AI Union Law voting, making it less spammy</li>
<li>Fixed an issue making the Timurid spawning player event to not work properly</li>
<li>The 'Claim French Throne' peace treaty during the 'Hundred Years' War' situation no longer requires you to be senior in a PU already</li>
<li>The events that convert Hussite pops for Bohemia during the 'Hussite Wars' situation are now converting much more aggressively and impactfully</li>
<li>Japanese clans will now properly lose their clan's foreign buildings when being landed after the 'Sengoku Jidai' situation starts</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The rest of the notes span all aspects of the game, from whether or not the Earldom of Ulster is a Vassal of the Pale, through the addition of province capital map markers, to ensuring that there are "proper reasons for countries to join Autocephalous Patriarchates". WTF is an Autocephalous Patriarchate. Some kind of octopus grandad? Can you conquer things with it? If you're reading these notes, you've likely played the game and I look forward to your generous explanations.
</p><p>Europa Universalis 5 seems to be going down well among players. It and Paradox stablemates <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> and Hearts Of Iron IV are currently congregating in the high 20s on Steam's 100 Most Played. They've got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> sandwiched between them like a strip of horse jerky. If you're keen on EU5, but are having trouble running it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-your-pc-is-too-puny-to-launch-europa-universalis-5-theres-a-secret-very-low-graphics-preset">this workaround for lower-spec graphics cards might be of interest</a>.</p>

              <p>We’re all now used to every big-name game coming out in five differently priced versions, each containing more in-game stuff than the last, but no matter which you choose you will still be buying the <em>same game</em>. That’s never been the case for the mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>series, starting even with its very first English-language release in 1998 with <em>Pokémon Red</em> and <em>Pokémon Blue</em>, each version subtly (but to fans, crucially) different. But have you ever stopped to wonder why? The reason is wonderfully silly.</p> <p>Creating two versions of what mostly boils down to the same game is certainly not an obvious choice. It introduces a huge amount of confusion to an unaware audience, not sure which is the most recent game or whether they’re making a mistake by buying one over the other. To those familiar with the series, it’s a huge feature and selling point, and deciding which version of the game you’re going to buy and why is a big part of the experience. But given the fear of alienation and confusion, it’s hard to imagine most marketing executives would ever allow such a conceit to survive its first boardroom whisper. Yet one of the best-selling game series of all time suggests it can work out OK.</p>

 <p>But why? Well, as&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/nintendo-legend-shigeru-miyamoto-says-one-of-the-reasons-pokemon-red-and-green-were-made-was-because-creator-satoshi-tajiri-joked-mario-couldnt-be-surpassed-unless-fans-were-sold-2-copies-of-a-game/">GamesRadar</a>&nbsp;</em>spotted via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1986266577789133097">Genki_JPN’s X account</a>, in a recent shareholders meeting Nintendo director Shigeru Miyamoto was asked if anything could ever outsell <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. This caused him to recall a conversation with the creator of the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> franchise, Satoshi Tajiri, about how the monster-catching games could ever outdo the success of the <em>Mario&nbsp;</em>games. Via machine translation, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2.pdf">Miyamoto told investors</a>, “A long time ago, Tajiri-san, the director of <em>Pokémon</em>, joked with me that if you want to surpass Nintendo’s <em>Mario </em>you’ll have to sell two copies of the game to each customer.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">In a shareholders meeting Shigeru Miyamoto shared a story about Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri and one of the reasons Pokémon Red and Green came to be!</p> <p>"A long time ago, Tajiri-san, the director of Pokémon, before creating the first Pokémon game, once joked to me ‘If you want to… <a href="https://t.co/YTS4AvAbu9">pic.twitter.com/YTS4AvAbu9</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1986266577789133097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Miyamoto continued, “This was one of the reasons why <em>Pokémon Red&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Green</em> were created.”</p> <p>(In Japan, the games were originally released in 1996 as&nbsp;<em>Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Green</em>, with a&nbsp;<em>Blue</em> later the same year.)</p> <p>For what it’s worth, it’s rarely actually worked! As phenomenally successful as the <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>games have been,&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> tends to beat them on each system. The two wins for <em>Pokémon</em><em>&nbsp;</em>in this match-up have been <em>Pokémon Gold </em>and&nbsp;<em>Silver</em> on Game Boy Color and <em>Pokémon</em> Ruby and&nbsp;<em>Sapphire</em> on Game Boy Advance. On the DS, 3DS and Switch, <em>Mario</em> has taken the lead each time. (There were no mainline <em>Pokémon</em> games on Wii or Wii U.) But it certainly hasn’t hurt, either, with&nbsp;<em>Sword</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shield</em> selling 26.84 million copies, and&nbsp;<em>Scarlet </em>and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em> hitting 27.15 million. It’s just that&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8</em> has rather rudely sold 69.56 million, <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. <em>Ultimate</em> 36.93 million, and&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> 29.84 million.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sony is filing a lawsuit against an eBay seller who it accuses of selling fake PlayStation 5 accessories, such as carrying cases for the console and its various peripherals, claiming that it has made unauthorized use of the company’s trademarks.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-lawsuit-ebay-counterfeit-playstation-5-accessories-2-million/"><i><span>The Game Post</span></i></a><span> lays out, Sony’s lawsuit against eBay user “zaocuand-002” has the company seeking potentially millions of dollars in damages as it continues to target counterfeit PlayStation products being sold around the internet. eBay is but one of several platforms Sony has been combing through in its search for fake PS5 accessories, as it has also gotten into legal scraps with sellers on Amazon, Walmart, and other sites.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sony has previously targeted “dozens” of anonymous marketplace sellers in its lawsuits targeting counterfeit PS5 accessories, but this latest eBay lawsuit specifically homes in on the zaocuand-002 account which has, according to </span><i><span>The Game Post</span></i><span>, sold over 9000 items on the platform. A PS5 carrying case is specifically mentioned in the lawsuit, but this listing has seemingly been taken down after the lawsuit was filed in October. Sony’s suit demands that platforms such as eBay “shall disable and cease displaying any advertisements used by or associated with Defendant in connection with the sale of counterfeit and infringing goods using the PlayStation Trademarks</span><span>.” </span><span>Alternatively, the company requests up to $2 million “for each and every use” of the counterfeit trademark, as well as compensation for its legal fees.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Defendant created an e-commerce store operating under at least the Seller Alias that is advertising, offering for sale, and selling Unauthorized Products to unknowing consumers,” the complaint reads. “Defendant attempts to avoid and mitigate liability by operating under at least the Seller Alias to conceal both its identity and the full scope and interworking of its counterfeiting operation.”</span></p> <p><span>Sony’s been getting pretty lawsuit-happy these past few months, as the PlayStation company is also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-clone-knock-off-light-1851787163"><span>suing Tencent over a pretty blatant </span><i><span>Horizon Zero Dawn </span></i><span>knock-off</span></a><span>. However, the Chinese publisher claims Sony is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858"><span>trying to monopolize open-world genre conventions</span></a><span> with the suit.</span></p>

                <p>Nintendo enjoyed enormous success in the film department with The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which earned more than $1.3 billion worldwide. Now, Nintendo is gearing up to release The Super Mario Galaxy Movie in 2026, with a live-action The Legend of Zelda film to follow in 2027. More films based on Nintendo properties <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-teases-more-movies-to-come/1100-6535943/" data-ref-id="1100-6535943">could come next</a>, and Nintendo has now said moviemaking is something Nintendo wants to be "even more actively involved in going forward."</p><p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said in <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earnings report</a> that Nintendo is keen to pursue moviemaking because it believes films can become long-term assets for the company as it looks to the future beyond games.</p><p>Nintendo has an internal unit called Nintendo Pictures, which is conducting experiments in the video space, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-second-weird-baby-short-introduces-pikmin-to-the-mix/1100-6535303/" data-ref-id="1100-6535303">recent Pikmin shorts</a>. But Nintendo Pictures won't be the team that handles future feature films--that work is being done by established Hollywood studios like Universal and Illumination.</p><p>"For movies, there is an established business framework where the distribution companies manage movies. The past indicates that following that established structure and creating content with care and attention leads to profits," Furukawa said.</p><p>Hollywood is an established machine with a "proven business model," Furukawa said, but Nintendo Pictures is a new unit trying to "take on various challenges in areas that have not yet clearly taken shape."</p><p>"The 'Close to You' Pikmin-themed short video that was released recently was created as an experiment based on this concept. We would like to continue providing this kind of content that generates enthusiasm around the world, and develop it into an important asset for Nintendo," Furukawa said.</p><p>No more Nintendo movies beyond the live-action Zelda film have been announced, but there have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-movie-team-returns-for-a-donkey-kong-film-listing-reveals/1100-6533131/" data-ref-id="1100-6533131">rumors of a Donkey Kong film.</a></p><p>Nintendo also recently discussed its general philosophy for filmmaking recently. The company said it doesn't simply license its properties to film studios. Instead, Nintendo is involved in the financing and "deeply involved" in production. Shigeru Miyamoto, for example, produced The Super Mario Bros. Movie and will be a producer on The Super Mario Galaxy Movie and the Zelda movie, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-zelda-movie-from-sony-and-nintendo-is-now-filming-apparently/1100-6535988/" data-ref-id="1100-6535988">just began filming in New Zealand. </a></p><p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie made a gargantuan $1.36 billon at the global box office, ranking as the No. 2 highest-grossing movie of 2023, only behind Barbie ($1.44 billion). The Super Mario Bros. Movie ranks as the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/ww_top_lifetime_gross/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 18 highest-grossing movie in history.</a></p><p>"It was enjoyed by a vast audience, including those who had experienced Mario games, those less familiar with gaming, and people of all ages, from children to seniors," Nintendo said. "What has pleased us most about this film, even more than the measurable results, are the warm comments we received from so many people."</p><p>Nintendo's gaming business is booming at the moment, thanks in part to the recent launch of the Switch 2. It's sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/" data-ref-id="1100-6535903">more than 10 million units thus far</a>, becoming Nintendo's fastest-selling platform ever. Nintendo is enthusiastic about its sales potential this holiday, recently boosting the console's sales projections from 15 million to 19 million for the fiscal year that ends in March 2026.</p>

                <p>Whenever a new mainline Pokemon game rolls around, you can expect not one but two versions of the same game to hit the shelves. That's a sales decision that was made with a primary goal in mind--to give Nintendo's iconic plumber Mario a run for his money.</p><p>During an investor Q&amp;A this week, Nintendo veteran Shigeru Miyamoto spoke about a meeting he once had with Pokemon creator Satoshi Tajiri, who joked that the only way to beat Mario Kart in sales was to sell two copies of Pokemon to each consumer. Miyamoto says this was one of the reasons why the first Pokemon game was released as Pokemon Blue and Pokemon Red, which is a tradition that was continued since then with most mainline games.</p><p>"That is one reason why Pokémon started with both Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue," <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2e.pdf" rel="nofollow ">Miyamoto said</a>. "I believe that new ideas are born precisely because of people like him, who challenge themselves to surpass what came before."</p><p>These Pokemon games typically offer exclusive Pokemon for players to collect, and as of Pokemon Silver and Gold, two distinct legendary Pokemon that can only be found in their respective games. Of course, trading Pokemon is a big part of the experience as well, and recent games have made the process of completing your Pokedex easier thanks to advances in online connectivity. There are still fans who are completionists at heart and will buy both versions of a Pokemon game, with Nintendo even selling two-packs to cater to player demand.</p><p>This year marked the 30th anniversary of Pokemon, and while a new Generation 10 game wasn't released, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet did get a Switch 2 upgrade</a> that greatly improved the game on the new Nintendo hardware. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-legends-z-a-review-a-battle-revolution/1900-6418423/" data-ref-id="1900-6418423">Pokemon Legends: Z-A was also released</a>, and it saw players return to Lumiose City for the first time since Pokemon X and Y on the Nintendo 3DS.</p><p>In the business department, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/">Nintendo has reported that it has sold 10.36 million Switch 2</a> units as of September 30, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html" rel="nofollow ">Mario Kart World has sold 9.57 million units so far</a>. The company also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-vast-majority-of-nintendo-switch-2-owners-transitioned-from-switch-1/1100-6535947/">84% of Switch 2 owners previously owned a Switch 1 console</a>, and while it'll still sell the older console, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-switch-will-not-be-removed-from-sale-but-nintendo-will-focus-on-switch-2-going-forward/1100-6535968/">Nintendo will focus on the Switch 2 going forward</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed</a>, which means we'll have to keep going back to Grand Theft Auto V to get a fix for Rockstar's best-selling franchise. If you're one of the handful of people who have yet to play one of the highest-selling video games ever, it looks like you'll get another chance, at least on PlayStation. According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a>, Grand Theft Auto V is heading back to the PS Plus Extra games catalogue.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun and Dealabs have a strong track record when it comes to reporting PS Plus games, whether it's one of, or sometimes all three, of the three games offered for the Essential tier, or one of the games entering the catalogue at the Extra tier.</p>



<p>This report pertains to the latter, as we've already had the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-november-stray-ea-sports-wrc-24-totally-accurate-battle-simulator/">three games for November at the PS Plus Essential tier</a> revealed (<a href="https://wccftech.com/stray-playstation-plus-november-2025/">one of which Billbil-kun also correctly reported ahead of the official announcement</a>).</p>



<p>Billbil-kun also predicts that this coming Wednesday, November 12, we'll get the official reveal of what games are coming to the PS Plus Extra catalogue, which will include Grand Theft Auto V.</p>



<p>With GTA VI delayed, it lines up perfectly that GTA V would re-enter the PS Plus Extra catalogue, just to make it as accessible as possible for people wanting to remain immersed in the world of Grand Theft Auto on their consoles. It's already available on Xbox Game Pass, so having it back on PlayStation's subscription service just rounds out where players can find it.</p>



<p>Regarding the additional delay for GTA VI, Take-Two boss <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-help-rockstar-exceed-expectations-take-two-ceo-never-regretted-delay/">Strauss Zelnick says the company has <em>"never regretted</em>" delaying a game</a>. At least it looks like we'll get another way to play GTA V in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar has announced that the hotly-anticipated <i>Grand Theft Auto 6&nbsp;</i>has been delayed once again, with the game now due to launch in November next year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak3ak31a49a221/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-set-to-launch-november-19-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official&nbsp;Rockstar website, the studio says that the open-world game, which was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">due to arrive in May 2026</a>, will now launch on November 19th that same year. This represents the game's second delay; it was initially set for a 2025 launch before being pushed back to May.</p>

<p>The studio says it's sorry for "adding additional time" to what it knows "has been a long wait", but that the extra months of development will allow the team to "finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-again-characters.jpg?itok=vmfIBJMz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-again-characters.jpg?itok=DhUko8n1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Grand Theft Auto 6&nbsp;</em>has been delayed again.</figcaption></figure><p><em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>is likely to become one of the industry's most successful releases when it does eventually arrive; it's such a massive project, in fact, that publishers and developers are reportedly <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/multiple-publishers-ready-to-delay-their-games-to-avoid-gta6-onslaught-its-claimed/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">considering</a> moving their own games' release dates ahead of time to avoid clashing with the game.</p>

<p>Their consternation makes a lot of sense; as of February last year,&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-v-has-sold-over-195-million-units-red-dead-redemption-2-at-61-million" rel="nofollow">sold a mammoth 195 million units</a>, and since it's been almost two years since that figure, it's likely that the game's sales have only increased since then.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>'s delay also comes just a few days after developer Rockstar was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6" rel="nofollow">accused of union-busting</a> following the dismissal of a number of employees who were reportedly involved in union activity.</p>

<p>Rockstar subsequently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">claimed</a> that the employees in question were leaking information about&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, with a spokesperson saying that the employees were sharing company information in a forum that also included non-workers.</p>




<p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6&nbsp;</em>is now set to launch for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/grand-theft-auto-vi/9NL3WWNZLZZN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on November 19th, 2026. No PC version has yet been confirmed by Rockstar.</p>

<p>So why is Arc Raiders so popular, when other extraction shooters haven't reached such highs in terms of sales or player count? Well, <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/arc-raiders-has-sold-25m-copies">according to the blog posted by Elliott</a>: "ARC Raiders is great because it focuses on community - NOT because it's an extraction shooter".</p><p>They also noted that there's a crossover between other co-operative games, and that the focus of community in Arc Raiders may have made all the difference. Elliott wrote: "Our crossover estimates show that about half of ARC Raiders players on Steam have also played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, respectively. And over 40% have played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/repo">R.E.P.O</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/valheim">Valheim</a>, PEAK, and Dead by Daylight."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-players-are-waging-war-over-a-controversial-topic-are-pvpers-ruining-the-experience">Arc Raiders are actually waging a war of words between themselves over the collaborative nature of the game</a>, with many feeling torn between helping other raiders out and going in for the kill on strangers. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-trials-are-the-perfect-way-to-do-ranked-in-extraction-shooters">While taking on the weekly trials</a>, it's clear to see the frustration from dying after a bountiful run.</p>

            <p>While we are going to have to wait a bit longer for GTA 6 following last night's news that its release has been delayed once more, it sounds like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> will be making its return to PlayStation Plus quite soon.</p>
<p>According to the ever reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766">Dealabs</a>, Rockstar's juggernaut of a video game (<a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766">which has now sold more copies than there are people in Brazil</a>) is going to be available for those PS Plus subscribers on the Extra and Premium tiers in the very near future, with an announcement from Sony expected later this month.</p>
<p>Dealabs said we will hear official word of GTA 5's return on 12th November, with the game then making its PS Plus comeback on 18th November. GTA 5 hasn't been available for those on PS Plus since it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-leaves-playstation-plus-next-month">removed from the service around the middle of last year</a>. As for what else may be coming to PS Plus, Dealabs has no current information. </p>

<p>Looking to the future of the Grand Theft Auto series, GTA 6 is now expected to release on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">19th November, 2026</a> (for now, at least. Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if it gets delayed again).</p>
<p>Per publisher Take-Two, the most recent GTA 6 delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve". It added "Rockstar has our full support of course", and that the Take-Two team is "confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience".</p>

Here's The Chance To Make Your Voice Heard 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/af10206becfb1/what-are-the-100-best-nintendo-games-heres-the-chance-to-make-your-voice-heard-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has been in this business for a <em>long</em> time, so when you're attempting to decide on what the 100 best games released on its consoles and handhelds are, it's little wonder that it's <em>quite</em> the challenge.</p>
<p>However, we've teamed up with our friends over at <a href="https://www.ign.com/">IGN</a> to do just that – and we're in the process of concocting a list of the best games ever released on Nintendo's systems.</p>
<p>You may wonder how this list differs from the one <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/top-100-best-nintendo-games-of-all-time">already on this site</a>, but the remit here is somewhat different; this collaborative ranking will include third-party games that are either Nintendo hardware exclusives or are synonymous with Nintendo consoles.</p>
<p>"IGN and Nintendo Life have come together to build the definitive list of The 100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-100-best-nintendo-games-ever-faceoff">says IGN's Simon Cardy</a>. "We'll be rolling that ranking out from Monday, November 10 to Friday, November 14, revealing 20 picks a day until one game is crowned Number One."</p>
<p>Be sure to check out IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/nintendo-voice-chat">Nintendo Voice Chat</a> for a rundown of the selected games. Who knows? You might even spot a familiar face...</p>
<p>Before the final list is published, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-100-best-nintendo-games-ever-faceoff">IGN is running a face-off campaign</a> that allows you to cast your votes and shape a separate, reader-curated list.</p>
<p>Ahead of the final list going live, why don't you make your voice heard by heading over to IGN and helping to determine the running order for this in a user-generated ranking – you might help get your favourite game to the top of the tree!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Talk to any <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review-in-progress-difficulty-1851782700"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a> fan lately and you’ll find a tarnished husk eager for a reason to jump back into their favorite obsession of 2025. Even after spending hundreds of hours toiling across the same map and fighting the same bosses we’re hungry for more, especially after the game’s new <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hard-mode-deep-night-ranked-2000620376">Deep of Night ranked mode</a> ended up being a dud. Well, we apparently only have to wait a little longer. FromSoftware’s parent company has confirmed the game’s first official paid DLC will arrive by April 2026.</p> <p>That morsel of good news came in Kadokawa Corporation’s <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/190133/00.pdf">latest financial earnings report</a>. In it, the company said the <em>Elden Ring</em> spin-off exceeded sales expectations but fell off steeply in the second quarter. It’s hopeful an expansion can revive the game’s momentum the same way <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> did with the original game.</p>

 <p>“FromSoftware is currently developing <em>Elden Ring Nightreign DLC</em> (planned for release in FY2025), <em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition</em> (planned for release in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2), and <em>The Duskbloods</em> (planned for release in 2026),” Kadokawa Corporation confirmed. Is FromSoftware working on anything else for next year? <a href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-3-remaster-armored-core-6-fromsoftware-1851786550">Previous rumors</a> suggested it’s next game isn’t as far away as some fans might think, with hints that it could be a new <em>Armored Core</em> or a remaster for <em>Dark Souls III</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Nightreign</em> needs a new map</h2> <p>But for <em>Nightreign</em> sickos like myself, the DLC will be more than enough to keep us occupied, at least if it’s on par with the studio’s previous expansions. What does that wishlist include? A new map, for one. I’ve grown quite <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-items-wending-grace-flask-1851782963">fond of Limveld</a> during my time there, but it represents only a small, randomized portion of the original game’s big open world. There are so many other parts that could be adapted into similarly sized, procedurally generated maps.</p>

 <p><em>Nightreign</em> is, first and foremost, a game about logistics and cost-benefit analysis. Much of that decision making has become streamlined and rote as players have become experts in all of the tradeoffs and probabilities underlying the current map. A new one, in addition to a fresh visual palette and new enemies and points of interest to draw upon, would almost feel like a sequel.</p>

 <p>Fans have also been begging for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-renant-summon-necromancy-faith-1851784379">more character classes</a> to try. There are currently eight in the game and most players have settled in on their favorites. Two new classes, especially ones that favor different weapons and abilities than the existing ones, would be another draw. New bosses also seem like a must for any DLC. FromSoftware has its entire Soulsborne back catalog to draw from, and the time it takes not just to learn new encounters but master them is no small investment.</p> <p>That’s especially the <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereign-libra-fissure-1851786568">case for the Nightlords</a> that cap off each run. The game currently has eight. Add four more and their Everdark variants and we’ll essentially have <em>Nightreign 2</em>. But I’ll settle for anything at this point. I just want a reason to send out party invites, round up the crew, and get our asses kicked like it’s launch all over again.</p>

They already faced the prospect of having to wait longer for GTA 6 — back when GTA 6 was planned for release in the fall of this year, some thought the game would come out on PC in 2026. That now looks impossible, and some PC gamers are worried they won’t get to play the game until 2028. Late 2027 feels like a safe bet, but this is Rockstar. It’s hard to predict what the company will do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN last night, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-is-highly-confident-on-new-gta-6-release-date-but-says-when-games-are-released-too-early-bad-things-happen">Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he was "highly confident" that this is the last time GTA 6 will be delayed</a>. “We wanted to give Rockstar the appropriate amount of time to polish the title and make sure it can be the very best it can be," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Previously, GTA 6 was announced for a fall 2025 release, which Zelnick was confident in at the time. The game was later delayed to May of 2026, with Take-Two and Rockstar similarly citing a need for polish. Zelnick sounded confident then, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for launch platforms, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response">last year Zelnick was asked if the lack of a PC version of GTA 6 was set in stone</a>. Here’s Zelnick’s response in full:</p><blockquote>Well, the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement, I guess that could happen too. It doesn’t seem to me that either would be set in stone.</blockquote><blockquote>But Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before, and they will make more announcements in due time. I do believe that the right strategy for our business is to be where the consumer is, and historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, on any platform that makes sense, over time.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That was Zelnick dancing around the inevitable PC version of GTA 6, but he did point to Rockstar’s release strategy for its previous games. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/place-your-bets-will-gta-6-release-on-pc-on-the-same-day-it-does-on-consoles/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fans of Rockstar games</u></a> have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">GTA 6 is delayed again</a>, this time from May to November 2026. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history">Perhaps we should have seen it coming</a>. After all, aren’t all Rockstar games delayed multiple times before they eventually come out and break sales records?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of coverage on the delay already, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-is-highly-confident-on-new-gta-6-release-date-but-says-when-games-are-released-too-early-bad-things-happen">comments from Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick</a>, who told IGN in an interview he was “highly confident” in the new release date (I’m sure he’s said that before?). And, if you need a reminder, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2">a whopping 89 details from GTA 6 Trailer 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how has the internet reacted to the GTA 6 delay? Fans are, as you’d expect, in tatters. And spare a thought for PC gamers, who now face the prospect of having to wait to play GTA 6 in 2027 at the earliest. But video game publishers — some, publicly at least — are having fun with it, while some are expressing concern for any game that might have earmarked a fall 2026 release window. And then there are the memes. Lots of memes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt, which took the opportunity to remind everyone that it once promised no more delays to Cyberpunk 2077, and look how that turned out when its sci-fi action RPG came out in December 2020. What CDPR is saying here is trust in Rockstar to deliver — it’s better to delay the game and ensure it’s great than launch it when it isn’t ready.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/SqC2ZYRK6s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/SqC2ZYRK6s</a> <a href="https://t.co/l5o58PULml" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/l5o58PULml</a></p>— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1986547061886427406?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Hotline Miami and Cult of the Lamb publisher Devolver Digital, meanwhile, continued the bit by continuing to promise (threat?) to release a game on the same day GTA 6 comes out. Now it’s moved whatever game it had in mind to GTA 6’s new release date: November 19, 2026. Devolver won’t — can’t at this point — stop. It even cheekily asked Rockstar if it needed help getting GTA 6 out the door, tweeting: "DO YOU NEED A PUBLISHER TO GET THIS THING BACK ON TRACK? DMs are open. Our work on @BALLxPIT speaks for itself." Those scamps!</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Devolver Digital (@devolverdigital) <a href="https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1986545399910289732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking more seriously, Christofer Sundberg, founder of Liquid Swords and former boss of Just Cause developer Avalanche, <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1986705793048031697" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called the delay</a> “a gravitational shift.” He continued: “When giants move, the ground shakes. That’s not competition. That’s opportunity.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a comment about how publishers will be left scrambling to adjust their own release dates in the wake of GTA 6 moving from May to November. Some may be able to hit May or thereabouts now GTA 6 has moved out of that window. Others already locked into fall 2026 may now be set for crisis talks. Will next year’s Call of Duty be okay, for example? COD usually launches in November, so we're potentially set for a GTA 6 vs Call of Duty showdown in 2026. I know what my money's on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the delay may even impact games set to launch in 2027. John “Bucky” Buckley, Communications Director and Publishing Manager at Palworld developer Pocketpair, <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1986583034326622227" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to X / Twitter</a> to say "expect to see many games (especially AAA ones) swerve to avoid the 2027 awards season," now GTA 6 is set for a November 19 launch, which puts Rockstar's game outside the nominaton window for most game awards in 2026. "Intentional or…?🤔" Bucky wondered.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Microsoft might be the publisher most heavily impacted by this GTA 6 delay.</p><p>Halo Remake, Gears E-Day, Fable, AND Call of Duty 2026 are all almost certainly scheduled for next Fall.
