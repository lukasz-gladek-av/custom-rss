            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642025/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-zelda-wind-waker-f-zero-gx<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Before this morning, I knew I was going to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 but I didn’t know when. After watching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct today</a>, in which a purple block traced the GameCube’s stylized “G” logo, followed by high-res footage from <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker </em>and <em>F-Zero GX </em>and an announcement that they’ll be playable at launch, I realized I’ll be doing my damndest to get it on day one. It was the cherry on top of a stellar presentation that made the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">console’s $449.99 price tag</a> way easier to swallow.</p><p>GameCube games are coming to the Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) subscription’s Classic Game Library feature, which the company is now shortening to “Nintendo Classics.” It lets you play games from the NES, SNES, and Sega Genesis. Like the Game Boy and Nintendo 64 game collections, you’ll need the NSO Expansion Pack for GameCube games. The existing catalog of playable Classic Game Library games is far from complete, but together (and combined with DLC for contemporary Switch games), they make the Expansion Pack well worth it.</p><p>The subscription gets even more enticing on the Switch 2, starting before the console even comes out — Nintendo is prioritizing long-time subscribers (with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">certain caveats</a>) when it sends out Switch 2 preorder invites. The Expansion Pack will also let you play the Switch 2 editions of <em>Zelda </em>games <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and<em> Tears of the Kingdom </em>(provided you own their respective Switch 1 versions). </p><p>But the GameCube games are what I’m most excited about. I’d love for the Wii U’s <em>Wind Waker HD</em> to get a Switch re-release, but the GameCube version is still one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played and looks great in Nintendo’s trailer for it. So does <em>F-Zero GX</em>, a game with such well-executed style and tight control that I would pit it against any futuristic racer today. The Switch 2 is also launching with <em>Soul Calibur II</em>, a game that featured adult Link as a playable character in his <a href="https://youtu.be/Q-25c8Rsobw?t=508">post-<em>Ocarina of Time</em> fighting-people-for-sport era</a>.</p><p>The company flashed a few other re-releases coming down the line, like <em>Super Mario Strikers </em>and <em>Chibi-Robo!, </em>in the latter of which you play a tiny, toothbrush-armed robot tasked with cleaning up a very messy house. It’s way more fun than it sounds, and gives me hope for what Nintendo <em>could</em> announce. There are some excellent, but more obscure gems that never really leapt beyond the GameCube, like the creepy, Lovecraft-inspired <em>Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem </em>and <em>Cubivore, </em>in which you play a small, wild cube trying to bring color back to the world by eating other boxy creatures, winning the chance to mate, die, and be reborn over and over again until you’ve become the fittest survivor of them all. </p><p>And all of these will be playable with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641482/nintendo-is-releasing-a-gamecube-controller">forthcoming wireless recreation of the GameCube controller</a>, as they should be. The GameCube wasn’t an abject failure, but it sold nowhere near as well as the Wii or the Switch. There’s no guarantee that the Switch 2 will keep up the sales pace set by its predecessor, but even if it manages half that console’s sales, it could give some games a well-deserved second look. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">Nintendo Switch 2</a> offers a fairly massive upgrade when it comes to raw storage space. The 256GB onboard SSD is four times larger than the Switch OLED (64GB) and eight times the size of the original Switch and Switch Lite (32GB). That said, the Switch 2's performance upgrades will inevitably lead to bigger file sizes for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">upcoming games</a>, which could compel you to expand your console's storage capacity. Just like its predecessor, the Nintendo Switch 2 has a microSD card slot. But while the Switch worked with basically every microSD card sold in stores, the Switch 2 is only compatible with a very specific type of storage: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DFQKQ9CB,B0DFQGVLYF,B0DYB7ZGR3,B0DYBW1MNC,B0DYB9TNB4&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">microSD Express cards</a>.</p><p>The Express format is a recent advancement in the semiconductor industry that hasn't been widely adopted by manufacturers yet. The Nintendo Switch 2 will certainly increase its adoption rate by both manufacturers and consumers in a hurry. During this week's Nintendo Direct, we learned that both Samsung and SanDisk will be releasing Super Mario-themed microSD Express Cards this year. If you want to get ahead of any potential Switch 2 storage woes, we've put together a brief list and explainer detailing the microSD Express options available now from SanDisk and Lexar. None of the current cards are themed around Nintendo franchises, but you'll probably save some cash by grabbing a non-branded one anyway.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-128GB-microSD-Express-SDSQXFN-128G-GN4NN/dp/B0DFQKQ9CB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SanDisk 128GB microSD Express Card</a> -- $45 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-microSD-Express-SDSQXFN-256G-GN4NN/dp/B0DFQGVLYF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SanDisk 256GB microSD Express Card</a> -- $60 (<del>$65</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB7ZGR3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar 256GB Play Pro microSD Express Card</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYBW1MNC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar 512GB Play Pro microSD Express Card</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar 1TB Play Pro microSD Express Card</a> -- $200</li></ul><p>For more on the new console, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">GameSpot's Nintendo Switch 2 preorder guide</a>, which includes all of the first-party hardware and games featured in the Nintendo Direct.

In fact, this card is actually faster than the average SATA SSD.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU\/dp\/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Lexar microSD Express Cards for Nintendo Switch 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU\/dp\/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Available in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB models</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you want to future-proof your Switch 2's storage space, Lexar is the only major manufacturer with microSD Express Cards exceeding 256GB.</p><p>Lexar's Express Play Pro Cards launched in March in three different capacities: 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB.

Lexar says its microSD Express Play Pro can reach 900MB/s read speeds and 600MB/s write speeds.</p><p>The manufacturer has already updated its Amazon listing to mention the Nintendo Switch 2, which may be contributing to the wide delivery estimates.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/with-the-switch-2-it-seems-like-nintendo-is-kind-of-figuring-out-online.1153515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642290/nintendo-switch-2-online-figuring-out-gamechat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s perhaps no surprise that Nintendo opened its Switch 2 Direct with <em>Mario Kart World</em>, a Switch 2-exclusive launch title that’s a sequel to the original Switch’s most popular game. But it was more of a surprise that the Direct’s second segment, instead of focusing on the console’s specs, was all about Nintendo’s Discord-like GameChat system – a system that seems to show that Nintendo is finally catching up with its online services.</p><p>For playing with your pals, GameChat looks like it could be a lot of fun. You can join a shared call with your buddies and play games together or hang out and share screens of the games you’re playing separately. The Switch 2’s onboard microphone picks up your voice for voice chat, and you can use the Switch 2 Camera accessory, which is designed to sit next to your TV while you play on the couch, to host video chats. Nintendo says other “compatible” USB-C cameras will work, too.</p><p>Even in Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVjRBTy5irI">demo video</a>, you can see that the shared screens have lower framerates than your main screen, and the sound quality from the mics seems iffy. But it appears to be a pretty low-fuss way to hang out and play games with your friends that could be a major selling point for the Switch 2 and a Nintendo Switch Online membership. (Though GameChat will be available in an “Open-Access Period” that doesn’t require Nintendo Switch Online through March 31st, 2026.)</p><p>GameChat is just one of a few smart new things Nintendo is doing with its online services. GameShare, which lets you share a Switch game you have with friends who don’t have it so you can play multiplayer together, works online. (This was <em>another</em> feature Nintendo showed before digging into the Switch 2’s specs.) </p><p>The Nintendo Switch Online app is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642093/nintendo-switch-smartphone-app-zelda-notes">getting some upgrades, too</a>. There’s a new name: just Nintendo Switch App. Nintendo Switch 2 players will also be able to access their most recent 100 screenshots or video captures. And the app will contain a new section called “Zelda Notes” that you can use for help while playing <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears for the Kingdom</em>.</p><p>Nintendo Switch Online is becoming a better deal, too – at least the premium Expansion Pack tier. That more expensive option will let you play Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso">available collection of GameCube games</a>, which will include <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, and will let you access upgraded Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of certain games at no extra cost.</p><p>Nintendo has so far only said that this benefit applies to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>. But an image on a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fwhats-new-with-nintendo-switch-online-on-nintendo-switch-2%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo website discussing the perk</a> includes an image of <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, and <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>, so it seems like those Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades, when they’re available, will be eventually included in the Expansion Pack, too.</p><p>All of these new changes are in addition to the recent launch of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288201/nintendo-music-streaming-hands-on-impressions">dedicated Nintendo Music app</a>, to which Nintendo is drip-feeding some of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623759/nintendo-music-app-legend-of-zelda-link-to-the-past-snes">best</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636581/nintendo-music-app-tetris-dr-mario-kirby-edit-share-playlists-update">soundtracks</a>, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637319/nintendo-today-news-app">Nintendo Today news app</a>, which it’s already used <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638133/legend-of-zelda-movie-premiere-date-2027">to break news</a>. It seems like Nintendo is taking its online services more seriously than ever to make its games better and broaden its overall footprint in your life, and all in a very Nintendo way.</p><p>Let’s just hope that GameChat is actually good.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Those include tariffs of 34 percent on China and up to 46 percent on Vietnam, where much of the manufacturing for the Switch 2 takes place. Cambodia, another country Nintendo sources from, would face a 49 percent tariff. The new tax hikes are set to go into effect on April 5. </p><p>Tariffs are taxes charged on products when they enter the country. Most companies choose to pass on much or all of the tax in the form of price hikes that then show up on the shelves at stores like Best Buy, Walmart, and Target. Many of the original Switch consoles were manufactured in China, but Nintendo began sourcing from countries like Vietnam and elsewhere after trade war threats during Trump’s first term, seemingly to avoid precisely this scenario.</p><p>“Switch production has been shifting to Vietnam and is around 50:50 versus China currently,” MST Financial analyst David Gibson told <em>Kotaku</em> last fall. “Expect more production to shift to Vietnam with Switch 2, but it  takes 6 months (or more) to gear up. If the mix does not change then prices go up 35%+ for U.S. consumers.” He suggested one result is that more U.S. consumers could start trying to import consoles sold from Europe instead. </p><p>The Consumer Technology Association had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901?_gl=1*h1hjvg*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzYxNzkxMi42OC4xLjE3NDM2MzEzMTguMjcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901?_gl=1*h1hjvg*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzYxNzkxMi42OC4xLjE3NDM2MzEzMTguMjcuMC4w">previously estimated price increases</a></span> of hundreds of dollars for video game consoles in the U.S., but the new tariffs being signed into law would lead to even more drastic hikes. “President Trump’s sweeping global and reciprocal tariffs are massive tax hikes on Americans that will drive inflation, kill jobs on Main Street, and may cause a recession for the U.S. economy,” Gary Shapiro, the group’s CEO, said in a press release today. “These tariffs will raise consumer prices and will force our trade partners to retaliate.” <br></p><p>As with everything Trump does, it’s hard to know if the latest tariff rollout will stick or is just another stunt aimed at exacting concessions for trade partners. It’s also possible that part of the Switch 2's $450 price tag built in some extra room for Nintendo to eat potential tariff costs before passing them onto fans.

Coordinate Experts on far-flung expeditions to discover new Exhibits, generating Buzz to entice droves of knowledge-hungry guests who will expect top info-tainment if they’re to leave impressed. This is all while you keep your Exhibits safe, rooms clean, staff happy… and children off the dinosaur bones.</p><p><strong>Exploring for Exhibits</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As Curator, the design and management of your expanding museum is in your hands! Send your team of partially trained Experts on Expeditions in search of rare and mostly well-preserved artefacts. When (and hopefully not if) your Experts return from their <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,174 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>, proudly display their fantastic finds in your museum.</p><p>You’ll unlock new locations as you decide where the next adventure takes you, and complete a sticker book to document your journey as a souvenir of your discoveries.</p><p>Your work doesn’t end there; Exhibit maintenance is crucial. While some Experts are gallivanting across Two Point County and beyond, you’re in charge of managing staff back home to ensure Exhibits and the museum stay in tip-top condition. If taking care of the carnivorous Chomper isn’t enough, there are also meddling thieves to watch out for. Thieves, and more frequently, children, are known for touching and grubbing up the displays, so make sure enough security is guarding your prized collection!</p><p><strong>Design-osaurs</strong></p><p>Get creative to design your museum layout your way! You have decorative freedom, so design thematic areas to guide your guests’ visit. Splash paint and lay carpet as you lovingly arrange each prehistoric fern, potentially melting iceman, and dinosaur remains wherever you see fit.</p><p>Once you’ve created the perfect atmosphere, arrange guided tours with custom routes led by a charismatic Expert. Tours are a fantastic way to enrich your guests’ experience. To keep guests enthused, showcase Exhibits with the highest Buzz—those that are top quality, provide ample info and beautiful decorations are likely to attract the most donations!</p><p><strong>Guest-ertainment</strong></p><p>Guests know best! The different types of guests who will frequent your museum may have different interests, but they do have some things in common… they expect the place to be kept clean, have plenty of refreshments, ample toilets, and a gift shop filled with goodies. And, of course, they need to be dazzled with knowledge of your Exhibits, which are kept well-maintained… or else you could make them sick.</p><p>Two Point County will bring a variety of guests to your museum, and they all hope to discover their new favorite Exhibit… From dino fanatics and botany buffs to haunted horror seekers, you’ll need to cater to their personal preferences to meet their needs. By exceeding their expectations, you can keep them engaged, leading to longer visits, increased donations, and glowing reviews!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>While Nintendo talked a bunch about the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Switch 2 Edition</a> paid upgrades of a select few original Switch games, there’s also some titles that will be getting free upgrades to support the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Free updates to improve playability on the Nintendo Switch 2 system will be released for select Nintendo Switch games,” Nintendo states.</p>
<p>“By connecting your Nintendo Switch 2 to the internet, you can download free updates that may improve performance or add support for features such as GameShare in select games. The contents of these free updates will differ depending on the game.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These updates will work on multiple levels. Simplistically, they can offer visual improvements through higher resolutions and improved frame rates – this will be a boon for both The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening and Echoes of Wisdom, not to mention Pokémon Scarlet and Violet – but there are also patches to enable GameShare for titles with multiplayer.</p>


<p>GameShare lets a single copy of a game be used to share multiplayer access to other consoles, both locally for Switch and Switch 2 devices, and through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/the-nintendo-switch-2-c-button-is-for-gamechat-and-gameshare/">GameChat</a> for Switch 2. This is great for when you just want to each have your own personal screen instead of sharing a TV, games where all players might have different viewpoints and camera angles, and more. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/heres-how-nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-lets-you-share-multiplayer-games-with-other-switches/">See here for more details for how GameShare works on Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>ARMS</li>
<li>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker <em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>Super Mario Odyssey<em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury<em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics<em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</li>
<li>Game Builder Garage</li>
<li>New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe</li>
<li>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</li>
<li>Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain <em>– GameShare</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The distinction between a free update and a Switch 2 Edition paid upgrade seems to be whether or not Nintendo is adding significant content to their games. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/23/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-switch/">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> are both getting major content expansions, while the improvements for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a> extend to HDR support and Switch Online app support (and these updates can be had when bundled in with Switch Online + Expansion Pack). Cross-gen games like Metroid Prime 4 are more straightforward.</p>
<p>For the free upgrades, they could be as simple as lifting the dynamic resolution bounds and any frame rate caps to let the Switch 2 stretch its legs. We’d love to see similar for games with iffy visual quality and frame rates on the original Switch, like Xenoblade Chronicles 2.</p>

<p>All of this means that third party developers are free to choose their own path. 2K are going down the paid upgrade path for Civilization 7, but other developers will no doubt choose free patches.</p>

            <p>
I'm not sure I've seen people swing back and forth on a game so rapidly like they have with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. It's had a few hiccoughs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-has-received-100000-negative-reviews-since-announcing-players-must-link-steam-to-a-psn-account">here</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-emerge-with-a-bullet-pointed-peace-offering-to-pacify-mutinous-helldivers-2-players">there</a>, which has made for some tough times for developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead</a>, at least in terms of battling the accursed "mixed" rating on Steam (and lower). In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/helldivers-2s-big-challenge-how-to">The Game Business</a>, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani quite accurately noted that it's been "one heck of a roller coaster year" for Helldivers 2, and also went on to speak about what it was like clawing its way back from low ratings - all the while having to explain to Sony about summer holidays in Sweden.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As Jorjani noted, at one point in time Helldivers 2 went as low as 30% positive on Steam, which as he says, "usually that's the death knell for a game, but we came back from that." The bigger problem came after some balancing tweaks which brought it down to 19%. "I think [19%] was the lowest. Games that get 19% user score do not generally recover." 
</p>
<p>
Except, at that point, everybody was on vacation. "When I was asked to step in [as CEO], they gave me the keys to the car… and told me: ‘we're going off on vacation, because we haven't been taking much over the last few summers,'" Jorjani explains. "And I was like: ‘we're running a live service game, people can't be off for the next three months!’ But that's what happens in Sweden. We take our summer vacations very seriously."
</p>
<p>
Jorjani had to explain this to SIE Studio Business Group CEO too, not exactly an easy task - "maybe the lowest point during my tenure so far" as the Arrowhead CEO put it - but a plan was formed, and reviews have swung back around to positive. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Jorjani said he was "inspired" by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/hello-games">Hello Games</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>, perhaps one of the most infamous games of the past decade when it comes to changing the rhetoric surrounding it. "The game was hyped, then bombed, and then they put the head to the grindstone and just updated the game," Jorjani noted.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Hello Games had a lot more work to do to right that spaceship, it took years to get it to where it's at now. The response to Helldivers 2 has certainly been a lot more volatile, and one could pretty easily argue that that fact speaks to where we're at with live service games: kick up enough of a fuss, and you'll more or less get what you want. In any case, fingers crossed for Arrowhead that Helldivers 2's second year goes a bit smoother.

Does the mashup of <em>Minecraft</em> jokes and fish-out-of-water oddball comedy succeed? </p><p><em>Entertainment Weekly</em>’s Jordan Hoffman seemed to think it was fine but that Black was a weak link. “His opening voiceover has some of the audible panic of someone asked to watch after someone else’s kids, laying on the excitement really thick in the hopes they don’t notice Mommy and Daddy have stepped away for a few minutes, “ he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/minecraft-review-jason-momoa-mines-gold-surprisingly-well-crafted-comedy-11706595&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/minecraft-review-jason-momoa-mines-gold-surprisingly-well-crafted-comedy-11706595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a></span>. </p><p><em>Mashable</em>’s Kimber Myers was more upbeat, though she conceded that probably nobody watching the movie is there for the story. “Parents will likely find this film more entertaining than listening to their kids talk about <em>Minecraft</em> for the equivalent amount of time (101 minutes, for the record),” she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mashable.com/article/a-minecraft-movie-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mashable.com/article/a-minecraft-movie-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a></span>. “<em>A Minecraft Movie</em> might also provide a deeper understanding of the universe (<em>Minecraft</em>’s, not the real one) for those who haven’t experienced it firsthand before. It’s a good primer for the game that never feels like homework.”</p><p>The creative conundrum at the center of <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> is how to convert a game about freestyle play, exploration, and building into a coherent 90-minute spectacle, and the sense you start to get from reading many of the current reviews is that nothing that happens in the film is that impactful, but neither is it a drag, and often it’s pleasant enough. “The limitless creativity inherent in the game hasn’t been fully replicated in the movie, which is designed to expand its brand dominance,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review-2025#google_vignette&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review-2025#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a></span> Brian Tallerico for<em> RogerEbert.com</em>. “However, there’s just enough inspired heroism in this flick to make people who put the game down years ago circle back to it and build something new.”</p><p>Writing for <em>The New York Times</em>, Brandon Yu said that much of the film has “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/movies/a-minecraft-movie-review.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/movies/a-minecraft-movie-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a camp quality of so-dumb-it’s-sort-of-fun.</a></span>” For Jacob Oller at <em>The</em> <em>AV Club</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>the lack of any coherent story arc earned the film a C-. <em>IndieWire</em> gave it a similar grade, with critic David Erhlich <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/a-minecraft-movie-review-1235112484/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/a-minecraft-movie-review-1235112484/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing</a></span>, “Fleet pacing, vivid colors, and a poppy Mark Mothersbaugh score do what they can to paper over the film’s prefab nature, but even kids — especially kids — will pick up on the disconnect between what they can make in <em>Minecraft</em> (anything they can imagine) and what Hess has made of <em>Minecraft</em> (nothing they haven’t seen before).”</p><p>But Johnny Oleksinski at<em> The New York Post </em>wasn’t having it. “It’s the kind of formulaic brand-extension tale a writer could pitch while in a coma,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://nypost.com/2025/04/02/entertainment/a-minecraft-movie-review-idiotic-video-game-film-stomps-on-your-brain/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/02/entertainment/a-minecraft-movie-review-idiotic-video-game-film-stomps-on-your-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a></span>. It only gets more brutal from there, as he continues, “‘To hope, to dream, to create is to suffer,’ the baddie says. She left out ‘to watch.’” Ultimately, <em>A Minecraft Movie </em>doesn’t sound anywhere near as bad a video-game-turned-movie as last year’s <em>Borderlands</em>, but it also doesn’t seem set to have the same juice as <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie </em>or the first few<em> Sonics</em>. Like most of the critics who reviewed it, however, I’ll ultimately be deferring to my kids’ takes when we see it this weekend. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/trumps-new-tariffs-on-exports-to-u-s-could-push-nintendo-switch-2-price-higher/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Potential Nintendo Switch 2 fans were surprised by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high price point revealed after today’s Direct</a>, but it may end up costing even more for American buyers. Thanks to a high tariff rate imposed on Vietnam and Cambodia by President Trump, the cost of a Switch 2 could get much higher.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-reason-to-get-your-nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-in-right-away">More Reason to Get Your Nintendo Switch 2 Pre-Orders in Right Away</h2>



<p>On April 2nd, hours after the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct showcase, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his plan to impose a minimum 10% tariff on effectively all goods coming into the country. However, Trump has imposed higher tariff rates on countries with higher trade deficits with the United States.</p>



<p>What does that mean for Americans trying to buy a Nintendo Switch 2? Well it means that those that wait too long may be hit with a higher cost. Nintendo shifted production and sourcing of parts away from China and towards Vietnam and Cambodia in order to avoid tariffs on China. However, the United States will now tariff products from Vietnam <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1907531727683334384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at a 46% rate</a> and from Cambodia at 49%, significantly higher than the 34% rate that’s being implemented onto Chinese goods.</p>



<p>Nintendo though has reportedly stockpiled “hundreds of thousands” of units in the United States over the past few months, in anticipation of these tariffs, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7edbe449-0c44-462e-8787-7347d7ac7a18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Financial Times</a>. It’s unclear though whether or not the $450 price of the Nintendo Switch 2 ($500 for the bundle including Mario Kart World) already takes into consideration the increased cost brought on by the tariffs. It’s possible that if the stockpile runs low and the tariffs don’t relent, the cost of a Nintendo Switch 2 could get even higher. Insider Gaming has already reached out to Nintendo for comment on how the tariffs will affect consumers, and is still awaiting a reply.</p>



<p>Trump’s tariffs are already affecting the PC gaming side of the market, thanks to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/price-increases-for-game-consoles-and-pc-parts-likely-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 25% tariff on all computer imports</a> announced the same day. This includes desktops, laptops, and various parts, and likely will include video game consoles as well. In addition to the Switch 2’s price potentially getting higher, tariffs could also negatively affect consumer spending as a whole.</p>



<p>Do you think the Switch 2 price could get even higher in America because of tariffs? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1807/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

However, there appears to be a concerted effort from Nintendo to introduce specially enhanced versions of Switch 1 games to the Switch 2. And these seem to go beyond just a graphical boost and framerate bump.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What Games are Playable on Switch 2?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As Nintendo breaks down, there will be primarily three types of games playable on the Switch 2. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/Switch_2_Games_List_-_Release_Date,_Price,_and_Exclusives">Native Switch 2 games</a> that are developed for the system and cannot be played on the original Switch. Compatible Switch 1 games whose cartridges can slot right into the Switch 2 and be played natively on the console. And Switch 2 Edition games which are Switch 1 games that will receive new features and performance enhancements when played on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This doesn’t include classic games that are available through Nintendo Switch Online which includes a library of games from the NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and now GameCube.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>So What Comes in a Switch 2 Edition Game?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The main takeaway from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is that Nintendo appears to be trying to throw in a little extra for anyone playing a Switch 2 Edition of a Switch 1 game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, Super Mario Party Jamboree was a Switch game and the Switch 2 Edition will come with a new suite of content called Jamboree TV that will take advantage of the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, Switch 2 microphone, and the Switch 2 USB-C camera that will be sold separately.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with upgraded resolution up to 1440p in TV mode and better frame rate, there will be new minigames and online functions as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which will be a cross-gen game, will support mouse controls with Joy-Con 2, and multiple display modes like Quality Mode which runs at 60fps in 4K when docked, or 1080p at 60fps on handheld; or Performance Mode which runs a 120fps in 1080p when docked, or 120fps in 720p in handheld mode. All modes will support HDR.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other Switch 2 Edition titles will get new story content like Kirby and the Forgotten Land’s Star-Crossed World add-on, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-72-new-game-details-mario-kart-9-the-duskbloods-and-more">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom</a> will gain additional support for the Zelda Notes service in the Nintendo Switch App that will give you guides and game help.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some games, like Pokemon Legends: Z-A will only feature performance and resolution bumps as part of the Switch 2 Edition label.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>When are the Switch 2 Edition Games Coming?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 is set to be released on June 5, 2025 and that’s around when the first batch of Switch 2 Edition games will arrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will get Switch 2 Editions on the day of the console’s launch on June 5, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 2 Editions for Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV will arrive a little later on July 24, 2025. Same for Kirby and the Forgotten Land’s update which will arrive on August 28, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither Metroid Prime 4: Beyond of Pokemon Legends: Z-A have release dates yet so both Switch 2 Editions are scheduled for sometime in 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>How Much Will Switch 2 Editions Cost?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That depends. If you don’t own the Switch 1 version of the game, then you can purchase the Switch 2 Edition at retail, which will be distinct thanks to the new red-colored physical game case. The digital versions will also feature a prominent Switch 2 logo so you know you’re buying the right edition for your Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you own the game on Switch 1 and want the upgrades that will be added in the Switch 2 Edition you will need to purchase an upgrade pack from Nintendo. The upgrade packs will be available at select retailers, the official My Nintendo Store, and Nintendo eShop. However, Nintendo has not revealed how much an upgrade pack will cost just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some upgrade packs, like the upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom will be included in a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. This is the same membership that gives Switch owners access to online features and the classic library.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 Zelda Nintendo Switch Editions</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So there you have it, that’s everything you need to know about the Switch 2 Editions of a game. We’ve detailed previously how Nintendo is making the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-is-making-the-jump-to-switch-2-as-easy-as-possible-for-everyone">jump to the Switch 2 fairly seamless</a> thanks to its backward compatibility stance, and it looks like Nintendo is looking to bolster its launch library with improved versions of Switch classics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Nintendo Switch 2 check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">all the news announced during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-price-confirmed">how much it costs</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-start-time">when pre-orders go up.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/heres-how-nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-lets-you-share-multiplayer-games-with-other-switches/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo is revitalising one of their favourite multiplayer game concepts for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> with GameShare, letting you share multiplayer games with other Switch owners, using just a single copy of a game.</p>
<p>This is different to PlayStation’s SharePlay, which streams a gameplay video to invited players, but is instead beaming game code to the other systems, letting them run the game on-device and with each player having a bespoke viewpoint, depending on the game.</p>


<p>GameShare will work both over local wireless and over the internet via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/the-nintendo-switch-2-c-button-is-for-gamechat-and-gameshare/">GameChat</a>, but it will be more limited in that second scenario.</p>

<p>Locally, a Nintendo Switch 2 can share a multiplayer game with both Switch 2 and original Switch consoles (depending on the game), but GameChat is a Switch 2 exclusive feature, so online GameShare only works with Switch 2 consoles. Additionally, some games will only have local GameShare enabled and block online play.</p>


<p>Six Nintendo Switch games are getting upgrades to support GameShare on the Nintendo Switch 2, most of them free.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/11/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-switch-review/">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/01/51-worldwide-games-clubhouse-review/">Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Games</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/10/super-mario-3d-world-switch-review-bowsers-fury/">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/01/big-brain-academy-brain-vs-brain-review/">Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> Switch 2 Edition – <em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Paid upgrade</a>, and no GameChat sharing</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these is a very different style of game. 51 Worldwide Games is packed full of boardgames, so each player can have different views of a chess board, for example. Treasure Tracker and 3D World are both isometric platformers from the Wii U with fully separate character control, while Super Mario Odyssey’s multiplayer is restricted to the second player being Cappy.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this concept many times in the past, whether it was the limited cable linked multiplayer of GBA games, giving small portions of games to those without a cartridge, or the same idea wirelessly with later handhelds like the 3DS – I think Tri-Force Heroes had this feature? – and it will be interesting to see just how extensively this is featured in Nintendo Switch 2 games.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo's post-Direct <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> info-dump has been full of juicy little details, and the nuggets keep on coming. It now appears, for instance, that Nintendo's newest console will be making things a little easier for the avid screenshot sharers and gameplay clippers out there.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2, just like the original Switch, features a dedicated button for capturing in-game screenshots and gameplay. It was a welcome addition on Switch 1, but a bit of a faff too; sharing captures either involved saving them to a memory card and plugging that into a secondary device for download, uploading them to a social media account (until the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-removing-x-support-from-switch">feature was removed</a>) then downloading them onto your device, or scanning in QR codes to get them onto your device. Hardly backbreaking stuff, admittedly, but not exactly seamless either.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2, however, looks to have streamlined the process if a little infographic tucked away on Nintendo's website is anything to go by. On a page introducing the revamped Nintendo Switch App (formerly known as the Nintendo Switch Online app) Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/mobile-apps/nintendo-switch-app/?srsltid=AfmBOopCv3siqbq6sJWgpzEYRt7_R9DcsjOjA3x59XIZYRwHsaN-nMG-">draws attention to the process of sharing screenshots and video using Switch 2</a>; by selecting the 'Upload to Smart Device' option from the console's album, it's possible to send captures from the console directly to the app - seemingly with no fiddly middle steps to slow things down.

<p>
Captures are stored in a new 'Uploaded Screenshots and Videos' gallery - accessible from the app's home screen - which can display 100 screenshots or videos from the last 30 days. From here, screenshots and videos can be saved to your smart device if you want to keep them indefinitely, or shared on social media. So if you're the kind of person to regularly go on a game-capturing frenzy, you could end up saving literal seconds - if not minutes - out of your day. Oh, and Nintendo notes the feature is available without a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.
</p>
<p>
Alongside streamlined capture sharing, the revamped Nintendo Switch App will continue to offer game-specific services - including SplatNet 3, NookLink, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">newly announced Zelda Notes</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Additionally, the app will still let users see which of their friends are online and register new friends using a QR code - although, notably, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-finally-explains-what-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-does">Switch 2's new GameChat system</a> means the app's voice chat functionality won't be supported for games exclusive to the new console.
</p>
<p>
So there you go - another bit of Switch 2 business to ponder. And there's plenty more information regarding Nintendo's new console over in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-live-everything-announced-as-it-happens">round-up of everything announced during (and after) today's Switch 2 Direct</a>.
