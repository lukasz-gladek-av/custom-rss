NBA 2K25 will feature three separate cover athletes across four distinct covers, depending on which edition you choose. In addition to revealing the cover art, 2K also provided the first screenshots and high-level details on the upgrades players can expect.</p>

<p>Headlining the cover star lineup is Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum. The 26-year-old Tatum is a five-time All-Star, a Gold Medalist at the 2020 Olympic Games, a member of the U.S. Men's National Team for the 2024 Olympic Games, and is coming off his first NBA Championship. Tatum lands on the NBA 2K25 Standard Edition.</p>

</article><p>Meanwhile, those who purchase the NBA 2K25 WNBA Edition will see Las Vegas Aces forward A'ja Wilson on their cover. Wilson is coming off back-to-back championships with the Aces. She won the Finals MVP honors for the 2023 Championship and is a two-time WNBA MVP and a six-time All-Star. Wilson also took home a Gold Medal at the 2020 Olympic Games and will again represent the United States at the 2024 Olympic Games. Together, Tatum and Wilson co-headline the NBA 2K25 All-Star Edition.</p>

<p>The final NBA 2K25 cover athlete is a recent Hall of Fame inductee, eight-time NBA All-Star, and the winner of the legendary 2000 NBA Dunk Contest, Vince Carter. Carter graces the cover of the NBA 2K25 Hall of Fame Edition. You can see all four covers below.</p>



<p>This year's entry signals the return of the MyCareer mode with fresh updates and new MyTeam modes. For the new-gen versions on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (for those with compatible specs), players can expect an added sixth era in MyNBA, a more compact and interactive City, and the return of the women's-focused mode The W. Crossplay will also be offered on newer-gen versions.</p>

			<p>Palworld studio Pocketpair has partnered with Sony Music Entertainment and Sony-owned media company Aniplex to establish Palworld Entertainment Inc.</p>
<p>Pocketpair, Sony, and Aniplex announced the joint venture earlier today through <a href="https://www.sme.co.jp/en/pressrelease/news/detail/NEWS001864.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an official press release</a> from Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc. According to the press release, the joint venture aims to expand the Palworld IP outside of the game itself. "The [joint venture] will be responsible for developing the reach of the intellectual property and for expanding commercial business endeavors, including the global licensing and merchandising activities associated with "Palworld," outside of the interactive game", the press release reads.</p>
<p>According to the release, the joint venture will kick off with the development of exclusive merchandise based on the game. This merchandise will debut at the Pocketpair booth during “Bilibili World 2024” (beginning Friday, July 12, 2024 in Shanghai, China).</p>
<p>On X, the official Palworld X account <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_JP/status/1810850675980652849" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> the following:</p>
<p>"Pocket Pair is pleased to announce that in order to accelerate the diversified development of "PAL WORLD" around the world and further expand the IP, the three companies, Pocket Pair, Sony Music Entertainment, and Aniplex have agreed to establish "PAL WORLD Entertainment Co., Ltd."!</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-ps5-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teases about a PS5 version of Palworld</a>, the 'Pokemon with Guns' title is currently only available on PC and Xbox Series. Interestingly, back in March of this year, Palworld creator Takuro Mizobe already suggested that he would be open for a partnership or an acquisition.</p>
<p>Palworld is available worldwide now for PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>Rocksteady has delayed the release of Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League's second season.</p>
<p>The second season was set to kick off tomorrow, 11th July. It will now start on 25th July.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your patience," the developer wrote in a short post on social media platform X last night. It did not give a reason for this delay</p>

<p>The upcoming season is set to bring Mr Freeze's wife, Nora, into the fray. Along with this new playable character, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's second season will also add new weapons, another map and two episodes with suitably chilly names: Frozen Hearts and Winter.</p>
<p>Rocksteady still has another two seasons planned for the future, as laid out in a <a href="https://twitter.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1749494429768146999">roadmap shared earlier this year</a>, with more playable characters and gear to come.</p> <div>

<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League failed to take off the way Rocksteady and publisher Warner Bros. had hoped. Back in February of this year, Warner Bros. Discovery's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">Rocksteady's release had "fallen short" of its expectations</a>. Warner Bros. went on to attribute a $200m revenue loss to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>
<p>A report then followed in July which stated a culture of perfectionism, an ill-suited genre pivot, and a constantly shifting vision were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">key reasons for the live-service game's failure</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-team-head-wants-to-make-a-sonic-rpg-before-he-retires-from-sega</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-team-head-wants-to-make-a-sonic-rpg-before-he-retires-from-sega.923448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-team-head-wants-to-make-a-sonic-rpg-before-he-retires-from-sega<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka would love to make a Sonic RPG before he retires from Sega, though that's just a dream.
</p>
<p>
Iizuka was interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNeWQbiawnk">YouTube channel Good Vibes Gaming</a> for a preview of the forthcoming Sonic x Shadow Generations and discussed whether he'd ever work on a Sonic RPG in future.
</p>
<p>
"Personally, I really like role-playing games," he said. "The RPG game format is a lot of fun and I've even thought to myself 'you know, for the past 30 years we haven't done a Sonic RPG'. And I'm questioning myself. 'Why haven't we done a Sonic RPG in all this time? How have we gotten to 30 years with no RPGs?!'

</figure>
<p>
"So I'd like to hopefully work on a Sonic RPG at some point before I retire from Sega. But you know, that's just a dream right now. There are no concrete plans at this point."
</p>
<p>
Of course, there has been a Sonic RPG in the past - Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood released on Nintendo DS - but this was developed by Mass Effect and Dragon Age studio BioWare.
</p>
<p>
But Sonic Team making an official Sonic RPG would be huge. There's precedent there too, as the studio have worked on RPGs in the past, in particular the Phantasy Star series. 
</p>
<p>
And that's before you bring in the long-running Mario rivalry - if the moustachioed plumber can star in Square Enix's Super Mario RPG and the ongoing Paper Mario series, why can't Sonic try his hand at turn-based battles?
</p>
<p>
Could we explore a fully open Sonic world? Would Sonic transform into Super Sonic for powerful moves? Would Knuckles summon the Chaotix crew? How would speed affect battles? Would there be classes, or romances? There are so many possibilities!
</p>
<p>
I recently went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-the-best-of-00s-sonic-with-a-big-dash-of-nostalgia">hands-on with Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> myself and spoke to Iizuka about why Shadow has become such an enduring character, how Sonic Frontiers has influenced the remaster, and whether Shadow will wield a gun.

</p>
<p>
Also, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-appears-to-be-teasing-another-secret-character">could there be a secret fourth playable character</a>?
</p>
<p>
Sonic x Shadow Generations is set for release on 25th October across PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC (Epic and Steam).

			<p>Infinite Inside is a game experience that is overwhelming and atmospheric. This Mixed Reality/VR title is an environmental puzzler that brings the environmental puzzles into your home, and its thoughtful, mysterious world is the perfect setting for an intriguing adventure through space and time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Infinite Inside | Cinematic Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLxaHT_1Wl0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Depending on where you play, Infinite Inside becomes something of a different experience. If you’re lucky enough to be playing on an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apple-vision-pro">Apple Vision Pro</a>, or the latest of the Meta Quest family of headsets (I predominantly played the game on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a>), you can experience the game directly in your home by utilising the passthrough features that allow you to see the world around you. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a> and SteamVR players meanwhile will have to settle for a fully VR experience, though the fundamental puzzling that lies at the heart of the game remains exactly the same.</p>


<p>While Infinite Inside can be played stationary, this is a game that really benefits from a room scale setting, though thankfully you won’t really need that much space overall to get the most out of it. A briefcase appears on the floor of your room, and from it springs a monolithic stone structure, the Plinth, replete with drawers, doors, and open sections that allow you to see the consistently changing world within.</p>


<p>This monolith is the literal centre of Infinite Inside, and walking around it in real time gives it a remarkable sense of weight and realism. The draws, easily grasped and opened by their handles, feel like they’re genuinely there, and have the high-class feel of an expensive kitchen drawer or cabinet. Whatever your cutlery draw is like, it probably doesn’t house the kinds of conundrums you soon find yourself involved in. Unless a spatula has wedged itself at a strange angle, that is.</p>
<p>There is a man. I came to call him Tiny Little Man, and latterly Humfrey, but at times, he’s not tiny, he’s the same size as you. His statue becomes a key to shifting between the real world and the internal world of the Plinth, and once inside it, you see the spectre of the Tiny Little Man exploring it in much the same way you are. Sometimes he leads you in the right direction, or teaches you how to interact with something, while at others he seems lost, bereft with his seeming incarceration within this shifting tower. At times he lurks near the edge of the abyss, and I genuinely worried just what might befall him. I forgot to worry about myself.</p>

<p>Much of the puzzling, both within and without the tower, revolves around collecting parts of an object and then putting them together in the right way. At first this is a simple, straightforward object that’s been split into pieces, but soon they balloon to take in more parts, and in more complicated configurations. It’s very reminiscent of Cubism, which has been a highlight of the Quest library for a long time, but which the Meta Quest 3’s improved passthrough has made the most of in recent months.</p>
<p>Infinite Inside is a much more extensive experience than that though, and shifting between the real world and the Escher-esque landscape inside never ceases to impress. The enigmatic and moving soundtrack from Steven Coltart certainly helps, its plaintive tones echoing through both the real world and the fictional one, but the visuals create a real sense of place and height, so much so that at points I felt the effects of vertigo take hold. There are similarities to areas we’ve seen before in the Assassin’s Creed franchise, sharing in a taste for shifting stones and enigmatic tower structures, but this is a new level of solidity for VR and Mixed Reality.</p>

<p>There’s an overarching narrative that Humfrey is embroiled in, but details in the world – a record player, a pot of tea, or a radio that never seems to quite be tuned to a station – help you to build a picture of just what’s going on here. It’s thoroughly intriguing, though at various points I wished that these elements were a little more interactive.</p>
<p>While you walk around the external monolith, inside you use an open palm gesture to grasp a ball of light that teleports you to the next one, and if anything, this is the most frustrating part of the entire game. It’s probably harder to replicate the required gesture with a controller in your hand for a start, but the game didn’t always immediately realise what you are trying to do. Equally, there are points where you can see a more distant teleport point, but you can’t leap to that one straight away, occasionally slowing the pace for very little reason. Here’s hoping a little tweak can be made here.</p>

            <p>Microsoft have announced global price increases for their Game Pass subscription business across all existing packages on console and PC. They’re also doing away with Xbox Game Pass For Console, while introducing a new Standard tier for console users which includes the Xbox back catalogue but doesn’t offer day-one access to new games.</p><!--more-->
<p>Being an RPS reader, you, of course, care nary a fig nor a figment for Game Pass on console. If those poor misguided Xboxers are getting owned by the megacorp, that’s what they richly deserve for turning their noses up at mouse and keyboard. But you probably do care about PC Game Pass prices going up from $9.99, €9.99 or £7.99 per month to $11.99, €11.99 and £9.99.</p>
<p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes PC Game Pass alongside first-party games at release, cloud gaming, multiplayer and the back catalogue, is also getting a hike - up from $16.99, €14.99 and £12.99 to $19.99, €17.99 or £14.99 per month. Here’s a <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/42/85/42850801-4997-491d-a5bd-69c5bd7948ac.pdf?n=FINAL%20Game%20Pass%20price%20updates%20by%20country%20and%20currency.pdf">Microsoft pdf with a complete breakdown of the price changes by region</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft have also popped up a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024">FAQ about the changes</a> with some dates, including a reminder of how to cancel your subscription. The price changes take effect for new subscribers from today, 10th July 2024. As for current subscribers, the price changes come into force from your first recurring billing charge after 12th September 2024. The date at which your billing charges go out won’t change.</p>
<p>Tl;dr Microsoft have altered the terms of the deal. Pray they don’t alter them any further... which they probably will, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-passs-only-outside-shot-for-sustainability-is-to-get-gta-6-or-call-of-duty-says-former-microsoft-senior-pr-lead%E2%80%9D">the ole’ subscription business needs to make a lot more moolah for those mischievous shareholders</a>, especially in the wake of that $68.7 billion Activision-Blizzard acquisition.</p>

		<p>Microsoft has made some big changes to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>, shaking up what is offered on the “standard” tier and generally increasing prices for subscribers. Most significantly, access to first party Xbox games on day one will now not be included with the incoming Xbox Game Pass Standard for new console subscribers.</p>
<p>Going forward, the prices and general offerings will be:</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Xbox Game Pass Core</strong> – $9.99 per month or $74.99 / £55.99 for 12 months (previously $59.99 / £49.99) – Includes Xbox online multiplayer and limited game library.</li>
<li><strong>Xbox Game Pass Standard</strong> – $14.99 per month &nbsp;– Includes Xbox online multiplayer, full library of back catalogue games, but does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;include games released on day one.</li>
<li><strong>PC Game Pass</strong> – $11.99 / £9.99 per month (previously $9.99) – Includes day one games and full library of back catalogue titles on PC.</li>
<li><strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate </strong>– $19.99 / £14.99 per month (previously $16.99 / £12.99) – Includes PC Game Pass, Xbox online multiplayer, day one games, full back catalogue, EA Play, cloud gaming.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/42/85/42850801-4997-491d-a5bd-69c5bd7948ac.pdf?n=FINAL%20Game%20Pass%20price%20updates%20by%20country%20and%20currency.pdf">the full breakdown of price changes here</a>. Xbox Game Pass Standard is “coming soon”, likely by September.</p>
<p>Any one with a current <strong>Xbox Game Pass for Console</strong> subscription will be able to continue paying with recurring billing for the foreseeable future and still have access to the current offering – the $10.99 / £8.99 price will also continue.&nbsp;This includes day one games and the full Xbox Game Pass catalogue, but Xbox Game Pass for Console does not include Xbox online multiplayer, cloud gaming or PC Game Pass.</p>
<p>A further change will come for the ability to stack subscriptions. From 12th September, you will only be able to stack Xbox Game Pass for Console for 13 months, doing so using pre-paid cards and conversions. Anyone with the current maximum of up to 36 months will be able to carry that forward, and other plans will also still have a 36 month stacking maximum.</p>

<p>All in all, this is a canny way for Microsoft to get through a price increase and break the long-standing pledge for all Game Pass subscribers to have day one games, and to make the most of the coming inclusion of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/the-game-pass-app-has-confirmed-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-day-one/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 as a day one launch game</a> – previous speculation had been that a new higher priced tier would be added specially for Black Ops 6, but Microsoft is maintaining the general structure through this price increase and relaunch.</p>
<p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will still be the all-in-one package, but now comes at a higher price once again, while the annual price increase for Xbox Game Pass Core (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/17/game-pass-core-will-replace-xbox-live-gold-games-with-gold-in-septembe/">formerly Xbox Live Gold</a>) annual subs is a nasty sting in the tail. However, what’s more interesting is how Xbox Game Pass Standard is morphed out of Xbox Game Pass for Console.</p>
<p>Game Pass for Console previously didn’t include online gaming, so the main upsell to Game Pass Ultimate was to get that, as well as PC games and the option of cloud. Game Pass Standard flips that around, so online gaming is now included, but you don’t have day one games instead.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this will put more pressure on the pockets of gamers, at a time where there are so many subscriptions all vying for customers, and all steadily increasing prices as the market has become saturated.</p>

			<p>FromSoftware's Elden Ring unsurprisingly made its way back to the UK monthly sales chart for June, largely thanks to the release of its one and only expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-sold-5-million-units-in-3-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over five million units globally in three days. The GSD data was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/elden-ring-sales-jump-467-on-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-i-uk-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared today by GamesIndustry</a>, who noted that Elden Ring sales grew by 467% compared to last month.</p>
<p>Even that big of a jump wasn't enough to make it to the top three, though. Those spots were secured by two Electronic Arts sports games (EA Sports FC 24 and F1 24) and Rockstar's evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-qa-codemasters-talks-ai-improvements-confirms-nvidia-dlss-3-frame-gen-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 24</a> is new as well, of course, having launched on May 31. However, its performance probably didn't make EA very happy, as it's 44% below what F1 23 could accomplish in the same timeframe.</p>
<p>The rest of the chart is, once again, dominated by the usual suspects: Hogwarts Legacy, Sid Meier's Civilization 6, Red Dead Redemption 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Grand Theft Auto Online, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.</p>

<p>On the hardware front, console sales fell in the UK by 9% compared to June 2023, with slightly less than a hundred thousand consoles sold this June. PlayStation 5 still outsold the competitors combined, while Xbox Series S|X came out just ahead of Nintendo Switch this month (but Nintendo's and Microsoft's consoles have sold nearly the same amount in 2024 so far).</p>
<p>2024 as a whole isn't looking good for console sales in the UK, with 29% lower unit sales and 31% lower revenue compared to 2023. According to GamesIndustry, this is because PS5 enjoyed a very strong first half of 2023 when its stock finally returned to normal; moreover, the Switch is very old at this point and has largely exhausted its potential customer base.</p>
<p>On the upside, accessory sales increased by 16% compared to 2023. The lion's share was done by the DualSense controller, partly thanks to a discount. Overall, UK customers bought as many DualSense controllers as they did PlayStation 5 consoles; as a reminder, the DualSense is also a great PC controller, and some of those sales definitely came from that userbase.</p>

<p>Like many of these compact concept-driven <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> games do (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slipways">Slipways</a>, my beloved), The King Is Watching started as <a href="https://hypnohead.itch.io/the-king-is-watching">an Itch project</a>. “Once you build something, it only works if it is inside your gaze,” is its unique thingamajig. Your ‘gaze’ starts as three squares on a 4x4 tileset, although you can upgrade it for wider gazitude. If a building falls outside your gaze, it doesn’t do anything. I love this concept so much, casting you as a jobsworth supervisor king constantly leering about his kingdom to scare the serfs into quitting munching on their straw sandwiches and get back to work. The gaze limitation makes you consider which sets of buildings you’re going to want active and complimenting each other at any one time.</p>
<p>So, training soldiers takes wheat, so it makes sense to have a defense-ready quadrant with a field and a barracks. Stick a wall-repairing structure in there too, while you're at it, alongside a mine for the clay you’ll need. Ah, but you’ll also want hardier troops for later waves. But! the training building costs gold, so you’ll want a marketplace to sell wheat…and you can already see how the gaze restriction turns a standard need-and-fulfillment pipeline into a more far more involved and puzzly affair. God save the king's neck as it relentlessly spins o'er hile and vale in perpetual motion.</p>
<p>Days tick down on a timer, and you’ll be attacked by periodic waves of goblins that try to batter down your stone walls with their fists, plucky shitmunchers that they are. Those first waves take time to arrive, though, and I do sort of wish you could increase game speed from the offset. Locking convenience behind upgrades is a long-standing bugbear of mine, but there’s also a soporific rhythm to the default speed - enhanced by the warped bloops of slightly detuned synths - that’d be undercut if this was the case.</p>
<p>Anyway, you throw in a few optional spendables like increased production for ten seconds, plus a roguelike framing that lets you buy upgrades at the end of each run, and I’m hooked. Well, this hook’s big enough for the both of us, reader. Come hang. Worry about the whole impalment thing later. You can grab the free demo on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753900/The_King_is_Watching/">here</a>. As you can see from the above trailer, the full game looks way more elaborate. Also, the new king's got a Nigel Thornberry thing going on, so there's that too. </p>

            <p>We already know that you’ll be able to romance all your companions in the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. Sounds a bit synthetic on the surface, right? Even fantastic games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> suffered from this overly obliging approach to relationships. A game letting you tell your own tales is dandy and all, but those stories don’t mean much if the cast feel like input/output affection bots, ready to drop trou like a clumsy Levis temp once you’ve adequately filled their invisible bonkometer.</p>

<p>However! It seems like The Veilguard’s romances won’t be as simple as spamming the dialogue option for 'the way that darkspawn's cursed blood on your hair reflected the moonlight was hot'. “We wanted to lean into not just the relationships the characters have with you but the relationships they have with each other,” game director Corinne Busche told <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/08/how-romance-and-relationships-work-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Game Informer</a>. Those relationships extend to romances, says Busche. If you ignore a companion’s affections, it sounds like they might well turn their attention towards other members of your party.</p>
<p>Each companion, write GI, has their own relationship level with Rook, the player character. This will change based on conversations, sure, but also how Rook interacts with the world. I’m less enthused about the idea of ‘ranking up’ your companions' relationship level to unlock skill points. Again, it all feels dryly synthetic, like the way you’d end up effectively grinding moral choices in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition">Mass Effect</a> series. Still, Busche notes that platonic relationships also contribute to the companion levels and skill points, saying that you’ll “learn who these characters are in how their romances unfold."</p>
<p>Game Informer have published a wealth of detailed information on what to expect from The Veilguard when it launches in Fall 2024. They recently shared some details about the game’s difficulty customisation options, which look <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguards-customisable-difficulties-look-genuinely-great-for-accessibility">genuinely great for accessibility</a>. Edwin said he’d make me write nothing but COD update posts (the games blogger equivalent of peeling potatoes in the brig, only less nutritious) until the end of time if I didn’t mention that his own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">hands-off preview</a> is the only information you really need though.</p>
<p>Former Dragon Age lead writer David Gaider recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-ages-former-lead-writer-has-many-mostly-positive-thoughts-on-veilguards-romance-options-story-and-environments">shared some thoughts</a> on The Veilguard. He was a big fan of how evocative the city of Minrathous was, saying that he wished “we could have done this for Kirkwall or even Val Royeaux. Utterly gorgeous.” Still, he expressed concern about the choice to make every character romanceable. "The Dragon Age writers realized, eventually, that as soon as you make a character romanceable it limits the type of character they can be and the types of stories they can tell. They become beholden to their romance arc and their need to, ultimately, be appealing,” wrote Gaider.</p>
<p>"Why is that a limitation? Because not all character story arcs are defined by being appealing to the player. Even if the appeal of an arc is for a relatively limited audience, the requirement of having appeal inherently restricts the potential stories to a fairly limited band." The line between giving the player what they want and focusing on authorial intent is a fine ol' one indeed, but there's no reason why we can't have both. Probably <a href="https://youtu.be/c06ow9Qe5b8">don't try that</a> in the game though. </p>

			<p>Creative Assembly and SEGA have announced a surprise for fans of Total War: Pharaoh. Later this month, owners of the real-time strategy game will receive a free expansion-sized standalone title called Total War: Pharaoh - Dynasties.</p>
<p>Game Director Todor Nikolov said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>From the outset of our design journey on Total War: Pharaoh, our vision has always been to deliver a grand-scale recreation of the turbulent Bronze Age Collapse; one brimming with historical intrigue, authentic representations of iconic civilisation, and a sandbox theatre that allows you to rewrite the course of human history. We’re very proud of what we’ve achieved, and whilst this will be our final content addition, we hope it serves as a love letter that encapsulates our continued passion for this wonderful age. Thanks for your support.</em></p>
<p>Total War: Pharaoh - Dynasties will be released for PC on July 25, while Feral Interactive is already preparing the macOS version, which should be released shortly afterward.</p>
<p>Here's a summary of what players can expect in this freebie:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 new major factions</li>
<li>25 new minor factions</li>
<li>150+ new and reworked units, including cavalry</li>
<li>168 new settlements Expanded Campaign map (1.8x bigger)</li>
<li>New battle mechanics e.g., Lethality</li>
<li>New DYNASTIES family tree system</li>
<li>Fixes for Legacy bugs</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Total War: PHARAOH - Dynasties Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6erHiCuh1tQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Do note that Total War: Pharaoh - Dynasties is launched through a separate app from your Steam library and cannot be purchased as a standalone game. Save files won't carry over from the base game, and there is no cross-progression. Dynasties will require around 80GB of free disk space, but the good news is you won't have to keep the base Total War: Pharaoh installed to play it.</p>
<p>The Blood &amp; Sand DLC works with Dynasties. On the other hand, a new version of the Assembly Kit is required for Dynasties mods, so legacy mods for Pharaoh will have to be updated via the new kit and re-uploaded to the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2951630/workshop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynasties Steam workshop page</a> to work.</p>
<p>Total War: Pharaoh debuted in October 2023. Our resident strategy fan Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-pharaoh-sands-of-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave it 9 out of 10</a>:</p>
<p><em>Total War: Pharaoh is a successful return to pure history for the series. While some may not like aspects, such as a limited unit variety and a map that can feel a little narrow in areas, the gameplay is enhanced across the board thanks to a variety of features, increased tactical options in combat, and more.</em></p>

<p>As revealed by Japanese outlet Famitsu, and spotted by <a href="http://ryokutya2089.com/archives/77375" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryokutya2089</a>, (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/07/double-dragon-3d-revival-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-and-pc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked up</a> by Gematsu), the Japanese studio is currently working on a new 3D entry in the popular beat 'em up video game series for current-gen consoles, past-gen consoles as well as PC (PS5, Xbox Series, PS4, Xbox One, and PC). According to Famitsu, this new 3D entry will aims to retain the thrill of old school <a title="Genres > Side-Scrolling [709 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a>&nbsp;<a title="Genres > Action [1,996 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a>, with updated controls and difficulty settings for the modern era.</p>

The game received various sequels for Arcade and home platforms, including Double Dragon II for the NES in 1991. In 1992, Super Double Dragon was released for the SNES. Various other installment and spin-offs have since been released with the Arc System Works acquiring the rights to the IP in 2015. In 2017, the studio released <a href="https://wccftech.com/double-dragon-iv-announced-pc-ps4-launch-january-30th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Double Dragon IV</a> for PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>
<p>"The next entry in the side-scrolling action game series Double Dragon is finally here!<br>
The story picks up after the elimination of the Shadow Warriors in Double Dragon II", Arc System Works wrote in 2016.</p>

<p>Recently, gamers were celebrating National Video Game Day, and a social media campaign saw many brands asking users what their favourite game of all time was. One unlikely Hollywood star popped into the trend to make his feelings known, revealing a title that’s not representative of the edgy, intimidating characters he’s known to play on the big screen.</p>



<p>Danny Trejo’s favourite video game of all time is Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-wasn-t-expecting-that">Wasn’t Expecting That</h2>



<p>Danny Trejo is no stranger to the world of gaming. He has appeared in several roles over the years that have taken him from Far Cry to Call of Duty, and his acting career spans more than forty years. It turns out he’s partial to playing games, too – the  80-year-old star revealed that his favourite game of all time is Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p>



<p>It seems bizarre to some that one of the toughest actors in Hollywood, who is partial to playing utterly badass characters, loves such a cutesy game.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch-exclusive title was released in 2020 to an overwhelmingly positive reception, with many users pouring onto the platform to create an ersatz life in place of the one they’d had restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It became a global sensation, with players worldwide using the freedom of New Horizons to create wonderful islands for others to explore.</p>



<p>Danny Trejo loves Animal Crossing, it seems. Fans of the game took to the comments <a href="https://x.com/officialDannyT/status/1810344789097000974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">under Danny’s post</a> to ask him a string of questions concerning his island, his favourite villager, or how many bells he’s amassed, but the actor hasn’t responded to any follow-up comments just yet.</p>

<p>BioShock 4 – which isn’t the official name of the developing title – is a long time coming. It has now been more than a decade since the last BioShock game hit the market, and fans of the franchise are <strong>hungry </strong>for something new. Ken Levine’s Judas should help fill the gap for a while, but a new BioShock game is long overdue – and 2K’s Cloud Chamber studio is looking to right that wrong by hiring en masse to flesh out the team working on the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-just-give-us-something">Just Give Us Something</h2>



<p>BioShock is a fantastic franchise beloved by millions, and the origins of the series stretch back almost twenty years. It’s a three-part franchise that toys with reality, giving players fantastical powers and presenting them with immersive stories that unfold in almost mythical locations: a city deep under the ocean and an entire civilisation living in the clouds on airships, for example. </p>



<p>It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshock-developer-ramping-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was recently discovered</a> that work on the next BioShock game is ramping up, with 2K Cloud Chamber, the studio working on the project, posting 30 open positions covering everything from cinematics to narrative. With these positions opening up, it seems unlikely that the development of ‘BioShock 4’ is too far down the line, and last year, a report emerged suggesting that the game had found itself in ‘development hell’.</p>



<p>In May 2023, it was claimed that writing a ‘worthy script’ had been one of the biggest issues with the game’s development, but it was also mentioned that the game was ‘on track’ to release in 2025, which now seems unlikely. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-partners-sony-palworld/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-partners-sony-palworld/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Pocketpair has just made two announcements, the first of which concerns a partnership in the form of a joint venture with Sony Music Entertainment and Aniplex focused on the development of Palworld. It was revealed that through this joint venture, Palworld Entertainment Inc. has been founded ‘for the purpose of accelerating the multifaceted global development of Palworld and its further expansion.’</p>



<p>It was also announced that a line of Palworld merchandise is being created and will soon be available to pre-order from Aniplex Online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-getting-bigger">Getting Bigger</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Pocketpair revealed the joint venture between itself and Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) that’s poised to ‘promote new developments of Palworld’. Presently, Palworld isn’t available on PlayStation, but recently, comments from the leadership team at the company suggested it’s only a matter of time before it comes to the platform. This partnership could be a step in the right direction.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that this joint venture <strong>specifically mentions </strong>that <a href="https://pwe.jp/news/?article_id=65765">game licenses aren’t included</a> as part of the deal – but that doesn’t mean there aren’t plans to align further down the road. It’s not like PlayStation and Sony Music sit under the same roof, but it’s the closest we’ve been yet to an announcement that Palworld is coming to PS platforms.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end with merchandise, either. Fans are expecting something like a Palworld anime to surface in the future, which would challenge the paradigm established by Pokémon to no end. Despite Nintendo not being bothered by Palworld’s existence, edging into the territory of merchandise could mean that trading cards, plushies, and other items emerge soon that start edging a little too close to Pokémon’s world for comfort.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Just as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review-ffxiv">Endwalker</a> opened with you and the crew setting sail for the distant city of Old Sharlayan, Final Fantasy XIV’s Dawntrail expansion kicks off with a long cruise to a place we’ve never been before. But instead of connecting with a long-referenced society, you step into an entire region no one from Eorzea knows very much about. From the outset, venturing into the Mesoamerican and Latin American-inspired land of Tural might lead you to believe that this is a summer vacation for a band of heroes that has saved entire realms from calamity. However, I can assure you that whatever you thought Dawntrail was, that’s exactly what it’s not. It’s the start of a new era for the MMO, and the growing pains of that transition can be apparent at times – but Dawntrail manages to prove once again why FFXIV is the standard-bearer for the Final Fantasy series.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>This latest expansion explores culture, family, and legacy in ways FFXIV hasn’t in the past – and before long, it begins to ask questions about the lengths we’ll go to preserve the things we hold dearest. On the surface, that will sound familiar to anyone who has stuck around all these years, but Dawntrail takes its own angle on these themes as to not retread well-worn territory. Instead, it offers new perspectives that, at times, hit just as hard as anything in the MMO’s 14-year history. The main scenario quest (MSQ) takes you in unpredictable directions, blending its deep real-world influences with high-tech sci-fi that incorporates concepts seen in the cyberpunk genre, and then manages to weave in the Final Fantasies of yore and have it all still make sense.</p><p>It takes some work to get there, however. I appreciate the groundwork Dawntrail lays in the first half of the main questline, painting such a vivid picture of Tural with all its cultural context at the forefront. Deep cuts are tucked underneath the more obvious references to the inspirations it draws from – we all know what tacos and mezcal are, but having a quest focus on the in-world cochinita pibil recipe is one example of several nice touches. From the architecture of the hub city of Tuliyollal to the vibrant environmental design of its early zones, Dawntrail wears its influences on its sleeve, naturally fitting those societies and the peoples who embody them into an already-rich fantasy world.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>At critical points, I was reminded that FFXIV always gets me in my feelings in ways no other piece of fiction can, game or otherwise.</p></div><p>But for as fascinating as the cultural exploration is, there’s a noticeable lack of momentum in the way you experience the story, which doesn’t surprise me given the nature of establishing a whole new story arc. For roughly the first half of MSQ, you travel across the lands of Tural alongside a new character named Wuk Lamat, a naive but always-optimistic female Hrothgar who has a heart of gold. She’s in the middle of an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-is-like-playing-a-great-one-piece-game">anime-like tournament arc</a> against her siblings in hopes of becoming the new Dawnservant, or ruler, of Tural. This leads you to gain an intimate connection with the region’s people and bridge gaps between the seemingly disparate societies of each zone. It's structured so that you go through similar motions for very long stretches, and the story itself in the early goings is written in a way that’s uncharacteristically surface-level. Not everything needs to be poetic and profound (and Dawntrail eventually gets there), but conflicts are brought up and resolved in a rather simplistic manner that isn’t as powerful as the story seems to want you to feel they are. Instead, I found unraveling the complicated relationships between the siblings to be one of the highlights in the front half, which is an interesting dynamic that remains consistent throughout.</p><p>Initially, I was quite surprised that Wuk Lamat is essentially the main character of Dawntrail while you, as the Warrior of Light, and your Scion friends are put in supporting roles. However, she <em>is </em>the link that connects you to the new region and having her as your lens while being part of her traveling band provides the necessary context as for why you’re involved in the first place (other than not having much to do back in Eorzea and seeking adventure for the sake of it). I like Wuk Lamat as a character since she has the heart to carry Dawntrail’s themes, but she isn’t really given the depth needed to be a de facto protagonist. FFXIV hasn’t really used this kind of approach to its characters before – even as the Warrior of Light, the supporting cast has always played their part in uplifting the story as a whole. The closest thing in past expansions is the Crystal Exarch from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/12/ffxiv-shadowbringers-review">Shadowbringers</a>, but his personality immediately shined and his impact was unmistakable whether he was on-screen or not. So, when Wuk Lamat extolls the virtues of peace without fully grasping the nuances that come with that, it tends to ring hollow.</p><p>With a tinge of shonen-style “power of friendship” energy, Dawntrail has its heart in the right place – and although it sometimes seems superficial, it’s nice to have a story that outright says that embracing our differences and engaging in an honest cultural exchange would make the world a better place, which Wuk Lamat does represents admirably. Its quest structure can sometimes be unexciting, but I’m hesitant to say that FFXIV is finally showing its limitations or anything because I’ve seen quests (main and optional) be truly creative within the confines of its MMO bounds over the years. Rather, it’s apparent that Dawntrail’s storytelling priorities mean it has a lot to get through while moving you along at a pace that tries not to drag on too much.</p><p>There were a few times where I began to question what Dawntrail was really building towards. Every expansion has a sense of momentum to it right from the beginning, and this one’s new start presents a challenge that FFXIV hasn’t really had to face since <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/11/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-review">A Realm Reborn</a>. However, some well-designed dungeons, engaging boss fights with fresh battle mechanics, and hype moments in story-based solo instances kept me engaged and invested – and if anything, I was just happy to be along for the ride. That’s also because I knew I would inevitably hit a turning point in Dawntrail, like all of FFXIV expansions tend to have – and when I got there, it left me floored with revelations that ripple throughout the MMO’s long history.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Michael Higham's Personal Final Fantasy Rankings</h3><p>To be clear, I do like every entry listed in here.</p></div><p>The switch flipped in the second half, which ushers you into FFXIV’s version of the old-timey American West. Hearing a Texan accent, let alone an American one, in FFXIV for the first time gave me whiplash on the same level as any plot twist. It’s charming as hell how another piece of the real world effortlessly blends into the rest of the expansion’s personality. That’s also to say that what it has up its sleeve deeper in creates a stark contrast that is both conceptually and aesthetically superb. The high-tech sci-fi aspect of Dawntrail is pretty well-known in the lead up to its release – the main city of Solution Nine was revealed well beforehand, but it’s the reasons for bringing you there that make for quintessential FFXIV storytelling. It goes for some wild swings, and in this second half, contains truly stunning moments I’m still trying to wrap my head around.</p><p>It fills me with joy to be genuinely surprised by a game I thought I’d known so well. Having been so invested in FFXIV for all these years and carrying many of my favorite story moments into my own life, I can’t always expect it to keep reaching those highs. Yet, Dawntrail does it again – perhaps not as consistently or elegantly, but it has left a significant impact nonetheless. It questions what makes family important, asks why we harbor such resentment for those different from us, and shows what’s possible when we work together. More effectively, it also builds on the questions posed in Shadowbringers and Endwalker, about how we handle loss, mortality, and the inevitable passage of time sweeping away the things we hold dear – and the uncomfortable truth that we ascribe value to life because it <em>will </em>end. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This expansion is a worthy extension of FFXIV, and it leaves a world of fascinating possibilities. </p></div><p>At critical points, I was reminded that FFXIV always gets me in my feelings in ways no other piece of fiction can, game or otherwise. Much of that can be attributed to the fact that certain characters I’ve loved continue to grow and be voices of reason to give clarity when everything else in my life feels like utter chaos. Yes, you are venturing into new and compelling beginnings in a land foreign to the characters you’ve been with for years, but Dawntrail is made stronger for the way it remembers where it came from.</p><p>Part of me feels like Dawntrail conjoins two very different halves, and I often imagine the depth to which FFXIV could have explored its larger themes had it dedicated more time to one or the other. But with just enough connective tissue for its hard-hitting moments to not ring hollow, it’s able to land with the same kind of impact that previous expansions have, and for its own reasons. If there’s one particular theme to point toward, it’s that peace isn’t just the absence of war but a two-way street that must be worked for – whether that be peace in the world or the struggle for inner peace amid indelible heartbreak and tragedy. </p><p>For all its shortcomings in the earlier hours, it certainly makes good on the ideas it tries to build. The way Dawntrail wields its final zone as a storytelling device, conceptually and visually, left me shocked and with my stomach in knots. The absolute onslaught of its last few dungeons had me on the edge of my seat frantically executing my attack rotation. The creative battle mechanics that even surprised me as a long-time Savage raider left me grinning as I took those Damage Down debuffs like a champ. And to have fought almost all those battles alongside my favorite characters through the Duty Support system let these gameplay sequences also shine as peaks in its storytelling.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The emotional core that always ushers FFXIV’s best moments is found in its music. Composer Masayoshi Soken alongside the sound team has broken new ground for the MMO, and for Final Fantasy as a series, here in Dawntrail. The Spanish and Latin American influences have been effortlessly woven into the songs that fill the new zones and towns with wonder and excitement, and the Flamenco-style battle theme is stuck in my head as I write this. The wistful melodies of the old western guitar riffs in Xak Tural standout as catchy tunes that set an unmistakable mood. Then you have synth-infused metal and trance tracks for pivotal battles that pack a punch unlike anything else in Dawntrail’s eclectic soundtrack. And yes, there are some really sweet lo-fi beats to chill or study to. Oh, and let’s not forget the jazzy swing theme of the new hub city of Tuliyollal. Regardless of style, Soken and company create incredible music that bends, fuses, and elevates genres while consistently incorporating the classical musical themes that naturally become part of the storytelling experience – just another common W for FFXIV.</p><p>Story may be at the forefront of Dawntrail’s launch, but with a new expansion comes tons of new content on top – most notably the two new Jobs: Pictomancer and Viper. After leveling Pictomancer and perfecting its attack rotation full of adorable painting abilities turned destructive, it’s become one of my all-time favorite expansion Jobs. Pictomancer is so cute, so unserious, and so much damn fun to play as. It finds a middle ground between its magic DPS counterparts Black Mage and Summoner; not so complex that you’ll struggle to learn but not so simple that you’ll mindlessly cycle through your rotation. Popping your paintings pre-pull is an adorable visual, as is dropping Moogle poms before whipping out a magic hammer to crush your foes. It’s satisfying when you line up all the cooldowns and casts while bouncing between the different spells you’re expected to execute, and as of now, it sits pretty high on the DPS charts (although some tweaks are planned to mitigate certain exploits).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pictomancer is so cute, so unserious, and so much damn fun to play as.</p></div><p>Viper on the other hand isn’t quite as exciting as I’d hoped – maybe it’s because I’ve played melee DPS for most of my time in FFXIV and have stuck with Ninja through every raid tier. But in contrast to Pictomancer, it lacks that rewarding buildup and burst window, or even a distinct personality to make it stand out within a crowded field of DPS Jobs. Don’t get me wrong, it looks cool as hell to see a Viper swap between dual swords and the double-sided blade, but when compared to Reaper (which shares similarities), the dynamic of Viper’s branching attack rotation doesn’t quite reach those satisfying heights. At launch, the development team even said that it’ll be reworking Viper, and although it’s impossible to say how that might change the core concept of the Job, there is certainly potential for it to grow into a better one.</p><p>As per usual, there are two Expert-level dungeons in the post-game, both of which make good use of the more whimsical settings of Dawntrail and experiment with a few new battle mechanics. And although I’m still progressing through them as of writing this, the Extreme trials currently available stretch the base-level boss fights into wild and chaotic battles. The other important piece of content worth mentioning are the role quests, which carry on the tradition of providing additional backstory based on the Jobs you have leveled up. They’re not quite as defining as the ones seen in Shadowbringers or Endwalker, but they are worth seeing through and add a nice touch to tie in other parts of FFXIV. The lasting legacy of Dawntrail also lies in future patch content – the Arcadion raid series, the Beastmaster special Job, Cosmic Exploration, and all the new things the FFXIV team will roll out over the next two years. I’ll be sat ready for them when they arrive, but for now, Dawntrail has earned its place in the pantheon of great expansions.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Dawntrail has some growing pains and notable lulls as it establishes a new era for Final Fantasy XIV, but the compelling cultures of the Tural region are strong enough to carry you to its greater moments – it’s also nice to see real-world influences near and dear to me represented so well in FFXIV. And though it takes a bit to get there, once the main story flips the switch and shows you what it’s really about, it hits the kinds of peaks we’ve seen from the MMORPG time and time again. Dawntrail left me floored with a unique sense of self-reflection and stunned by spectacular combat encounters, and to go through that journey with characters I’ve grown to love, both new and old, proves that this experience can only exist in the form that it does. This expansion is a worthy extension of FFXIV, and it leaves a world of fascinating possibilities for the future. Dawntrail doesn’t forget that this is a Final Fantasy story, and the way it ties in its past, present, and future makes for incredible moments that continue to uplift and define the series.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Xbox Game Pass service is undergoing, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-tier-changes-cod/">rumored</a>, some major changes, and some them will go into effect in just a few hours.</p>
<p>Today, Microsoft confirmed that from July 10th, the price for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Core, and PC Games Pass will be <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/42/85/42850801-4997-491d-a5bd-69c5bd7948ac.pdf?n=FINAL%20Game%20Pass%20price%20updates%20by%20country%20and%20currency.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased globally</a>. In the United States, for example, the price for Game Pass Ultimate will be increased from $16.00 to $19.99 for the monthly subscription and from $59.99 to $74.99 for the 12-month subscription, while the Game Pass PC subscription will see a monthly price increase from $9.99 to $11.99. The price for recurring charges will be increased after September 12th to give users the chance to cancel their subscriptions before the price increase goes into effect for them.</p>
<p>In addition to price increases, Microsoft also confirmed today that Game Pass for consoles will no longer be available for new members starting tomorrow, and a new option called Xbox Game Pass Standard will be introduced in the coming months. This option includes Xbox Live Gold multiplayer and grants access to Xbox's back catalog, but it will not include day-one games and cloud gaming. Those already subscribed to Game Pass for consoles and have automatic renewal will be able to continue enjoying their membership.</p>
<p>Aside from the Standard option, console players will still be able to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Core, which grants access to multiplayer on consoles. Its annual price, as mentioned above, will increase from $59.99 to $74.99, but its monthly price will remain the same, $9.99.&nbsp; More information on the changes announced today can be found <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024">here.</a></p>
