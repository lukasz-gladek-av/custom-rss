            <p>Here's a new date for your bumper summer line up of video game showcases: Konami has today announced its own livestream, which will give us all a fresh look at both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>.</p>
<p>The showcase - known as Konami Press Start - is scheduled for this coming Thursday, 12th June. It will air at 2pm here in the UK, so that's 6:00am PT / 9:00am ET / 3:00pm CEST.</p>
<p>The whole thing is expected to last for around 37 minutes, Konami has said. While the studio namechecked both Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill f, it also promised "and more" during that time. </p>

<p>In a statement <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1932075231885382103">posted on X</a>, Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed that the movie was being delayed "for production reasons". The film's original release date was 26th March 2027, so it's only a few extra weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682661/nintendo-switch-2-early-hands-on-mario-kart-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Now that I’ve had a Nintendo Switch 2 in my hands for a few days, I can say pretty confidently that this feels a lot like a Switch. You know, only more. The differences between console generations have become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review">increasingly blurry</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review">over the</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review">last few years</a>, and Nintendo’s latest device is the blurriest yet. It really is just a bigger, more powerful Switch. It’s not a radical update to Nintendo’s portable console — but it is a pleasant one.</p><p>There are some elements I still need to test properly for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679346/nintendo-switch-2-review-guidelines-plan-launch">our full review</a> — like the mouse controls and GameChat social features — but after an entire weekend spent playing a lot of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, and a bunch of other games, I can also tell that it’ll be pretty hard going back to the original Switch.</p><p>Here are some of my initial thoughts.</p><div><p id="a-seamless-transition"><h2>A seamless transition</h2></p></div><p>One of the best trends in modern gaming is how your library is able to move along with you when you upgrade your hardware. This has never been a strong suit for Nintendo, which historically has forced users to start over from scratch with a new device. But the company seems to have gotten it right with the Switch 2. After logging into my Nintendo account and spending 15 minutes transferring the contents of my OLED Switch over to the Switch 2, everything was there. Even my online accounts, like with <em>Fortnite</em>, were already logged in, and the old games worked just as they did before.</p><p>It may seem like a basic thing — and it is — but it’s nice that Nintendo made this part of the process much more seamless this time around.</p><div><p id="big-games-are-big-in-more-ways-than-one"><h2>Big games are big in more ways than one</h2></p></div><p>One of the promises of the Switch 2 is that larger games, particularly big open-world titles, can now run much better on the beefed up hardware. I’ve been testing this so far by putting a few hours into <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. And while it obviously doesn’t look as good as it does on a high-end PC, PlayStation, or Xbox, it still looks and runs pretty great. I haven’t noticed any major issues with the game either in docked or handheld mode. The game doesn’t look as sharp when playing on a portable, and I spotted the odd blurry texture on in-game billboards, but it ran nice and smooth otherwise.</p><p>The flipside is that the Switch 2 now has some pretty hefty file sizes to deal with. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is nearly 60GB, while <em>Street Fighter 6</em> is 49.2GB, and <em>Fortnite</em> is 37.8GB. That’s smaller than on a PS5, for example, where blockbuster games are often pushing 100GB, but it does mean I’ve already had to manage my software to make things fit.</p><div><p id="hardware-size-hasnt-been-an-issue"><h2>Hardware size hasn’t been an issue</h2></p></div><p>The other size differences — the bigger screen and heavier hardware — haven’t been an issue for me so far. I sat out in the sun playing <em>Mario Kart World</em> until the battery was nearly dead, and I didn’t really notice any discomfort, aside from the sore right thumb that is the price of playing <em>Mario Kart</em> with any degree of intensity. My 12-year-old also spent two hours playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679031/pokemon-violet-scarlet-switch-2-update-hands-on">the upgraded <em>Pokémon Violet</em></a> and claimed it was a comfortable experience, but that might’ve just been a ploy for more screentime.</p><div><p><cite>Photo: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="the-joy-cons-are-very-satisfying"><h2>The Joy-Cons are very satisfying</h2></p></div><p>Functionally, the new controllers are almost identical. Although I have to admit, I keep hitting the GameChat button when I mean to press Home. So there’s been a little bit of relearning muscle memory there. But the best part is the new magnetic connectors, which are extremely satisfying to snap into the Switch 2 and its controller grip. The big, chunky button on the back feels very good to press, to the point that I’ve found myself fiddling with it while waiting for things to load.</p><div><p id="shareable-screenshots-finally"><h2>Shareable screenshots, finally</h2></p></div><p>This may be a niche concern, but as someone who takes a lot of screenshots while I play games — so I can share important details about <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/andrewrweb.bsky.social/post/3lr4s6qbskc2l">public transportation in the Mushroom Kingdom</a> — it’s great that they’re so much easier to share now. Before, I had to scan two different QR codes to get them on my phone. Now, I just click the upload button, and they appear in the Switch mobile app. It works essentially the same way as on the PS5, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/andrewrweb.bsky.social/post/3lr2f3vmo322f">which is good news for posters like me</a>.</p><div><p id="updated-games-really-look-better"><h2>Updated games really look better</h2></p></div><p>There aren’t a lot of major Switch 2 exclusives at launch, but there are a lot of existing games that have been enhanced for the new hardware. My colleagues have already written about how much better <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/681222/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-hands-on"><em>Fortnite </em>play on the Switch 2</a>. I agree that both of those are solid upgrades, and I even played through <em>Fortnite</em>’s most recent live event on the Switch 2 without any issues.</p><p>But I’ve also been spending a whole lot of time in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678957/no-mans-sky-switch-2-launch-update"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/12/12454434/no-mans-sky-diaries">to nobody’s surprise</a>), and it really is a noticeable difference. While the game technically worked on the original hardware, it was also much slower and uglier than on any other platform. The Switch 2 version isn’t the best-looking, of course, but it still looks and runs great, even in portable mode.</p><p>I’ve found myself really getting lost in this virtual universe once again, which is much easier to do when you can just take it with you.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Obsidian RPG is one of my favorite games <em>ever</em>, and yet, I’ll still forget to bring it up when totting the best RPGs. It’s like it has a curse upon its name, fated to go unmentioned. But perhaps that’s finally to be lifted, with the fantastic news that it’s due to receive an Enhanced Edition from Aspyr.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195410" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="169" data-playlist="195410,196299,196903" data-current="195410"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20876.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> BioWare’s original <em>Neverwinter Nights </em>launched with its own solid 60-hour solo campaign, but the game was primarily about equipping players with the tools to create their own online D&amp;D campaigns. That’s where its legacy lies, certainly, and Aspyr subsidiary Beamdog gave that game the remastering treatment back in 2018. But Obsidian’s sequel, released four years later in 2006, flipped the script. Yes, this was also a game designed to make creating player campaigns as accessible as possible, but first and foremost, it was its single-player story, and <em>wow</em>. Featuring some of the best companion characters in any of the BioWare-likes that made up the glory years of the RPG genre, this was the tale of an orphan, raised by a master elven ranger, setting out to defeat the King of Shadows.</p><p>BioWare aided the development, much as it had for Obsidian’s other borrowed sequel, <em>Knights of the Old Republic II</em>, while the game had former Black Isle employees responsible for the extraordinary <em>Planescape: Torment</em> in prominent positions. It was a game created by a development supergroup, and it shone for it.</p><p>Of course, like so many 20-year-old games, it does feel awfully clunky now, so it’s excellent news to hear Aspyr is giving it a remaster. Here’s the trailer, but don’t get over-excited at the opening moments—that’s just a new rendered cutscene:</p><p>Rather crucially, this is going to ship with all the expansion packs, and given we’re talking about a game from 2006, that doesn’t mean a bunch of new outfits and a bonus gun skin—<em>Mask of the Betrayer</em>, a DLC expansion released in 2007, is a whole new three-act story featuring the same characters, but with new spells and abilities, and it was wonderful. Then, 2008 saw <em>Storm of Zehir</em>, which wasn’t quite as solid, but was a great last hurrah for D&amp;D’s 3.5 ruleset. Lastly, there was 2009's <em>Mysteries of Westgate</em>, which wasn’t created by Obsidian, isn’t connected to the previous stories, and didn’t really hit at all. But for the sake of preservation, it’s great that all three expansions are receiving the same overhaul.</p><p>There’s not long to wait—the game is out July 15 across Xbox, PS5 and PC, although no signs of a mobile edition just yet. I mention that simply because the Android version of <em>KotOR</em> from Aspyr is quite so good.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo has delayed its Legend of Zelda film to later in 2027.
</p>
<p>
Originally intended for release on 26th March 2027, the live-action film will now be released on 7th May 2027.

<p>
The news was shared on social media in a statement from the company's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, citing "production reasons" for the delay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/09/abyssus-preview-shooting-stuff-underwater-together/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Abyssus is a first-person shooter roguelike that offers plenty of co-op pew-pewing, both with your friends and with randoms, but despite having some really interesting aspects to the game flow and weapon design, it might not be doing quite enough to stand out from the preposterously huge crowd that it’s a part of. To tell the truth, I don’t know how any incoming game can manage it though, so it might not be an issue.</p>
<p><iframe title="Abyssus | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vnAWfATPH3I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The standout feature of Abyssus is its setting. This is a “brinepunk” world, which basically means we’re dealing with underwater stuff and have some big old helmets protecting us. It’s a bit eldritch in its design, or at least will feel that way for anyone who’s played any of the Call of Cthulhu games. The enemies here aren’t unknowable horrors, though; they’re mostly just little golem guys.</p>


<p>While there is some enemy variety, the end result of nearly all of them doesn’t offer much actual change in how you approach them. You just have to shoot stuff, and while some will run after you and some will attack from range, it’s rare that an enemy outside of a boss encounter will actually challenge you to do anything more than start blasting.</p>


<p>Of course, a key part of any roguelike is build variety that changes how you play, and here that’s dictated by a couple of choices. The first of these is your loadout. You can choose from among a few different weapons and then augment those weapons to have different behaviours, secondary fire options, and abilities. Then, when you’re actually in a run, you find obelisks to get power from that are all elementally themed. You can diversify these for lots of different options, or if you’re lucky, you can commit to a single element and just get a huge boost in power.</p>
<p>I don’t think that these do enough to really feel diverse, though. Sure, a wind explosion looks different to a shadow explosion, but does it really matter? No, not especially. You’re not really changing the way that you play the game with any of these power-ups, that’s mostly done via your weapon selection. The result is that, as with the enemies, runs just feel kind of samey.</p>

<p>None of these feels bad, though. I realise it probably feels like I dislike this game because I’ve been complaining about it, but that’s not the case. Abyssus is a fine game with beautiful graphics and a really fun setting. Yet it doesn’t do enough to push beyond that into the realms of a truly great game. Of course, these are early days and there’s sure to be more beyond what’s on show in the Steam Next Fest demo.</p>
<p>There’s a chance that a lot of this gets mucked about with between now and the full release of the game in August, and I hope that it does, because I always want games to be good. As it stands though, Abyssus is a pretty standard FPS roguelike that’s got a lot of interesting concepts, but not enough clean execution and variety.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-genki-sleeper-case-a-virtually-indestructible-switch-2-carry-case-that-looks-as-good-as-it-protects.1213329/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-sleeper-case-a-virtually-indestructible-switch-2-carry-case-that-looks-as-good-as-it-protects<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Review: Genki Sleeper Case 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/360ca88f5e6f7/review-genki-sleeper-case-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>When you've got a shiny new handheld like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a>, getting a good carry case is of the utmost importance. However, not all carry cases are created equal; some are fine when it comes to providing a modicum of protection on the move, while others are built with a little more robustness. I'm pleased to report that <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/sleeper-case">Genki's Sleeper Case</a> ($42.99 / £36) is definitely in the latter camp and perhaps represents one of the best Switch 2 cases on the market right now.</p>
<p>The first thing that struck me when I removed the Sleeper Case from its packaging was just how sturdy it felt. According to Genki, the case is constructed with "materials trusted in motorsport gear", and it certainly feels that way.</p>
<p>The case has surprisingly little flex when completely closed and is apparently "crush-proof", according to the manufacturer. Genki says it's "virtually indestructible" and that it has even taken hammers to the case to test its strength, although it advises against customers trying the same thing. I wasn't going to try, to be honest, but I can certainly believe the Sleeper Case is capable of withstanding some severe punishment.</p>

<p>What makes this case remarkable is that, despite its robust nature, the external wool coating feels pretty welcoming. This material is apparently specially treated to resist water, stains, and abrasions. It looks great, in my opinion, and certainly stands out from your typical Switch 2 case. On the back, there's an elasticated strip that you can fit your fingers through, giving you additional grip when you're carrying the case around.</p>
<p>The ability to resist water extends to the "incognito" zipper, which, when fully closed, is almost impossible to see. There's a tradeoff here, however; the zipper system is quite tight and often difficult to close. This way well ease up over time, but it takes a fair bit of effort to engage it fully.</p>
<p>Inside the case, your Switch 2 console is presented with a reasonably snug fit. It's not as tight as some other cases, and there's a little room for movement because the case is designed to accept your Switch 2 with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">Attack Vector modular case</a> installed (however, you can only use the smallest 'feather' grips with this case; the other two grips are too wide to fit).</p>

<p>The screen is protected by a flap which doubles as a holder for a whopping 18 Game Cards (Nintendo's official case can only hold six). It's brilliant to have that amount of game storage built into the case as it means I don't have to take additional Game Card holders on the road with me. But it also makes me somewhat worried about misplacing or losing the Sleeper Case when I'm out and about, as that's a <em>lot</em> of monetary value at risk.</p>
<p>All things considered, though, the Genki Sleeper Case is one of the best options on the market when it comes to Switch 2 storage and transport. It's smart, rugged and has plenty of space for games inside, making it a fantastic alternative to Nintendo's official offering.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-out-this-year-team-cherry-confirms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hollow Knight Silksong continues to be one of the most anticipated indie games because, in the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c"> six years since its first reveal</a>, it's still not out.</p>
<p>But it will be out this year, according to developer Team Cherry. We've known that the studio has been targeting a 2025 release date, partly because there will be a playable version of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-can-play-hollow-knight-silksong-in-september-2025-at-a-museum-in-australia-that-is/">in an Australian museum this coming September</a>. However, following the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 event and the reveal of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, Team Cherry has made a new statement confirming that Silksong will indeed arrive this year.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally reveal had Hollow Knight fans confused, as the reveal for the new handheld almost exclusively showcased Hollow Knight Silksong gameplay, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M3QwLBrg8g&amp;t=2370s">Xbox president Sarah Bond followed up by saying,</a> "<em>The highly anticipated Hollow Knight Silksong will be available at launch, and in Game Pass, when the Ally releases later this year</em>."</p>
<p>Fans were quick to jump on that, and presumed that once we have a release date for the ROG Xbox Ally, we'll have our Silksong release date. That's not exactly the case, though, as Team Cherry's Matthew Griffon took to the studio's official Discord server (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-cherry-confirms-hollow-knight-silksong-is-coming-this-year-following-xbox-games-showcase">Eurogamer</a>) to clarify that Silksong's release is not tied to the launch of any device, but the game will arrive this year, before the holiday season.</p>
<p>"<em>I confirmed before holiday,</em>" Griffon wrote. "<em>We are not tied to a console release</em>."</p>
<p>That means we'll have a release date at some point between now and the end of the year. Which is about as vague as the release date for Silksong has always been, but at least this time, it really feels like we're closing in on the game being ready for prime time. Hopefully, by Gamescom 2025, we'll have a specific release date publicly announced.</p>

Project Fantasy. MindsEye. IO Interactive has a lot going on in the coming days, months, and years. But one key franchise of theirs has been conspicuously quiet: Hitman.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not that IOI is doing <em>nothing </em>with Hitman — it did <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-hitman-co-op-mode-with-stone-and-knight-is-in-the-works-at-io-interactive" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just announce that a co-op mode is in the works</a> for the games and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-world-of-assassination-elusive-target-sees-mads-mikkelsen-reprise-iconic-casino-royale-role">Mads Mikkelsen will reprise his iconic Casino Royale role as an Elusive Target</a>. But as for new Hitman games, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-franchise-on-hiatus-as-io-interactive-focuses-on-james-bond-game">franchise has officially been on hiatus since 2023</a>. Updates aside, it seems like IOI might be getting a touch too busy to give Agent 47 more major work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I asked Hakan Abrak, CEO of IO Interactive, if that was the case when we sat down for an interview this past weekend following the reveal of 007: First Light. And he reassured me that Agent 47 was still on active duty.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Hitman series is definitely not done," Abrak said. "We're not done with Hitman. IO has been synonymous with Hitman, despite the other IPs we have done. We absolutely are proud, grateful, and happy with Hitman. But obviously doing another new IP, Project Fantasy, and doing Bond, it takes a lot of our resources and time. But as you saw, we announced the Hitman co-op, which is a big dream of mine. And they will be maybe in different shapes, but they will definitely be more Hitman in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My question to Abrak was sparked by our prior discussion of the differences between Agent 47 and James Bond. Though IO Interactive's espionage pedigree is certainly what led to the studio being trusted with the Bond license [to kill], the two heroes are quite different in practice. Bond leans more toward action, with Agent 47 preferring stealth and disguise. And while Bond certainly has a classy sense of humor, the Hitman games are renowned for being... well, pretty silly! Agent 47 dresses up in a flamingo mascot suit at one point, for Pete's sake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So will 007: First Light still have that Hitman flavor? Yes, said Abrak, but it will have a tone all its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It is very, very important to get the humor right. In Denmark, we love dark humor and the silliness because it takes away from the seriousness of being an assassin. Bond is different. Bond, the humor is first of all very British. And the humor there is to support the energy and his personality, which is much more front and center. So I would say less silly. It's not flamingo disguises, as you said, but still entertaining."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Abrak continued: "And it's a game that plays differently. It's emphasizing more action, for sure. And the structure of Bond is more like it's breathing more. Like there are more linear parts where you have the spectacle moments and exotic vehicles. And then we also give space in Bond to open up a bit and breathe a bit. So you have definitely glimpses of IO Interactive, as you would know from Hitman games as well, but it's more front foot. It's less of an analytical mind, chess play, where you sit and meticulously plan. All the clockwork things in Hitman where if you do this or do this, where Bond is more impulsive, more reckless sometimes. It's more like he's just taking things and acting and handling it more as they arise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So it's a different dynamism, because we want to make something that feels true for a Bond fantasy. So it's definitely not a re-skin of a Hitman kind of thing, but I feel that people will see IO Interactive, that is a game made by Interactive, but they will also see that this game is something else.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-spot-shigeru-miyamoto-missing-from-mario-kart-world-credits-but-it-isnt-too-much-of-a-surprise<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World's credits don't feature Nintendo's most famous designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of Mario himself. But as fans who complete the game spot Miyamoto's absence, others have pointed to his changed role of late as something of an explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In days gone by, Miyamoto's name was synonymous with much of Nintendo's gaming output. From Donkey Kong to Nintendogs, Pikmin to Pokémon, Miyamoto was in the credits for dozens of games each year. Indeed, video game credit tracking website <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/36620/shigeru-miyamoto/credits/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mobygames</a> has 20 credits for Miyamoto in games released within 2000 alone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Miyamoto's role has changed over the years, and increasingly so within the past decade after he adopted the more supervisory role of Creative Fellow at Nintendo in 2005. Once a familiar face during Nintendo Direct broadcasts, Miyamoto now most commonly appears in relation to the company's expanded reach beyond games — such as when there is news to share on Nintendo's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-bros-movie">Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, or its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/super-nintendo-world">Super Nintendo World</a> theme parks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Miyamoto's most recent game credits before the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/platform/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch are from 2024, where he is listed as a Senior Supervisor on Mario spin-off games Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership and Princess Peach: Showtime! And while Miyamoto is credited as a Supervisor on 2023's Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the company's last big Mario platformer, it was notably fellow Nintendo veterans Takashi Tezuka and Shiro Mouri who took charge of the game's development as its producer and director, respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, while Mario Kart 8 featured Miyamoto in its credits back in 2014, it's perhaps not surprising to see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> does not — and simply being the original creator of Mario isn't a factor. (Miyamoto wasn't credited for the more recent spin-off Mario Kart Tour, either.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another familiar name not in Mario Kart World's credits is voice actor <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-and-toads-veteran-voice-actor-says-nintendo-told-her-shed-been-replaced-on-switch-2-launch-day-as-mario-kart-world-released-without-her-in-it">Samantha Kelly, who discovered her 18-year tenure as Super Mario characters Princess Peach and Toad was over on Nintendo Switch 2 launch day</a>, when Mario Kart World released without her in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images.</em>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps-makes-me-feel-bad-that-i-stopped-meditating.1213302/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Baby Steps</em>, a being-bad-at-walking simulator by developers behind games like <em>QWOP</em>, <em>Ape Out</em>, and <em>Getting Over It</em>, got a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281040/Baby_Steps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> during yesterday's PC Gaming Show. It's a slice of the beginning of the game that tasks you to go from Point A to Point B, and it would have made me tear my hair out if I still had hair.</p><p><em>Baby Steps</em> stars a schlub named Nate, who is suddenly whisked from his basement couch into some kind of mysterious wasteland. The game's Steam description calls him "an unemployed failson with nothing going for him;" he whines and worries as you guide him on his new adventure, and he's surprisingly incurious about where he's ended up and the people he meets there. Those people are energetic and welcoming, but Nate just wants to leave.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Baby Steps | Demo Trailer | Play the Steam Demo Now 👶🏽 🦶🏽" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zk-OFadZeIM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>To do so, you have to steer him up a mountain, moving one foot at a time with your controller triggers. I didn't find this motion too hard to come to grips with, but it required my continued attention to avoid sending him sprawling. One of my most memorable moments with the demo came when, well up the slope and feeling a bit self-congratulatory, I fell, tipping off the side of the stairs I was climbing and into a muddy ditch. I then slid the <em>entire</em> length of that ditch, unable to do anything but kick my legs feebly until I ended up all the way back at the bottom. I got turned around when exiting and ended up... <em>somewhere</em>, with what seemed like a million steps between me and my goal.</p><p>There's no shortcuts to the end of the demo; it's just going to take you manually controlling every single step to get where you want to go. I got distracted by a side activity that required bringing something up the mountain; I was curious how this was meant to be done given that Nate doesn't seem able to do much with his arms, but it ended up never mattering. I spent a solid half an hour trying to carefully steer him to the top of a rock, inching his toes along a thin ledge and inevitably tumbling back to the ground. When I finally decided to give up and come back later, I could see my goal--a fire at the top of the mountain--<em>so </em>far in the distance, across a swamp of grass and ruined carnival equipment, and as badly as I just wanted to <em>get</em> there, there was nothing for it but to plod along, flailing and tripping and falling. </p><p>It requires a lot of patience, which was sometimes more than I possessed. I spent several of my college years as a very serious Zen Buddhist, where I attempted to get very good at just being where I'm at, but these days I am very bad at that. I thought of that effort a lot as I played <em>Baby Steps</em>. It's hard to do anything besides pay attention to Nate's feet, with the game's shifting soundtrack to occasionally distract you. If I wanted to take in my surroundings or orient myself, I'd usually have to stop walking completely; changing direction required carefully moving Nate's legs to spin around. The demo asks for just the right amount of attention, not necessarily concentration or precision, but a kind of presence that I castigated myself for struggling to bring it because I'd start trying to play it like a different game, or my brain would start ruminating on something else. But then Nate would fall and bring my focus back like I used to do in meditation, and it would feel like a little restart. I'd be determined to <em>do better</em> this time, and even get into a pretty good groove, before my focus or patience would drift and I'd fall again.</p><p>This is surely all some kind of metaphor for Nate's life situation; at the beginning of the game, you hear people who seem like his parents worrying about how he's spending, or wasting, his time. From what I played, the game doesn't use his appearance as a punchline, which I was relieved about and hope is true of the full game. That said, I didn't quite click with the game's humor; everyone Nate meets is frantic and whiny in that sort of "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQXOCq0cPqI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aw jeez</a>" <em>Rick &amp; Morty </em>way that isn't really my thing, but it never became too much for me in the demo. Mostly, I was just alone with Nate and his feet, getting better and then worse again, moving one unsteady step at a time through the world. It was by turns weird fun and annoying as shit, but always in a way that made me want to keep playing.</p><p><em>Baby Steps</em> comes out September 8.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoff-keighleys-yellow-sneakers"><h3>You Can Always Count On Sneakers</h3></a><p>The one thing you can count on Summer Game Fest for</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/felt-that-boxing"><h3>Nope, No, No Thank You</h3></a><p>I love this idea, please keep it away from me</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">Activision marketing chief Tyler Bahl described the casting of Ventimiglia to Variety as being as the right fit for "an iconic character from the franchise and one of the fan favorites" from Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Variety also revealed Kiernan Shipka and Michael Rooker have also been cast. Kiernan Shipka, who is most notable from Mad Men, plays the character Emma Kagan, and she seems to be a newcomer to the Call of Duty universe.

We'll likely get more cast announcements or details in the coming weeks. Activision also didn't reveal a release date but confirmed the game is coming this year to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC (via the Xbox PC app, Steam, and Battle.net). While not yet confirmed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/">Black Ops 7 is likely coming to Switch 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-new-call-of-duty-warzone-map-teased-in-black-ops-7-trailer/1100-6532265/">Black Ops 7 cinematic reveal trailer</a> already has fans speculating about the next potential battle royale map for Warzone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/konami-announces-press-start-event-for-june-12-with-mgs-delta-silent-hill-f-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Japanese game developer and publisher KONAMI announced an upcoming event titled 'Press Start' that will take place on June 12 at 6:00 AM Pacific Time / 9:00 AM Eastern Time / 3:00 PM Central European Time. The live stream will be watchable via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXaDgU72gRI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://twitch.tv/KONAMI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, and <a href="http://facebook.com/konami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>.&nbsp;KONAMI already said that it will last around 37 minutes. Subtitles will be available in 13 languages.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the studio confirmed that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill f will be prominently featured in the broadcast. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the remake of 2004's Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Developed in Unreal Engine 5 with the help of Virtuos, the game features modern controls (with the option to stick to legacy controls) and an upgraded battle damage system that reflects the wear and tear to Snake's clothes and the bruises and bullet wounds on his body in real time. These injuries will leave permanent marks on Snake's body, telling the story of each player's unique journey through the game. The game's official PC system requirements are available <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-gets-pc-requirements-and-new-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>; Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on August 28.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is a new entry in KONAMI's prized horror franchise. It's being developed by NeoBards Entertainment, a Hong Kong team that previously worked on games like Resident Evil: Resistance, Resident Evil Re:Verse, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Marvel's Avengers, and Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. During last week's State of Play, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-launches-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-september-2025-new-gameplay-showcased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that the game, set in a secluded town in 1960s Japan, will be released on September 25 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>But that's not all we're getting in the Press Start event, as KONAMI teased that 'more' will be shown. Of course, whether that's something significant or perhaps just an update for eFootball remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/discussing-magic-gathering-x-final-fantasy-with-daniel-holt-game-design-lead-for<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> set is now available in pre-release with the full release only days away. As someone hooked into both the <em>MTG</em> and <em>FF</em> spaces, it's been incredible seeing the reaction, on par with the release of a <em>Final Fantasy</em> game. At Summer Game Fest, I got to sit down with Daniel Holt, Senior Game Designer for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> and the lead designer behind the pre-con Commander decks featuring Terra, Cloud, Tidus, and Y'shtola.</p>

<h2>But First, A Duel</h2>

<p>Prior to sitting down to discuss the collaboration, Holt and I engaged in a quick game of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> using the Cloud and Sephiroth decks that come in the starter set. Cloud's deck features equipment cards lending to the JRPG root,s while Sephiroth's deck is built around tokens and powering up Sephiroth, Planet's Heir.</p>

<p>Being my first time really getting hands-on with these cards, I was continuously distracted while playing, spotting favorite characters, locations, and events from the history of <em>FF</em>. I couldn't help but comment in excitement seeing the Sunstones of the Giza Plains from <em>Final Fantasy XII</em> glowing on the Plains card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-x-final-fantasy-starter-deck.jpg?itok=Pl6q5a71 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-x-final-fantasy-starter-deck.jpg?itok=MRbiUFFP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>After competently defeating him (absolute blind luck top-decking a card that let me create a 13/13 monstrosity with Haste and Trample, there was no skill on my part whatsoever) we moved over to an interview space to continue talking.</p>

<h2>Picking And Choosing Moments</h2>

<p>Knowing how much history there was to <em>Final Fantasy</em>, I first wanted to understand how, even in a large set such as this, they were able to pick and choose the different characters and moments to highlight.</p>

<p>Holt told me that Gavin Berry, who led the main set, developed a tiered system. "Tier One was made up of the character and story moments that every character knows; Sephiroth and Cloud, etc. Tier Two is like, if you played the game, you'd probably know. Tier Three is those deeper facts, like this is probably your favorite game."</p>

<p>On the topic of favorite games, Holt revealed that his favorite numbered <em>Final Fantasy</em> title was <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, which is why he was even more excited that he got to create a Tidus and <em>Final Fantasy X</em> themed pre-con.</p>

<p>I quickly paused to ask him whether he pronounces it Tidus (Tee-dus) or Tidus (Tie-dus), and he very quickly and confidently said the correct answer, Tidus (Tee-dus).</p>

<p>At the interview space, Holt directed me to editions of each of the Commander Pre-Con decks, explaining that each of these Pre-Con decks doesn't just feature a hero, but is completely themed after the game that they're from.</p>

<p>"When you buy the <em>Final Fantasy X</em> deck, every card in here is <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, except the lands. So we had 63-ish cards to all be from <em>Final Fantasy X</em>. So we got to go in those deep moments."</p>

<p>"One of my favorites from this one is the reprint Endless Detour. We've got to show Riku where she's scared of lightning. She's with the whole party inside the hotel, and she doesn't want to go back out."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-x-final-fantasy-lands.jpg?itok=KryxqtLN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-x-final-fantasy-lands.jpg?itok=Nar_65jr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Creating The Plan For A Pre-Con Commander Deck</h2>

<p>I asked if there were any moments that a fan of <em>FFX</em> like himself put his foot down to say they needed to be included, and Holt revealed a bit of the behind-the-scenes for Commander deck creation. "The way we approached all these decks is that I had an Excel sheet where I looked at the reprint I'm considering, and a possible story moment."</p>

<p>He talked about the discussion he had with Dylan Davini, the head of creative for the set, "I'll ping him and ask 'hey, can we do this?' and [Davini] will say 'yeah, that's fine' and for every card we have one sentence what it could be. I had this sheet already filled out for <em>Final Fantasy X</em> before coming to Davini. He looked at it and said 'This pretty much works' and we were already kind of done."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Every character is somebody's favorite Character"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While <em>Final Fantasy X</em> had a lot of easy moments to pull from the Commander deck, <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> was more difficult. "VI was the last of the pixel games, so some of our references weren't great for capturing the game. Some of the items in the game are just a sphere, it's not enough for a reference."</p>

<p>Holt talked about having to drop certain ideas when there just wasn't any possible option, and seek out a different reference for those cards.</p>

<p>Holt did speak very highly of the team at Square Enix that they worked with while putting this set together. He talked of the benefit of so many on the <em>MTG </em>team being fans of Square Enix and <em>Final Fantasy</em>, and likewise, a lot of those at Square Enix were fans of <em>MTG</em>.</p>

<p>If they reached out to Square Enix and there wasn't a great reference to be use,d the team would be very helpful and provide alternate references.</p>

On top of that, Sagas have been altered to provide a basis for Summons. Powerful while on the field, but only temporary.</p>

<h2>Turning Gameplay Mechanics Into Card Mechanics</h2>

<p>Explaining more about how they adapted game systems to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Holt again referenced the <em>Final Fantasy X</em> deck. "Tidus has a Cheer ability and he moves counters around. Just like you are on the sphere grid."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We've got some fan favorite moments like the Cloud in a dress scene, the train suplex, and the laughing scene from <em>Final Fantasy X</em>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing that there's so much excitement around the <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> Cards I wondered how he and the team were reacting to it.</p>

<p>"It's still amazing. Even now that it's out like, I hear somebody say Sephiroth over in the corner and I'm like 'do people know about Sephiroth already?' because we've been working on this for four to five years. [...] Everyone on the team understands these games, loves them so it was a true passion project."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Aspyr has revealed&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition</em>, a remastered version of the 2006 CRPG classic that comes with all-new enhancements and improvements, as well as all of the game's expansions.</p>

<p>Revealed during yesterday's PC Gaming Show (along with the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paralives-december-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>release date</a> and more),&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>promises to do for the nearly twenty-year-old RPG what the enhanced editions of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate&nbsp;</em>and its sequel did for their respective originals.</p>

<p>According to the game's brand new Steam page, <i>Neverwinter Nights 2</i>'s new enhanced re-release will feature "smoother gameplay", as well as "refined camera controls, polished mechanics, enhanced textures, and full controller support", together with a brand new "controller-specific UI".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-combat.jpg?itok=n4aHR9dl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-combat.jpg?itok=1Q2nZbzZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Neverwinter Nights 2&nbsp;</em>is coming back, in enhanced form.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the fact this is an enhanced re-release of a classic CRPG, usual suspect Beamdog is nowhere to be seen in the credits for the game. The studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beamdog-acquired-by-porting-and-remake-specialists-aspyr" rel="nofollow">acquired by Aspyr back in 2022</a>, but it still remains a distinct entity and hasn't been renamed, so it looks like Aspyr is the one handling this remaster.</p>

<p>Other than the aforementioned improvements, it looks as though&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>will largely be the same game you may or may not already be familiar with; there's no mention of restoring cut content.</p>

<p>What that means is the package will contain the base&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2&nbsp;</em>game, plus its three major expansions:&nbsp;<em>Mask of the Betrayer</em>,&nbsp;<em>Storm of Zehir</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Mysteries of Westgate</em>.</p>




<p>It's all go in the world of&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>video games right now. As well as this remaster, it was revealed last week that&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>director Stig Asmussen's new studio Giant Skull is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/giant-skull-wizards-of-the-coast-dungeons-and-dragons" rel="nofollow">working on a&nbsp;<em>D&amp;D&nbsp;</em>game</a> alongside Wizards of the Coast.</p>

<p>That's in addition to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">live-service multiplayer title</a> currently in development at Starbreeze Studios, about which we admittedly know very little at present. Hopefully, Starbreeze's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-financials-2024-payday-3" rel="nofollow">current difficulties</a> don't impact the development of that project too much.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738630/Dungeons__Dragons_Neverwinter_Nights_2_Enhanced_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1032-PPSA20783_00-NWN2ENHANCED0000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/dungeons-dragons-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition/9NS7KLP387H6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dungeons-and-dragons-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (and not Switch 2, oddly enough) on July 15th.</p>

<p>It also includes three story expansions. If that's simply not enough <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverwinter-nights">Neverwinter Nights</a> for you, there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738630/Dungeons__Dragons_Neverwinter_Nights_2_Enhanced_Edition/">bundle on Steam currently</a> where you can buy both this and the original NN - also in Enhanced Edition form - for 10% off. This would require pre-ordering, however. It's like I always say: if someone has to bribe you into doing something, it's surely a brilliant idea. Here's Steam on the matter of the affairs of the particulars of the videogame at hand:</p>
<blockquote><p>Return to the city of Neverwinter in Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition. A dark force sweeps over Faerûn, ravaging everything in its path as though searching for something – something that you now find in your possession. As the Shard-Bearer, only you can stop the King of Shadows and his army from desecrating the land you call home. Will you save Faerûn, or fall victim to the temptation of absolute power? When your actions dictate the fate of the Realms, there are no small choices.</p></blockquote>
<p>I bet there are <em>some</em> small choices, really. That's just good writing. How do you make the big choices seem big otherwise? Please, consider your hyperbole for one second, advertising blurb.</p>
<p>The previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverwinter-nights-enhanced-edition">Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition</a> was handled by Beamdog. They've since been gobbled up by Aspyr, themselves a gobbling appendage of chief gobblers Embracer, and it's Aspyr on both enhancing and publishing duties this time around. Being long in the tooth by now, the Neverwinter Nights games have built up a decent modding community over the years, and the minimal amount of research I've done suggests that mods for the original NN worked fine with the 2018 EE. Assuming that's the case for this new one, it means you'll be able do things like play the entire <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/neverwinter2/mods/794">Baldur's Gate 1 campaign inside of it</a>.</p>
<p>Here's John's (RPS in peace) diary series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-bastard-in-neverwinter-part-one-bastardly-beginnings">A Bastard In Neverwinter</a> if you're curious to learn how Neverwinter Nights 2 reacts to proto-Dark Urge shenanigans, and also just find the word 'bastard' inherently funny enough to force at least once into most articles you write, like some sort of marauding crambastard.</p></div>

But with Black Ops 7, Activision is intentionally holding back information to create a Beyonce-like effect, he said, referencing the singer Beyonce's surprise-release of her self-titled album in 2013.</p>

<p>"I think in a lot of ways we're setting this up more like a Beyonce album dropping; nobody's going to know about it, or nobody's going to see it coming," Bahl said.</p><p>Of course, Bahl is exaggerating here. Millions of people already know about Black Ops 7 and are awaiting its release later this year. A Call of Duty game coming to market annually is one of the safest bets a person could make in gaming. Since 2004, Activision has released a new Call of Duty game every year.</p><p>Whatever the case, Bahl said the aim with Black Ops 7's marketing was to "really do something different, and for us to zag and show up in a unique way."</p><p>"One way of doing that is almost not doing any pre-promotion and giving it to players in a really unexpected way," Bahl said.</p><p>The Black Ops 7 announcement trailer capped off Microsoft's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a> on June 8. The game is set in the year 2035 and aims to be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/" data-ref-id="1100-6532238">"most mind-bending" Black Ops game yet</a>. Black Ops 7 is also notable because this is the first time Activision is releasing Black Ops games in back-to-back years.</p><p>The Black Ops 7 trailer concluded with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-new-call-of-duty-warzone-map-teased-in-black-ops-7-trailer/1100-6532265/" data-ref-id="1100-6532265">possible tease for a new Warzone map</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/absolum-preview-very-promising-beat-em-up<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some of my fondest gaming memories involve playing beat 'em ups with my brothers. <i>Castle Crashers&nbsp;</i>comes to mind, in particular, a game I could play over and over again.&nbsp;<em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>feels the same way; it's the type of game that encourages repeat playthroughs with your best buds.</p>

<p>Really,&nbsp;<em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>ticks all the right boxes for me. A compelling fantasy universe with fleshed out lore, weighty beat 'em up gameplay, and a killer soundtrack to boot. My time with&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>&nbsp;at Summer Game Fest 2025 left me very eager to try more.</p>



<h2>Fantastic(al) Fights Await&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The art style for&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>&nbsp;really draws you in. It's this comic book-like aesthetic in this whimsical, high fantasy universe. It's a world where mages are feared for their use of magic. Non-magic users are scared of them, and monsters want to kill the wizards too.</p>

<p>Most of the demo comprised gameplay rather than story, but I'm very interested in seeing the narrative unfold. It actually reminds me a bit of&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>, with crucial NPCs in your hub with their own stories and motivations.</p>

<p>But the&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>&nbsp;similarities don't end there. The roguelite elements seem to take inspiration from that title. Gameplay involves progressing to new areas, while collecting boons every few rooms or so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These boons empower your wizard's attacks. These upgrades are usually elemental in nature, so your special attack might shoot tidal waves when you activate it.</p>

<p>You're able to choose from several characters in&nbsp;<em>Absolum;&nbsp;</em>for example, one is a dwarf, and another an elf, so on and so forth. They're all visually distinct from one another and have different styles of attacking.</p>



<h2>Fighting to the End</h2>

<p>The core of&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>'s gameplay, outside of its roguelite mechanics, is the beat 'em up combat. These aren't your ordinary wizards. The dwarf mainly uses his magically powered fists. His punches are powerful, and each hit is accompanied by a satisfying sound.</p>

<p><em>Absolum</em>&nbsp;has branching paths for each run, so my partner and I took a northern route along the coast. We're met with dog-like creatures and hermit crabs that hide in their shells. We made short work of them, and went on our way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually we reached a village under attack by goblins. Now, you'd think the villagers would accept our aid, but in fact, they started to attack us! Surrounded on both sides, we fought through goblin and human foes. Just another example of&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>'s very intriguing narrative.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><i>Absolum&nbsp;</i>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Eventually we reached a boss at the end of the demo. It's your typical tanky boss that takes a lot of hits, so my partner and I dodged and weaved around him. This boss had a giant shield, so we'd go on either side of him and harass the guy until he lowered his guard.</p>

<p><em>Absolum</em>&nbsp;is genuinely a lot of fun, and words don't do it justice. It oozes quality, from its art design and soundtrack, to its gameplay. The rougelite elements really make me want to try and try again even in the face of failure. Although there's no release date yet, I shall eagerly wait.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/relooted-is-unique-heist-game-for-2d-platforming-speedrun-fans<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's always fun to come across games that are truly unique, and I got to experience one of them at Summer Game Fest this week. <em>Relooted</em>, by Nyamakop, is a unique game where you play as Nomali, a woman dragged into working to reclaim <s>stolen</s> obtained artifacts from collectors or museums across the world.</p>

<p>The premise of the game is that due to the wording of a new law, any ancient artifacts that were on public display at museums would need to be returned to their country of origin. The loophole in this that these locations found though, was that if an item was only shown in private, then the artifacts no longer needed to be returned.</p>

<h2>Accessory To A Heist</h2>

<p>With knowledge of these artifacts, Nomali and her team, consisting of a group of people skilled in acrobatics and hacking, and more as the game progresses. With this team it is your goal to get into these locations, scope out the most ideal way to 'reloot' these items with intent to return them to their homes, and then get out as quickly as possible.</p>

The game takes place from a sidescrolling view, you'll run left to right through each location but you'll also need to find ways to climb up to higher levels or return to the ground floor to obtain all of your items.</p>

<p>In the first level that I got to play, a private collector had two primary artifacts to collect, and a further two (one of which I missed, hidden in a safe). Reviewing the world was like looking at an equation where you have all of the pieces and you needed to get as close to the final answer as possible in order to succeed.</p>

<p>You could pre-emptively place your hackers by door, move desks into security doorways to keep them open, and have your acrobat in strategic places to get you to upper floors with ease. Once everything is in place it’s time to snag the first artifact, that kicks off the alarm, and starts the timer for you to get everything and get out.</p>

<p>From there the game is a mix of platforming and speedrunning and you maintain your line, pick up all of the artifacts and getting out. As you begin to get low on your escape timer a drone enemy will appear, with nothing to do to defend yourself you’ll have to just keep heading towards the exit.</p>

<p>Speaking with Ben Myres, CEO at Nyamakop and Creative Director for <em>Relooted </em>he told me that the inspiration behind the game came from a trip that he took to London with his family. While he spent time meeting people in gamedev, his parents went to the British Museum. Once the family got back together he learned of how enraged his family had been about the entire front of a building that had been taken from somewhere in the world and placed in the museum.</p>

<p>From there it was suggested to make a game about returning these items that have been taken or ‘looted’ and while you can’t get away from a museum with a whole wall research was done into different artifacts that could be reclaimed.</p>

<p>Myres told me another story of the Ngadji Drum, important to the Pokomo people in Kenya. This sacred relic was thought to have been destroyed over 100 years ago turned up in the storage of the British Museum too.</p>

<p>Stepping away from the gam,e I was excited to have gotten my hands on such a unique game that consists of puzzle solving and speedrunning-like gameplay with such a unique story to tell.</p>
