We all used it to take a brief glance at our playtime breakdowns, then consigned it to the pile of other unused apps in our phone's storage, thanks to its reliance on funnelling us to the My Nintendo Store website.</p>
<p>The constant channels to your preferred web browser are still prevalent in the app today, but a new update is moving things in the right direction, with in-app product searches now working... in-app.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3mefi2elba62i">@Oatmealdome</a> on Bluesky, previous versions of the app would kick the user straight to the My Nintendo website whenever they tried to use the app's search function. As of today's ver. 3.1.0 patch, the app now displays search results itself, but it will still open the game page in a browser if you tap on it. Still no chance of buying anything via the app, then, but hey, it's a step in the right direction!</p>

<p>Aside from the added search functionality, the update also improves display speed in select tabs, adds the option to enlarge product images (<em>groundbreaking</em>), and makes a few smaller tweaks, too.</p>
<p>The patch notes were shared on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nintendo-store/id1495746988">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znej&amp;utm_source=emea_Med">Google Play Store</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Nintendo Store Ver. 3.1.0 (9th Feb 2026)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>・ Product search results can now be displayed in-app on the "Search" tab.<br>
・ Performance for the "Search" and "Wish List" tabs has been improved.<br>
・ You can now enlarge the product images displayed on the details page for a product.<br>
・ Various issues are now resolved.</p></blockquote><blockquote>

			<p>In the eight years since Yakuza Kiwami 2 gave us the showdown between the Dragons of Dojima and Kansai, SEGA and the Ryu ga Gotoku Studio, six remasters/remakes and eight new titles in the series have graced all of the major platforms (with even Google Stadia getting to experience Judgment Remastered). Now, the third numbered title (and fourth chronologically) in Kazuma Kiryu's ascension as the most valuable member of the Tojo clan is here, bringing us to Okinawa and some unusual casting choices.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Yakuza-Kiwami-3-Orphanage-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In the short period of time since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yakuza-kiwami-2-double-dragon-hd/">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> wraps up its narrative, Kiryu has taken a step back from the glamorous Tokyo city life and instead resigned himself to take care of the orphanage where he fosters a number of orphaned children alongside his pseudo-adopted daughter, Haruka. Kamurocho is teased in front of the player's face before Kiryu hops into a cab with the intention of making Okinawa his new forever home. Naturally, he's brought back into the fold of yakuza power dynamics when the land his orphanage is built on is crucial for a pair of lucrative government contracts, including a new resort meant to bolster Okinawa's future as a tourist attraction. This doesn't sit right with the Dragon of Dojima, and he finds himself hitting the streets once more to protect his newfound family and give them a place to grow up. From here, Yakuza Kiwami 3 spirals into a narrative spanning both cities with major players of the Tojo clan all claiming a stake in the future of that orphanage and Kiryu is having none of that. </p>



<p>It doesn't matter who stands in Kiryu's way when it comes to protecting his newfound family and the orphanage he founded. Whether it's a sworn brother, Tojo clan lieutenant, or even the local minor family who has staked Okinawa as their claim, his fists will do everything they can to protect the family. Kiryu's Dragon of Dojima style is just as formidable as it was in Yakuza Kiwami 2, letting Kiryu rage out and use everything from salt shakers to motorcycles as weapons in the series' signature brawler combat. New to Yakuza Kiwami 3 is a fighting style based on Okinawan traditions: Ryukyu Style. Here, Kiryu loses the ability to pick up weapons from fallen enemies and instead comes to battle with eight different weapon types, each assigned to different button commands and swapped around freely during the course of combat. Kiryu loses some of the freeform combos from his main fighting style, as each weapon only has one or two used mapped to specific commands and cannot be upgraded independent of one another. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Yakuza-Kiwami-3-Biker-Gang-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In streamlining Kiryu's weapon-focused fighting style, the entire equipment system of the original game is lost in Yakuza Kiwami 3. This means no weapon durability, no armor, and more importantly, no Golden Gun for completing every substory. What Kiryu does get this time around is a customizable cellphone where accessories like stomach bindings and charismatic photos are instead replaced with lock screens and three charms that can hang off the cellphone. This oversimplification is just one of the core issues surrounding Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties.</p>



<p>Kiryu's roster of substories is also massively cutback for the Kiwami-style remake in lieu of including Bad Boy Dragon (one of the series' best minigames to date). While the original title featured 119 substories, many of these have either been combined into the same multi-part substory or removed altogether. With the Hostess minigame once again MIA for Kiryu's adventure, that's nearly ten substories missing alone. Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties only features less than three dozen substories, which, in proper Yakuza fashion, all need to be completed before Amon calls on Kiryu for the signature superboss fight at the end of his adventure. Mine's story also features an Amon fight of his own, but despite completing every bit of content available, I was not able to figure out the requirements for that one.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Yakuza-Kiwami-3-Kanda-Business-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Yoshitaka Mine, the financier of the Tojo clan, remains the ultimate antagonist of Yakuza 3 but his motivations and rise to power were largely unknown in earlier games. The smartly dressed yakuza in a pinstripe suit was calculating and had a firm hold on the clan's purse strings, but what were his ultimate ambitions? This Tojo lieutenant was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8GBQI4Dn_g">once recognized as the series' tenth most popular character</a>, so it's only natural to want to dig a little deeper into a man who was only featured in a single mainline title (not counting the ghost photograph easter eggs in Yakuza 6).</p>



<p>The second half of the game's title, Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties, centers solely around Yoshitaka Mine, from his beginnings as a startup founder pushed out by his board of directors, to seeing an attempted assassination of Dojima Daigo. This moment becomes the formation of Mine's motives as he strives to learn just what about this man would make people want to risk their lives to protect him. Getting into the Tojo clan's good graces requires a lot of footwork and getting in with a minor family first, starting with befriending the equally bald and hot-headed Tsuyoshi Kanda. Rather than the usual assortment of substories, Mine's side activities are all about doing damage control for Kanda and doing good deeds in his honor (which usually involve punching faces in any case) to raise his reputation. Completing all of these side missions is by no means mandatory, but it does give the player some motivation to want to stick around just a little bit longer to complete the otherwise immensely short narrative.</p>

<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties clocked in at less than forty hours in total: thirty for Kiryu's campaign and around eight to ten for Mine's Dark Ties story. Much of this is attributed to the removal of minigames and substories alike, streamlining the optional experience while keeping it padded with the usual assortment of bowling, golf, darts, and the like. There are several arcade titles new for a modern release, and both Kiryu and Mine can collect various Game Gear titles if you're itching for that nostalgic fix. Sadly, Surf Ninjas isn't one of those titles you can pick up and play here. </p>



<p>The casting choices at play here in Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties are perhaps the most controversial we've seen in the series to date. Pierre Taki's character in Judgment/Judge Eyes was famously removed and recast as Miou Tanaka due to drug use. Yakuza 4's Tanimura was also recast for the remake due to alleged drug use as well. Here, the most famous of the recasts are of Rikiya, a low-ranking yakuza who wants to become Kiryu's sworn brother in Okinawa, and Goh Hamazaki, a scumbag who is only interested in the resort deal to enrich himself. Hamazaki's recasting alone is perhaps the most controversial, as his face and voice likeness were replaced by Teruyuki Kagawa, a kabuki actor known for playing villain roles in a wide number of TV shows and movies. However, he had his own controversy of sexual harassment that was well-known and documented ahead of the casting announcement. During an interview with IGN, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-tried-to-think-of-someone-who-makes-you-go-this-guys-a-creep-yakuzalike-a-dragon-director-addresses-controversial-casting">director of Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties admitted</a> that he wanted to cast someone who would make players think 'this guy's a creep'.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Casting choices aside, Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is a complete package that carves away so much of the slow and methodical pacing of the original and dresses it up with HD flourishes and streamlined content. What was once one of my favorite entries in the series for being a story about being forced out of retirement for 'one last job' to save his family, Kazuma Kiryu's adventures through Okinawa and Kamurocho alike are given a death by a thousand cuts. Seeing the title's antagonist through a more human lens is an interesting addition for Dark Ties, but I would not recommend this remake to anyone who wants to remember Yakuza 3 as fondly as it was back in 2010.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Removing a significant amount of content and replacing it with Mine's Dark Ties storyline hurts the narrative as a whole, but perhaps not as much as the other design choices at play for this remake of Yakuza 3.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Morning Glory Orphanage storyline is fully-fleshed out, with market and farming mechanics
</li><li>Mine's story is kept up to a rapid pace and doesn't overstay its welcome
</li><li>Bad Boy Dragon storyline features multiple 100-man melees and showcases Kiryu's potential against overwhelming odds
</li><li>Still some of the best facial capture and performances in the business
</li><li>Kiryu gives everyone the business with his two signature fighting styles
</li><li>Full outfit and makeup customization
</li><li>Straddles the fine line between drama and over-the-top comedy</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Trivia, Hostess Clubs, and over eighty substories removed

            <p>I'm just a tiny mining droid trying to carve an upward path through the brutalist monolith that dominates the skyline. Not hurting anyone, am I? Yet, I'd be making much better progress if it weren't for the pesky red-eyed monsters that keep attacking my base. They're just afraid of change – NIMBYs the lot of them.</p>
<p>Every few floors I climb, I have to race home to blast the incoming creeps with my base's gun turret. But then that's the ever-present challenge of Iter-8, the latest half-mining game, half tower defence game to have stolen my attention.</p>
<!--more-->
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Fireshine Games / fluckyMachine</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This isn't the first time I've played a game that pairs the digging of Manic Miner with the Missile Command style base defence. Iter-8's structure is extremely similar to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dome-keeper">Dome Keeper</a> and Wall World – two games I'm also a sucker for. (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-going-deeper-wall-world-2-brings-its-dullest-moments-to-the-surface">Less so Wall World 2</a>.) As in those games, there is a clear divide to the action: in the mines you're drilling for resources, dragging ore and scavenged equipment back to your base; back at base, your focus is purely on shredding the incoming waves.</p><p>Again, similar to Dome Keeper and Wall World, you spend resources extracted from the mine on upgrades, either to your mining equipment or base weaponry. That could be a more powerful mining laser or a larger carry bag for ore, or maybe a faster-firing turret. Fail to mine enough resources between the waves of enemies and you can't afford to keep pace with the enemies' growing strength.</p>
<p>Iter-8 isn't identical to those other games. It differs in two important ways. In Dome Keeper, you mine down. In Wall World, you mine to the right. And in Iter-8 you mine upwards. Okay, that's not the biggest difference, but it's good to know we are just one game away from being able to mine in all four directions. Iter-8 also introduces a tower defence layer and a little light puzzle solving.</p>



<p>As you climb the monolith, you will uncover gold-coloured wires connecting sprawling nodes. Dig out every node in the chain and you will unlock a relic that you can convert into a tower back at your base. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2832310/ITER8/">the demo</a> I've played, I've only come across a cannon and howitzer so far, but I suspect (and hope) there are more varied towers to come. While towers don't radically change the dynamic at play, they do make incoming waves a little more forgiving, especially as your mining operation takes you further and further from your home base.</p><p>The puzzles are a little more of a departure. On each floor of the monolith, you'll find a door out to a platform dotted with mirrors, stacked blocks of concrete, and a glass shard. Your job is simple, uses the mirrors to reflect a shaft of light into the glass shard. You'll need to reotate the mirrors and clear away any blocks that block the light beam. Your reward is a nice little upgrade for your home base.</p>
<p>These additions don't radically change what is on offer in Dome Keeper and Wall World. However, it's different enough to excite my little brain and convince it is playing something new enough to while away an hour or two – long after I've got through what's available in the demo. I'm also a big fan of games that use a tilt-shift effect, giving every object and enemy in the game the appearance of being a figurine.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Yakuza Kiwami 3 & Dark Ties Review]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I’ve been playing the Yakuza games for a long time now, having been drawn into them when they were still niche PS3 action games that needed fan petitions to get localised. Now, the series has become SEGAs biggest property with yearly releases that each manages to be larger and longer than the last. Some of these entries have been spin-offs set outside the main continuity, while others have been entire remakes of the oldest games in the series. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/yakuza-kiwami-3">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> manages to be both at one – a two-pack where one game is a modernised remake of Yakuza 3, while the second weaves a prequel adventure around the final protagonist of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3</a>, Yoshitaka Mine. Unfortunately, this duo left me scratching my head and wondering who, exactly, they were made for.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties | Double Feature Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hwjcoyqx1go?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3, as a concept, is a game that I’ve been unsure about, even years before it was announced. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/23/yakuza-kiwami-2-review/">Kiwami remakes</a> of the first two games were able to bring a huge leap forward in quality from PS2 to PS4, and make them readily available on modern hardware, but Yakuza 3 isn’t nearly as dusty, and is still easily playable thanks to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/25/yakuza-remastered-collection-review/">Remastered release in 2020</a>.&nbsp; It left me wondering what Yakuza Kiwami 3 could add or change that would make this kind of thing feel like a worthy alternative to the original game (which, as it turns out, SEGA is no longer selling standalone once this remake is released.)</p>


<p>A big part of the original game is the way it blends the usual crime drama of the series with Kiryu’s struggle to settle down in the tropical locale of Okinawa to help run the Morning Glory Orphanage that he himself grew up in. In the original game, your gritty missions in Kamurocho were often and suddenly interrupted to check in on the orphanage for meandering dialogue-focused activities to help the kids and deepen your bonds with them. Yakuza Kiwami 3 adds a lot of depth to these excursions and massively expands your interactivity with the orphanage. There’s a wide variety of new domestic minigames you’ll partake in – sewing, farming, fishing, cooking, catching bugs, and even helping with homework. It’s hilarious, as always, to see the stoic and brawny hero Kiryu so earnestly invest himself in hilariously inconsequential activities. Taking care of these successfully will increase your Daddy Rank – a translation that either had no thought or a little <em>too&nbsp;</em>much thought put into it.</p>


<p>I’m torn on the expanded Morning Glory Orphanage, though. On one hand, having so many more actual activities to get involved in really enhances the feeling of living at the orphanage and feeling your contributions. At the same time, though, there was an important narrative reason to why Kiryu wasn’t mending clothes or helping with homework in the original game. A big part of the story was Kiryu struggling to adapt to domestic dad mode after only knowing crime and violence his whole life. It wasn’t because the technology back then couldn’t handle a bug-catching minigame, it was because Kiryu himself couldn’t handle it. Seeing him dive deep into Daddy mode here feels far more in-line with the 50-something Kiryu we know from the later entries in the series, and not the younger and brasher one we’re supposed to be following here.</p>
<p>A lot of the additions or changes in Yakuza Kiwami 3 feel like they make sense or add value on paper, but the change the mood the original game was going for and make it less immersive. The new combat system is another big example of that. You now have the ability to swap between two unique sets of combat abilities. The Dragon of Dojima: Kiwami style is basically a greatest-hits of Kiryu’s most recognisable moves up until now, with the addition of some fun but fitting new ones like loads of gnarly wrestling throws.</p>

<p>The second style, Ryukyu style, is a little strange. In this mode, Kiryu swaps between a bunch of different melee weapons and attack styles that are based on traditional Okinawan martial arts and weaponry. It’s funny, and weird, and it just doesn’t fit the game at all. It’s sort of an unrestricted extension of the way these games have already let you use knives and guns and bombs to battle your foes in the past, but as an entire dedicated fighting style it’s another example of something added to the game for the sake of fun and at the cost of immersion.</p>
<p>Dark Ties, the other game in the package, is a tighter experience, if still a bit of a baffling one. Kicking things off as a young Yoshitaka Mine and seeing him ousted from his company and seeing him turn to a life of crime is so fascinating. It’s a really fresh character archetype that the series has never put a focus on – Kiryu and Ichiban as protagonists have been so desperate to claw themselves out of the pit that the yakuza lifestyle put them into. Seeing a character who’s cold and calculated but also desperate to claw his way <em>into&nbsp;</em>that world is so fun. At the same time, it often comes dangerously close to ruining the mystique that made Mine an iconic villain in the first place. Playing Dark Ties after beating Yakuza Kiwami 3 solves a lot of that issue, of course, but there’s still something so memorable about the “less is more” way that Mine was used in the original game that Dark Ties spoils a bit.</p>

<p>Both games come with pretty massive side-modes that are, honestly, some of the funnest side-content the franchise has ever put forward. In Yakuza Kiwami 3 you have the Bad Boy Dragon mode (again, someone had way too much fun naming some of this stuff) which sees Kiryu leading a gang of girl bikers into huge multi-crew battles to assert dominance on their turf. Customising and recruiting bikers is a blast, and the chaos that ensues in this fights never gets old. Dark Ties, meanwhile, has the Underground Fight Club. It’s sort of a roguelike dungeon mode, where you’ll explore randomised labyrinths and find new weapons and upgrades as you explore each floor. Successful escape allows you to upgrade your character, recruit mercenary companions, and tackle deeper floors. Both are some of the rare Yakuza franchise gems where I love the modes so much that I almost wish they were standalone games.</p>

<p>All in all, I think this double-pack of titles is a pretty great time for Yakuza fans who have already experienced the original story. For newcomers, though, the breadth of fun-focused new content really dilutes the unique vibe and atmosphere that Yakuza 3 was originally going for. With the original game now being delisted ahead of this release, newcomers will struggle to be able to have that original experience at all. As the franchise grows bigger and the well of potential remakes continues to dry up, it’ll be interesting to see if the team at SEGA manages to find the way to please both longtime fans and newcomers that this entry doesn’t quite stick the landing on.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: Yakuza Kiwami 3 & Dark Ties (Switch 2) - Maybe It's Time To Take A Break]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties</link>
            <guid>1430020</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>I’m of the opinion that there are no bad <strong>Yakuza</strong> games. Although the series has definitely fluctuated in quality over the years, they always offer up something to keep me engaged and satisfied. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> is still a decent entry, but it’s also bloated, poorly paced, and marred in controversy surrounding the recasting of a key character. Frankly, I’d argue that RGG’s prolificacy is starting to have an impact on the quality of its games, and it might be time to take a break.</p>
<p>Much like the previous Kiwami titles, this is a remake of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/yakuza_3">2009 PS3 original</a>, continuing the story of protagonist Kazuma Kiryu as the story shifts over to the new location of Downtown Ryukyu in Okinawa. The new setting offers a nice change of pace, leaning more towards a kind of tropical, resort-style environment. At a glance, it’s lovely to look at with the series’ signature attention to detail all intact, though you might be wondering whether the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-dev-acknowledges-demos-graphical-issues-launch-update-planned">lighting issues from the demo</a> have been addressed.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161859/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, the good news is that they absolutely have in a pre-release patch. There was a particularly egregious issue in which the area around Kubochi River looked genuinely awful, with the river itself showcasing a bright blue colour that somehow made the environment look worse than the original. This has been fixed, and it looks pretty good now. I did notice a weird bug early on in which some code was displayed in the dialogue subtitles, but this seems to have been a one-off, and otherwise it's a pretty polished experience.</p>
<p>Overall performance on Switch 2 is also as solid as you'd hope. The bump up to the Dragon Engine means we're looking at 30fps, but it remains pretty stable throughout. Resolution can also look a touch fuzzy in handheld mode, as you'll no doubt see in the accompanying screenshots here, but its overall a really handsome-looking game.</p>
<p>As for the gameplay, you’re looking at a familiar mix of melee combat (<em>lots</em> of melee combat), exploration, side activities like bowling, darts, and karaoke, and some light customisation features.</p>
<p>Focusing on combat first and foremost, Kiryu’s iconic Dragon Style makes a return, and it’s just as satisfying as ever. What’s more, the devs wisely made it so that your enemies no longer block incessantly, making emergent fights as you explore the environment much less irritating than the original.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161856/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>New to Kiwami 3 is the Ryukyu Style, which focuses on weapon combat like scythes, shields, and all sorts of weird and wonderful objects that Kiryu just happens to have stashed in his pockets. The basic functionality is the same as the Dragon Style, with standard attacks mapped to ‘Y’ and stronger ones mapped to ‘X’, combinations of which result in some pretty sick moves. Overall, I still tend to prefer the Dragon Style, as the dodging mechanic is a bit more immediate and satisfying, but both are valid options.</p>
<p>Like previous Yakuza games, random gangs can start fights with you while you’re out and about, but you can avoid these if you wish. What’s new here are Baddie Battles, which are large-scale scraps with a bunch of goons and one stronger foe as part of the new Bad Boy Dragon mode. This also sees you take over parts of Okinawa via motorbike skirmishes, and overall, it’s a fun little distraction that leans heavily into the series’ penchant for absurdity.</p>
<p>Other side missions focus primarily on the new Morning Glory orphanage (yeah, it’s not a good name, I know), during which you raise your ‘Daddy Rank’ by helping out the children in various minigames like cooking and fishing. The original release made a lot of the orphanage section mandatory to progress the story, but Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has wisely restructured the flow of the narrative to make this stuff more optional.</p>

<p>That said, Kiwami 3 still suffers from poor pacing throughout. At its height (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a>), the series has managed to strike a decent balance between story progression and side content, but here, there’s just simply too much <em>stuff</em>. You’re constantly being bombarded with cutscenes and random pedestrian dialogue, to check out features for your phone, buy some new threads, and <em>much</em> more. Some might relish all of the extra content, but in my opinion, Kiwami 3 tips the scales too much, and it often feels like a chore to play.</p>
<p>You’ve also got the completely new side campaign called ‘Dark Ties’, and this stars the fan-favourite antagonist Yoshitaka Mine as he goes from ousted chairman of an upstart company to ruthless Yakuza lieutenant. In contrast to the main story, this takes place almost entirely within the iconic Kamurocho, and so feels like a more 'traditional' Yakuza experience compared to Kiryu’s narrative. It's also a little more streamlined, offering a nice antidote to the bloated main story.</p>
<p>Mine is a compelling character, too. His calculating, no-nonsense attitude remains engaging throughout, though I have to admit that his task in raising the reputation of fellow clan member Tsuyoshi Kanda is disappointing given just how unlikeable the latter is. You’ll need to complete a bunch of missions to raise Kanda’s rank, including dealing with street bullies, accompanying him to a local brothel, or even just winning a plushie on a UFO catcher.</p>

<p>During combat, Mine is noticeably more brutal than Kiryu, with slightly slower movement balanced by hard-hitting punches. Building up a gauge will also eventually let you unleash Dark Awakening, which can be boosted two or three times in one go if you’ve managed to build up enough energy. Naturally, this increases Mine’s strength further and introduces a few cinematic finishing moves which, honestly, never get old. Overall, his fighting style is a delight, and I think I might even prefer it to Kiryu’s Dragon Style.</p>
<p>You’ll need to make good use of Mine’s abilities, too, since a key feature within Dark Ties sees you navigate a series of labyrinths in the Hell’s Arena underground fight club – yes, it’s as ridiculous as it sounds. These are stuffed with treasure to find and bad guys to vanquish, all leading to a thrilling one-on-one fight with the labyrinth’s leader. It’s good stuff, and it makes for a nice break from the persistent jobs you need to complete on the surface to help out Kanda.</p>
<p>I mentioned Kanda is unlikeable, and this is largely because his introduction sees him forcing himself upon a woman in an alley. As Mine, you have to intervene, which makes their subsequent alliance somewhat repulsive. I bring this up because RGG Studio made the decision to recast a key character in the main game, enlisting actor Teruyuki Kagawa to provide the voice and likeness for antagonist Goh Hamazaki.</p>

<p>The reasoning for replacing the original actor, George Takahashi, is unclear. However, in 2022, replacement actor Kagawa admitted to accusations of sexual misconduct from 2019, leading to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/yakuza-3-remake-backlash-blows-up-again-as-actor-guilty-of-sexual-harassment-stars-in-new-trailer">massive fan backlash</a> over his inclusion in Kiwami 3.</p>
<p>Now, if Kagawa's inclusion here means you decide to skip this entirely, I wouldn't blame you in the slightest. The series often deals with themes of horrific men being terrible to women, so his addition feels hypocritical of RGG Studio, and it did affect my enjoyment of the game every time Hamazaki shows up.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, even if this wasn't an issue, Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is still the weakest entry for the Switch 2 so far. It feels like we're being bombarded with new titles in the series recently, and I genuinely wonder whether RGG should just pull back slightly and focus on what made it so great to begin with.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is a fair series entry, but one that's tainted by poor pacing and a recasting controversy that simply didn't need to happen. The main story has a lot to offer, but it's also bloated with way too much side content getting in the way of the core narrative. Dark Ties feels like a nice antidote to this, but I'm not sure whether this alone would be worth the purchase for anyone but series die-hards.</p>
<p>RGG Studio fixed some visual blemishes in time for launch, so that's good news. Unfortunately, it seems Kiwami 3 will forever be associated with the recasting of one of its main antagonists, a controversy that undeniably affected my personal enjoyment of the game. If that doesn't bother you, and if an overabundance of side content appeals, you could probably add a point to the scoreline.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As predicted by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/">reliable insider NateTheHate two weeks ago</a>, <strong>Sony</strong> has announced that it will host a <strong>State of Play</strong> event this coming <strong>Thursday, February 12, 2026, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BT</strong>. Unlike Nintendo's recent <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Partner Showcase Direct</a></strong>, which only featured announcements from third-party games, this showcase promises to feature "<em>eye-catching third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with <strong>the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios</strong></em>."</p>



<p>That's from the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/09/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday-february-12/">PlayStation Blog post</a> announcing the event, which also adds that this showcase will last for over an hour when it's all said and done, with "<em>60+ minutes of news, gameplay updates, and announcements.</em>" </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sony and <strong>PlayStation</strong> could pack a lot of news into a showcase that's over an hour long, especially since we now know that it's going to be a general event, and not dedicated to one singular game. In the past, PlayStation has gone back and forth between hosting a general State of Play event and one dedicated to a singular upcoming title in February. With last year's February event being a general show, there was no guarantee this year's would be as well.</p>



<p>What's exciting about this event is the lack of knowledge we have going into it on the first-party PlayStation front. Yes, we know that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/">Saros</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-reveals-mild-marathon-pc-system-requirements/">Marathon</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">Marvel's Wolverine</a></strong> are at least three big releases set for 2026 from PlayStation Studios teams, but there are a lot of developers under the PlayStation branch that we need to hear from.</p>



<p>Firstly, we can probably rule out <strong>Naughty Dog</strong>, especially if reports from last year saying that its upcoming title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/"><strong>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</strong>, isn't arriving until <strong>2027</strong></a>, are correct. We may also be able to rule out <strong>Guerrilla Games</strong>, mainly because we just heard from them with <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrilla-cartoonish-coop-game/">the reveal of <strong>Horizon Hunters Gathering</strong>.</a> Though they could show off a little more of the co-op project, since it is due to have a <strong>closed-beta</strong> at the end of the month.</p>



<p>We also probably won't see anything from <strong>Bend Studio</strong>, considering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-bend-has-reportedly-laid-off-30-of-its-staff-as-it-kicks-up-a-new-project/">layoffs the team suffered last year after its live service project was cancelled</a>. The same goes for <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">which saw a <strong>God of War</strong> live service game it was working on get cancelled at the start of 2025</a>. It's possible the studio has another project that's ready for the spotlight, but that's in no way guaranteed.</p>



<p>As for who we could hear from, one of the more obvious picks is <strong>Sucker Punch Studios</strong>, which will be looking to follow up the success of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-shipments-92-million-ghost-of-yotei-outsold-tsushima/">Ghost of Yotei</a></strong> with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/">Ghost of Yotei Legends</a></strong>, the returning multiplayer mode from Ghost of Tsushima that was announced at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a></strong>. It's also likely that <strong>Sony San Diego</strong> takes the spotlight for a few minutes, with <strong>MLB The Show 26</strong> arriving on <strong>March 17, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>There's the chance we see more of the aforementioned Marvel's Wolverine, or, to throw in a wildcard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-will-continue-collaborating-with-insomniac-for-many-years-to-come/">a look at what other Marvel titles <strong>Insomniac Games</strong> might be working on</a>, and once again, Saros and Marathon are likely to make an appearance at the State of Play. But if all we get out of a 60 minutes+ showcase is news for third-party titles, indies, and first-party games we already know about, that won't make for an exciting event.</p>



<p>What would be exciting is finally hearing from <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/"><strong>Sony Santa Monica</strong> and seeing what <strong>Cory Barlog</strong> has been working on</a>. Or to learn that, despite project cancellations and layoffs, Bend Studio and/or Bluepoint Games do have something ready to reveal. We can only hope, at this point.</p>



<p>When it comes to third-party games, that opens up a whole new can of worms, with upcoming titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-pragmata-demo-delivers-a-smooth-polished-experience-on-pc/">Pragmata</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/evil-has-always-had-a-name-capcoms-new-short-film-sets-the-mood-for-resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-need-to-empty-your-wallet-for-more-ram-007-first-light-updated-system-requirements-lower-ram-and-vram-recomendations/">007: First Light</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-gameplay-xbox-developer-direct-2026/">Forza Horizon 6,</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>, </strong>and<strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-system-works-shows-more-marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-closed-beta-december/">Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</a> </strong>all potentially making an appearance. However, one game that won't be there, according to a new rumour, is the long-awaited <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-announce-release-soon/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Following a metric tonne of teases over the past few days in the form of the game's socials <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/2020468074701291965">spewing</a> <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/2020165683854663803">out</a> <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/2019804227699146825">more</a> <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/2020528429590786308">binary</a> than your average techie sees in a lifetime, Arrowhead have pulled back the curtain on the incoming cyborgs today.</p>
<p>The borg forces are made up of three unit types - Agitators, Radicals, and the Vox Engine. The former are heavily armoured field commanders who'll direct the game's existing automaton robo-enemies to ruin your day more ferociously than usual, while Radicals are less heavily armoured melee brutes who can whip out some "techno martial arts" to mess you up. Finally, there's the Vox Engine, a beefy tank with rockets, lasers, and gatling guns. Good thing Arrowhead put a friendly tank stratagem called <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/2019034113517212088">the Bastion</a> into the game last week, otherwise it'd really be brown trousers time.</p><p>These three foes will be rocking up in Helldivers 2 tomorrow, February 10th, as part of a major update dubbed Machinery of Oppression. The update revolves around the battle for Cyberstan, homeworld of the game's Automaton faction, whom these new cyborgs will be fighting alongside. Helldivers 2 director Mikael Eriksson has teased in a chat with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-helldivers-2-launches-the-battle-for-cyberstan-arrowhead-says-its-already-plotting-to-expand-the-scope-of-the-game">IGN</a> that, as far as the game's "most ambitious" fight so far, with "a new type of meta gameplay" making it "much more clear now for players what the consequences would be depending on how they choose to tackle [the assault]".</p>
<p>If it's been a while since you've dropped into the shooter's galactic war, this update's the first really substantial shift in the conflict since our real world calendar flipped over into 2026. Lots of bot bashing is on the agenda in the coming weeks and months, and we'll see which side's been reduced to scrap once the scrapping subsides.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/discord-will-force-you-to-scan-your-face-or-id-to-unlock-all-of-its-features-2000666884</link>
            <guid>1430002</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Big changes are coming to Discord next month. The company behind one of the most popular voice and chat services on the planet announced that all new and existing Discord users will soon have to prove their age via face scan or ID to gain access to the entirety of the app.</p> <p>On February 9, <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally">Discord announced</a> that as part of its “long-standing commitment to creating a safer” experience for teens, all Discord users worldwide will be shifted to a “teen-appropriate experience” by default. This change will happen in early march and once fully rolled out, it means users who can’t prove they are adults will lose access to a number of features and parts of Discord.</p>

 <p>To prove you are an adult, Discord is going to make you either upload an image of a legal ID or share a video selfie to verify age. Discord promises that all legal documents will be deleted “in most cases” immediately after the user’s age is verified and claims all selfies will never leave the user’s device. It does warn that some users might need to submit multiple pieces of information to prove their age, and there will be a method to dispute an assigned age if Discord gets it wrong. And a new age inference model will “run in the background” and will “help determine whether an account belongs to an adult, without always requiring users to verify their age.”</p> <h2>What features you’ll lose if you have a teen account on Discord</h2> <p>So what do you lose access to if you aren’t an adult on Discord? Quite a bit, actually, though you’ll still be able to use most of the apps basic features with some restrictions. Here’s what’s being blocked or gated for teen Discord users or people who don’t verify their age.</p>

 <ul role="list"> <li><strong>Content Filters:</strong>&nbsp;Discord users will need to be age-assured as adults in order to unblur sensitive content or turn off the setting.</li> <li><strong>Age-gated Spaces</strong>&nbsp;– Only users who are age-assured as adults will be able to access age-restricted channels, servers, and app commands.</li> <li><strong>Message Request Inbox:</strong>&nbsp;Direct messages from people a user may not know are routed to a separate inbox by default, and access to modify this setting is limited to age-assured adult users.</li> <li><strong>Friend Request Alerts:</strong>&nbsp;People will receive warning prompts for friend requests from users they may not know.</li> <li><strong>Stage Restrictions:</strong>&nbsp;Only age-assured adults may speak on stage in servers.</li> </ul> <p>“Nowhere is our safety work more important than when it comes to teen users, which is why we are announcing these updates in time for Safer Internet Day,” said Savannah Badalich, head of product policy at Discord. “Rolling out teen-by-default settings globally builds on Discord’s existing safety architecture, giving teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility. We design our products with teen safety principles at the core and will continue working with safety experts, policymakers, and Discord users to support meaningful, long term wellbeing for teens on the platform.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/robloxs-ai-powered-age-verification-is-a-complete-mess/">This is a similar approach to how</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045"><em>Roblox</em> has rolled out its age verification system</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/age-verification-is-sweeping-the-us-activists-are-fighting-back/">follows on the heels of various laws in the United States</a> that <a href="https://nym.com/blog/porn-restrictions-by-us-state">force users to prove their age via face scan or ID to access pornographic websites</a>. The age of truly anonymous internet ended a long time ago, but this new era of face scans and age verification is something else entirely and a huge blow to privacy advocates and people who feel weird having to send a selfie to a computer to look at porn, visit a website, or send a message to a friend.</p>

<p>Interested players can get a feel for The Witcher 4 early through the new Dawn over Korvir mod for The Witcher 3. </p>



<p>The Witcher 4 has a long way to go, with the latest reports revealing that the title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not release in 2026</a> and that the new trilogy will stick to the 6-year plan. From what we know about the next title, Ciri is going to be taking centre stage, and now players can get an early glimpse of what it could be like through the latest mod. </p>







<h2 id="h-witcher-4-can-be-experienced-early-through-new-witcher-3-mod">Witcher 4 Can be Experienced Early Through New Witcher 3 Mod</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/ciri-story-mod-dawn-over-kovir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>, the new Witcher 3 mod, called Dawn over Korvir, was recently uploaded to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11831?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexus Mods</a>. The mod itself adds a new questline that players can take on as Ciri.

            <guid>1429996</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2’s next big update, Machinery of Oppression, launches the Battle for Cyberstan, and sees players head to the alien homeworld and take on the Cyborgs, a new Automaton-adjacent enemy type that’s set to usher in a new round of terror — and chaos — to Arrowhead’s explosive third-person shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Machinery of Oppression also triggers the next big narrative beat in the Galactic War’s ongoing meta narrative, a community-driven story that has captivated fans ever since Helldivers 2 set PlayStation sales records two years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two years ago! Where has the time gone? For the developers at Arrowhead, the launch and ongoing development of Helldivers 2 has been something of a rollercoaster, with ups and downs dominated by community love and hate. But now, as Helldivers 2 enters its third year, Arrowhead is coming to understand the game it has on its hands, and how to fuel the live-service beast in a sustainable way while keeping player numbers healthy. Steam concurrents are there for all the world to see, and even now, they are in a good place.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers 2 Machinery of Oppression Update Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what happens next? The Battle for Cyberstan is yet another player-directed update. Players will take Cyberstan, or they will fail — Arrowhead doesn’t know how it’s going to go. But can Arrowhead make meaningful updates to Helldivers 2 beyond the sort of things we’ve seen in the last two years? In December, Johan Pilestedt [CCO of Arrowhead and creative director on Helldivers 2], <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-boss-casually-reveals-that-a-helldivers-2-roguelite-mode-is-in-the-works-and-it-changes-the-game-fundamentally">talked about the possibility of a Helldivers 2 rogue-lite mode</a>. But can the developers expand the scope of the game to, say, increase the squad count? Increase the number of players in a squad? Release bigger maps?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ideas aren’t the problem, of course. The problem, as with everything, is time, energy, and ideas. But, as game director Mikael Eriksson tells me in the interview below, these sorts of game-changing updates are being worked on. They are possible. And, he insists, the future of Helldivers 2 is bright indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Players have spent the week marching towards Cyberstan and they have tanks as well. I know you have big ambitions for how this new update will let the community direct the events of the Galactic War in an even more direct way than before, but how exactly will it work?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikael Eriksson:</strong> February 10, that's when Super Earth will commence the battle for Cyberstan. And you're right, this is the most ambitious one yet for us. One of the central points of Helldivers is that we play the game together with the community, and the actions of the community are not known to us and the outcomes are not predetermined. This has been the case since launch, but of course we've tried to expand on this with almost every update to make this more impactful, and to make it more obvious what the different outcomes are and what the consequences will be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We still have many ambitious plans on how to expand on this even further, but for this time, the Battle for Cyberstan, will be the most ambitious one yet with a new type of meta gameplay. So it would be much more clear now for players what the consequences would be depending on how they choose to tackle this. So they can attack the planet from many different angles and it would be very obvious when players get there, what the consequences are and what's at stake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But again, the outcome is not predetermined, so we don't know what will happen. Players can win and players can lose, and it's going to be super fun to see that play out. Last time, with the Battle for Super Earth, which I think was maybe the biggest one before this, we also didn't know. Eventually players actually managed to defend Super Earth, which was super cool to see. Following that was pure fun for everyone at the office except for maybe the Game Master who was sweating a little bit, but for everyone else it was fun to see.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/08/mikael-eriksson-1770554040787.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Helldivers 2 game director Mikael Eriksson has big plans for the game.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Are you suggesting significant differences between outcomes this time around in a way that players haven't seen before, where things you might have created for one outcome just might never see the light of day?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikael Eriksson:</strong> I want to make sure to set the right expectations here. Our primary inspiration for the Galactic War is tabletop role-playing games. And in tabletop role-playing games — for anyone who's played this — they know that there's a story that you can follow. This story is basically set, and the Game Master tells this story, but the players engage with the story in different ways and they create memories together, really powerful memories together that they share. It's a shared fantasy that they have. And this is unique, because how things play out in the tabletop role-playing game is not predetermined, but you take these memories with you and they can be and often are very powerful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I would say that what we're aiming for with Helldivers is similar, where we do want things to be consequential, and the type of consequences that we talk about is, for one, the story plays out in a way that we don't know, and this is up to the players to determine, or the story outcomes I should say, because we have the story that we're telling, we know what’s going to happen. We know that players will now go to Cyberstan, but we don't know how it will play out. We don't know if they will win. We don't know if they will lose. And there will be impacts on the Galactic War level. So the story that is being written in the Galactic War will change depending on what they do. And it can be quite consequential. Planets can get destroyed to never be able to be played on again. That sort of thing can happen. Or they don't get destroyed. This has happened in the past. Players have even voted to blow up planets, and they show us what to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what we are trying to do is we're trying to go as deep as we can, and deeper with every update, into this kind of experience where it really feels impactful on the meta layer, where you can see afterwards on the Galactic War screen. You can see it only looks like this because of all the actions that we took. But then there's of course additional things that we're talking about, which is impactful and persistent gameplay changes as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we're playing a little bit with all kinds of things here for this experience, and I don't want to spoil things so players will know what I'm talking about as soon as they're fighting this battle. But for the future, the summary of what we're doing is that we really want to have persistent story changes depending on community actions, and also persistent Galactic War consequences that you would be able to see and shape for all future time, and also tie rewards and actual gameplay differences to these things as well. That's the more high-level goal. And I think it is one of the most fun things with this game, the stories that the players create together when they interact with this game. I do think that's extremely powerful and it's one of the most fun things that we do with this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So are you looking to improve how the game itself helps players understand their role in the Galactic War and how they impact it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikael Eriksson:</strong> Yeah. Okay, so I'll jump ahead a little bit. Even though I do think that we make strides in this direction with this upcoming update, the one that's going live right now, I also agree completely with what you're saying. As a new player or even an experienced player, when you come into the game, it can be confusing. What's happening in fact right now? For what reason? What's the context? Do I have to understand the full Galactic War to be able to understand this? Or is it okay if I just understand the current event? This can be quite tricky for players, and this is not what we want. So I can openly say that we are actively working on getting to a point where regardless of if you're new or if you're experienced, you should just be able to get into the game and understand very easily exactly what's happening and why we're fighting the fight that we're doing right now. And additionally and more importantly for me, what the consequences are, or rather what's at stake. So that's something that we are actively working on. It's one of the key things and key focuses for upcoming updates. So I'm happy to say that this is a really big part of what we're focusing on for the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It must be an interesting design challenge for you to maintain what makes Helldivers special, but also accommodate people who are either newcomers or returning players who haven't played for a while in a gameplay sense?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikael Eriksson:</strong> Yeah. I think one of the strengths of Helldivers is that it is very easy to understand the fantasy and get into it quickly. You can watch the opening cinematic with our John Helldiver character — named by the community — you can watch that and you can get it immediately. Then you can just participate in the fantasy and have fun. And we never want to stray away from that. We never want to get to a point where we've built so much complexity into the game that it's a real uphill battle to get into it. That's not what we want to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We of course think a lot about this. Players will leave for a while and then will return, and we think it's very important that when they return, they can very easily get back into it and they can participate in this epic fantasy together and create these great memories that they can then bring with them for, I mean, ideally their entire lives. We want to believe that we actually add real value to the lives of real people. And so we do not want this to feel like an uphill battle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this new update, I do think that it will be quite straightforward what the goals are. Everyone's marching towards Cyberstan and there will be an epic battle on Cyberstan, and I do think it's going to be easy to understand what the stakes are and what's at play. But yes, for every coming update that we're going to do now, this will increasingly be a focus. So that should always be easy to get into and always be easy to understand. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Last month Johan Pilestedt [CCO of Arrowhead and creative director on Helldivers 2], talked about a rogue-lite mode casually on Twitter as if it was nothing. I'd love to pick your brains about what's going on there.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikael Eriksson:</strong> Rogue-lite is a very big umbrella. I'm always happy when the community is active and speculating and coming up with ideas and just participating in the conversation. We have a really awesome community, so the more the merrier, keep it coming! I'm very happy about all this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rogue-lite, very big umbrella. A lot of people hear it and a lot of them have different opinions about what this sort of means. What I can say is with this new update, players will see that there's at least some similarities to rogue-lite with how the meta game plays out on Cyberstan. There’s going to be some elements there that the players will think are quite interesting. But tempering expectations here, it's not full rogue-lite. We do draw some inspiration from that in some aspects with this new updates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the future, here's what I'll say without confirming anything: we are experimenting with many different game modes. I can tackle it actually from this direction with this game: we want to basically offer all kinds of experiences that make sense in this universe. The way I view this game is I view it as a living universe. It's actually out there, where things are happening and players can be invaded from nowhere with an enemy that they didn't anticipate and so forth. And in this kind of universe, it makes sense that it would have an impact on what you choose to do. So if you choose to defend one planet or you choose to do a mission on this specific location, that should have an impact that should be persistent, and you should carry that with you to the next mission in the operation and so forth. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I do think that with the game that we have right now, it's actually not as consequential as it would actually be in this actual universe. Do you see what I'm saying? So it makes sense to draw inspiration from that kind of game in our universe, not because we want to emulate any other game, but rather because yeah, this actually does make sense in our universe. So for that reason, we are experimenting with all of these different kind of modes, but it's coming from a place of, how do we make sure that this game delivers on the promise that this game is, to deliver on this universe and everything that makes sense within it? That's why we choose to go to Cyberstan. Of course, in this universe, Super Earth should be able to attack the enemy home planets, right? You couldn't do that when we launched the game, but of course we should be able to do that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And of course that home planet should look different and play different from if we are being invaded, or if we're playing out in an open landscape. And of course it should make a difference if the battle goes very quickly or if it takes a long time. There's also a resource war going on. We don't have to build a super advanced strategic game, but we still need to stay true to this fantasy. So yeah, there's a lot of stuff that we still want to do, and we're exploring many things, but it's all coming from a place of how do we deliver on the full promise of what this game is and what it should be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Helldivers 2 is two years old now. Do you have a better understanding of what Helldivers 2 is, how to work on it, how to meet community demands? Do you feel like you've gotten to a place that is better for you guys as well as players? How would you assess the state of things now? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikael Eriksson:</strong> When we launched the game, we were not really used to being a live-service studio of this size and with an audience of this size either. So we were really finding our way in this new environment. We've come to a point now after many ups and downs where we're starting to really find our identity as a live-service studio that is in it for the long haul. We can have this conversation again when Helldivers 2 is 10-years-old! We can talk about it then! But that's where we're going. We're in it for the long run. And I do think it's getting way more stable. So we still have some issues lingering in the game, but we're dealing with them one at a time. And I really believe that the future is looking bright and that we can get away from the really big ups and downs. Hopefully we're looking at this year being the most stable and most predictable yet I think in terms of just quality of our updates, and to be able to deliver a consistently smooth experience to players. So I'm very happy with where we are heading, and I really do believe that the future is very bright for Helldivers in this year and many years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it's also super fun. Working on Helldivers as a live-service game is just bliss, because it’s such an interesting universe, endless possibilities, and we have many, many ideas that have yet to come to fruition. And I just want to see what the future holds and stick around for long enough to build everything that we want to build. That's what I'm hyped about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Would Helldivers 2 need a significant tech overhaul, almost like a tech rebuild, for you to implement really game-changing systems and mechanics? The first two years we've seen great updates. You've added new vehicles, various new weapons, strategems, new planets of course. But I mean to the point where it would be considered significantly game-changing — if you're talking about a 10-year plan, something really attention grabbing that fundamentally changed the way the games works — would it need something like that to support it? Or do you feel like the way the game is now could support those game changing updates?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikael Eriksson:</strong> I think what I can say there is that when we launched, we had to prove to ourselves and everyone that we had a good formula for live-service games. So you're right that we have added a lot of really interesting, cool updates and I think that we have a good formula. We are doing what we call ‘good FOMO,’ that's what I call it at least, where we do these really cool updates where the outcomes are not predetermined and the community comes together, and they really love it, we really love it, and it's super fun to play with them. And so we got to a point where, alright, we believe that we have something that works and we have many awesome plans for the future — this being one of them with The Machine of Oppression. And you're right that we've had these tech issues lingering in the meantime that we've had to deal with. I won't speak to any sort of tech overhaul that we need to do or not, but what I can say is that we've invested heavily into tech improvements over the last year, and these things can sometimes take a while to cook, but we've already managed to, for example, reduce the fight size by over 100GBs on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So that was a massive win for us, and there's many other initiatives that's happening. We brought many more people in to work on these tech performance improvements. More is to come with every other update. I really do believe that we would be in a better place. And we fully intend to keep developing our tech and keep building on it to allow for even more things in the game, more variety of the sort that we struggle to do now because we are limited by tech. So yeah, we're committed and we are spending a lot of time and effort just working on these improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Helldivers 2, you are a single squad of four players that drops down onto a planet and goes about its business and escapes having completed various objectives, and it's wonderful fun, I absolutely love it. But when I'm talking about the previous question, it’s setting up the idea that that scope could be significantly expanded. What if there were two squads competing against each other in some way or working together in some way? What if there were three squads? What if a squad was bigger? Or the play space was bigger as a result? And that sort of tech question comes from a place of wondering about whether those sorts of things are possible in the current Helldivers 2, or it would require significant work to be able to enable those things. That's more what I was getting at with the previous question, but it'd be great to get your take on that.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikael Eriksson:</strong> One of the best things about working with this game is that the cool things that you can do in this universe are kind of obvious, at least many of them are. So having multiple squads working together, or bigger squads, or way more enemies, or way more friendly NPCs by your side, like with the SEAF soldiers that we have in the Super Earth cities, these are things that we know — at least we think we know — can be super cool. What I’ll say is of course we're experimenting with this and we do have grand plans in this sort of area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting the game to be a consistently smooth experience for everyone is a number one priority. This has to be the case across all platforms and on the recommended specs for PC, on the lower end hardware and so forth. That will be the first priority and that's what we're doing first. But then yes, we are of course looking into how to expand the game in ways that is not currently possible with, for example, more players and so forth. But I really want to make this clear: I'm not promising anything or announcing anything with that. But what I want to emphasize is, we are working with a game that has these quite obvious things that you would want to test, me included. And I'm very hyped about pushing this game to say, okay, what can it be? It comes back to the delivering of the fantasy of this game is delivering on the promise of this universe. That's where we keep going, and we want to keep going for many years. And assuming that we can do that, then I'm sure that there will be many, many things of this sort that will come up as we go into the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/replaced-final-preview-you-might-think-you-know-what-it-is-but-i-promise-you-dont</link>
            <guid>1429993</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">OK, I know that whenever a new cyberpunky-looking sci-fi game shows up, everybody says it’s “like Blade Runner”. Well, Replaced actually is. Like Ridley Scott’s masterpiece, it’s both exactly what you’d expect from a story-led neo-noir thriller, and also very different in a multitude of ways. Yes, those neon-drenched, screenflicker-lit streets could be the ones that Deckard once ran down, but as for what you actually do in those streets, Replaced utilises a surprising combination of ideas that make for a confident mix of platforming, puzzling, and combat. Across its opening three hours, it takes that well-worn Replicant shell, but augments it with aspects from the likes of Ninja Gaiden, Inside, and even LucasArts classics, to create an exciting new cyberpunk vehicle, all while looking and sounding absolutely gorgeous. It’s safe to say I’m excited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I won’t say too much about what I’ve seen of the story so far, but you’ll need the basics. Replaced casts you as a “Research Engine for Altering and Composing Humans”, better known as Reach; an artificial intelligence that accidentally finds itself taking control of a human body. Following an explosive escape from the facility it called home, this now-corporeal AI must try to return to the place of its creation to uncover the mystery of how this all happened. The problem is, that research centre sits inside a gargantuan sci-fi city surrounded by a towering perimeter wall that you have since fallen outside of. Think Final Fantasy 7’s Midgar, if what lurked outside of its confines was more akin to Mad Max’s wasteland. That’s because Replaced takes place in an alternative universe America, where the US government, in a somewhat rogue move, decided to turn its nuclear weapons on its own territory, rather than Japan’s.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Replaced Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This dark scenario makes for a world where class and wealth divides have only grown in magnitude, with the affluent population of Phoenix City leeching off the bodies of those surviving outside, deeming them “Disposals” and harvesting their organs at will. It's an ugly setup, but one that looks absolutely stunning due to developer Sad Cat Studio’s decision to render this world in an eye-catching 2.5D pixelated style that reflects both the retro nature of its inspirations, but also its desire to show us something new as it attempts to “reinvent the cinematic platformer”. The opening escape alone is a showcase for both the driving synthwave soundtrack and the glistening sheen of its visuals. It somehow simultaneously manages to look satisfyingly old-school thanks to its NES-like blocks of colour, but also thoroughly modern, as thick layers of smoke and striking 3D lighting sit atop crunchy pixels to add yet another filmic flourish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That cinematic presentation also stretches to how each combat encounter is framed. The camera zooms in to create a tense sense of claustrophobia. The depth of field twists shallower so that you and your foes are the sole focus. Slo-mo finishers add yet another dash of cool as bodies are flung to the floor before being dispatched with the blast of a pistol. The fighting starts out simple, translating the Batman: Arkham formula of dodges, parries, and strikes to a 2D plane successfully — complete with flashing red and yellow warning signals above enemy heads — but gradually introduces some welcome complexity over time. Heavy attacks are added to your arsenal and are required to tear armour off of certain enemies so that damage can be dealt to them.</p><p>Want to blow a hole in someone? You'll have to bruise their flesh first.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re also handed a Blade Runner-like blaster pistol that sits inside Reach’s customary Deckard-like coat. There’s an incredibly satisfying hefty weight to this hand cannon, which sends foes flying off-screen in a manner I perhaps found a little too much delight in. It’s a powerful tool, capable of one-shotting brutes that otherwise take many punches to perish, but one that’s smartly kept limited by a novel ammunition system, which rewards you with rounds for performing well in its melee action. Aggression is encouraged - striking and countering enemies builds up your gun’s charge, whereas dodging and remaining passive noticeably drains it. Want to blow a hole in someone? You'll have to bruise their flesh first. It’s a rhythm you’ll have to get to grips with if you want to overcome some of Replaced’s beefier foes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My playtime ended in a boss battle with “Uncle Ben”. No, not Spider-Man's deceased family member nor the face of the since-rebranded packs of microwaveable rice, but a cybernetic LeChuck lookalike with a death wish. Ben is the hulking leader of the Termites, a Mad Max Fury Road-like faction who hide in the dark as whispers of Valhalla echo around their sewer lair. The boss fight itself was a challenge, significantly stepping up the complexity compared to the hordes of enemies I’d encountered up until that point due to the large amount of damage Ben could deal, the sheer size of his health bar, and the fact that he’s restored to full HP for a tougher second phase. Reviving an enemy for round two in the very first very boss battle is cruel stuff, but I couldn’t help but chuckle when it happened.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This battle required patience and a close reading of the opponent, and this approach serves as a throughline for each and every one of Replaced’s encounters. Patience is rewarded, and timely button presses are required instead of quickfire spamming. That’s not just the formula behind combat, though; Replaced’s puzzles and platforming are also methodical — this isn’t a game that wants you to zip through its handsome levels, but instead stop to smell the sewage and read through its journal entries on Reach’s gloriously retro tablet device. Its slow pace surprised me at first, with a touch more holding right on the thumb stick and hopping over a few more fallen tree trunks than maybe I would've desired, but it's all in service of setting the scene. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Platforming never got overly complicated, with routes clearly marked in yellow and interactable objects made obvious for the most part, but it can be a little fiddly at times. Frustrations arise due to hit boxes sometimes not appearing as clearly as I'd like, and very occasionally, the gorgeous blending of art styles leading to a little difficulty in distinguishing decoration from obstacle. From what I’ve seen so far, whereas Replaced’s combat impresses greatly, its platforming is merely serviceable.</p><p>Replaced switches into LucasArts mode, as a surprise helping of those beloved ‘90s point-and-click adventures make their way into this world.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s at this point that you may be asking yourself. “Simon, I thought Replaced was <em>exactly</em> the sort of sci-fi action platformer that you’ve just described. Where is all the unexpected stuff?” Well, that’s where Chapter 2 comes into play, sandwiched between the facility escape intro and the Termite hideout infiltration. It’s in this section that Replaced switches into LucasArts mode, as a surprise helping of those beloved ‘90s point-and-click adventures make their way into this world. Reach is thrown into a bustling town on the outskirts of Phoenix City that echoes the feel and fashion of Full Throttle, complete with seedy bars and unwelcoming characters to stumble into. It’s here that Replaced trades in the platforming and combat cocktail it initially serves up and instead asks you to walk, talk, and, if you so desire, help out its citizens through side missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I walked through its back alleys full of dodgy doctors and questionable figures asking for favours, and decided to help out a couple. One led me on a fetch quest to reclaim a pair of binoculars from a girl in a rundown arcade. Once I’d ripped an electrical component from a nearby machine in service of powering up one of the games, binoculars girl let me know that she’d only part with her telescopic goggles once I’d beaten her high score on the newly revived cabinet. So, unexpectedly, I found myself chasing big points on a very rudimentary arcade game that played like Crazy Taxi meets Operation. Then, binoculars finally in hand, I  headed back to their original owner and was rewarded with an extra half a heart for my health meter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I appreciate that while these optional objectives come with traditional bonuses such as improved medstims for use in combat, they also enrich your understanding of the world and the social and political dynamics at play within it. And so it’s the inclusion of these more open world-style hubs that makes for a complete package that feels, unexpectedly,  as informed by Disco Elysium as much as it is old-school Ninja Gaiden. And I feel I’ve only just scratched the surface – beyond the playable demo, Sad Cat also showed me later sections of Replaced that offered a glimpse inside of Phoenix City’s walls, home to a hacking puzzle minigame and even social stealth elements involving blending into the crowd at busy road crossings to avoid looming security drones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But no matter what you’re tasked with doing, it seems as if Replaced never loses sight of its slick style and rich tone grounded in a love for all things Blade Runner, all while letting that reverence permeate into every aspect of its design in interesting ways. I started my playthrough thinking I knew exactly what I was in for. I was wrong, but thankfully still ended it excited, knowing there’s still plenty left to discover when Replaced arrives for PC and Xbox on March 12. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <p>A new report suggests Blizzard has partnered with Korean gaming giant Nexon - owner of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> and The Finals studio Embark - to create a shooter of some kind based on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a> brand.</p>
<p>The report, published on <a href="https://www.dnews.co.kr/uhtml/view.jsp?idxno=202601301526154230994">Korean site dnews</a> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexon-to-reimagine-starcraft-as-a-shooter-secret-project-underway.1429834/">picked up by Resetera</a>, heard from "industry sources" that Nexon signed a "cooperation contact" last year with Blizzard "for content development related to the StarCraft IP". Nexon has reportedly set up a dedicated team for the project and is housing it in its shooting division, suggesting the game is a shooter. Not much is known beyond that, apart from famed StarCraft modder Choi Jun-ho has apparently been hired to guide the team.</p>
<p>This news follows suspicions from earlier this year that Blizzard is preparing a StarCraft-related announcement for BlizzCon this year, in September. Those reports in turn follow talk from last year that Blizzard is working on a StarCraft shooter. Respected reporter Jason Schreier, who'd written an insider-based book about Blizzard's history, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm">told IGN</a> that, "They are working on a StarCraft shooter. StarCraft is not dead at Blizzard." Former Far Cry man Dan Hay is apparently in charge.</p>

<p>If this is true, it will be Blizzard's third known attempt to make a StarCraft shooter. The first attempt, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/news270306ghost">StarCraft Ghost, was public and was cancelled almost exactly 20 years ago</a>. The second attempt was never announced but was said to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-reportedly-cancels-first-person-starcraft-shooter">codenamed Ares and cancelled in 2019</a>.</p><p>This wouldn't be the first time Blizzard has partnered with another company to adapt one of its major gaming brands. Relatively recently, Blizzard partnered with Chinese gaming giant NetEase to produce mobile game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a>, which - even after a falling out between the two companies - remains a key part of the company's Diablo vision. Could Blizzard be doing something similar with Nexon?</p>
<p>Perhaps a more pertinent question is: if this is true, what kind of game will this be? Blizzard games are fundamentally about people playing together - it's one of the company's core tenets - so multiplayer will almost certainly feature in some way. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> is a futuristic multiplayer shooter too, so if this is true, how do you make a StarCraft shooter different enough to live alongside it?</p>
<p>Nexon is the Korean company that famously owns Arc Raiders studio Embark, but which also produced The First Berserker: Khazan last year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> in 2023. It also runs a number of online games including Sudden Attack and MapleStory.</p>

            <p>Hey, remember Netflix's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> movie that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-expect-that-netflix-bioshock-movie-any-time-soon-three-years-on-it-still-doesnt-have-a-finished-script">is going nowhere</a> for the time being? No? We don't blame you, as we're having a hard time trying not to forget about it ourselves. Funnily enough, we continue to get more updates on Gore Verbinski's take on the material, which has been dead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levine-personally-killed-off-the-bioshock-film-heres-why">for nearly 13 years now</a>.</p>
<p>While promoting his latest movie (Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1qwyvlg/hi_rmovies_im_gore_verbinski_director_of_good/">on Reddit</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gore-verbinskis-bioshock-movie-would-have-somehow-included-both-of-the-games-endings">IGN</a>), the original Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy director once again commented on that ambitious big-screen adaptation at Universal that was ultimately binned.</p>
<p>"I loved this project when we were getting close to making it at Universal... I was going to dive deeply into the Oedipal aspect and definitely keep it hard R with the Little Sisters, and the 'choices' the protagonist makes... and the consequences," he said at first. As a healthy reminder, this was a $200m R-rated movie that was unsurprisingly deemed too risky. But considering Verbinski's knack for both epic and creepy visuals, it probably would've been visually stunning at the very least.</p>
<p>We'd already heard how the project came undone and was shelved, but most of the creative deets had been locked away in a vault. This time around, Verbinski was chattier than usual, so he revealed a shocking approach to the game's conclusion: "I had worked out a way with writer John Logan to have both endings and I was looking forward to bringing that to the big screen and really f***ing with people's heads." The first game's two endings were all about showing the Little Sisters the best side of humanity and rescuing them... or harvesting their power to become more powerful yourself. A single murder ruined your chances of getting the good ending, essentially penalising players for chasing easier and faster upgrades.</p><p>Verbinski has shown in the past he's also quite good when it comes to loopy narratives (and A Cure for Wellness might be the best example in his career), so I'm also choosing to think he could've totally pulled off a dual ending which offers no definitive answer.</p>
<p>Nowadays, he admits he's still hearing about the current iteration of the project from time to time, but he's not sure "any studio is quite willing to go where I was headed." With Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games series, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-long-walk-review">The Long Walk</a>) now at the helm and Netflix footing the bill if the project moves forward, there's a good chance the movie could retain some of the needed edge, but we're not expecting a $200m R-rated epic at this point.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[All Her Fault Is A Thriller About Gender Roles]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/all-her-fault-peacock/</link>
            <guid>1429969</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I recently got a subscription to Peacock, NBC’s streaming service, mainly to watch Six Nations rugby and the Olympics. But it also finally gave me a chance to watch <em>All Her Fault</em>, an eight-episode series about a missing child and the fathers and husbands who are useless at finding him.</p><p><em>All Her Fault</em>, which premiered back in November, stars <em>Succession</em>’s Sarah Snook as Marissa Irvine, a Chicago mom and finance worker who arranges a playdate for her son, Milo, over text with another mom at Milo’s school. But when Marissa goes to the address that mom, Jenny Kaminski, has given her, neither Milo nor Jenny are there, and the older woman who is has no idea what Marissa is talking about. It quickly becomes clear this isn’t just a mixup; someone has kidnapped Milo. The first episode stays painfully close to the Irvine and Kaminski families as they realize the severity of the situation and their roles in it.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J9y_QvRwu64?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="All Her Fault | Official Trailer | Peacock Original"></iframe></figure><p>As someone who cannot deal with any media where a kid is upset, I was relieved that <em>All Her Fault</em> very quickly lets you know Milo is alive and, all things considered, having a fine time, as well as revealing the identity of the kidnapper. But this doesn’t sap the drama out of things. Instead, the rest of the show unravels the relationship between Marissa, her husband Peter (Jake Lacy), and Peter’s family, as well as the relationship between Jenny (Dakota Fanning) and her husband Richie (Thomas Cocquerel). Jenny feels responsible for what’s happened, for several reasons, and even though Richie warns her that getting involved with Marissa could be an admission of guilt, she goes against his advice to support her fellow mom.&nbsp;</p><p>Their growing relationship stands in contrast to their relationships with their husbands. Peter and Richie both attempt to take charge and control things, but neither is any good at it; they are both distant, incompetent fathers, despite exuding confidence and control in the rest of their lives. They cannot adequately describe what their children were wearing or provide any information about the kids’ nannies because they let their wives handle all that. But that doesn’t stop Peter from getting angry at Marissa for not doublechecking the details of the playdate, or Richie from weaseling out of caring for his and Jenny’s son even though Jenny is managing the household, her job, and the situation with Marissa. It’s important that they see themselves as active players in their families’ lives, and in the Irvines’ case in particular, this has disastrous ramifications.</p><p>While the gender politics can get a bit heavy-handed, it’s all an interesting twist on the usual familial thriller format. Jenny is trying to land a big client at her publishing job, and we see her keep literally everything together while something terrible is happening in her personal life, making presentations and managing school dropoff while still being there for Marissa. Of course no one can <em>actually</em> do it all; both families have nannies, which becomes another complex issue the show explores, with what it means to invite a stranger into your home to care for your kids being a vector to explore class divides and maternal expectations. The Kaminskis and the Irvines are both obscenely wealthy, and while the show never goes as hard as movies like <em>Parasite </em>on what it means to have “help,” it does suggest that even with all these resources at their disposal, Jenny and Marissa cannot escape the expectations society heaps on moms. This also highlights the expectations placed on nannies, and the complicated roles they find themselves in as both employees and de facto members of a family. It never goes too deep into of this, but the questions it raises gives it more depth than I expected from the show on its surface.</p><p>The plot turns more soap opera than thriller pretty quickly, but each episode does a good job of introducing some new plot twist or secret between its cast that kept me watching even if I scoffed a bit at the situation. Even when things stretched the bounds of credulity, the show’s focus on its exploration of family and gender kept it feeling grounded. There’s nothing particularly revelatory in it either as a drama or in its politics, but combining the two things makes it something intriguing and unique. </p><p>I appreciated how <em>All Her Fault</em> does something beyond the standard thriller and provides its own take on the division of labor within families. The flow of getting some questions answered while raising new ones kept me deciding “OK, just one more episode” until I’d watched the whole thing much faster than I meant to. I’m a single queer man with no kids, surely not the show’s intended audience, so I’d be curious to know what viewers with actual families think of it all.   </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Discord <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally">announced on Monday</a> that it’s rolling out age verification on its platform globally starting next month, when it will automatically set all users’ accounts to a “teen-appropriate” experience unless they demonstrate that they’re adults.</p><p>Users who aren’t verified as adults will not be able to access age-restricted servers and channels, won’t be able to speak in Discord’s <a href="https://discord.com/stages">livestream-like “stage” channels</a>, and will see content filters for any content Discord detects as graphic or sensitive. They will also get warning prompts for friend requests from potentially unfamiliar users, and DMs from unfamiliar users will be automatically filtered into a separate inbox.</p><p>Direct messages and servers that are not age-restricted will continue to function normally, but users won’t be able to send messages or view content in an age-restricted server until they complete the age check process, even if it’s a server they were part of before age verification rolled out. Savannah Badalich, Discord’s global head of product policy, said in an interview with <em>The Verge</em> that those servers will be “obfuscated” with a black screen until the user verifies they’re an adult. Users also won’t be able to join any new age-restricted servers without verifying their age.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption><em>Unverified users won’t be able to enter age-restricted servers. </em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Discord</cite></span></p></section><p>Discord’s global age verification launch is part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/715767/online-age-verification-not-ready">a wave of similar moves</a> at other online platforms, driven by an international legal push for age checks and stronger child safety measures. This is not the first time Discord has implemented some form of age verification, either. It initially rolled out age checks for users <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/650493/discord-age-verification-face-id-scan-experiment">in the UK and Australia</a> last year, which some users figured out how to circumvent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord">using <em>Death Stranding</em>’s photo mode</a>. Badalich says Discord “immediately fixed it after a week,” but expects users will continue finding creative ways to try getting around the age checks, adding that Discord will “try to bug bash as much as we possibly can.”</p><p>It’s not just teens trying to cheat the system who might attempt to dodge age checks. Adult users could avoid verifying, as well, due to concerns around data privacy, particularly if they don’t want to use an ID to verify their age. In October, one of Discord’s former third-party vendors <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/792032/discord-customer-service-data-breach-hack">suffered a data breach</a> that exposed users’ age verification data, including images of government IDs.</p><p>A government ID might still be required for age verification in its global rollout. According to Discord, to remove the new “teen-by-default” changes and limitations, “users can choose to use facial age estimation or submit a form of identification to [Discord’s] vendor partners, with more options coming in the future.”</p><p>The first option uses AI to analyze a user’s video selfie, which Discord says never leaves the user’s device. If the age group estimate (teen or adult) from the selfie is incorrect, users can appeal it or verify with a photo of an identity document instead. That document will be verified by a third party vendor, but Discord says the images of those documents “are deleted quickly — in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.”</p><p>Badalich also says after the October data breach, Discord “immediately stopped doing any sort of age verification flows with that vendor” and is now using a different third-party vendor. She adds that, “We’re not doing biometric scanning [or] facial recognition. We’re doing facial estimation. The ID is immediately deleted. We do not keep any information around like your name, the city that you live in, if you used a birth certificate or something else, any of that information.”</p><p>However, some users may not have to go through either form of age verification. Discord is also rolling out an age inference model that analyzes metadata like the types of games a user plays, their activity on Discord, and behavioral signals like signs of working hours or the amount of time they spend on Discord.</p><p>“If we have a high confidence that they are an adult, they will not have to go through the other age verification flows,” Badalich says.</p><div><p>“A majority of people are not going to see a change in their experience.”</p></div><p>She goes on to explain that the addition of age assurance will mainly impact adult content: “A majority of people on Discord are not necessarily looking at explicit or graphic content. When we say that, we’re really talking about things that are truly adult content [and] age inappropriate for a teen. So, the way that it will work is a majority of people are not going to see a change in their experience.”</p><p>Even so, there’s still a risk that some users will leave Discord as a result of the age verification rollout. “We do expect that there will be some sort of hit there, and we are incorporating that into what our planning looks like,” Badalich says. “We’ll find other ways to bring users back.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/875309/discord-age-verification-global-roll-out]]></content:encoded>

            <p>You might be wondering why a video game website like <em>Kotaku</em> is writing about sports, but the connection between games and sports runs much deeper than the annual release of <em>Madden</em>. Super Bowl ads tie the year’s biggest sporting event to every facet of our culture, serving as annual conversation pieces thanks to their high-concept ideas, celebrity appearances, and big-budget production value. The event <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/super-bowl-lvi-total-viewing-audience-estimated-at-over-208-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener">draws nine-figure viewership every year</a>, so whether they’re shilling chips, cars, or crypto, Super Bowl ads tend to pull out all the stops. Video game ads during the big game are no exception, and developers and publishers have put out some real standout commercials during the Super Bowl over the years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Fareeha Andersen, the voice actor behind Anran, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s newest fire-wielding hero</span></a><span>, has thrown her support behind an ongoing fan movement begging Blizzard to redesign her character.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you open the comments section of just about any </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a> <span>social media post, you’ll likely see dozens if not hundreds of fans spamming comparison images of Anran as she appears in the game versus how she looked in the animated trailer for Wuyang, her younger brother and a support hero added to the game last year. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-anran-kiriko-juno-face-edit-reaction-change-2000666138"><span>The difference is pretty stark</span></a><span>, with her original design having sharper features and a longer nose.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The Anran that showed up in </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>itself looks pretty different, with a smaller nose, rounded face, and a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-heroes-characters-hotter-young-skins-collab-2000665796"><span>distinct resemblance to previous heroes Kiriko and Juno</span></a><span>. This has fans calling her another example of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s “same face syndrome” in which characters, women especially, tend to all look alike.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Now that fans have gotten loud about it, Andersen has responded in a video that supports the fan movement, with her calling on Blizzard to make Anran look more like her original appearance.</span></p>   <p><span>“I got to mourn Anran between the design I had hoped for her and the design we ended up with,” Andersen says. “Because I think in her comic and the cinematic Elemental Kin, there was a precedent set by it. There was an unspoken promise that said, ‘We are going to challenge the beauty standards plaguing—ransacking—media these days,’ right? The ozempic-chic, the ‘contour your nose, you have no nose, the tiniest nose,’ and I think because of that precedence, people feel understandably let down.”</span></p>

 <p><span>She continued, “</span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> is a trailblazer at challenging that, right? Of trying to break those molds, trying to explore the bounds of what it means to be good, what it looks like to be heroic, and I think the result we got says something else. It says something that leaves a bad taste in our mouths. It’s not the bold, optimistic swing that we know </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> to make.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Andersen says that she has shared the community’s concerns with the Blizzard team, and she hopes that they see and hear all of the feedback. She encourages others to do so as well with “boldness and kindness.” We’ve reached out to Blizzard for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back.</span></p> <p><span>Given the massive response (seriously, you can’t look at pretty much any of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s social media channels without seeing people spamming the comments about this), I would be surprised if Blizzard doesn’t make some changes, but it’s probably not going to be overnight. Anran is currently playable as part of a testing phase before her proper launch tomorrow, February 10, alongside four other heroes as part of the game’s next season.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There isn’t time for Blizzard to update her look before she’s in the game but maybe in a future patch we’ll see some of those more distinct features come back.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Despite the convoluted journey between concept and finished product, despite all the many things that change between initial prototype and whatever ends up in players’ hands, something always remains of the initial feeling that inspired a video game. If you know what to listen for, it’s easy to hear the echo of that original idea. Pokémon was born from a fascination with creatures, Zelda from nostalgia for the freedoms of childhood. Animal Crossing, meanwhile, was born from loneliness.</p><p>Katsuya Eguchi left his home prefecture of Chiba, east of Tokyo, to join Nintendo in 1986. He found it hard to adjust to living in Kyoto. “When I moved . . . I left my family and friends behind,” he told <em>Edge </em>magazine in 2008. “In doing so, I realized that being close to them—being able to spend time with them, talk to them, play with them—was such a great, important thing. I wondered for a long time if there would be a way to re-create that feeling, and that was the impetus behind the original <em>Animal Crossing</em>.”</p><p>Eguchi had a long career at Nintendo—he was a level designer on <em>Super Mario Bros. 3 </em>and <em>Yoshi’s Story</em>, and director on <em>Star Fox </em>and <em>Wave Race 64</em>—before the opportunity to explore his idea of a “communication game” arrived in the late 1990s. Nintendo was working on a floppy disk drive add-on for the N64, called the 64DD. Its disks had a then-ample 64 Mb of rewritable storage, which would allow players to save things that they created. It had the ability to connect to the internet, to share those things. And, most important for the game that would become <em>Animal Crossing</em>, it had a real-time twenty- four-hour clock. This meant that a game could continue to operate on its own schedule, whether you were playing it or not. Something new could be happening whenever the player turned up.</p><p>This wasn’t the first time that Nintendo had released a disk-writing add-on for one of its consoles: the Famicom Disk System sold 4.4 million units in Japan between 1986 and 1990, and it is very fondly remembered there. You could bring a Famicom disk into a game shop and rewrite it for a fee on a charmingly retro-futuristic- looking kiosk machine, from which you could also fax high scores from the disks directly to Nintendo to participate in tournaments. You can still buy bright-yellow Disk System–themed holders for your metro or bank cards in Nintendo’s department stores, featuring its charming mascot, Diskun (Mr. Disk).</p><p>Nintendo made a big fuss about the 64DD when it was announced in 1996, showing a demo of a Zelda game that would become <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. But it was, in the end, one of Nintendo’s hardware failures. It was released in Japan only in December 1999 and discontinued in February 2001, having sold about 15,000 units. Almost all of the soft- ware that had been in development for it ended up being transmog- rified and released in some form on the N64 or the GameCube. This is what happened to Eguchi’s “communication game”: It appeared in 2001 on the N64 under the name <em>Doubutsu no Mori</em>, or <em>Animal Forest</em>, the last game ever released for that console. Unlike the hardware it was initially developed for, it did not become a footnote in Nintendo history. Instead, it became one of its slow-burn successes.</p><p><em>Animal Forest </em>is an odd game. Slightly eerie, even. You arrive as a vacant-eyed stranger in a strange place, the only human in a population of chattering animals, and immediately you are railroaded into purchasing a house from Tom Nook, an arch-capitalist tanuki landlord, whom you must then pay back bit by bit. Each player’s cartridge was home to a unique, individually generated town, with space for four people to build a home, decorate it, talk to the animals, send and receive letters, and go hunting for shells, insects, and fish around the rivers, trees, and beaches. That was it. You couldn’t finish <em>Animal Forest</em>; you couldn’t play it well or badly. You just kind of . . . existed within it, checking in every day to see what was happening in your virtual life, who was moving in and out of town, what special events were coming up on the calendar. It continued to exist whether you were there or not. Spend a long time away, and weeds would grow up around the village. Your neighbors would be shocked to see you upon your return.</p><p>It is astonishing how ahead of its time <em>Animal Forest </em>turned out to be. Technology took years to catch up with its ideas. That initial version of the game, later ported to the GameCube as <em>Animal Crossing</em>, sold just over two million units, but each time a new version of the game was released, it came into a world that was more suited to it. For a long time Animal Crossing was one of Nintendo’s lesser-known series, one of those deep cuts you could feel smug about importing. But by the time <em>Wild World </em>turned up on the Nintendo DS, in 2005, the idea of internet-enabled social gaming was becoming mainstream. That game sold almost twelve million. By 2012, when <em>New Leaf </em>came out on the 3DS, the concept of expressing yourself within a game and sharing your creations with others was, thanks to social media, also totally normal- ized. The result: thirteen million sales. And then, in March 2020, <em>New Horizons </em>was released the same month that much of the world went into lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. It offered community, creativity, relaxation, and connection to a world that was suddenly starved of all those things. It sold over forty-five million copies and became the dominant pop-cultural phenomenon of that dreadful time. Way back in 1986, Eguchi envisioned a game that might ease his loneliness. In 2020, <em>New Horizons </em>saved the whole world from loneliness. There are few more perfect illustrations of the power of video games.</p><p>By the late nineties, Katsuya Eguchi had settled in Kyoto. He had friends, colleagues, a wife and children. But now he had a new problem: He was often so busy at work that he didn’t have time to play video games together with his family. His wife played games, his children played games, but there was no way for them to play together if his children were already asleep by the time he got home from the office.</p><p>“I was sad that I couldn’t play games with my kids, even though I knew it would be fun,” Eguchi explained at a Nintendo company seminar in 2008. “From the beginning my idea was that, if this is the way it’s going to be, maybe there’s something we could do that would let someone in a similar situation to me come home late and play. And that would somehow overlap with what the kids had played.”</p><div><p>“I was sad that I couldn’t play games with my kids, even though I knew it would be fun.”</p></div><p>Working with the theme of “playing with others,” Eguchi teamed up with Hisashi Nogami and Takashi Tezuka, and got the green light to start putting a game together in around 1998. The prototype they developed was absolutely nothing like <em>Animal Crossing</em>. It was a multiplayer dungeon adventure game.</p><p>“The beginning of that design was that you’d have this role-playing- game-like world in this massive field, and multiple people would enter, and your play would affect the other players . . . For instance, say the kids were adventuring in a dungeon during the day and made it some of the way through, but then they reach a point they can’t get past. When dad came home at night, he could use the information the kids left as a hint and clear the dungeon, and proceed further. I wondered how that kind of relay-type play would be.”</p><p>The only connection to <em>Animal Crossing </em>in this prototype—apart from the idea of playing together—was that players could bring pets with them on their adventures. “There are lots of RPGs where you become the hero, but in the game that I was imagining, the player was powerless,” Eguchi explained. “So I thought, ok, what the player can’t do on their own, they could borrow the power of animals to overcome. That’s the first time the idea of animals came up for this project . . . There wasn’t even a hint of being able to have conversations with animals at the time.” You would have been able to get only so far with your own animal’s powers; at some point you’d need help from another player, hence the social side of the game.</p><p>It was the waning fortunes of the 64DD that forced the team to change tack. “During our original planning phase the field was incredibly large . . . There would be four different islands—one for each of the four seasons, and each island would have small dungeons that you would adventure in,” explained Nogami. “Of course, some- thing so large wouldn’t possibly fit [on a Nintendo 64 cartridge], so we thought fine—let’s make it one [island].”</p><p>“But then we asked ourselves, what could players enjoy doing in such a tiny village?” Eguchi interjected.</p><p>“We thought, well you can’t really have an adventure now, can you,” replied Nogami. “And so we said fine. Let’s get rid of the adventure.”</p><p>Adapted from: Super Nintendo by Keza MacDonald<br>Copyright © 2026 by Keza MacDonald. Published by arrangement with Alfred A.

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Last week, Bulkhead revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wardogs/" id="3558">WARDOGS</a>, a developing first-person tactical shooter with an impressive amount of ambition. It has been in development for several years and shone brightly in the game’s first trailer, which offered a tasty lay of the land for what’s set to come.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the team at Bulkhead was explaining how many aspects of WARDOGS will work, including monetization. In a thinly-veiled stab at Call of Duty, they stressed that there will be ‘No Nikki Minaj skins. No bullshit.’</p>







<h2 id="h-wardogs-is-all-about-realism">WARDOGS is All About Realism</h2>



<p>WARDOGS is bursting with potential and has already garnered a sizeable following since dropping its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wardogs-reveal-trailer-100-player-tactical-warfare/">inaugural trailer last week</a>. It’s a large-scale, wide conflict game with destruction elements, vehicles, a unique economy model, and above all else, <strong>realism</strong> running deep in its veins.</p>



<p>That’s why the team recently addressed the game’s monetization model and said that there won’t be any battle pass features or ‘Nikki Minaj skins’.</p>



<p>This is a reference to Call of Duty, which has spent the last few years promoting inane crossover cosmetics packs that have featured the likes of Nikki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, Family Guy, Beavis and Butthead, and Squid Game, to name a few. It has long since diluted the Call of Duty name and made it feel like something closer to Fortnite.</p>



<p>Here’s the full post from the team at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bulkhead/" id="3559">Bulkhead</a>, WARDOGS’ developer:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>// MONESTISATION?</p><p>No Battlepass. No Pay to Win.<br>No Nikki Minaj Skins. No Bullshit.</p><p>Earn cosmetics by playing.</p><p>WARDOGS is an immersive, Tactical All Out Warfare FPS that doesn't forget it's a game… <a href="https://t.co/Yp3d280XxQ">pic.twitter.com/Yp3d280XxQ</a></p></div>— WARDOGS (@WARDOGS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WARDOGS/status/2020591501785678082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>WARDOGS doesn’t have a release date yet, nor does it have a testing window arranged, but prospective fans are being invited to sign up to receive updates on that front as soon as they’re available.</p>



<p>In WARDOGS, players start a match with $10,000 in their pocket, and as they play, they earn more money. That money is then spent on weapons, vehicles, upgrades, and other items designed to turn the tide of battle. It’s a large-scale concept that can be scaled right down to the individual player, of which there are 100 in every match.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation will stream a major State of Play broadcast this week, featuring over an hour of news and reveals, including the latest updates from its own teams within PlayStation Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event will be held this Thursday, February 12 at 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern / 10pm UK time — and as ever, IGN will be reporting live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has said that the broadcast will run to "60+ minutes" — suggesting fans have a meaty show to look forward to. But what could PlayStation have up its sleeves?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-everything-announced">Sony's last major State of Play broadcast, held back in September 2025</a>, finally treated fans to a good look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Marvel's Wolverine</a>, which is in development by the talented team behind the console's various Spider-Man titles: PlayStation studio Insomniac Games. Other games showcased included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/saros">Saros</a>, the next project from Returnal studio Housemarque, as well as third-party titles such as Battlefield 6 and Nioh 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company then held <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/state-of-play-japan-everything-announced-updating-live">a smaller-scale State of Play in November 2025 focused solely on Japanese titles</a>, and it was here we got a look at Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, Elden Ring Nightreign expansion The Forsaken Hollows, Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation fans will certainly be keen to see more of Wolverine and Saros, and potentially discover a release date for the former. We're also likely to see something of Bungie's long-delayed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, which will finally arrive on March 5 — less than a month away. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Saros September 2025 State of Play - Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Saros has already been dated for April 30, though currently all we know for certain of Wolverine's arrival is that he'll land in the second half of this year. (With GTA 6 due on November 16, it'll likely be earlier, and well clear of that.) Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-kind-of-fancy-lawyer-lingo-marvels-wolverine-developer-just-dropped-a-big-tease-for-another-hero-fans-believe">a tease from Insomniac Games hinted at Wolverine meeting Daredevil in the game</a>. And, of course, we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game-for-ps5-and-pc">just got a first look at multiplayer Horizon spin-off Hunters Gathering</a>. Perhaps we'll get more news on early play sessions?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Third-party games set for PS5 in the coming months include Capcom's Monster Hunter Stories 3 and Pragmata, which just got a showing in Nintendo's Partner Direct, Square Enix's climactic Life is Strange Reunion, Hitman developer IO Interactive's 007 First Light and Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight from Warner Bros. Games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The confirmation of a State of Play this week will mean that all three major platform holders will have held some form of announcement broadcast within the first six weeks of 2026 — though Nintendo fans still hope there is a dedicated first-party Nintendo Direct also waiting in the wings with more news on the company's own games (and perhaps a new 3D Mario). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, though, join us here on IGN for all of the news and reveals from this week's State of Play in just a few days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
