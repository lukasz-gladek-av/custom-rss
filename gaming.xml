            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios and Sony have announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and it's arriving just in time for the spookiest time of the year.</p>
<p>As revealed in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/24/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond-launches-oct-31/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a new PlayStation Blog post</a>, the Truth Enforcers Warbond brings two primary weapons, a new pistol to try out, and new armor, plus cosmetic patterns and an emote to help you stand out from the crowd (not that you'd want to do that, soldier).</p>
<p>First up, you're getting the Punisher-esque SG-20 Halt pump-action shotgun, which alternates between stun rounds and flechette that can pierce armor. Your second new primary weapon is the SMG-32 Reprimand, a heavy SMG with a "cool slap reload".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond-shotgun.jpg?itok=X2N5B6BP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond-shotgun.jpg?itok=OdFr5xjj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond comes complete with a cool new shotgun and more.</figcaption></figure><p>On the secondary weapon front, you've got a new plasma pistol, the PLAS-15 Loyalist, to try out. You can either use this one as a semi-auto plasma pistol or give it a "shot with more kick".</p>
<p>New light and medium armor sets are also being added in this Warbond. The UF-16 Inspector is a white set with red accents, and it comes complete with a complimenting cape. Medium armor lovers will probably prefer to use the UF-50 Bloodhound armor and Pride of the Whistleblower cape.</p>
<p>Both of these armor sets come with the Unflinching passive, which will reduce staggering when you're hit. Since a loss of control on damage is something&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>players have been complaining about for a while, this might go some way towards offsetting the problem.</p>
<p>A rather interesting booster is also being introduced as part of Truth Enforcers: Dead Sprint, which lets you continue sprinting once your stamina has run out, but at the cost of your health instead of your stamina.</p>

<p>This Warbond comes shortly after Arrowhead Game Studios concluded its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/huge-helldivers-2-update-balance-changes-more">60-day balance update program</a>, which was aimed at addressing some of the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>&nbsp;community's most common complaints about the game.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4551541857552166131" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arrowhead itself says</a>, the balance pass has included changes to over 70 weapons and stratagems, as well as overhauls to certain enemies, changes to spawning and targeting, and more.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> (and you <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">won't even need a PSN account</a> to check it out on the former).

But it’s worth noting they’re close to useless, given there is nothing in place to prevent a child creating an adult’s account. In fact, it’s simpler not to.</p><p>To create a brand new <em>Roblox</em> account, you go to the website, click “Sign Up,” then fill in a username, password, and a date of birth. You can pick 1925 from the drop-down menu, and then with a click on “Sign Up” below, that’s it. Seriously. There are no checks whatsoever, no email or phone number required, no verification options—it just hands you an account for a 99-year-old, with full access to all aspects of the application, including all chat features. (It took maybe five clicks from having no account to being able to play <em>Blood &amp; Gore</em>.) To get <em>voice chat</em>, you need a phone number for a verification code, but this can come to WhatsApp so it’s easily subverted.</p><p>So these new features, while welcome, do nothing to prevent kids who have the sense to just scroll down and pick an earlier year of birth. Nor indeed do they help children whose parents have no interest in or awareness of parental controls. And they continue to allow anyone over the age of nine to play games that, under any other circumstances, would have teenage or adult ratings.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Check it out in the images below, captured by Lanny16_I_think on PC.</p><p>For example, this town sequence in the original Zero Dawn is noticeably lacking in NPC characters and has a distracting orange tint to the colors.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4389826-horizonzerodawntown1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389826" data-ratio="0.42615384615385" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4389826-horizonzerodawntown1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389826"></a><figcaption>Aloy arrives in a town from the original version of Horizon Zero Dawn.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4389826-horizonzerodawntown1.jpg"></figure><p>The remastered version significantly increases the background NPCs and removes the orange tint, revealing a much more vibrant environment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4389827-horizonzerodawntown2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389827" data-ratio="0.42153846153846" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4389827-horizonzerodawntown2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389827"></a><figcaption>Aloy's arrival in town in Zero Dawn Remastered.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4389827-horizonzerodawntown2.jpg"></figure><p>The Reddit thread also included a look at the remaster's vastly improved skin textures, as well as the lush background details. However, some of the shots from the original Horizon Zero Dawn don't reflect the intent of the title's developer, Guerrilla Games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/one-lesson-from-10-years-of-writing-for-game-developer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On October 14 2014, I </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/race-and-racism-in-games-dissecting-tech-s-struggle-with-racial-diversity">filed my first freelance story</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for what was then called "Gamasutra." 10 years and a changing of the guard later, I'm now a senior editor for Game Developer, which—I'm sorry—is a 10 times better name than a vaguely appropriative sex pun.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Very few game journalists make it to 10 years at all, fewer still to 10 years at one site. Marking the decade left me with complicated emotions. Why am I still here when so many other great folks have lost their jobs, seen outlets close, and struggled to make a living?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Privilege, inevitably, is part of the answer. I'll leave our readers to determine if there's any degree of talent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I tried writing a "10 lessons from 10 years" and it just wasn't clicking. What exactly do developers need from a look back at the last 10 years? 10 lessons implies I have the perspective to pick the most important insights of an entire decade. I don't! That's okay, that's a lot of pressure for one mild-mannered journalist.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there is one lesson that stayed with me when I tossed away the other nine. It stared up at me from the screen, and seemed to feel like my past self asking my present "what did you learn?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Don't meet your heroes," I almost blurted out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that was the frustration talking. I am not a cynical person. Almost everyone I've met who's uttered the phrase has seemed burned by resentment I don't want to echo.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let me rephrase it. I'd tell my younger self this: "you don't need heroes to be the best you you can be."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="I've had a tendency to put people on pedestals">I've had a tendency to put people on pedestals</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early in my writing days I was stunned when a developer I looked up to in the industry responded to an email and said "yes," he'd be down to do an interview. I was such a novice I live-transcribed it as we talked.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was over the moon. I felt acknowledged by an incredibly creative person and that by taking the interview, he'd somehow validated my creativity and hard work. Then came the angry email.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He raged at me after my piece went up because...well, mostly, typos? Maybe I misquoted him or something but I really remember how angry he was about the typos. I was so stunned I called my then-editor in a panic asking what to do. He was just confused. The typos were cleaned and that was that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I beat myself up for a while (as I'm wont to do still), and assumed I'd done something very bad. I thought this was a normal thing to do, and that I'd harmed this person I looked up to. I was relieved when he didn't even seem to remember it at a meetup at PAX, and he wound up connecting me to people who still shape my career today.</span></p><p>Image via Adobe Stock.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then later on he was publicly accused of various kinds of verbal and interpersonal abuse, and a whole lot of things fell into place. It turned out my first blush with the game industry put me in contact with its worst instincts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">C'est la vie. I don't even blame him for how I thought it was a normal thing to do. I'd been through some shitty work experiences up to that point where I was taught to normalize way worse behavior.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I assumed being nervous about angering everyone around me was a normal way to live.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Abusers in every industry know how to put on a charming face">Abusers in every industry know how to put on a charming face</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm lucky. This was my one interaction with a game development "celebrity" that went really sour. In the decade since, plenty of high-profile names rose to prominence as advocates or charismatic creatives, only for accusations (many corroborated) to surface of how they manipulated and abused partners or coworkers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's been long enough now that I keep running through a loop with these people. They're often high up on the interview list, either as someone I reach out to for comment or someone PR has offered. It's now a semi-regular habit that when allegations surface I </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/building-the-new-pve-features-in-i-wow-battle-for-azeroth-i-">double check our archives</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and find out I'd had a great interview with that person and really enjoyed their company, perhaps even looked up to them as someone to aspire to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This really took a turn outside the world of game development, when a celebrity writer I looked up to was finally outed as being extremely abusive in the workplace, and who often took advantage of his subordinates. I'd built a lot of my creativity identity around this person's work, and reading stories about him that people were too afraid to tell for fear of reprisal left me in a rough spot. If he was such an abusive creep—what was I supposed to do with that?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's put aside for a moment the conversation of how we treat the work of "cancelled" artists—if only because it's largely unhelpful. The victims of abuse deserve more care than a book or film series.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That much has been obvious to me with each outing. What actually tore at me was how I felt somehow </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>lesser</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with each revelation. That I was either an idiot for putting my faith in someone just because of how creative they were or worried that my faith in them revealed something dark about myself. Had I picked up whatever it was that made them abusive?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The only way to answer that is to assess if you've behaved like they have. Otherwise, you're just doing their work for them. Many abusers behave the way they do because they think everyone else acts the same way, or that this behavior is acceptable because it drives creativity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But none of them are that creative, are they? They often get to ride high on the work of other people too exhausted or disinterested to enter the limelight. "Rock stars" often mask the harm they're doing by seeming to overdeliver, and once they're booted out, it's revealed that not much was lost.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's easy to discard them. But where does that leave the rest of us?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="We're all looking for someone who knows what they're doing">We're all looking for someone who knows what they're doing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making games is hard. Landing a job in games might be even harder. But once you feel that creative itch, that sense you might have a good game in you, you're scratching at the walls to find a way in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is no guaranteed way in. When you can't see the path, and aren't even sure how to make the thing you want to make, you cast out in search of resources. And that is where plenty of abusers lay their traps.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The same goes even when you're in the world of game development. If you have no idea how to start a business or build a kind of game feature, the most confident people with the loudest voices will draw you in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's easy to say "don't put anyone on a pedestal," but between LinkedInfluencers, game development conferences, and the video game marketing cycle, pedestal-placing is unfortunately built right into the business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was definitely drawn to some accused abusers because I was a person in search of a path. But finding a path wasn't enough, it still felt like giving them rent-free space in my head was allocating space for insights on how to be a creative person. That I needed their ideas and their behavior to be normal if I was going to do anything other than work on a farm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Luckily that's not how any of this works.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I mentioned up top that the cynical reaction to this is to say "don't meet your heroes." And hey, maybe that's a message lots of folks need. I've met my heroes, and a lot of them sucked.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not all of them did though. Plenty were kind, gave great feedback, and did everything in their power to not play up their talent or popularity. The ones I've gotten to speak with more extensively have been transparent about their failures and even shared opinions that I staunchly disagreed with. It wore some of the sheen off, sure, but I felt lucky. I got to know the actual person I looked up to, not just the projection on the screen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Learning how to grapple with grifters and abusers is more relevant now than ever before as the game industry bleeds talent and studios in 2024. Any disaster opens doors for exploitative actors to take root and pitch themselves as the solution to everyone's problems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So if you cross paths with such a person—if they lure you in and take advantage of you in some way—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>it's not your fault</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Their failures don't mean your spark should be diminished in any way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Everyone should get to meet their heroes. Everyone should also be ready to chuck their heroes into the bin at a moment's notice the second they let them down. No one needs the power or presence of a celebrity-style figure to validate who they are.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just do what you do best, Bryant Francis from 2014. Keep writing, keep treating people well, and keep pushing back against bigoted weirdos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oh and uh, stop live transcribing your interviews.

<p>As is tradition for this series, those who pre-order will get the bonus content of a Target Führer mission, where you’ll be able to go out and try to assassinate Hitler. They will also get more weapon skins and the Karabiner 98 rifle.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s a Deluxe Edition of the game, which will include the Season Pass of DLC content that is set to follow later in the year. Pre-ordering the Deluxe Edition will also get players the M1911 pistol and two days early access.</p>

Sniper Elite: Resistance isn’t looking to revolutionise the series, but give a new campaign, a few new twists and tweaks to the formula, and just let you settle in with a nice glass of red – to go with all the red you spill in-game.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-weekly-update-welcomes-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-romancing-saga-2-and-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's GeForce NOW Thursday, which means another weekly update that adds several PC games to NVIDIA's leading cloud streaming platform. By far the most popular is Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which launches tomorrow on all platforms. Its addition to GFN is not surprising at all, given that the beta <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-will-be-playable-on-geforce-now-via-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was already playable through GeForce NOW</a>. As usual, some players might scoff at the mere thought of playing a competitive shooter with added latency from cloud streaming, but for those playing casually, it might not be much of an issue, especially if they are subscribed to the Ultimate tier, which ensures the lowest possible latency.</p>
<p>Today is also launch day for Square Enix's Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven, which is supported by GeForce NOW. Granted, the game's system requirements are far from demanding: anyone who built a PC in the last ten years should be eligible. Still, GFN enables playing even on other devices, such as TVs and mobile. Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven was just <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven-ps5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed</a> very favorably (8.4/10) on Wccftech by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>While Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven features the same narrative and core gameplay under the hood, this 3D remake turns the influential JRPG into a brand new experience. For players who rightfully enjoyed Kawazu’s non-linear storytelling in prior SaGa titles, Revenge of the Seven is a must-play. Just make sure to dust off one of those old Super Famicom strategy guides if you plan to see all of the tourism and fiends that Avalon has to offer.</em></p>
<p>The full list of weekly GeForce NOW additions also includes the following titles:</p>
<ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/big-dave-diver-collaboration-update-balatro<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A major new&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>update has arrived, and this one's themed around some pretty big indie collaborations, but it's got plenty to offer in addition to those crossovers as well.</p>
<p>These crossovers won't be&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver</em>'s first; the game has also notably crossed over with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-godzilla-dlc-coming-next-week">kaiju franchise&nbsp;<em>Godzilla</em></a>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke</em>, the free-to-play mobile RPG from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sony-publishing-deal"><em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>creator Shift Up</a>.</p>
<p>First up, Californian singer-songwriter and YouTuber mxmtoon has been added to&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver</em>, and she'll be playing a "special concert" for Dave and his buddies. You'll also get the chance to dive alongside her and serve up a special dish for her.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dave-the-diver-collaboration-update-mxmtoon.jpg?itok=_Vw_Fcpu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dave-the-diver-collaboration-update-mxmtoon.jpg?itok=6bu-Mp_f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Singer-songwriter mxmtoon can now sing for you in&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Hugely <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-reach-2-million-as-devs-promise-first-major-update-soon">successful indie poker roguelike</a>&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is up next in today's&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>crossover stakes. We first heard about this crossover <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-august-2024-recap">back in August 2024</a>, although we don't know if&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>will also be getting&nbsp;<em>Dave</em>-themed content.</p>
<p>It turns out the Sea People are just as prone to&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>addiction as everyone else, so you can now take on the Sea People in a game of&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>and "earn a special Charm as a reward".</p>
<p>The third major game crossing over with&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>in today's update is&nbsp;<em>Potion Craft</em>. You'll be able to meet the Fellow Alchemist and help him find his Magic Cauldron, and you can also buy new ingredients and recipes from the Mushroomer.</p>

<p>Even if you're not interested in any of these indie crossovers, there's plenty more to enjoy in this&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>update, including a new minigame, a new tracking feature for recipes and weapons, and more. You can take a look at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1868140/view/4658501443526031231" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the full changelog here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dave-the-diver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dave-the-diver-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, as is its newest "Dave and Friends" collaboration update.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/from-the-sonic-movies-to-amazons-like-a-dragon-drama-series-how-sega-is-bringing-its-games-to-the-screen<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has found great success with its series of Sonic the Hedgehog movies – so much so that it has inspired the company to more actively pursue big- and small-screen adaptations of its treasure trove of game franchises. Next up is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-yakuza-live-action-series-shares-first-look-at-kiryu-in-iconic-grey-suit">Like a Dragon: Yakuza, an Amazon Original series based on the first game in the beloved series</a>, which launches on October 24 – and Sega has plans to do even more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During Gamescom Asia, <a href="https://jp.ign.com/" data-cy="styled-link">IGN Japan</a> sat down with Justin Scarpone, Global Head of Transmedia at Sega, whose resume includes 17 years working with games and entertainment at Disney and who joined Sega in April 2024. From adaptations of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/segas-shinobi-is-getting-a-film-adaptation-from-the-director-of-extraction">Shinobi</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/golden-axe-animated-series-in-works-comedy-central">Golden Axe</a> to early forays into the theme park space, Scarpone gave us the lowdown on Sega’s plans to reach new audiences away from the game console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Like a Dragon franchise is one of our core pillars,” Scarpone said when asked how the new series was conceived. “We released a live-action film years ago, but I think the new series came about originally through conversations between the Amazon Studios folks and our Like a Dragon studio, and it became a cross-Pacific project where you had talent in both the US and Japan working on the project. It’s obviously filmed in Japan, with Japanese talent, but leveraging some of the creativity that an overseas perspective brings. So it's a unique project for us.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Streaming TV has been a great home for episodic dramas set in Japan, with Shogun breaking records in awards season and Tokyo Vice showing shocking sides of Japan’s (fictionalized) criminal underworld. Scarpone said the success of these shows has been encouraging as Amazon prepares to launch the new Like a Dragon series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Like a Dragon is a very Japanese story, but it's also very universal,” he said. “And one of the differences between the previous live-action film and this new drama being shown on Prime Video is that in the years since the film came out, the Like a Dragon series has become very much a global franchise. We have an international team who are considering from day one how to make a compelling story set in Japan with universal themes that resonate in different cultures.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He says that the dev team at Ryu ga Gotoku Studio have been supportive of the Prime Video show, which is partly based on the original game but will tell its own original story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“(Masayoshi) Yokoyama has been quite supportive of this series,” said Scarpone. “As a truly creative individual, he's seeing a very interesting interpretation of the IP he lives and breathes, and he's very happy with the quality and the output. I think he's excited to see somebody else's perspective on it.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We have an international team who are considering from day one how to make a compelling story set in Japan with universal themes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Like a Dragon game series has a setting that balances heavy crime suspsense drama with more humorous themes tied to gameplay. The Amazon show seems to be leaning more toward the former, but when condensing a game with a storyline that is dozens of hours long into a TV show, it must be difficult to choose which elements to embrace and which ones to leave out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the format of a series where you have about five hours of storytelling, how can you tell a compelling, exciting, dramatic and concise story?” Scarpone pondered. “Some of the games in the series you could play for over 80 hours, which gives you a lot more flexibility to weave in other aspects of the characters than you have in a condensed, linear format. So I think the director, the actors and the screenwriters of the Amazon show needed to make a judgment call on how to tell the best story within the confines of that time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The game series evolved over time, so if this Amazon series were to have a sequel, I think we could also experiment. The series hopefully will be a good starting point in that format, and maybe there'll be more in the future.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sega's Sonic renaissance</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has had huge success with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-movie-review">live-action outings for its mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog</a>. Since 2020, Paramount Pictures has released two hit movies and a TV spinoff, with a third movie landing in December and adding Keanu Reeves to its voice cast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have seemingly come to think of this period of the last decade or so as the renaissance of Sonic,” Scarpone told us. “There were a lot of stops and starts to try to bring Sonic to the silver screen – it didn't happen overnight. But once we were locked in and working on the first film, that was really Sega’s entry point into transmedia, and thinking of Sonic as a franchise, and the way companies like Disney and Universal and Warner Brothers have always done it for decades. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're offering new stories and new ways to experience the characters in different media. And so with Sonic, the film really expanded what Sonic could be in the eyes of the fans – and probably a lot of people inside of Sega as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-frontiers-combat-movie-inspiration?utm_source=twitter">in an interview with IGN in 2022</a>, Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto told us the success of the Sonic movies had inspired him and Sonic Team while making the games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega also has multiple other screen adaptations of its games in the pipeline, including versions of series that have been dormant for decades. One is Shinobi, which has both a game and a live-action adaptation in the works. The film is being produced together with Universal, which made the smash-hit Super Mario Bros. Movie, and directed by Sam Hargrave. Scarpone confirmed to us it is still in the “early stage” of development.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As we reboot some of these franchises, it's important for us to really work on the story, to update it for younger generations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Classic series Golden Axe is also coming back, both as a game and as an animated series for Comedy Central. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/streets-of-rage-adaptation-from-john-wick-creator-acquired-by-lionsgate">A Streets of Rage movie</a> has also been announced, with a script by John Wick creator Derek Kolstad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of these adaptations of older Sega franchises, Scarpone said, “Our core pillars are franchises like Sonic, Like a Dragon, Persona and Angry Birds, but our so-called Legacy Initiative is really exciting because, while these stories have a foundation, we have a lot more new storytelling to work on, which is really cool. As we reboot some of these franchises, it's important for us to really work on the story, work on the lore, to update it for younger generations who weren't even alive when the Sega Genesis was around.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarpone also confirmed that Sega has multiple other screen adaptations in the early stages of development, but would not share which games these unannounced projects are based on just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it doesn’t stop at screen adaptations. In recent years, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-nintendo-world-review">Nintendo has had great success with its theme parks at Univeral Studios</a>, while other games such as Monster Hunter and Resident Evil have been reimagined as excellent theme park attractions in Japan. Sega is an old hand in this business, with its Joypolis and other entertainment centres. Scarpone said Sega is keen to expand on this, offering the example of its upcoming collaboration with the Kai Tak Sports Park mall currently under construction in Hong Kong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Within that complex, we're going to have Sonic Stadium, which is a destination for families and children in particular, as a ticketed area where you can be immersed in the world of Green Hills and Sonic and friends. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What Nintendo has done with Universal Studios is the gold standard, and we have similar aspirations. Attractions are another format to tell our stories and delight our fans, and we really want to be in that space. We’re not launching our own standalone theme park, but we are looking into different partnerships.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Daniel Robson is Chief Editor of IGN Japan.

It also tunes enemy AI (another aspect of the game that came under fire) and speeder travel. The patch notes, courtesy of <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/2Vn4XE0lBNrsqFhfkqjrs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft’s website</a>, are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft added that it’s aware of an ongoing issue affecting PC players after the 24H2 Windows Update, and is working to fix it. Elsewhere, Ubisoft has created a dedicated Bug Reporter tool where players can report issues and track their status, in a bid to “improve transparency and communication.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Star Wars Outlaws Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars Outlaws has struggled since its launch in August, with Ubisoft admitting sales failed to meet expectations. Developer Ubisoft Massive has said it’s committed to improving the game, however, with more patches planned in the run up to the crucial Christmas sales period. Update 4 will arrive on November 21, featuring further combat and stealth improvements as well as free additional contracts. The upcoming story DLC, Wild Card, will "see Kay and Nix infiltrate a high-stakes Sabacc tournament where they will face off against the legendary Lando Calrissian."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It comes amid a shakeup at Ubisoft following the collapse of the company’s share price and Outlaws’ aforementioned poor sales. Ubisoft has returned to Steam (Outlaws hits Valve’s platform on November 21) after years of Epic Games Store exclusivity on PC, delayed Assassin’s Creed Shadows into next year, and is reportedly considering partnering with Tencent to take the company private.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Star Wars Outlaws Title Update 1.3.0 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>PATCH DETAILS (version 7199763.TU3):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>PlayStation 5: 3.48 GB (version 01.003.000)</li><li>Xbox Series X|S: 5.07 GB (version 1.0.3.0)</li><li>PC: 4.88 GB (version 1.0.3.0)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>NOTABLE CHANGES:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Implemented stealth changes to 'False Flag' and other missions to give players more flexibility in how they approach situations without the risk of failing</li><li>Improved speeder travel by reducing collisions with objects in the environment</li><li>Improved NPC combat behavior</li><li>Increased auto-save opportunities in open world hostile areas (Imperial Compounds and Faction Territories)</li><li>Scaled 'Wanted' difficulty based on player progression</li><li>Improved AI speeder avoidance</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>FULL PATCH NOTES:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Performance &amp;

"We are pleased to confirm Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan have recently started an exploration phase on the Rayman brand," a Ubisoft spokesperson said. "The project is still in its early stages, and we will share more details later. As creator of the Rayman brand, Michel Ancel is being consulted to ensure consistency within the universe."</p><p dir="ltr">Ancel is the original creator of Rayman, but in 2020, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-investigating-retired-rayman-creator-for-alleged-hostile-work-environment/1100-6482636/" data-ref-id="1100-6482636">he was investigated by Ubisoft for allegations of creating a hostile work environment</a>.

Montpellier's involvement in this new Rayman project is also of note because it recently spearheaded development on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.

If this new project is a direct remake, the expertise of the Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown team would make sense.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-rayman-dlc-launches-at-end-of-august/1100-6516456/" data-ref-id="1100-6516456">Rayman last appeared in DLC for Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope</a> for Nintendo Switch. The last entry in the main series for the mascot was 2013's Rayman Legends.</p>

            <p>The developer of Dress to Impress has removed a hotdog costume from its lineup of outfits, after some players used it to deliberately dress their characters up like a giant penis.</p>
<p>If you weren't already aware, Dress to Impress is a dress up fashion game hosted on Roblox, that has blown up in popularity since its launch a year ago. It is, generally, a fairly innocent way for players to pass the time, and somewhere they can partake in catwalk shows while wearing an array of fun fashion looks.</p>
<p>At least it was, until the hotdog costume was introduced recently as part of a Halloween range. Basically, when certain players got their hands on the hotdog costume, they changed up the colour palette and popped on a fleshy-hued hat to make it look like their character was wearing a particularly phallic ensemble.</p>

<p>The sudden rise of catwalking willies, of course, caught the attention of Dress to Impress's creators.</p>
<p>"We want to create a safe and friendly environment for our players and it was not intended to be used this way," the game's development manager wrote on 21st October. At this time, only the threat of removing the costume was mentioned.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Here’s the thing: We cannot simply change our whole UI system for a simple hotdog costume. </p><p>Creativity is the point of the game, and we see a lot of tweets that prove that. But, we just can’t give other outlets to something this serious. We love all of your creativity with it…</p></div>— zac (@studiozacc) <a href="https://twitter.com/studiozacc/status/1848532044394958879?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>However, this warning didn't do the dick, sorry, I mean trick. </p>
<p>As such, the hotdog costume has now been temporarily removed from Dress to Impress. After all, Roblox is on its surface at least, a platform for children.</p>

<p>"Just an update in case you haven't already seen. The hotdog costume will be temporarily removed from [Dress to Impress] due to inappropriate usage," the <a href="https://x.com/BeaPlaysRBLX/status/1848839932141240717">game's community manager wrote on social media platform X</a>. "We plan to bring it back later with limitations on how you can colour it/couple it with other items to reduce this."</p><p>While the team does what it needs to do to make sure no more willies make their catwalk debut further down the line, it has replaced the hotdog costume with a hopefully less suggestive cupcake outfit, which you can see below.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-23/roblox-enacts-child-safety-changes-giving-parents-more-control?srnd=undefined" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Bloomberg report</a>&nbsp;(which cites an email from <em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>to parents), these controls include limiting certain chat features for users under 13 without parental permission, as well as requiring children under 9 to get permission to access games with "moderate violence or crude humor", as Bloomberg says.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>will supposedly be introducing a new kind of account that allows parents to monitor what their children do on&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, as well as who they're interacting with on the platform.</p>

<p>However, the spokesperson for Roblox Corporation didn't elaborate on the changes. It's likely we'll hear more from Roblox Corporation itself as we draw closer to the official reveal for the changes, which we're likely to see next month, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>These changes follow in the wake of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/roblox-report-pedophile-hellscape-lying-investors">a damning report</a> released by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research, in which the company refers to&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>as an "X-rated pedophile hellscape" in which some groups openly trade child pornography and solicit sexual favors.</p>
<p>The report also found that moderators have a "limited ability" to remove perpetrators and keep them away from&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, and that moderation for the platform is "largely outsourced to Asian call centers" at which moderators are paid "$12 a day to review countless instances of child grooming and bullying".</p>

<p>Whether or not these child safety controls do anything to improve things for&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen; we'll have to wait and see what happens when they're officially announced. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft Montpellier's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good And Evil 2</a> has been delayed so much that it has transcended the label of "vapourware", while staunchly refusing to become "abandonware". Announced in 2008, it has now comfortably outstripped Duke Nukem Forever as the "triple-A" game with the longest development time. I'm sure there are a few indie passion projects that have been bubbling away in the shadows for longer, but nothing on this scale. What's less tangible than vapour? Ectoplasm? The promises of small children? 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Ah, we josh, Ubisoft, but only because we care. The original Beyond Good And Evil was a magnificent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open worlder</a> with a sense of mystery and whimsy that hasn't quite been seen since. It had a photography element and a talking pig uncle who was an absolute liability in bossfights. I will pounce on any scrap of halfway-positive BG&amp;E2 news I can find. For example, Beyond Good And Evil 2 has a new creative director, Fawzi Mesmar - Ubisoft's vice president of global creative and the former head of design at Battlefield developers DICE.
</p>
<p>
Mesmar's predecessor in the role was Emile Morel, a veteran Ubisoft designer and game director of Rayman Legends, who died suddenly in 2023 at the age of 40. Morel's sad passing is the latest in a long series of misfortunes for the project and its team. According to series creator and former game director Michel Ancel, Beyond Good And Evil 2's development has been on hold for significant chunks of the 16 years since it was announced. Ancel himself departed Ubisoft in September 2020,  amid allegations of mismanagement; Ubisoft staff claimed at the time that he hadn't been involved with Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 for a while.
</p>
<p>
Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 seemed most concrete back in 2017, when Ubisoft finally showed off some footage at E3. The header art above dates back to that time. It looked very weird for a triple-A blockbuster production, and also powerfully unfocussed - a mouthy hybrid of Outer Wilds and Roblox, featuring Cockney monkeys - which perhaps explains the enormous development time. Rather than exploring a single planetary map, as in the first, players would zip about simulated solar systems of part-procedurally generated worlds. There was also a "Space Monkey Program" that would have let players create their own art and music for the game.

<p>
It's unclear how BG&amp;E2 has evolved since then, but Mesmar has a lot of experience overseeing vast productions, so hopefully, he can yank the pieces together in Morel's stead. "Today I'm glad to share that I joined Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 as Creative Director. I have been working with those peeps for years now on this ambitious game and witnessed their talent firsthand," he wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fawzi-mesmar/?originalSubdomain=se">Linkedin</a> this week. "I am standing on the shoulders of creative giants that have supported the team before me, and I look forward to continuing to craft a game that is truly unique for players to enjoy."

Ubisoft has some accompanying comment in which they note that "Mesmar previously collaborated with the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 team as VP of Editorial". In his capacity as a top Ubisoft honcho, he also contributed to development of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/beyond-good-evil-anniversary-remaster-includes-a-new-mission-with-a-narrative-link-to-beyond-good-evil-2">this year's Beyond Good &amp; Evil remaster</a>, which contained a few hints about the long-overdue sequel's story (it's actually a prequel).
</p>
<p>
As ever, all of this is scant grounds for optimism, after such a long wait. I'm genuinely staggered Ubisoft haven't cancelled the game yet. It's pretty eccentric by triple-A standards - far from a proven earner, like Assassin's Creed - and Ubisoft are currently undergoing a well-reported <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">financial slump</a>. Fingers crossed that they'll finally bring it home, and that it won't be another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skull-and-bones-review">Skull And Bones</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-new-patch-yajirobe-nerfs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A couple of days ago, the official Dragon Ball Games account on X (formerly Twitter) revealed that a patch for Sparking Zero should arrive around late October. Their latest post shows the patch is live; check out the changes below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As mentioned in the post, Sparking Zero’s new patch targets several issues, such as responsiveness, balancing and more. The first fix is towards controls becoming unresponsive during online matches when using Classic Controls. The following fix adjusts the difficulty settings for some Episode Battles missions when lower difficulty is selected. Moreover, Yajirobe’s stats have been adjusted, and operational stability has improved.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 The patch is now live! 🚨</p><p>Also, we are aware of some remaining issues and are investigating:<br>-Character rank reset to 0<br>-Connection errors &amp; online matching issues<br>-Corrupted save data<br>We apologize to all affected players and thank you for your patience.</p></div>— Dragon Ball Games (@dragonballgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/1849377423542079847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The new Sparking Zero Patch will delete “the Replay Data” of players’ battles, including Custom Battles World Library replays. Furthermore, the developers acknowledged some additional issues that will be addressed in a later patch. These include character rank resetting to 0, connection errors, online match issues, and corrupted save data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Out of all the changes in Sparking Zero’s latest patch, nerfing Yajirobe is one of the major ones, as this character had become a <a href="https://x.com/dsimons_/status/1847268172912623913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">go-to pick</a> for a significant chunk of the community. It will be interesting to see if the character can retain his position in the player’s DP battle squads after the patch or if the players must find a new meta. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-to-get-multiple-remasters-from-third-party-developers-in-2025-to-compensate-for-nintendo%E2%80%99s-focus-on-the-switch-2-%E2%80%93-rumor.1018113/</guid>

			<p>Multiple third-party remasters could be hitting the Nintendo Switch in 2025 to compensate for the publisher's internal team's focus on the console's successors.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tvPH-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PH Brazil</a>, who proved to be somewhat reliable in the past, the Japanese publisher itself is planning to release a GameCube game and a Nintendo 3DS game remaster on the console in 2025. Also, Nintendo is reportedly courting third-party publishers to release remasters on the system to beef up its release lineup in 2025 to make sure that players not immediately upgrading to the Nintendo Switch 2 will still have new things to play. This, the leaker highlights, doesn't suggest in any way that the new console is further away than anticipated. Among the publishers that are being courted by Nintendo are Ubisoft, which could release remasters of Splinter Cell Blacklist, Rayman 3, the first two entries in the Driver series, EA and Bandai Namco.</p>
<p><iframe title="2025: The Year of Remasters on Nintendo Switch (English)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/llgNYTpRvOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given how the Nintendo Switch release schedule for the first few months of 2025, releasing remasters seems like a good idea to keep the console alive before and shortly after the release of its successor, of which we currently know very little outside of the fact that it has been in the works for a long time. Leaks from the past few months suggest that the system will also support ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS in some capacity. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see the actual system, which shouldn't look <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-video-design/">too different</a> from the current one, and what it is capable of doing.</p>

            <p>A freshly-discovered glitch in the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> has been discovered, allowing players to skip a huge section of the game and head straight to its biggest twist.</p>
<p>I'm being purposefully vague here for spoiler reasons, but if you're at all familiar with the game you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Really, it's surprising that after 26 years players are still finding new ways to skip through the game.</p>

<p>So you've guessed right now I'm talking about Aerith. And this new glitch lets you at last keep her alive.</p>
<p>Well, sort of. Essentially you force her to watch her own death and battle against the mother of her murderer.</p>
<p>As shared by Final Fantasy speedrunner Luzbel on X/Twitter, the skip was discovered by AceZephyr and Kuma.</p>
<p>The glitch does not use any form of cheats. Instead, players can utilise a complex mechanic where the game stores information on the terrain whenever mounting and dismounting a chocobo on the world map. With this, it's possible to walk through the world from early in the game straight to the Forgotten Capital at the end of the first disc.</p>
<p>Of course, players will be pretty underleveled for this section of the game. But with Aerith in the party, it's possible to have her witness her own death and then join the subsequent battle against Jenova.</p>
<p>However, Luzbel notes the game will softlock during a cutscene if Aerith is in the party when she shouldn't be. Still, Aerith saviours can at last rejoice!</p>

<p>This year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> tackled the same section of the game as part of the trilogy remake project. While I won't spoil Aerith's fate here, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aeriths-fate-in-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-the-trouble-with-remakes">treatment of the moment proved controversial</a>.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy series producer Yoshinori Kitase stated last month the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-wont-betray-fans-of-the-original-says-series-producer">third part of the trilogy won't "betray the fans of the original"</a>.</p>
<p>"There are these things we feel we can only do now in the remake project that can bring a new happiness, a new sort of feeling of satisfaction to the players playing this game now 27 years later," he said. "What this will entail exactly is something we hope players will experience soon."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

						<h5>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House</h5><p><span>October 22nd, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Remedy Entertainment</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>It has been a year since the release of the amazing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a>, and the long wait to see the infamous writer back in action has been well worth it, as the game is among the best survival horror games ever released, featuring the same amazing balance between humor and horror that makes Remedy Entertainment the development studio it is, and some truly epic sequences that will continue to resonate in video games history for a long time. For the game's first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/">Night Springs</a>, the Finnish studio went all in with the humor, taking characters and scenarios from the base game and twisting them to present entertaining self-contained stories that did not take themselves too seriously.</p>
<p>Those who wished to experience more of the atmosphere and horror elements of the base game had to wait for the second expansion, The Lake House, which also serves to bridge the gap for what will presumably be the next single-player game set in the Remedy Connected Universe, Control 2. Undoubtedly, the second and final Alan Wake 2 expansion fully delivers its promises, but it could have been so much more, as its very short length will not be enough for most players to upgrade to the Deluxe Edition, which is currently the only way to get both expansions.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Alan-Wake-2-Screenshot-2024.10.23-11.08.01.87-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House stars Kiran Estevez, one of the Federal Bureau of Control agents first mentioned in Control that appears in the base game. Leader of the Investigations Unit Beta, the agent was assigned to Bright Falls to investigate the paranormal phenomenons in Cauldron Lake, an investigation that culminates with the inspection of the Lake House, a clandestine research facility on the shores of Cauldron Lake used by the FBC to study the phenomenons happening in the area and their relation to the Dark Presence. Inside, Agent Estevez will get to understand what exactly was being researched in the facility, getting to know how Alan Wake's unique powers have influenced the lives of the two doctors leading the research, all the while trying to stay ahead of the monstruosities born out of the horrible research conducted in the facility.</p>
<p>The story of Alan Wake 2: The Lake House fits perfectly into the base game and the Remedy Connected Universe, further exploring the themes introduced so far and bringing some elements that will likely be developed in the future, including a not subtle-at-all <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Control 2</a> tease. The expansion's short length, barely over one hour and a half, actually plays in favor of the story, as it translates into an extremely tight pacing, which, paired with the tension ramping up from the moment agent Estevez enters the titular Lake House, makes the experience extremely engaging, especially for those heavily involved with the RCU.</p>
<p>The expansion's tightly paced story is compounded by the atmosphere. The Lake House brings out the best Remedy has offered so far in terms of location design, combining the best elements of Alan Wake 2 and Control to offer a very immersive experience with amazing visual and audio production that make players actually feel inside the haunting research facility.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Alan-Wake-2-Screenshot-2024.10.23-11.34.49.35-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While Alan Wake 2: The Lake House's short length works in favor of the story, it doesn't do the same with gameplay. With only five floors to explore, featuring a few simple puzzles to complete, which mostly involve carrying batteries to turn the power on and deducing passwords from a few hints scattered around, and only a new enemy type, a frankly well-designed slim monstrosity coming out of the paintings scattered around the research facility, it definitely feels like the expansion ends way too soon. The final boss, at the very least, is very interesting from both a gameplay and a narrative point of view, and makes most players ask themselves who was the real monster hidden in the Lake House.</p>
<p>If Alan Wake 2: The Lake House was priced reasonably, it would have been a much better proposition, as it is a worthy continuation of the base game in terms of story, themes, and atmosphere. As the only way to get the expansion is by purchasing the Deluxe Edition, however, I don't think it offers quite enough to upgrade to the more expensive edition of the game for all but the most die-hard fans of the base game and the Remedy Connected Universe.</p>
<p><em>PC version tested. Deluxe Edition code provided by the publisher.</em></p>

<p>With its great atmosphere and tight story pacing, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House retains the same elements that made the base game so engaging. The lack of significant new mechanics and its very short length, however, make it a worthwhile purchase only for the most die-hard fans of Alan Wake 2 and the Remedy Connected Universe.</p>
