			<p>After debuting our first look at gameplay for the '80s-looking isometric horror action game, I Hate This Place, <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-hate-this-place-gameplay-trailer-debut/">just last month</a>, developer Broken Mirror Games and publisher Skybound Games have announced that I Hate This Place will land on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC this coming <strong>November 7, 2025</strong> as part of this week's Gamescom 2025 festivities.</p>



<p>The release date trailer shows off even more gameplay and more of the '80s aesthetic that makes the game stand out in the crowd of isometric games available on the market today. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>I Hate This Place is a debut title for both its developer and publisher. It's Broken Mirror Games' first title after being founded in 2024, and it's the first game that publisher Skybound Games is working on since the publisher was founded by <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloober-team-announces-partnership-with-skybound-entertainment-developing-a-new-title-by-2025/">Bloober Team at the end of 2023</a>.</p>



<p>Even though we've just seen a few trailers at this point, it already looks like it is shaping up to be one hell of a debut game. And if you're in attendance at Gamescom 2025, then you'll be able to put that theory to the test, since you can head over to the studio's booth in Arena Hall 10.1, Stand A:044 to check out I Hate This Place and play it for yourself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>These days, most AAA video game companies are struggling to gain and maintain momentum in a fickle marketplace when games are taking longer than ever to make. Capcom, meanwhile, is on a hot streak. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><i><span>Street Fighter 6</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-review-ps5-1851349573"><i><span>Dragon’s Dogma 2</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113"><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></i></a><span>, and the continued renaissance of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891"><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i></a> <span>series are just a few examples of the developer being in a no-skips, all-hits era. I recently got a chance to play three of the company’s upcoming games: </span><i><span>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Pragmata</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>, and my limited time with each spoke both to the variety in the company’s line-up, but also indicated a refreshing “back to basics” mentality that a lot of AAA companies can’t seem to fathom in 2025. These games feel like they’re from a different era, and that’s for the better.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Onimusha: Way of the Sword - 3rd Trailer: The Genma Experiments | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bf1cAQIKpWA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><i><span>Onimusha: Way of the Sword </span></i><span>was the first game I played during my preview session, and after 20 years away, the latest </span><i><span>Onimusha </span></i><span>feels surprisingly untouched by the RPG trappings that have latched onto many modern action games. The section I played was the same one I saw at Summer Game Fest, which showed samurai warrior Musashi Miyamoto slicing his way through a mostly derelict village overrun by underworldly monsters. At first blush, </span><i><span>Way of the Sword </span></i><span>might feel a bit simple to the modern action game fan who has become so used to skill trees and Soulslike difficulty. But there was a time in the PlayStation 2 era when a good parry and dodge mechanic was enough to satisfy you for about 10 to 15 hours.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>When I played </span><i><span>Way of the Sword</span></i><span>, I was caught off guard by how “of its time” it felt. It’s as if it picks up where the series left off 20 years ago, but with a bit of modern flair and finesse. The boss fight at the end of the demo against Ganryu Sasaki, a fellow Oni Gauntlet-wearing swordsman, was challenging enough to prove that skillful swordplay is enough to carry an action game in 2025, even as the genre more frequently de-emphasizes those core fundamentals.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pragmata - First Contact Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdDVyBtYrUI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>That same streamlined focus was evident when I played </span><i><span>Pragmata</span></i><span>. I already </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pragmata-capcom-preview-summer-game-fest-impressions-1851784342"><span>wrote up impressions of the demo</span></a><span> I played at Summer Game Fest, and this appointment was mostly focused on the same early section of the game, just with a boss fight at the end. Like </span><i><span>Way of the Sword</span></i><span>, the sci-fi puzzle shooter feels like something plucked out of a previous generation. Its over-the-shoulder shooting, brutalist sci-fi aesthetic, and dad game setup make it feel exactly like something you would’ve seen on a GameStop shelf during the PS360 generation. As I said back in June, it keeps from feeling like a rote retread of old tropes by combining its shooting with a real-time puzzle-solving element that has you breaking down enemy defenses and opens a window for your bullets to actually do real damage. Separately, these mechanics are simple and perhaps unremarkable; together, they create a big-budget shooter that would have been the kind of fun, one-off experiment a company like Capcom would have released between big sequels. Even as Capcom has put out hit after hit, the company has become pretty reliant on sequels in the same way pretty much every other AAA developer has. It’s refreshing to see that it still has the chops to put out something like </span><i><span>Pragmata</span></i><span>, a non-sequel which may pull from old motifs, but also feels novel as games like it have gone out of style in recent years.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Resident Evil Requiem - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POz1-EmLsTY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>That brings us to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-grace-trailer-gamescom-mother-2000618547"><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a><span>, the latest entry in a series that has spent the better part of a decade reinventing itself. What I played of the ninth mainline game in the long-running survival horror series felt more evocative of </span><i><span>Haunting Ground</span></i><span>, a cult classic hide-and-seek horror game Capcom put out in 2005, than the misadventures of Chris Redfield and Leon Kennedy. As we see more of it, </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>may eventually adopt the more action-oriented flow of 2021’s </span><i><span>Resident Evil Village </span></i><span>or stay in the escape room-esque hide-and-seek loop of the segment I played, but in the demo&nbsp; section, at least, it felt like the game had been stripped down to its core elements to leave you with a terrifying helplessness. All I had to defend myself from a horrifying monstrosity that followed me back and forth through a dimly lit hallway was my wits, glass bottles, and whatever light sources I could find to scare it away. </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>has been experimenting with what it means to carry that name for a while, and so perhaps it’s fitting that what I played of </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>didn’t make me think of </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> much at all, but rather of a </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/after-20-years-capcom-removes-its-website-for-controversial-usd500-ps2-horror-game-and-i-know-the-bad-ending-might-get-you-pregnant-but-im-prepared-to-stage-a-funeral-if-there-isnt-a-remake/"><span>long-lost gem that Capcom has mostly forgotten</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>All three of these games are coming out in 2026, and by then, we’ll be another trip around the sun removed from the games that seemingly inspired each of them, and they could feel even more out of time. Even so, Capcom’s dedication to the old ways of doing things, when it feels like every other month we’re hearing about a beloved franchise or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>company</span></a><span> being handcuffed to&nbsp; modern practices solely meant to make every game a time suck, is a big part of the reason it’s put out mostly bangers for the past few years. I’m not usually one to say “things were better back in my day,” but it is nice to have reminders that not every developer has learned the wrong lessons. At least one major player is willing to go back to the well, find what worked before, and meaningfully iterate on it instead of breaking it apart to turn it into something we no longer recognize.</span></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-we-played-it-gamescom-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-we-played-it-gamescom-2025.1275642/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I finally played Hollow Knight: Silksong. No, I don’t mean to brag, but instead find myself having to type it out just to convince my eyes that it actually happened. Yes, it may have only been for around 20 minutes, but the long-awaited sequel shows little sign of disappointing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During my demo at gamescom 2025, I was faced with a choice of two areas to play in: Moss Grotto or Deep Docks. Of course, I was going to try both, but first went for Moss Grotto — based on nothing apart from green being my favourite colour — which turned out to be the right decision. This sunlit grassy zone appears to be the very beginning of Silksong, as I fell into it following a brief cutscene in which a caged Hornet (the playable princess-protector protagonist) breaks free from the metal wagon she’s held captive in by collapsing the bridge it’s being paraded on. Developer Team Cherry seems keen on immersing us straight back into the world of Hollow Knight right from the very beginning, teasing lore via a passage of Conductor Romino's Pharloom Folly.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Moss Grotto itself, it felt very much like a (re)introduction to the core mechanics of Hollow Knight. A mixture of rudimentary platforming and simple battles was littered across its grassy floors in a short but sweet section of Silksong’s presumably sprawling labyrinth of a world. It all ended with a boss fight against a large queen-bee-like insect that attempted to lock me in her lair. Moss Mother gave me little boss bother, though, dispatching them by unlocking that long-dormant Hollow Knight muscle memory as I leapt over darting diagonal attacks and evaded crumbling rocks falling from the sky. It was action platforming 101, but still felt incredibly satisfying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I then swiftly moved onto Deep Docks, which turned out to be an entirely different proposition. Tools such as kunai, which can be thrown horizontally to pierce foes, were added to my arsenal, along with skills such as a familiar dash ability. Things naturally get more complex with more items to juggle, which is reflected in Deep Docks' level design that comprises a maze of clanking metal elevators and the numerous semi-hidden levers that operate them. I may have only spent a handful of minutes there, but I could already see myself getting hopelessly lost without the aid of one of Cornifer’s ever-valuable maps.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Discovering the secrets of Hollow Knight's world was maybe the purest of its joys to me; I wouldn't want Silksong to feel like running into a brick wall too often.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon unlocking a boss arena, I was confronted by an enemy of far greater threat than any I had encountered yet. Lace, a balletic white insect, not too dissimilar in look to Hornet herself, dazzled me with intricate combos delivered at a speed my poor brain could not compute quickly enough. Defeated, I moved on, knowing this would be a battle for another day and not one I particularly wanted the dozens of people waiting in the queue behind to witness me losing again and again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's too early to gauge the overall difficulty of Silksong, the jump up in this later area was noticeable, with enemies capable of far more than simple prods and darts. I usually welcome added complexity and evolution of combat when it comes to sequels, so I have no great issue here. I just hope that in totality, fights won't become too tiresome with exploration and progress being halted too often. Discovering the secrets of Hollow Knight's world was maybe the purest of its joys to me; I wouldn't want Silksong to feel like running into a brick wall too often.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are concessions to make you feel more powerful compared to the original, though. Health regain is now divorced from skills, meaning you can throw those kunai liberally without having to sacrifice a potential life-saving heal. Attack is still the best form of defense, echoing some of my favourite systems from the likes of Control, Doom Eternal, and, of course, the original Hollow Knight. This is emphasised by the fact that you can only trigger health regen when your silk-white bar is full, encouraging even more offensive maneuvers to build that up quickly. Dodging will only get you so far in Hollow Knight Silksong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these tweaks and changes tie together to create a more aggressive minibeast, and, although I certainly have a soft spot for the original Hollow Knight, I’m finding myself instantly drawn to Silksong more. 2018's game often placed you on the back foot, but here I felt instantly more empowered and ready to go toe-to-toe with my aggressors. As someone who traditionally enjoys the push of faster-paced action games as opposed to the pull of more modern examples of the genre (I’m really trying my hardest not to use the term soulslike here), I’m left encouraged. Creature design is still one of the highlights in the sequel, with the borderline adorable adversaries <em>almost </em>being too cute to stab. At one stage, I got locked in a room with some flying nuisances with pots over their heads who lobbed molten rocks at me, as well as a pudgy little round lad with a saucepan for a shield. I almost felt bad killing them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in truth, combat was never the highlight of Hollow Knight for me anyway, but rather the layers of exploration and discovery lurking beneath each of its beautifully crafted environments. And while I’ve barely scratched the surface of what secrets Silksong has stored in this regard, initial impressions promise a similar bounty of nooks and crannies packed full of insect friends and foes. Platforming through these mazes is still a joy; a delicately delightful balance between precision and floaty jumping that tests your skills, that crucially never feels unfair when dropping into a gap unwillingly. The addition of mantling in the sequel helps this massively, with edges freely within grasp even when slight misjudgments are made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was instantly taken by how much more colourful the environments are this time around. Cinders dance around caves dripping with lava and glowing green moss dresses earthy overhangs, themselves floating precariously above pools of glistening water. Hornet's red cape billows against the painted backdrops, both acting in harmony to form the sort of Saturday morning cartoon look you'd expect if one were to hang in the Louvre. Hornet also feels bigger on the screen, dominating the frame to a greater degree than her meeker-yet-still-mighty forebearer. That visual design feels like a deliberate choice, one aimed at creating more of a power trip sensation this time around. It's these ideas — from revamped combat design to its repainted world – that appear to be acting in concert to a magical degree, and impressive proof, even in this small dose, of what Team Cherry has been brewing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, we've been waiting many, many years for this sequel, but everything at this stage points to it being worth it. Each aspect feels authored and prescribed to a clear vision — a piece of playable art that is as fun to wield as it is to watch (I should know, the gamescom queue was very long). It may have been the shortest of demos, but so far, Silksong is very much singing to me, maybe even more than the original.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher series really did well to capture that sense of exploring a brutal fantasy world as a protagonist who knew how to get their hands dirty. But in the upcoming dark fantasy RPG The Blood of Dawnwalker, a new game from a team of former creatives behind The Witcher 3, it leans further into a morally ambiguous setting as you decide which path its protagonist will take – one that maintains his human form and ideals, or one that embraces newfound powers as a half-vampire.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just ahead of Gamescom 2025, we got an extended walkthrough of The Blood of Dawnwalker from the devs at Rebel Wolves that put a spotlight on the parallel playstyles of human and vampire action-RPG gameplay. So far, The Blood of Dawnwalker is putting forth some strong concepts for its take on a dark-fantay RPG that's all about navigating two different worlds in cunning fashion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Blood of Dawnwalker - Gamescom 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of what makes vampires so compelling as horror characters is that they can be tragic figures. Having to contend with supernatural forces that potentially put them at odds with humanity is a concept that can be great to explore in video games. That idea is at the heart of The Blood of Dawnwalker.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in a supernatural version of 14th-century Europe, The Blood of Dawnwalker focuses on Coen and his vendetta against a powerful coven of vampires that seek to take over Europe with violence and even some old-fashioned medieval-era politicking. After Coen has a violent encounter with the vampire leader Brencis following the abduction of his family, the protagonist develops a special strain of vampirism that transforms him into a half-vampire that can navigate the increasingly blurry line between human and supernatural. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The protagonist develops a special strain of vampirism that transforms him into a half-vampire that can navigate the increasingly blurry line between human and supernatural.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Our extended preview focused on a quest called "A Monk and a Saint," which saw Coen travel to the settlement of Svartrau to uncover a hidden tomb – and the town's more nefarious side. This quest features a round of combat sequences against some foes capable of withstanding Coen's abilities in both his human and vampire forms. It initially seemed standard fare for an RPG quest, but where Dawnwalker differs is in how the quest can change depending on the time of day and which form you take on to complete it. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The leading narrative hook carrying players forward is the month-long time limit, giving Coen only a limited period to rescue his family. You can largely advance the day at your choosing, and Dawnwalker doesn't necessarily pressure you to make some time-specific choices. That said, your approach to progression will very much influence the course of events in Coen's journey – especially with which side of Coen is taking the lead. Time is essentially a resource that you spend with each passing quest and activity, and depending on what you do and when you do it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers gave us a run of the preview's main quest from two different sides, as both Coen's human and vampire forms. When playing as the latter, Dawnwalker shifts to a stealth-action playstyle, where the protagonist must avoid detection from guards and civilians. Coen's vampire abilities are also unleashed in this state, allowing players to walk on walls, teleport, and use blood abilities and vampiric claws to cut down foes. And yes – you'll also be able to drain the blood from humans, foe and non-combative alike, for stealth takedowns or outright executions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was impressed by how much the action and pacing looked like a mix between The Witcher's grand scope and the immersive-sim elements of Dishonored when seeing Coen in his vampire form – you can truly leap across rooftops and get the jump on some foes, which was very satisfying to see. However, it shows how players will have to grapple with some moral choices, as Coen, who needs to feed to maintain his vampire abilities during the night, must do. While you can feed on animals to offer some temporary relief, the larger payout comes from human targets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The vampire form looks to present a more direct and action-heavy approach to engaging with the quests. However, Coen's human form presents an interesting contrast by focusing more on investigation and tactical methods. Because Coen can blend in with others in his human form, there are far more opportunities to engage with the different characters and uncover pathways for success without the need for bloodshed. It was also fascinating to see how the characters react to knowing that vampires are now in control of the region and that life is, understandably, far worse off.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When things pop off, combat shows the stark differences in Dawnwalker's playstyles. I adopted the tactical-action approach, which feels like a blend of The Witcher 3's versatile swords and sorcery combat flow, combined with the calculated nature of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's swordplay. It presents an opportunity for players to feel powerful as Coen, where they have to exploit vulnerabilities. In his human form, Coen relies on his swordplay, along with gadgets and hex spells, to overcome some enemies. Similar to The Outer Worlds, you can pull up a tactical menu to target an enemy to execute attacks that can stun foes or deliver killing blows.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Coen's massive claws can tear into enemy defenses, and he can pull off combat finishers where he can lay into foes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat gets a bit more hectic when in Coen's vampire form, which sees him unleash his supernatural blood-based abilities. In addition to his sword, Coen's massive claws can tear into enemy defenses, and he can pull off combat finishers where he can lay into foes. However, Dawnwalker still presents some challenges with elite foes, such as the human Blood Guards who have armor and weapons to stand up to Coen's vampiric abilities, along with some more dangerous monsters and the rival vampires that can overpower the protagonist if you're not careful.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An interesting detail that the developers highlighted during the presentation was that players could make a beeline to the primary goal of the game early on – think of how players might try to defeat Ganon in the opening hours of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. However, the team stated that it'll be a challenge to pull off, as the core game is all about powering up Coen with new gear and abilities. Still, I’ll be curious to see if it'll be possible for players to clear the campaign early on in Coen's journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I wish we had more of an opportunity to see what the larger world would be like, but so far, The Blood of Dawnwalker captures that feeling of navigating two different worlds as a half-vampire, which is a very compelling premise for a role-playing game. Compared to The Witcher 3 or developer Dontnod's Vampyr, The Blood of Dawnwalker captures that open-ended, freeform nature of classic role-playing games like Gothic 1 and 2, which is exciting to see. Hopefully, the full game will be able to deliver on the concept of a vampire RPG with some world-changing stakes.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-offers-2-very-different-rpg-playstyles]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/asus-and-microsofts-xbox-handhelds-arrive-october-16-but-pricing-remains-a-mystery/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-and-asus%E2%80%99-answers-to-steamos-and-the-steam-deck-launch-on-october-16.1275630/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Asus and Microsoft will be launching their <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">ROG Xbox Ally series of handheld gaming PCs</a> starting October 16, according to an Asus announcement that went out today.</p>
<p>An Xbox-branded extension of Asus' existing ROG Ally handheld line, the basic ROG Xbox Ally and more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X, both run a version of Windows 11 Home that's been redesigned with a controller-first Xbox-style user interface. The idea is to preserve the wide game compatibility of Windows—and the wide compatibility with multiple storefronts, including Microsoft's own, Valve's Steam, the Epic Games Store, and more—while turning off all of the extra Windows desktop stuff and saving system resources. (This also means that, despite the Xbox branding, these handhelds play Windows PC games and not the Xbox versions.)</p>
<p>Microsoft and Asus initially announced the handhelds in June. Microsoft still isn't sharing pricing information for either console, so it's hard to say how their specs and features will stack up against the Steam Deck (starting at $399 for the LCD version, $549 for OLED), Nintendo's Switch 2 ($450), or past Asus handhelds like the ROG Ally X ($800).</p>
<p>Both consoles share a 7-inch, 1080p IPS display with a 120 Hz refresh rate, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.4 support, but their internals are quite a bit different. The lower-end Xbox Ally uses an AMD Ryzen Z2 A chip with a 4-core Zen 2-based CPU, an eight-core RDNA2-based GPU, 512GB of storage, and 16GB of LPDDR5X-6400—specs nearly identical to Valve's 3-year-old Steam Deck. The Xbox Ally X includes a more interesting Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme with an 8-core Zen 5 CPU, a 16-core RDNA3.5 GPU, 1TB of storage, 24GB of LPDDR5X-8000, and a built-in neural processing unit (NPU).</p>
<p>The beefier hardware comes with a bigger battery—80 WHr in the Ally X, compared to 60 WHr in the regular Ally—and that also makes the Ally X around a tenth of a pound (or 45 grams) heavier than the Ally.</p>

                <p>A release date for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-x-impressions-green-with-envy/1100-6532506/">ROG Xbox Ally</a> has been revealed, as the handheld gaming PC will be go on sale starting <strong>October 16</strong>. Microsoft hasn't confirmed pricing for the devices yet, but it did explain how games will be optimized for these systems. One thing to note here is that there will be two different versions of the ROG Xbox Ally--a base model and a more premium "X" handheld--so performance will vary across them.</p><p>During its Gamecom 2025 livestream, Microsoft said that the base model Xbox Ally targets a resolution of 720p, while the Xbox Ally X aims for a 1080p resolution. Both units can run in one of three modes--Silent, Performance, and Turbo--and for frame rates, games that hit certain benchmarks will receive a specific compatibility tag.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTaboYwSyuc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VTaboYwSyuc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Microsoft says that it has worked with game studios to optimize thousands of games for handheld compatibility, with the overall goal here being that you can install them and start playing right away. This has resulted in two tags that will accompany optimized games, similar to Valve's Steam Deck Verified program for its handheld gaming PC:</p><p><strong>Handheld Optimized</strong></p><p>Games that are ready to go with default controller inputs, an intuitive text input method, accurate iconography, clear text legibility, and appropriate resolution in full-screen mode.</p><p><strong>Mostly Compatible</strong></p><p>Games that may require minor in-game setting changes for an optimal experience on handheld.</p><p>Additionally, there'll be other tags that will give you an idea of how well a game will perform on the Xbox Ally:</p><p><strong>Should perform well on your device</strong></p><ul><li>Games that run at 30fps or above</li></ul><p><strong>Should perform great on your device</strong></p><ul><li>Games that run at 60fps or above</li></ul><p><strong>Performance check not available yet</strong></p><ul><li>Games that haven't been tested yet</li></ul><p>Microsoft added that more technical features will also be made available in the future, including advanced shader delivery that preloads game shaders during download. This will make games run more smoothly and use less battery power on first play. Enhancements to the docking experience for the devices are also in the works and several accessories will be released for it as well.</p><p>The company also recently spoke about how handheld consoles like the Xbox Ally tie into its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/">next-gen console plans</a>, as Microsoft is looking to create a broad ecosystem for players that will allow them to play their games at home or on the go.</p>

At this point, it's almost tradition that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Opening Night Live draws to a close with a collective sigh. Again I send my prayers to the stars that the OmniGeoff may one day concede - and this goes for the equally interminable likes of Summer Game Fest and The Game Awards - that shorter, more focused is always better. Imagine the sustained enthusiasm you could generate without all that flaccid, glassy eyed filler! And so in that spirit of relative brevity, here's a quick list of some of the slighty under-the-radar announcements from this year's show (and pre-show) that managed to get us quite excited.
</p>
<h3>Denshattack!</h3>

<p>
One of a couple of Opening Night Live standouts relegated to the pre-show warm-up, Denshattack! is the work of developer Undercoders. And it's easy to imagine the studio's pitch for this one as 'what if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a> but runaway trains?', given its cell-shaded aesthetic and tricking, grinding action would be pretty familiar if it wasn't for the fact it switches out skateboards for graffiti-strewn, gravity defying locomotives.
</p>
<p>
Story wise, it sees players rail-riding across Japan, traversing vibrant countryside and urban city sprawls, all in a quest to defeat the sinister Miraidō corporation. You'll ollie and kickflip in a bid to win over rivals and rack up points, with everything from magical mecha girls to moving castles making an appearance too. It looks an absolute blast and it's coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year.
</p>
<h3>Valor Mortis</h3>

<p>
I've fond memories of developer One More Level's cyberpunk action-parkour adventure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a>. Or at least, I've fond memories of its first couple of hours, after which everything is lost in a bright red haze of pure fury. The point, though, is it was Pretty Good (Eurogamer's Bertie Purchese <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghostrunner-review-an-exhilarating-display-of-acrobatic-first-person-platforming">said it more eloquently in his review</a>), so there's every reason to be curious about what One More Level is doing next now the Less Good <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghostrunner-2">Ghostrunner 2</a> is behind it.
</p><p>
And that, it transpires, is Valor Mortis - a gory "first-person action Soulslike" that's arriving next year. I appreciate there's a general air of Soulslike fatigue about these days, but Valor Mortis does at least attempt to carve its own niche with, firstly, that shift in perspective, and also a pretty distinctive set-up. It's the 19th century and the Napoleonic Wars are raging; you're a soldier in Bonaparte's Grande Armée and also, regrettably, dead. Until, that is, you awaken on a battlefield ravaged by a mysterious supernatural plague, former friends and foe now twisted into awful abominations. Expect a combat-focused adventure incorporating the likes of parries, dashes, and some pretty brutal finishers when Valor Mortis comes to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year.

For readers of a certain age, Ron Gilbert needs no introduction: he's the writer and designer best known for his point-and-click adventures, including Maniac Mansion, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thimbleweed-park">Thimbleweed Park</a>, and, of course, the legendary Monkey Island series. Every now and then, though, Gilbert strays outside of those genre bounds; there's 2013's puzzle-platform adventure The Cave, for instance - made in conjunction with Double Fine - and now there's Death by Scrolling.
</p>
<p>
Developed by Gilbert's Terrible Toybox studio, Death by Scrolling has the air of a top-down 16-bit RPG, but there's seemingly a lot more to it - it is, after all, described as a "rogue-like vertically scrolling RPG". Your ultimate goal - playing as one of several characters, each with their own unique perks and abilities - is to race upward through endless levels in order amass enough money to pay the Ferryman and escape Purgatory. That involves battling enemies, swiping gems, grabbing power-ups, completing side quests, and a spot of shopping, all while outsmarting the ever-pursuing Grim Reaper. There's no release date for Death by Scrolling yet, but it's coming to PC.

<p>
Sorry to keep calling you out, people of a certain age (and I include myself in this increasingly withered demographic), but here's another name that's likely to get old-timers a-flutter. Outlaws, developer LucasArts' fondly remembered - if, perhaps, oft-overlooked - Wild West FPS is making a return, courtesy of remaster specialists Nightdive Studios.  
</p><p>
First released in 1997 - around the time LucasArts was dipping its toes in new genres after dominating the point-and-click scene for so long  - Outlaws aimed to build on the success of the studio's beloved Star Wars: Dark Forces by taking the FPS to hitherto unseen frontiers. Namely, the cowboy ones. According to Wikipedia, it was perhaps the first shooter to introduce a sniper zoom and one of the first to feature a gun reloading mechanic, but my own memories - which don't extend much further than a well-worn cover disc demo - remain positive but decidedly hazy. Nightdive's remaster, which also includes 1998's Handful of Missions expansion, promises the likes of high-resolution textures, redrawn art, crossplay multiplayer, and gamepad support, and it's coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch this year.

<p>
If you had a vague sense of déjà vu when Unbeatable popped up during Opening Night Live, you're not the only one. A quick trip down memory lane (Google) confirms Unbeatable was first announced back in 2021, when it got a whole bunch of people, including me, excited for the very first time. It had a fantastic demo, released to promote what would go on to be a successful Kickstarter, after which it was time for developer D-Cell to knuckle down.
</p>
<p>
Four years later, and the rhythm adventure where "music is illegal and you do crimes" is back. Unbeatable promises "big emotions" and "arcade-flawless rhythm gameplay" as the story of Beat and her band unfolds, charting their efforts to gig and stay one step ahead of the cops. "Half the game is walking around and taking things at your own pace," D-Cell says of Unbeatable's story mode. "The other half is trying to keep up with ours." It's also got an "unlimited" arcade mode featuring a "entire double album" of music, alongside acoustic versions, and remixes. Unbeatable looks and sounds like a winner, and it's coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, on 6th November.

<p>
The only thing I can remember about Battlestar Galactica, apart from that cool swishy visor thing the robots did in the original series, is that woman in red spending bloody ages pretending she wasn't real. Which is to say I'm not exactly an leading expert. And yet there's something about Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes that's caught my eye. For starters, it's by Alt Shift, the team behind well-received tactical rogue-lite Crying Suns, and it's promising an interesting mix of turn-based and real-time action too.
</p><p>
Officially a "story-rich tactical roguelite", Scatted Hopes plays out in two distinct halves. On one side, you - a Gunstar Captain attempting to rendezvous with the Battlestar Galactica - have a galaxy to traverse, navigating planets and galactic points of interest turn-by-turn, all while dealing with tough dilemmas. You'll need to juggle the sometimes opposing interests of different factions, perhaps, or manage dwindling resources, or try and identity impostors onboard. With every decision, the Cylons draw nearer, and your choices impact your chances of success when battle comes. Space combat plays out in real-time (tactical pause is available), as players attempt to last long enough to engage their FTL and scarper, with talk of deployable squadrons, missiles, and more. It all sounds pretty neat and Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes is aiming for a Q1 launch on PC next year.

<h3>Bubsy 4D</h3>

<p>
Okay, look, Bubsy might not exactly - or even remotely - be a byword for quality as far as video game platform mascots go, but credit where credit's due; his name has managed to linger far longer (like a bad smell perhaps), compared to the largely forgotten likes of Socket, Rocky Rodent, Awesome Possum, and Vexx. After two so-so 2D platformers in the 90s and the absolute nadir that was Bubsy 3D in 1996, most would assume the titular bobcat would have hung up his jumping boots for good (pedants, please note I am aware Bubsy doesn't wear shoes). Instead, he inexplicably returned two decades later for two more middling side-scrolling platformers. The legacy of Bubsy, to reiterate, is not great.
</p>
<p>
And yet! I'm absolutely fascinated by the prospect of Bubsy 4D, and not just because of the bobcat's almost admirable refusal to bow out gracefully. Rather, this latest entry in the mascot's dubious back catalogue is the work of indie studio Fabraz, which, if you're unfamiliar, has made some pretty enjoyable games - including Demon Turf and Slime-San. Plus, it's upcoming Demon Tides looks good too. So it's an enticing pairing. As for Bubsy 4D, it's got rolling, jumping, gliding, a bunch of evil sheep, a bunch of evil <em>robot</em> sheep, vibrant 3D worlds with a sort of old-school air to their design, and I really like the music in the trailer. Bubsy 4D doesn't have a release date yet, but it's coming "soon", and I am cautiously optimistic.

<p>Threading the needle</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>You've read the title, you've seen photos of the booths online, so you know it's coming — six years after its last official public demo, we've <em>finally</em> played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. And, we've played it on Switch 2, too.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's special broadcast tomorrow, 21st August, we — or, more specifically, the lovely Felix — has spent some hands-on time with the highly-anticipated sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>.</p>
<p>Now, it's only about 15-minutes or so, but that's 15 minutes more than we had before. So, was it worth the two-hour-long wait? (Yes, <em>two</em> hours)</p>
<p>Of the two demos available — one from near the beginning of the game in a green area, and another later in the game in a magma-filled stage — Felix picked the second one. And, as we've already confirmed, there's a 120fps mode.</p>
<p>There's more dialogue (given that Hornet speaks), more collectible, and different movement options. And, of course, Felix took on the demo's big boss, Lace. So, it's more Hollow Knight with more features, at least for now.</p>
<p><em>So, if you want your first look at Silksong on Switch 2, here's the place for it — check out Felix's video up-top and then let us know if you're looking forward to Silksong in the comments</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ROG Xbox Ally Officially Launches This October]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-release-date-gamescom-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-officially-launches-this-october.1275603/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>Update 20/08/2025:</strong> Wario64 on X (formerly Twitter) spotted that Best Buy has already listed the prices for the ROG Xbox Ally and the Xbox Ally X, confirming the prices leaked by Billbil-kun below. Pre-orders are not yet live, but should be any moment, since <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-pre-orders-go-live-gamescom-2025/">Billbil-kun already reported that they would go live today.</a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Xbox has announced the official release date for the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X at Gamescom 2025, which will officially launch this coming October 16, 2025.</p>



<p>The news was announced during Xbox's first day of livestreaming during this year's Gamescom, but it's not news for anyone that's been paying attention to the ROG Xbox Ally, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/">Billbil-kun from Dealabs leaked the release date last week</a>.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun even leaked the prices, though Xbox has yet to confirm them at the time of this writing. Earlier today,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/billbil-kun.bsky.social/post/3lwt47zevds24"> in a Bluesky post</a>, they claimed the US prices would be <strong>$549.99 </strong>for the ROG Xbox Ally and <strong>$899.99</strong> for the ROG Xbox Ally X. Billbil-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-prices-leaked/">leaked the European prices last month</a>.  </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Inside the ROG Xbox Ally: Game Access and Compatibility" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTaboYwSyuc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Gamescom live stream also went over a few details for the Ally, like the fact that it will come with Microsoft's Co-Pilot for Gaming built in, and that games will carry a performance tag similar to what Valve has for the Steam Deck. Instead of something being 'Ally verified' or not, games will carry one of three tags telling players what kind of performance they can expect.</p>



<p>If the game in question has been tested and can hit at least 30FPS on the ROG Xbox Ally, it'll get a "<em>Should perform well on this device</em>" tag. If it has been tested and can hit at least 60FPS, it'll have a "<em>Should perform great on this device</em>" tag. If it's not been tested, it'll have a "<em>Performance check not available yet</em>" tag.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Introducing Handheld Compatibility" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQiwumMYsGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Regarding that testing, Xbox also introduced its Handheld Compatibility Program, which is "<em>a new Xbox initiative designed to make more games ready to play on your supported handheld</em>,"<em> </em>according to an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/20/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-october-features/">Xbox Wire post</a>. Xbox has been working with studios to test "<em>thousands of games for handheld compatibility,"</em> to ensure they're ready for players picking up an Ally this coming October.</p>



<p>It's nice to see the release date get an official confirmation, even if the news was spoiled before Xbox got the chance to shout it out itself. Hopefully, we'll have the prices confirmed soon. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This year's Gamescom Opening Night Live aired just last night, and it came packed with a ton of reveals and new information about existing games. Here's everything that was announced during the show, including the pre-show stream!</p>

<hr>

<p>We'll begin with everything that was revealed during the pre-show segment, which ran for a little under half an hour. Believe it or not, it was packed with news as well. Here we go!</p>

<h3><em>Bubsy 4D</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bubsy-4d-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=WK7OwcgS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bubsy-4d-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=K8gPjW2i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bubsy&nbsp;</em>is back, baby.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, we got a look at a brand new 3D platformer from Atari and Fabraz, namely&nbsp;<em>Bubsy 4D</em>. That's right; everyone's (least?) favorite feline mischief-maker is still around, and his latest game is coming to PC and consoles sometime in the near future.</p>

<h3><em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em></h3>

<p>The next game on Gamescom's 2025 agenda was&nbsp;<em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em>, a roguelite strategy game in which you must "take command of a fleet escaping the annihilation of the Twelve Colonies". Early 2026 for this one.</p>

<h3><em>Outlaws</em></h3>

<p>Nightdive continues its mission to single-handedly revive all of retro gaming with a remaster of the 1997 Western-themed FPS&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>. You can expect to check this one out on November 20th.</p>

<h3><em>Denshattack!</em></h3>




<p>I'm not sure how to describe&nbsp;<em>Denshattack!</em>. Train platformer? On-rails skating racer?&nbsp;<em>Yellow Train Goes Choo-Choo</em>?&nbsp;Well, at any rate, it's coming in 2026, and it looks like exactly the kind of off-the-wall insanity the indie industry excels at.</p>

<h3><em>Keeper</em></h3>

<p>Next on the agenda was an interview with&nbsp;<em>Keeper&nbsp;</em>creative director Lee Petty, who told us a little more about the way Double Fine's upcoming lighthouse sim (?) will work. As a reminder, the game is due to launch on October 17th.</p>

<h3><em>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction</em></h3>

<p>Try saying that name ten times fast.&nbsp;<em>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction&nbsp;</em>is a classic-style pixel-art beat-'em-up featuring iconic characters like He-Man, She-Ra, and Man-at-Arms, and it's coming soon.</p>

<h3><em>Absolum</em></h3>

<p>We got a look at another beat-'em-up next in the form of&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>, which launches on October 9th. If you want to know more about this one, you can read our very own Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/absolum-features-gorgeous-story-and-flashy-combat-to-keep-you-coming-back-over-and" rel="nofollow">preview of it right here</a>.</p>

<h3><em>Long Gone</em></h3>

<p>Hey, have you had enough of zombies yet? <i>Long Gone&nbsp;</i>sure hopes you haven't. It's a narrative survival adventure inspired by "games of old", according to developer Hillfort Games, and it launches soon.</p>

<h3><em>Valor Mortis</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valor-mortis-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=RKOayitY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valor-mortis-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=2FrLM7Xh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wouldn't want to run into him on a dark&nbsp;<em>rue</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The developers behind&nbsp;<em>Ghostrunner&nbsp;</em>are trying their hands at a Soulslike, it turns out, and that Soulslike is&nbsp;<em>Valor Mortis</em>. It's a rather distinctive-looking first-person action game set to debut next year, so keep an eye out for this one.</p>

<h3><em>Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</em></h3>

<p>It's okay; you can just call this one&nbsp;<em>PVKK&nbsp;</em>if you want. It's a sim that sees you operating a planetary defense cannon amidst an interplanetary invasion, and you'll have to press all the right buttons if you want to fend said invasion off.</p>

<h3><em>Routine</em></h3>

<p>Yeah, that's right,&nbsp;<em>Routine&nbsp;</em>is still alive! Remember this one from back in the day? The narrative-based horror game is still very much alive (although there's no guarantee you'll stay that way during your playthrough), and it's coming in late 2025.</p>

<h3><em>Swords of Legends</em></h3>

<p>Okay, okay, I know this one's from an established franchise, but come on.&nbsp;<em>Swords of Legends</em>? They may as well have called it&nbsp;<em>Quest of Hero</em>. In any case, it's a single-player action Soulslike set to arrive...uhh, sometime in the future.</p>

<h3><em>Road Kings</em></h3>

<p>From Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment comes&nbsp;<em>Road Kings</em>, a "next-gen truck simulation" that has you hauling cargo across the American South while dealing with natural disasters along the way. It's coming in 2026.</p>

<h3><em>Pac-Man&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>are getting crossover DLC packs</h3>

<p>Next, we got to see DLC packs for both&nbsp;<em>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds</em>, both of which are getting DLC themed around the other game.&nbsp;<em>Pac-Man</em>'s comes in late 2025, while&nbsp;<em>Sonic</em>'s arrives early next year.</p>

<hr><h2>Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 - Main Show Announcements</h2>

<p>Well, that's everything from the pre-show, so now we're getting into the meat of things. Here's everything we got to see during the main Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 ceremony!</p>

<h3><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></h3>

<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/major-hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-set-for-this-week" rel="nofollow">big announcement for&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>tomorrow</a> (which is almost certainly going to be a release date), we got to see some new gameplay footage, and hey, it certainly looks like&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>. Hype is building yet again for this one.</p>

<h3><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></h3>

<p>Next up, it's a look at the characteristically bonkers-looking&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, and a giant man smashing his fist into one of the game's campaign stages is just one of the weird sights you're going to see when the shooter launches on November 14th.</p>

<h3><em>Lords of the Fallen 2</em></h3>




<p>CI Games announced its Soulslike followup&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen 2&nbsp;</em>next (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-2-2026-epic-exclusive" rel="nofollow">well, officially, anyway</a>), and it's got more of the pseudo-Biblical designs and ruined kingdoms that the first game loved so much. It's coming in 2026.</p>

<h3><em>Sekiro: No Defeat</em></h3>

<p>No, it's not a followup to 2019's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-sales" rel="nofollow">hugely popular</a>&nbsp;<em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, but an anime adaptation of the game with some pretty gnarly-looking art. It's coming exclusively to Crunchyroll next year.</p>

<h3><em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em></h3>

<p>You're in luck if you love Batman and Lego, because this new game will marry the two once again. It's a sort of anthology experience that takes in many of the Dark Knight's most iconic movie, TV, and comic appearances, and it's coming next year.</p>

<h3><em>Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War IV</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-iv-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=SsQ15cXt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-iv-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=7nhSeNXN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dawn of War IV&nbsp;</em>brings the franchise back to its roots, by the looks of things.</figcaption></figure><p>The iconic RTS franchise returns, although it's not being helmed by its usual custodian Relic Entertainment this time around, instead being developed by&nbsp;<em>Iron Harvest&nbsp;</em>studio King Art. Happily, though, it looks exactly like&nbsp;<em>Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>should. 2026 for this one.</p>

<h3><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</i>cross over</h3>

<p><em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>has crossed over with&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>before, and they're about to do so again when&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>'s iconic Omega monster finds its way into <i>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</i>in late September.&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>is also getting itself a new&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>encounter in October.</p>

<h3><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em></h3>

<p>Next, Capcom showed off its upcoming hack-and-slash revival&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, and hey, it sure looks like an&nbsp;<em>Onimusha&nbsp;</em>game, complete with lots of fancy swordwork and creepy-looking enemies. No release date beyond 2026 for this one yet.</p>

<h3><em>Arknights: Endfield</em></h3>

<p>We got to see a moody trailer for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Arknights&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>Arknights: Endfield&nbsp;</em>next, and it'll marry action RPG gameplay with, uh, base-building and factory simulation. This one doesn't yet have a release window.</p>

<h3><em>Europa Universalis V</em></h3>

<p>If you're one of the players who was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-vii-slow-start-take-two" rel="nofollow">disappointed</a> by&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII</em>, then perhaps Paradox's (admittedly more complex)&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-europa-universalis-v-project-caesar-maybe" rel="nofollow">Europa Universalis V</a>&nbsp;</em>will work better for you. We got to see it in action during Gamescom ONL, and it's coming on November 4th.</p>

<h3><em>Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</em></h3>

<p>I didn't have a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Daemon x Machina&nbsp;</em>on my 2025 bingo card back when it was announced in 2023, but here we are. We got to see a new trailer for it during yesterday's ceremony, too. It's set for launch on September 5th.</p>

<h3><em>Void/Breaker</em></h3>

<p>Playstack and Stubby Games' futuristic roguelite shooter&nbsp;<em>Void/Breaker&nbsp;</em>is next, and hey, wouldn't you know it, the game is out right now. You can check it out right this instant if you think you'd be interested!</p>

<h3><em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>season 2</h3>




<p>Prime Video's second season of its acclaimed&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>show got itself an airing following&nbsp;<em>Void/Breaker</em>, and we got to see some clips of the show, which will be heading to New Vegas <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-season-3-confirmed-season-2-december" rel="nofollow">when it begins airing</a> on December 17th.</p>

<h3><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch 2</h3>

<p>A trailer for&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>confirmed that the game will be making its way to the Nintendo Switch 2 sometime next year, which is a pretty impressive feat of porting prowess. No specific release date for this yet, though.</p>

<h3><em>Deadpool VR</em></h3>

<p>Yep,&nbsp;<em>Deadpool VR&nbsp;</em>is still a thing, and we got to see a new trailer for it during Gamescom Opening Night Live last night. It looks exactly as irreverent and silly as you'd expect a&nbsp;<em>Deadpool&nbsp;</em>game to look, so bonus points for that, I guess.</p>

<h3><em>World of Tanks 2.0</em></h3>

<p>The "biggest update" in&nbsp;<em>World of Tanks</em>' history is scheduled to launch in early September, and it'll bring an entirely new tier of vehicles, a brand new map, and plenty more. If you're a&nbsp;<em>World of Tanks&nbsp;</em>devotee, you won't want to miss this.</p>

<h3><em>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</em></h3>

<p>Saber Interactive's co-op FPS is shaping up to be the perfect tribute to the 80s oeuvre of its titular filmmaker, and a new trailer last night further confirmed that the game is going to be full of over-the-top insanity when it arrives next year.</p>

<h3><em>Death Scrolling</em></h3>

<p>Now here's something you don't see every day: an auto-scroller that scrolls upwards, not sideways.&nbsp;<em>Death Scrolling&nbsp;</em>comes to us from legendary publisher MicroProse and equally legendary developer Ron Gilbert, and it has plenty of fantasy-inflected action for you.</p>

<h3><em>Zero Parades</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zero-parades-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=vdQ41vm_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zero-parades-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=-a6TkDmi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZA/UM has a lot to prove with&nbsp;<em>Zero Parades</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>ZA/UM's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">new RPG</a> is called&nbsp;<em>Zero Parades</em>, and it's a "story-rich espionage RPG" in which you must "untangle a bloody web of intrigue at the End of History". Here's hoping ZA/UM, or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs" rel="nofollow">what's left of it</a>, can pull this one off.</p>

<h3><em>Neverness to Everness</em></h3>

<p>A new trailer for Hotta's&nbsp;<em>Neverness to Everness&nbsp;</em>showed us that yes, the game definitely does look like a big ol' melange of everything HoYoverse is currently running, and no, we still don't have a release date.</p>

<h3><em>Unbeatable</em></h3>

<p>In this rhythm-action game, "music is illegal and you do crimes", according to D-Cell Games and publisher Playstack. I've got a bit of a bee in my bonnet about "rock'n'roll can save the world" stories, but I guess we'll see if this one can change my mind on November 6th.</p>

<h3><em>Honor of Kings: World</em></h3>

<p><em>Honor of Kings: World&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honor-of-kings-world-cross-platform-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">still exists</a>, and we got to see more of its, erm, world during a trailer last night. It all looks very grandiose and fantastical, although we still don't have any idea when we can actually play this one.</p>

<h3><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></h3>

<p>We're just a few weeks away from&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>now, and just in case the story was the part of this frenetic hack-and-slash game in which you're most interested, that's what last night's trailer focused on. More slashing, please!</p>

<h3><em>Cinder City</em></h3>




<p>Turns out NCSoft's Project LLL is actually&nbsp;<em>Cinder City</em>, an MMO shooter that takes place in an alternate-future version of Seoul devastated by a mysterious crisis. This one looks suitably ambitious, combining squad-based tactics, vehicles, and more.</p>

<h3><em>Time Takers</em></h3>

<p>Time (ahem) to see another live-service shooter now in the form of&nbsp;<em>Time Takers</em>, a team-based game in which "time is your lifeline - and every second is earned, spent, or lost in combat". It's another NCSoft game, and a playtest is coming to Steam soon.</p>

<h3><em>Silent Hill f</em></h3>

<p>We got another look at upcoming survival horror&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>next, and though it looks a bit more action-oriented than I'm used to from this franchise, it seems as though Konami has its mojo back. We'll find out in late September.</p>

<h3><em>La Divina Commedia</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/la-divina-commedia-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=6O4PKbXu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/la-divina-commedia-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=2cYJvMEG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Previous attempts at adapting&nbsp;<em>The Divine Comedy&nbsp;</em>haven't exactly been roaring successes.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps this attempt at adapting Dante Alighieri's famous&nbsp;<em>The Divine Comedy&nbsp;</em>into an action game will be more successful than EA's famously mid effort, although its "procedural extraction dungeon generation" system doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.</p>

<h3><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em></h3>

<p>Yup, Bloober Team's upcoming survival horror game sure looks like a horror game alright. I'm on record as a Bloober hater, but perhaps, between this and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>, the studio can redeem itself in my eyes. I'm sure they're itching to do just that.</p>

<h3><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></h3>

<p>Obsidian's RPG has some pretty big shoes to fill, not to mention an entire first game to apologize for (sorry, I'm on record as a hater for that as well). Let's hope the studio has learned its lesson and can deliver a satisfying RPG experience this time around!</p>

<h3><em>inZoi: Island Getaway</em></h3>

<p>Next, we got to see a DLC pack for Krafton's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">AI-filled</a>&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-like&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, with&nbsp;<em>Island Getaway&nbsp;</em>bringing tons of idyllic new scenery and other features. It's out today, so if you love&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, you can already check it out!</p>

<h3><em>Fate Trigger</em></h3>

<p>Yup, that's right: it's another anime-style live-service shooter.&nbsp;<em>Fate Trigger&nbsp;</em>launches in the first quarter of 2026, and I can only speak for myself, but its art style makes it a little difficult for me to get particularly hyped for this one.</p>

<h3><em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</em></h3>

<p>We got to see this anime action RPG in, well, action next, and there's a closed beta test on the cards as well, so if you want to get a chance to try out Netmarble's game, you can do just that.</p>

<h3><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em></h3>

<p>Next, we learned that Digital Sun and 11 bit studios'&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2&nbsp;</em>will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">launching in Early Access on October 23rd</a>, bringing more action-RPG-slash-shop-management shenanigans with it.</p>

<h3><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gamescom-opening-night-live.jpg?itok=xGJQwcRB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gamescom-opening-night-live.jpg?itok=BBUMHq1E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could all the roadblocks finally have been removed?</figcaption></figure><p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>finally, finally, finally has a release date, and I really, really hope The Chinese Room and Paradox don't delay it again (unless it's absolutely necessary for quality, of course). October 21st for this one.</p>

<h3><em>Enshrouded</em></h3>

<p>Update 7 is coming soon for&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, and "Wake of the Water", as it's known, will bring lots of sunken treasures for you to plunder. The update is in the works now, although we don't know when it's landing just yet.</p>

<h3><em>Age of Empires IV</em></h3>

<p>The latest title in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Age of Empires&nbsp;</em>series of real-time strategy games is coming to the PlayStation 5, together with its&nbsp;<em>Dynasties of the East&nbsp;</em>DLC. The game launches for Sony's machine on November 4th.</p>

<h3><em>Cult of the Lamb</em></h3>

<p>Devolver Digital's beloved roguelite action-slash-management game (the composer of which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cult-of-lamb-composer-narayana-johnson-dies" rel="nofollow">we sadly lost last year</a>) is getting a "massive paid expansion" in the form of&nbsp;<em>Woolhaven&nbsp;</em>next year, bringing new weapons and much more for you to intimidate your followers with.</p>

<h3><em>World of Warcraft: Midnight</em></h3>




<p>Next up, we got a new cinematic trailer for the&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Midnight</em>, which forms the next part of Chris Metzen's Worldsoul Saga, as well as some gameplay. It's coming next year, so make sure you're leveled accordingly.</p>

<h3><em>Project Spectrum</em></h3>

<p>You might not be able to tell it from the creepy and evocative trailer, but&nbsp;<em>Project Spectrum&nbsp;</em>is actually a multiplayer game; it's kind of like&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em>, by the sound of things. No release date for this one yet.</p>

<h3><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></h3>

<p>Hey, look at that.&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>is getting its own&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/co-op-is-coming-to-ghosts-of-tsushima" rel="nofollow"><em>Tsushima</em>-style multiplayer DLC</a> next year, bringing a "fantastical, supernatural setting" to contrast against the core game's historically-accurate locations. Cool stuff!</p>

<h3><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></h3>

<p>If you were hoping for some actual, y'know, gameplay from&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, you'd have left yesterday night's show disappointed, but perhaps more will be on the way soon. At any rate, we did get to see a fun and spooky snippet of new gameplay, so that's something, at least.</p>

<h3><em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</em></h3>




<p>Lastly, we got to learn that Game Science is working on a brand new followup to last year's&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-serious-monkey-business" rel="nofollow">which I rather liked</a>.&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui&nbsp;</em>will follow the titular Chinese folk hero and is currently in development.</p>

<hr><p>Well, that's everything! I hope you've enjoyed this recap of all things Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/762116/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-compatibility</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-and-asus%E2%80%99-new-xbox-ally-handhelds-launch-on-october-16th.1275594/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft and Asus are putting a date on their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">new Xbox Ally handhelds</a>: October 16th. Both the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X will be available on the same day in a variety of markets worldwide, but Microsoft and Asus aren’t opening preorders yet or revealing pricing. Microsoft also announced its handheld compatibility program to identify games optimized for the new Xbox Ally devices.</p><p>Leaks have suggested that the Xbox Ally will debut at €599 (around $699) and the top-of-the-line Xbox Ally X model at €899 ($1,049). I understand Microsoft and Asus had planned to announce Xbox Ally pricing and release date information today, but then it decided to only reveal a release date. Microsoft is now promising pricing and preorder information “in the coming weeks.”</p><p>The price information delay could be related to the leaks or ongoing uncertainty with US tariffs. <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340"><em>Dealabs </em>reported</a> yesterday that the Xbox Ally could be priced at $549.99 and the Xbox Ally X at $899.99 in the US. It will be interesting to see if Microsoft and Asus can subsidize this further for this important Xbox hardware release.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The homescreen of the Xbox Ally X.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Both Xbox Ally handhelds will be available on October 16th in the following: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, China (only the Xbox Ally X), Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, and Vietnam.</p><p>That covers a lot of key markets for Asus and Xbox at launch, and there are also plans to introduce these handhelds in Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Thailand. The white ROG Xbox Ally is designed for 720p gaming, and the more powerful black ROG Xbox Ally X targets 1080p gaming. Like the existing ROG Ally and Ally X, the new ones share the same 7-inch 1080p screen, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate and VRR support.</p><p>The Xbox Ally uses AMD’s Ryzen Z2 A chip, combined with 16GB of LPDDR5X-6400 RAM and 512GB of M.2 2280 SSD storage. The Xbox Ally X upgrades the chip to AMD’s Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor, 24GB of LPDDR5X-8000 memory, and a 1TB M.2 2280 SSD.</p><p>Alongside release date confirmation, Microsoft also announced its handheld compatibility program today. “We have worked with game studios to test, optimize, and verify thousands of games for handheld compatibility, allowing you to jump into the game without having to tweak settings, or requiring only minor adjustments,” says Roanne Sones, CVP of gaming devices and ecosystem at Xbox.</p><p>There will be two forms of handheld compatibility: Handheld Optimized and Mostly Compatible. While Handheld Optimized games will have default controller inputs, accurate icons, and the correct screen resolution in full-screen mode, Mostly Compatible titles “may require minor in-game setting changes for an optimal experience on handheld.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The task switcher on the Xbox Ally X lets you switch into the Windows desktop.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Microsoft will also mark games with a Windows Performance Fit indicator, so you’ll get the benefit of knowing if a game is compatible and how well it will play. Both Xbox Ally devices will ship with the Xbox full screen experience that Microsoft has been developing to improve Windows on handheld devices. This will boot as default, with the Windows desktop hidden away but still accessible through an option in the Xbox Game Bar UI.</p><p>Microsoft is also working on improving the game shader experience on Windows, with a new “advanced shader delivery” feature. This will preload game shaders during download on the Xbox Ally devices, so certain games can launch a lot faster and run smoother without the typical stutters that shader compilation introduces on Windows. This is key on a handheld as it will help with battery life and performance, but it’s not clear which games will support this just yet.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166413/microsoft-windows-auto-super-resolution-sr-qualcomm-npu-dlss-fsr">Automatic Super Resolution (Auto SR)</a>, which is an NPU to upscale games, is also arriving in early 2026 on the Xbox Ally X. Microsoft is planning to use the NPU on this device to introduce a highlight reels feature that uses AI models to automatically capture gameplay moments and make them easily shareable with friends or on social networks.</p><p>Additional improvements to the docking experience for the Xbox Ally devices are also coming soon. Microsoft is working “to enable a seamless, high-performance setup that supports big-screen gaming, Auto SR, intuitive controller pairing, optimized display output, and more,” according to Soanes.</p><p><em>Photos by Tom Warren / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/762116/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-compatibility]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Development on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/">Stardew Valley</a> may have slowed down earlier this year so that developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-wants-to-focus-on-mystery-whimsy-in-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6531252/">focus on his next game</a>, Haunted Chocolatier, but that doesn't mean it's going into hibernation. In fact it's even going so far as to jump worlds through an upcoming collaboration with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/infinity-nikki/">Infinity Nikki</a>, of all games, as revealed in a new trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer kicks off with a group of Junimos, those cute, apple-looking creatures that help you tend to your chores on the farm, before revealing a strawberry-looking asteroid that had crash-landed. After inspecting it, the asteroid explodes, shooting off one of the Juminos into Infinity Nikki's world, turning it 3D as it does so. As cute as the trailer might be, it's also quite light on details.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Infinity Nikki × Stardew Valley Collab Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">There's no word on what the collaboration will look like in-game, but at the very least a date for the collab has been set: September 1. That's the same date Infinity Nikki receives its next big update, version 1.9, aka the "Music Season." The full scope of version 1.9 is yet to be revealed, though it is set to introduce a <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/news/241" rel="nofollow ">new Home feature</a> where you'll get your own house on a secluded island that you get to decorate yourself.</p><p dir="ltr">Infinity Nikki faced a bit of controversy this year after an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/infinity-nikki-team-offers-apologies-and-compensation-after-unpopular-update/1100-6531661/">unpopular update</a>, particularly because of what some claimed were quite aggressive monetization practices. On the opposite end of player responses, Stardew Valley actually became the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-has-a-new-best-rated-game-of-all-time/1100-6533053/">best-rated game of all time on Steam</a>.</p>

              <p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> has been through a hell of a journey to reach us. At <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">last night’s Opening Night Live from Gamescom</a>, Paradox revealed the long-delayed game finally has a release date, October 21. What the publisher didn’t boast about was is that it is locking two out of the six playable clans behind paid day-one DLC, and it’ll cost you an extra $30 to unlock them. A third of the ways to play the game.</p> <p>Expensive day-one DLC was once the most loathed concept in gaming. Back in 2012 <a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-dlc-triggers-fan-outrage-bioware-respons-5887626">it was the talk of the industry</a>, as companies deliberately developed a chunk of the launched game with the intention of hiding it behind a further paywall, and people understandably <em>hated it</em>. Times moved on, and now we’re screwed over in all manner of different ways, most usually seeing significant portions of games sectioned off behind so-called “battle passes,” where we’re expected to not just pay once but to buy new ones multiple times throughout the year! Yay video games! But Paradox is kicking us old-school with <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>by deciding that a full third of how you can play the game will require you to fork out 50 percent of the original asking price again. The cheapest version of the game will cost you $60 on PC, but if you want to buy everything they developed for launch, it’ll cost you an extraordinary $90. Not even the $70 “Deluxe Edition” will secure you either of the missing clans. (Thanks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sticks-two-bloodsucker-clans-including-the-sexy-one-behind-paid-day-one-dlc"><em>RPS</em></a>.)</p> <p>A huge part of how the original&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines</em> played was based on the clan you chose at the start. It affected not just more common features like stats, but entirely changed how you approached the game. Different clans within the world treated you accordingly, missions were experienced differently as a result, and the means by which you could approach the RPG quests were all affected by who you were. Play as Brujah and you were a mighty warrior but very vulnerable to “frenzy,” where you’d fully lose control of your bloodlust. But pick a Toreador and you were a schmoozer, expert in socializing, but weakened by your inability to turn away from the truly beautiful. Clearly these made for very different experiences of the game. But now, in&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>, if you want to be a Toreador and play that way, it’s going to cost you an awful lot more.</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/bloodlines-faq">the game’s own FAQ</a> makes clear, these choices are not cosmetic.</p> <p>“How will the dialogue options differ in each playthrough?” asks one of the questions. The answer:</p> <blockquote> <p>The dialogue options differ depending on which clan you’ve chosen and what choices you’ve made throughout the story. When hunting for Blood Resonance, specific disciplines and outfit choices can also affect NPCs on the street.</p> </blockquote> <p>It also notes that “each clan offers new, unique abilities, playstyles, and distinct outfits.” Play style seems a hell of a thing to lock to day-one DLC.</p> <p>For a while, Bloodlines<em> 2</em> did look to have become vaporware, after its original development under Hardsuit Labs fell apart in 2021 following its former leads being fired. Then in 2023 it re-emerged, <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-release-date-1850804491">now being developed by The Chinese Room</a>, the studio best known for their walking sims, which has had its own turbulent few years. Given The Chinese Room only released their most recent game, <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>, in June of last year, it seemed unlikely that <em>Bloodlines 2</em> could be imminent. But here we are! It’s out in just a couple of months.</p> <p>We’ve reached out to Paradox to ask what has motivated the decision to lock away such a significant chunk of the core game behind day-one DLC. (Although we can guess it’s at least in part, “We desperately need to recoup some of the costs of the last six years of development across two different studios under multiple different leaderships for the sequel to a game that came out in 2004.”) We’ll report back if they respond.</p>

<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally has an official release date. </p>



<p>After weeks and months of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-ally-x-release-date-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors and leaks</a>, it was officially confirmed on Wednesday that the Xbox Ally X and Xbox Ally will launch on October 16. The announcement came during the official Xbox Gamescom stream.</p>



<p>What fans might be surprised to find out, however, was that only a release date was announced. What wasn’t confirmed was the price of the devices, at least at the time of publishing. Even in the <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1958159636370174153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official post on social media</a>, pricing wasn’t mentioned. </p>



<p>There are rumors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-and-asus-delay-xbox-ally-price-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">circulating on the floor in Cologne</a> regarding the price after it was leaked yet again that it will cost $549.99 for the Xbox Ally and $899.99 for the Xbox Ally X. However, it’s pure speculation at this time.</p>



<p>When official pricing information is announced, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you think of Microsoft announcing the release date of the Xbox Ally but not the pricing? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

Other markets where ROG Ally series products are sold, including Brazil, India, Indonesia and Thailand, will follow in early 2026. More information about pricing and pre-orders will be announced in the coming weeks. <span id="more-986421"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ready for Launch</strong></p><p>Able On October 16, ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X will be available in the United States and across key international markets, spanning Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Availability will expand to additional regions where the ROG Ally series is already sold today. Pricing and pre-order details will follow in the coming weeks.</p><p>ROG and Xbox co-developed the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X to give gamers the freedom to play their way, anytime and anywhere. The ROG Xbox Ally is powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor featuring four Zen 2 cores with eight threads and eight RDNA 2 GPU cores. This offers ultra-efficient performance, paired with 16GB of LPDDR5X‑6400 RAM and a 512GB M.2 SSD, and all backed by a 60Wh battery for extended play.</p><p>The premium, high-performance ROG Xbox Ally X ups the ante with an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme, a new 8‑core/16‑thread Zen 5 APU with 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores and an integrated 50 TOPS NPU. The ROG Xbox Ally X also features 24GB of LPDDR5X‑8000 memory, a 1TB M.2 SSD, and boasts a larger 80Wh battery for longer playtime.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Optimized for Handheld</strong></p><p>The team at Xbox has been hard at work behind the scenes partnering with game studios to test and optimize thousands of <a title="Platforms > PC [23,978 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> titles for handheld compatibility. This new Handheld Compatibility Program ensures day-one users have the best experience possible on their ROG Xbox Ally handhelds. At launch, compatible games in the game library will sport Handheld Optimized or Mostly Compatible badges.</p><p>Handheld Optimized means that the game is ready to go—with default controller inputs, an intuitive text input method, accurate iconography, clear text legibility, and appropriate resolution in full-screen mode. Mostly Compatible means that the game may require minor in-game setting changes for an optimal experience on handheld.</p><p>The Xbox team is also bringing advanced shader delivery to the ROG Xbox Ally. This allows the Xbox app to preload a game’s shaders during download, so supported games will launch up to 10x faster, run more smoothly, and use less battery on first play. Xbox is working on adding this feature to even more games over time.</p><p>The ROG Xbox Ally X also features AMD’s cutting-edge Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor with a built-in NPU, that unlocks upcoming AI powered features starting early next year—with more to come. These features include:</p><ul><li><strong>Automatic Super Resolution (Auto SR)</strong> – a system-level feature that uses the power of the NPU to upscale games running at lower resolutions. This delivers high-resolution visuals and smooth framerates across a wide range of games, with no additional changes required from game developers.</li><li><strong>Highlight Reels</strong> – AI captures standout gameplay moments—like epic boss battles or victories—and generates short replay clips to share with friends or on social channels.</li></ul><p><strong>See the New ROG Ally Lineup in <a title="Genres > Action [2,951 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a></strong></p><p>The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X will make their fully playable debut at Gamescom 2025, joined by ROG’s complete 2025 laptop lineup powered by the latest NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.

How does Leslie feel about the competition? He told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-responds-to-lazy-accusations-and-battlefield-6-lets-all-have-fun" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that he recently played the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a> open beta and concluded that "it's a fun game," but Activision is staying focused on its own product.</p><p>"We're fans of all games and I think we look for inspiration anywhere. But we're focused on our own craft. They're doing their thing," he said. "We know if we can hit our goals, we're going to deliver what the fans want and that's the key, because if we're happy when we're play testing, then we know fans are going to be happy play testing."</p><p>Leslie added: "We're fans of the FPS genre. We're fans of lots of games. Let's all have fun."</p><p>The developer was also asked to respond to the claims from some in the FPS community that Call of Duty doesn't do enough to innovate with its annual releases. Leslie said, "You just don't worry about it." He said the developers instead aim to stick to their vision and make something fun for people to enjoy.</p><p>"There's always going to be people that are going to try to knock you down and not have positive criticism, which we do look for. So, it's like noise. You try to cut through that and stick to your vision and plan," he said.</p><p>Former Xbox executive Mike Ybarra <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1953621587993014620" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently said</a> that Battlefield 6 will "boot stomp" Black Ops 7. "The real win here is CoD won’t be lazy anymore, and we'll all get better FPS games for it," he said.</p><p>For what it's worth, experts do not expect Battlefield 6 to outsell Black Ops 7, in part because the masses of casual players who play Call of Duty <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will buy the newest game every year even if they complain about a lack of major changes or innovation.</a> As for Ybarra's comments specifically, one research firm said <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he needs to "chill out" and think more critically.</a></p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, which is about a month after Battlefield 6 arrives on October 10. </p>

                <p>For the first time ever, Activision is releasing new Call of Duty: Black Ops games in consecutive years. Beyond that, the same two developers that led the production of Black Ops 6--Treyarch and Raven Software--are once again co-leading the development on<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073"> Black Ops 7</a>.</p><p>With Activision previously stating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-three-year-dev-cycle-ensures-best-id/1100-6421741/" data-ref-id="1100-6421741">how important it is to have a three-year production cycle for each new Call of Duty game</a>, many are wondering how it's even possible that Black Ops 7 is coming just a year after Black Ops 6.

<p>"They were started at the same time," Leslie sad. "So obviously they have different production ramp-up times, but they were started in parallel and greenlit at the same time. That was a really unique challenge, but also fun to be able to know that you're going to do that. Black Ops 6 is going to be 1991 rogue team, and now how do you flip the script on Black Ops 7 in 2035?"</p><p>Also worth noting is that while Treyarch and Raven are the two co-lead developers for Black Ops 7, Activision's network of studios are contributing to its development. For example, Beenox is heading up the PC edition specifically. Other studios that worked on Black Ops 7 include Activision Shanghai, Demonware, Digital Legends, High Moon Studios, Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games, Activision Central Design, Activision Central Technology, and Activision QA.</p><p>Lead narrative producer Natalie Pohorski, meanwhile, said making the games in tandem affords for some "payoffs" that might not have been possible in a different setup. "A lot of the things that we innovated on with Black Ops 6, you're going to see in Black Ops 7, and so it's a great connector," Pohorski said.</p><p>One of those features is the Omnimovement system, which is expanding in Black Ops 7 with things like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-see-wall-running-and-active-camo-in-action-plus-other-major-multiplayer-changes/1100-6534097/" data-ref-id="1100-6534097">wall-running</a>. Additionally, Black Ops 7 adds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-adds-a-new-20v20-mode-with-wingsuits-and-grappling-hooks/1100-6534075/" data-ref-id="1100-6534075">wingsuits and grappling hooks.</a></p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC, and it'll also be available at launch on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s Jet</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> European</p>
</section></header><section><p>Once upon a time, Jet-Ski games were all the rage. Arcade cabinets and fifth generation consoles were replete with these high-speed polygonal racers that sent you careening around tracks set in sunny locales with bobbing water physics. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_aqua_jet">Aqua Jet</a> was an early example of the trend and released the very same year as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/wave_race_64">Wave Race 64</a>. Now, you can play it in all its glory on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Hamster Corporation has recently released two other classic Namco arcade titles on the new console in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_air_combat_22">Air Combat</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-aqua-jet">Aqua Jet</a> is just as lovingly curated as those games. In lieu of riding a replica personal watercraft, like the original cabinet offered, there's some nice feedback from the HD rumble and togglable gyroscopic controls. Elsewhere, there are widescreen format options and the ability to play both English and Japanese versions of the ROM.</p>
<p>There is such a wealth of customisation and ways to tailor your experience here that it's a shame the actual game doesn't warrant much of your time. Only two courses are available and unlocked from the start, with the advanced course being simply an extension of the normal course.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version features High Score and Time Attack modes, which offer some replay value, while a Caravan mode gives players a continuous five-minute block to set the best scores. You can also rewind if you're not happy with a turn.</p>
<p>The tracks still look great, with bright colours popping in both docked and undocked modes and an impressive sense of speed. Big jumps send you plunging underwater to catch a brief glimpse of the fauna, while whales and helicopters dart about at the periphery of the course.</p>
<p>Mirror variants and a goofy penguin mode can be unlocked with cheats detailed in the menus, but that’s still only two more versions of the same track. So unless you're a hardcore aquatic racing fan, or a big fan of the arcade original, this might not be the right game for you.</p>
<p>Aqua Jet offers one other nice feature in online leaderboards to keep you cracking away at course times, but with no multiplayer, there's barely any reason to revisit this once you're satisfied with your performance.</p>
<p>Still, Hamster has done another solid job bringing a '90s arcade classic to Switch 2 and making it sing. Unfortunately, without much content present in the base game, there are only so many times you can revisit this colourful racer before things get repetitive.</p></section></article><div><p>Ken Talbot has been playing games since they came in the form of cassettes.

			<p>Where Winds Meet, the free-to-play open-world action-adventure RPG from Everstone Studio and NetEase will launch in the Western world on PS5 and PC this coming November 14, 2025, Everstone and NetEase have announced.</p>



<p>The game initially launched on PC in China in December 2024, followed by an iOS and Android launch this past January. It's been a long time coming to PS5, as lead designer Chris Lyu explains in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/where-winds-meet-launches-november-14/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that the November date will be the culmination of five years worth of work at Everstone Studio.</p>



<p>"<em>We’ve crafted this game with care, pouring our hearts into every detail over the past five years, and we’re beyond excited to share it with the world," </em>Lyu writes.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The final PC and PS5 test for Where Winds Meet was <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-minds-meet-final-test-july-24-31/">held last month</a> ahead of this November launch, and around that time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-final-test-qa-everstone-unveils-its-living-world-wuxia-action-rpg-offering-single-player-and-mmo-like-features/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo got the chance to speak to Everstone Studio</a> and, more specifically, today's PS Blog author, Chris Lyu, about the coming title. </p>



<p>At the time, Lyu told Wccftech, "<em>Our main goal has always been to share the world of Eastern martial arts in a way that feels new, exciting, and approachable for players everywhere. We want to present something truly different, but also make sure it’s easy for everyone to connect with, using familiar language and storytelling styles."</em></p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how that resonates with players when it arrives on PC and PS5 on November 14, 2025.</p>
