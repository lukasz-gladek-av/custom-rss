            <p>Ten years ago, we were drowning in early access survival games about chopping trees and crafting camp fires. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rust">Rust</a> pit monstrous players against one another, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dayz">DayZ</a> had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forest">The Forest</a> creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/survival-week">survival week</a> to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/7-days-to-die">7 Days To Die</a> is a solid sandbox craft 'em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it's quite soon.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Right now the target date for stable - and we're hoping to do a simultaneous release for console too - would be Thursday July 25th," said Richard Huenink, co-founder of studio The Fun Pimps in a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2165670925?t=01h49m58s">Twitch chat with fans</a> last week.  "So, cross our fingers, our team is working overtime to deliver this."  </p>

<p>Huenink calls it a "tentative schedule, subject to some game-breaking bug" and notes that in the lead-up to the stable release there will be an experimental branch on Steam for anyone who wants to see new features early. </p>
<p>"Monday June 24th we're planning on a public experimental," he said, adding that this will give the studio "four and half weeks to fix bad bugs and pass certification".</p>
<p>I remember 7 Days To Die in its earliest guise, and if you compare the screenshots in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/7-days-to-die-diary">those early playthroughs</a> with the trailer above, it's a reassuring sight. Here's a couple of comparison screens to illustrate that. </p>

<p>Even back in the heyday of survival games, it was a surprisingly simple-but-fun premise: build by day and defend by night - a philosophy that no longer seems a core tenet of its longtime crafting peers, such as Minecraft. I've been dabbling in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-2-stay-human">Dying Light 2</a> recently in an effort to sip upon some zombie apocalypse superswill, and it seems good. But hmmm, maybe I should just go back to desperately defending my snowy home in the mountains against sluggish hordes. 7 Days is one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a>, after all. </p>
<p>In the same Twitch stream the developers also said the game might some day return to Game Pass (it was on there for a couple of years) but that's not confirmed. If you're looking for a deal on it, though, they have some straightforward advice.</p>
<p>"I would just buy it now while the price is still less," said fellow dev Joel Huenink. The cost of the game is currently £19/$25/€23, but with full release that's due to increase to $45 (probably £40/€45). This is often the case with games erupting out of early access. Like other independent studios the team are quite forthright in suggesting people buy it while it's still cheap.</p>
<p>"It's a desert island game that you can play for a hundred hours," says Richard Huenink. "We've put blood, sweat, tears, and a lot of effort into this game, and we're still updating it."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-preview-%E2%80%93-to-go-even-further-beyond.900387/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-preview-to-go-even-further-beyond<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a kid, I lost countless hours to the <em>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi</em> series. It practically became the primary way I absorbed some of Akira Toriyama’s greatest work. So like many others, I was stoked to see <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em> announced at last year’s Game Awards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got to play almost 30 minutes with the Versus Battle mode, fighting against the computer in some high-octane, action-packed, environment-destroying fights. In many ways, it looks and feels like the old <em>Budokai Tenkaichi </em>games with updated graphics and more blue-haired saiyans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But <em>Sparking! Zero</em> also feels like something more special than that. It checks all the boxes my 12-year-old self has wanted in a <em>Dragon Ball</em> game for the past 15 years, but it also feels like a celebration of one of anime’s most legendary shows.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Faster Than the Eye Can See</h2>
<p>Fighting in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em> is pretty approachable, so any fan could pick this up and play it. You’ve got light attacks and a heavy attack button, which has alternate effects depending on when you press it in the combo.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-new-saga-of-heroes"><em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em></a>, another fantastic game in the franchise, really nails that frantic yet measured feeling of close-quarters combat. While <em>Sparking! Zero </em>has a lot of those moments, it really shines when you send an enemy flying and follow up with rushes or teleportation.</p>
<p>It effectively captures that too-fast-for-the-eyes action that the series is known for. Additionally, sending enemies flying through the air is a great way to showcase how destructive these battles are. Buildings and rock formations crumble, and it doesn’t take long for the field to become a series of craters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For defensive options, you can block, perfect block (which leads to a stun), vanish, or dash out of the way. It’s hard to make defense feel as good as offense, but there’s something about vanishing behind an enemy to send them flying that feels so perfectly like <em>Dragon Ball</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, we're all here for the big attacks, your kamehamehas and your galick guns. Executing these attacks is pretty easy: simply hold down the charge button and press one of the corresponding face buttons and directions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the ones I tried launched into a canned animation of the character readying the attack, and some of them play a second set of animations if it connects, like rush moves or ultimates.</p>
<p>These special attacks are probably the cream of the crop here in <em>Sparking! Zero</em>. They hearken back to the show and movies that made Goku famous, simultaneously hitting the nostalgia and the hype.</p>

<h2>Did You Know Piccolo Kills Goku (and Raditz)?</h2>
<p>In the hands-off portion of my preview, we got a presentation of what to expect from the Episode Battle and Custom Battle modes, the latter of which might be the best thing to hit a <em>Dragon Ball</em> game in years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this day, people still argue and discuss imaginary matchups in and beyond <em>Dragon Ball</em>. After all, there’s an eternal joy in imagining hyperdynamic hypothetical fistfights. Seriously, if you wander down the right (or wrong?) YouTube rabbit hole, there’s countless videos out there analyzing power levels and zenkai boosts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Custom Battles give all these fans an outlet to explore all their wildest dreams. Through a simple menu, you can create custom cutscenes with dialog and motion, and then attach them to battles with specific win conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-vegeta-vs-gohan.jpg?itok=FJ0LAq3O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-vegeta-vs-gohan.jpg?itok=G1-eYlXZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The facial expressions in this game are also fantastic. It looks even better in motion.</figcaption></figure><p>Do you want Mr. Satan to save the Earth from Cell’s tyranny, as Kami intended? Or are you a big fan of that one fan manga where Yamcha is actually the strongest character in the show? All these ideas and more can come to life in Custom Battles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even better, these can be shared online, making it a social creative endeavor. It’s the video-game equivalent of smashing action figures together, and it’s maybe the most brilliant thing to hit the fandom since <em>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Episode Battles are more of a known quantity. You can follow eight characters and enjoy a retelling of the story from their perspective. Goku’s story, of course, spans from <em>Dragon Ball Z </em>up through Super.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were walked through his first episode, where he and Piccolo fight Raditz. The cutscenes are quick and concise, so even if it’s your 20th time seeing this scene, it won’t take long. No need to wait five episodes for a spirit bomb here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even better, certain scenes will come with a literal new perspective. During the moment where Goku has Raditz in a full nelson, you can toggle to see the scene from Goku’s point of view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, this is the scene where Goku gets a hole blown through his chest by his son’s future godfather.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was honestly hilarious to see this classic yet tired scene in a new light, and a spokesperson at Bandai Namco mentioned that other iconic scenes will get a similar treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I, for one, am hoping to see POV: Ultra Instinct Goku Kamehameha surfing on Kefla’s Christmas beam. Or, seeing Goku’s perspective as he Dragon Fist punches through Hirudegarn would be gross and fascinating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To spice things up even more, there are alternate scenarios that can play out, depending on player choice, performance in combat, or even fulfilling certain conditions like using a specific finishing move.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, when Piccolo offers to team up with Goku to fight Raditz, a dialog wheel shows up where players can decline Piccolo’s help. For our preview, we saw the canon as intended, but when I play the game, I’m definitely taking Goku solo to see what happens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If I remember right, these what-if scenarios existed in some fashion in previous <em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em> games, so this isn’t completely new. But the <em>Dragon Ball</em> franchise—and its fandom—has changed a lot in the last two decades. "What if" hits different nowadays than it did 20 years ago.</p>
<p>All I know is, October 11 is going to be a difficult day this year. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/metaphor-refantazio-preview-worthy-of-atlus-35th-anniversary">Atlus’ <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a> comes out the same day as <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, and I’m torn between them. All I know is, I’m eagerly awaiting to see how the new stories in <em>Super </em>pan out here.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24177290/video-game-industry-layoffs-studio-closures-record</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2024-has-already-had-more-video-game-industry-layoffs-than-all-of-2023-%E2%80%94-and-it%E2%80%99s-only-june.900381/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177290/video-game-industry-layoffs-studio-closures-record<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="edPnbx">The video game industry <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23964448/video-game-industry-layoffs-crisis-2023">reached a grim milestone in 2023</a> as the year closed with more than 10,000 layoffs affecting programmers, quality assurance workers, sound designers, and artists — alongside countless other people and job titles. But the new year did nothing to stop the trajectory of layoffs. Just days into 2024, more than 2,000 video game industry workers were laid off from game engine maker Unity and streaming platform Twitch — and in the months that followed, that number continued to climb. Now, the industry has reached another unfortunate landmark event: Just six months into the year, the total number of video game industry layoffs in 2024 has surpassed 2023’s total of just over 10,000.</p>
<p id="b5iuA8">The numbers, for both 2023 and 2024, are conservative, community-counted estimates from <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">technical artist Farhan Noor’s layoff tracker</a> and from Polygon’s own count; there are likely well over 10,000 people laid off from the video game industry across the globe. Though the data is not exact, it tells a devastating tale — as CEOs bemoan <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171899/xbox-showcase-2024-preview-analysis">an economic downturn</a>, the workers who make games continue to suffer the consequences of leadership’s decisions. Of course, video game companies are still hiring, and some, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/en/outline/index.html">like Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/06/04/western-publishers-layoff-thousands-nintendo-hires-400-new-staff-20967164/">continue to up their employee pools</a>. Although hire-and-layoff cycles aren’t necessarily uncommon in the video game industry — <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-video-game-industry-is-booming-why-are-there-so-many-layoffs-222685">The Conversation rightly called</a> it a “long-standing structural issue” in which companies boost hiring during production, then fire workers after launch — the scope of the current situation is unprecedented.</p>
<p id="ixbGww">Even Geoff Keighley, the video game industry’s unofficial hype man, could no longer ignore reality: Keighley <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-geoff-keighley-layoff-palworld-balatro-1851527203">briefly paused the sparkle and shine of his Summer Game Fest broadcast</a> to acknowledge the layoffs and studio closures.</p>

<p id="sQjZ3p">The video game industry isn’t necessarily doing badly. Market analyst Newzoo estimated that the global video game industry would <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/video-games-in-2023-the-year-in-numbers">generate $184 billion in 2023</a>, a return to growth — albeit a small one — after a minor decline in 2022. Individually, the big companies vary: <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/a-double-take-on-take-twos-layoffs-this-week-in-business">Take-Two Interactive hasn’t been profitable lately</a>, and it saw major layoffs weeks after it spent $460 million to purchase Gearbox. Electronic Arts reported net revenue growth of 2% just months after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24086077/electronic-arts-ea-layoffs-february-2024">it laid off 670 people</a> during a company “refocusing.” At Sega, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-financials-2024-pachislots">profits are up</a>, yet Sega laid off hundreds and divested from <em>Age of Empires 4</em> studio Relic. (Sega’s good profits were, however, largely due to its pachinko business — not video game success.) </p>
<p id="9OrhPh">But despite the reality of the financials, the number of layoffs, studio closures, and divestitures cannot be understated or ignored; this decline continues to impact the health of the industry and the people who make it run. Companies are hiring, but it isn’t happening fast enough for a lot of developers. Over the past several months, Polygon has spoken to dozens of video game industry workers who’ve collectively submitted hundreds of applications, but who hear back on very few of them. </p>
<p id="ribvOv">“It feels like I’m at the bottom of a pile and they keep pouring more people on top of me,” a game designer laid off in September 2023 told Polygon. “The cynical part of it is, yes, there’s this part of me that’s like, <em>Oh man, the job market is even more rich with excellent candidates. My chances of landing a job have just become that much smaller by virtue of numbers alone.</em> I hate having that thought, but I do. The entire industry is hurting.”</p>
<p id="hrZjo0">The confusion of it all extends to Microsoft, too, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151045/microsoft-xbox-studio-closures-tango-gameworks-arkane-austin-redfall">which recently shut down three studios</a> and absorbed a fourth into another — and one of the shuttered studios, Tango Gameworks, released a critical and commercial hit for Microsoft in 2023. According to The Verge, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152137/xbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty">Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty told staff</a> that Microsoft needed more “smaller games that give [it] prestige and awards” — arguably a good description of the success of Tango Gameworks’ <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>. </p>
<p id="FI5GlW">Among the layoffs and closures, several projects have been canceled or delayed, making it inevitable that the video game release schedule will be impacted by this period. You can see the impact of the past several years already, in fact. There hasn’t been a blockbuster game from a AAA studio in 2024 — it’s been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24173629/12-new-indie-games-play-right-now">successes from a whole bunch of indie studios</a> all the way down. The weirder-than-usual schedule may be due to slowdowns related to the current industry landscape, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24172090/microsoft-xbox-showcase-june-2024-announcement-reveal">with the biggest titles all pushed out to 2025</a>, putting the biggest companies with ballooning budgets, massive teams, and expanding timelines on edge.</p>
<p id="58rU1D">Midsize and small teams are not immune. Most recently, Phoenix Labs and Singularity 6 both laid off dozens of people, while indie developer Die Gute Fabrik closed entirely.</p>
<p id="EwisjF"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24074767/video-game-industry-layoffs-explainer">Why is this happening?</a> It’s complicated. Executives often point toward a challenging economy following the COVID-19 pandemic — businesses expanded to meet demand, but realized they overinvested when it inevitably constricted. The money used to make games, wherever it’s from, is expensive to borrow, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/11/techscape-zirp-tech-boom">as inflation and interest rates continue to rise</a>. And that’s if you <em>can</em> get money from investors, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24058266/video-game-industry-funding-gap">because that money has all but dried up</a>.</p>
<p id="e8AFuR">On the player side, people are spending less money on video games, despite engagement staying stable.</p>
<p id="66G1lH">“Gaming’s long-term tailwinds haven’t changed — there are over [100 million] new gamers born every year, there are more indie successes than ever, the medium’s creative achievements continue to grow (and expand into books, film, TV) — but without material growth in players or spending, or new breakout genres… the challenges seem likely to continue,” video game investor and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24074767/video-game-industry-layoffs-explainer"><em>The Metaverse</em> author Matthew Ball</a> told Polygon in February.</p>
<p id="2z3Yfk">Players are also playing differently. People are spending a lot of time in just a few games, instead of dipping their toes into the gamut. And in response, publishers and developers are adjusting. Roblox and <em>Fortnite </em>are masters of this: People play a lot of these games and new content is always coming out, but these developers use player labor to update the game through the so-called creator ecosystem.</p>

<p id="d9Cf5u">“Companies want to sell these transformations to us as new forms of innovation — but really, what motivates a lot of this activity is the fear of having the value of one’s platform degrade,” Laine Nooney, New York University assistant professor of media and information industries, told Polygon over email in January. “There is, of course, a $1 million question lurking under all of this: if these platforms were only profitable when they were experiencing 400% engagement booms because everyone was locked indoors, are any of these businesses actually profitable at the scale their investors gambled on? What, exactly, is propping up all of these valuations?”</p>
<p id="qmzkHF">Layoffs and studio closures are the solution for executives looking to cut costs and therefore increase the numbers on a sheet of paper. What’s lost in it all is the devastating impact on the people who make games — some of whom may end up leaving the industry altogether. “There’s this existential crisis of, <em>Has any of this hard work been worth it if I can’t stay in my career?</em>” a community manager laid off in 2020 told Polygon. “I don’t want to leave games, but I feel like I have to.” </p>
<p id="buU3Dx">There’s also <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23737921/tears-of-the-kingdom-bridge-physics-game-devs-explain">a massive loss of institutional knowledge</a> at each individual studio <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23903033/bioware-severance-lawsuit-canada-dragon-age-dreadwolf">as companies drop employees</a> with long tenures and valuable skills, not to mention the cancellation of games that could have been your next favorite. It doesn’t feel like the industry’s layoffs will end soon, which puts its people in a precarious place. <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/survive-til-25-and-longer-nostradamus-report-industry-future-seriencamp-1235960372/">Like the movie industry</a>, the video game sector seems to have a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/survive-til-25-how-game-studios-are-keeping-the-lights-on-amid-the-layoffs">“survive till ’25” mentality</a> — but what happens then? There’s no doubt the impact of the past several years will bleed into 2025 and beyond. </p>

Law is weird.</p><p>The site goes on to suggest that Valve’s market dominance and “pricing restrictions” also allow it to “continue charging an excessive commission” to sell games on Steam.

<p>There’s a recent trend in competitive first-person shooters that players aren’t thrilled about. Skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) dictates precisely what type of lobby you’ll wind up in, depending on how you play. Developers believe the community wants this feature to feel like they’re doing adequately at a game. We want to improve, not be coddled. So, does The Finals have SBMM?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-the-finals-feature-skill-based-matchmaking">Does The Finals Feature Skill-Based Matchmaking?</h2>



<p>Yes, The Finals does utilize a type of SBMM to place you in a match with appropriately skilled players, as determined by an algorithm. </p>



<p>“We’ve made some changes to our skill-based matchmaking to ensure better-quality games… You should find yourselves in slightly closer matches.” This is the precise wording used by developer Embark Studios in an update in December, so we know that the competitive FPS has SBMM.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-does-sbmm-do-in-first-person-shooters">What Does SBMM Do in First-Person Shooters?</h2>



<p>The entire point of skill-based matchmaking is placing players of varying skill levels together to ensure the game feels well-balanced. For example, if you’re a low-skill player with little time to practice the game’s mechanics and movement, you’ll find yourself in a lobby with similar players. If you’re a high-skill player who streams on Twitch daily, you’ll wind up with other high-skill players.</p>



<p>Furthermore, you’ll find SBMM in most modern first-person shooters, such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. I’d bet we see a similar system, if not the same mechanic, in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, too. </p>

        <p>Follows the passing of new competition law in Japan</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Epic Games has announced that the Epic Games Store and Fortnite will be available on iOS in Japan in late 2025.</p>
<p>This follows the passing of a law in Japan, similar to the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/apple-google-under-pressure-as-eu-approves-digital-markets-act">European Union's Digital Markets Act</a>, that will allow third party app stores on the App Store.</p>
<p>Originally proposed by a government panel last June, the law won't come into effect until later next year, as reported by <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/06/12/japans-parliament-has-approved-a-law-that-will-force-third-party-app-stores-on-apple-google">Apple Insider</a>.</p>
<p>The law will require Apple and Google to allow users to download third-party app stores onto its platforms, and provide alternative payment systems.</p>
<p>"Fortnite will now return to iOS in Japan and UK next year, and EU this year," Epic CEO Tim Sweeney commented on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1800944707599728913">social media</a>. "This is a new free world, from the point of view of app developers and users."</p>
<p>The EU will be the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/apple-to-allow-alternative-app-stores-in-europe">first territory to see the Epic Games Store and Fortnite on iOS devices</a>, which will launch sometime this year and will be operated by Epic Games Sweden.</p>

<p data-characters="293" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Those looking to divine the future of the world of boutique physical game releases will soon find out what’s next for Limited Run Games. The publisher <a href="https://twitter.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1800936212900835624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced plans</a> to kick off its LRG3 2024 showcase next week, with the stream set to go live on June 20 at 11:00 a.m. PT / 2:00 p.m. ET.</p> <p data-characters="63" data-current-count="63" data-injectable="false">The showcase will be available to watch via <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/limitedrungames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LimitedRunGames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-i-wanna-get-physical" data-injectable="false"><strong>I wanna get physical</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Limited Run Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="860" data-injectable="true">While the primary focus is naturally on physical releases, the LRG3 showcases aren’t bereft of fresh game announcements. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWRytWXN4KE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last year’s event</a> brought with it some unexpected news, including the first announcement of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/after-28-years-the-original-clock-tower-is-finally-coming-west/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enhanced port</a> of Super Famicom survival horror classic <em>Clock Tower</em>. That one has WayForward partnering with Limited Run Games and using its Carbon Engine to retain the essence of the original and add new features, from a new animated opening to save states and beyond.</p>
 <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false">The 2023 showcase also revealed physical release plans for <em>Tiger Heli</em>, <em>The Making of Karateka</em>, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle </em>game soundtracks on vinyl, <em>Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 </em>on Switch, <em>Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution</em>, and more. It was also the first time we got a look at the spiritual successor to the notorious CD-i <em>Zelda </em>games, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-arzette-the-jewel-of-faramore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore</em></a>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="719" data-injectable="false">We don’t have much to go on right now other than looking forward to seeing some of their “biggest upcoming physical and digital releases.” Basically, anything could happen, so we’ll definitely be tuning in to see what Limited Run Games and the developers partnering with them are up to for the rest of this year and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="284" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There seems to be a noticeable uptick in classic cartoons and TV shows getting adapted into pixelated beat ’em ups and, man, I’m here for it. <em>GI Joe</em> is hopping into the fray as well with <em>Wrath of Cobra</em>, but my time with the demo isn’t as wrathful as I’d hoped.</p> <p data-characters="525" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">Before we start, I have a confession to make: I never watched more than a single episode of <em>GI Joe</em>. Yes, I am what you can laboriously call a ’90s kid, but I also grew up in the sticks where cable TV was a luxury. However, when I wasn’t squinting at cartoons through static, I was playing a ton of beat ’em up games. I hope that’s enough authority for some of you dyed-in-the-wool <em>Joe </em>fans. For the most part, I have enough experience in the genre to know that <em>Wrath of Cobra</em> is lacking at this stage.</p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">But I’m getting ahead of myself. As mentioned, <em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em>, coming from the team at Maple Powered Games, is looking to join the very welcome trend of “old shows your uncle liked are video game brawlers now.” <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em> brought the boys in green back to high praise, and the recently revealed <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind</em> is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-looks-like-a-retro-tastic-good-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looking spicy</a>. It makes perfect sense for Maple to want the same for the Joes.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-go-joe" data-injectable="false">Go, Joe!</h2> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true">The demo provides a nice vertical slice of the game, starring several characters of the series’ main cast. You can play as Duke, Scarlett, or the ninja Snake Eyes. Naturally, I first dove in as Snake Eyes for the very scientific reason of “ninjas are cool.” And Snake Eyes is cool, decked out in black gear and wielding a katana. </p>
 <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">The game’s combat is typical, consisting of light and strong attacks you can combo in a few ways. Three light attacks in a row is your bread-and-butter move, but you can swap the third out for a strong attack. You can hold a block button to negate seemingly all damage from fists to laser blasts, which is impressive. Tapping up or down while pressing block lets you hop in either direction. Jumping leaves you dangling in the air long enough to get a little weird, but at least it works for when you need to hop over a hole in the floor. </p>
 <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">Damage is oddly inconsistent in <em>Wrath of Cobra</em>, with the floating numbers fluctuating without any clear reason. Both the combos seem to deal similar damage regardless, with the latter (light-light-strong) ending in a flourish. Snake Eyes flings a couple ninja stars, for example, while Duke follows up with a big boot. You can’t combo if you’re not hitting an enemy.</p> <figure data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-these-beats-are-so-fresh" data-injectable="false">These beats are so fresh</h2> <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true">But since they both combos dish out the same amount of pain, I didn’t see much reason to not spam the bread-and-butter attack. You can charge the strong attack for an ultra-powerful move, but it takes so long that most enemies are able to smack you before you can pull it off. The same issue affects the light-strong combo, as the second half is a wind-up attack that leaves you open for just enough time for an enemy to bop you in the face. So, yeah, spam it is. </p>
 <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="209" data-injectable="false">There is a dash to get you across the screen, and it can be followed up with a dash attack. It can do some decent damage, and Snake Eyes can attack again quickly with a slash that should make anime fans happy.</p> <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">You also get a super move that charges up via a blue bar underneath your health. Snake Eyes sends out his wolf Timber to attack several enemies onscreen, while Duke drops a volley of explosive shells. Charging it up is fairly quick, as each defeated enemy adds to the bar. There’s really no reason not to hold onto it for a boss fight. I do wish they were a bit more impressive, though. With Duke and Snake, you can either kill a handful of enemies or a handful of enemies but slower. </p>
 <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">Combat is the core of beat ’em ups, as is indicative of the name, so I’m disappointed that <em>Wrath of Cobra</em> feels so rudimentary and stiff in the demo. Moving around an arena can be tiresome, and both Snake Eyes and Duke play almost the same. The game does give characters different stats like strength and speed, but I hardly noticed the difference. Weapons dropped from crates range from laser rifles to grenade launchers, and they can liven up the party a bit. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true">I did mention a third character, Scarlett. I played her after the guys and, thankfully, she does change things up. Her light-strong combo has her flip into the air with a vicious kick, and her air attack has her whip out a crossbow that fires an explosive bolt. Yes! Precious variety. We really had to work to get here.</p>
 <h2 id="h-tackling-the-cobra-legion" data-injectable="false">Tackling the Cobra legion</h2> <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">Enemy types is also rather typical. You have your blue Cobra soldier fodder, sometimes wielding guns, and blue Cobra soldiers with leather straps who have the power to, uh, <em>block </em>for an irritating amount of time. There is also a soldier variant who tosses bombs at a rhythm that continues knocking you back to the ground before you can react — that’s nice.</p> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="743" data-injectable="true">The game does fill the screen with plenty of enemies and it can be fun to combo multiple at once, but a lot of the time they merely crowd your character and spam attacks (so <em>that’s</em> what it feels like). Having more players in co-op should, at least, help pare down the numbers. Mini-bosses are also present, but act more like a punching bag than anything close to a threat. </p>
 <p data-characters="483" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">The actual bosses don’t fair much better. There is a boss battle at the end of both stages, one where you infiltrate a flying Cobra fortress and another in which you storm a mountain base. The Baroness stands against you in the former, where she flips around and occasionally fires her gun. It was an easy fight, but nothing compared to Dr. Mindbender at the end of the mountain stage who meandered around and attacked maybe twice. I was playing on Normal, for those wondering.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Where you runnin’? | Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="589" data-injectable="true">Visually, <em>Wrath of Cobra</em> looks fine. The game’s pixelated characters and enemies closely match its contemporaries, though the level backgrounds can use some brushing up. There’s no parallax scrolling in the mountain level, making it look more like the backdrop of a stage play.</p>
 <h2 id="h-stop-all-the-downloadin" data-injectable="false">Stop all the downloadin’</h2> <p data-characters="507" data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true">In the end, I suppose my biggest gripe is that <em>Wrath of Cobra</em> feels like a run-of-the-mill brawler buoyed by a <em>GI Joe</em> veneer. The demo didn’t include any dialogue sections, so fans of the ’80s <em>Joe </em>cartoon may be disappointed with the lack of corny one-liners. Worse, though, is that the game is mostly a bit boring. Scarlett does liven things up, so I’m hopeful for the other characters I haven’t tried yet. I also have no idea what the floppy disks enemies drop are supposed to do. </p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">The game is still in development and is set to launch this year. There may still be time for <em>Wrath of Cobra</em> to become something <em>Joe </em>fans can be happy with. But let’s admit it, the demo is probably already better than <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-g-i-joe-operation-blackout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GI Joe: Operation Blackout</a></em>.</p> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true"><em>GI Joe</em> has certainly seen its fair share of video game adaptations since the halcyon days of the 1980s, back when the cartoon arrived and the franchise arguably hit its peak. Granted, a lot of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/g-i-joe-operation-blackout-might-be-the-dash-of-nostalgia-you-need/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">those video games</a> kinda sucked. <em>Cobra Strike</em> on the Atari 2600 was the only one I played while growing up, and I still have no idea what you were supposed to do. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="745" data-injectable="true"><em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> is, so far, thankfully not gearing up to be as bad as its worst predecessors, and may ultimately stand above them all. There is still a journey ahead of it, though, so hopefully “better than the others” isn’t the only praise the game will ultimately receive. But if you’d rather find out how the game feels, you should <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2516170/GI_Joe_Wrath_of_Cobra/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">try the Steam demo </a>and decide for yourself if it’s worth the excitement. </p>
 <p data-characters="38" data-current-count="38" data-injectable="false">After all, knowing <em>is </em>half the battle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/assassins-creed-shadows-map-size-is-roughly-similar-to-origins/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=assassins-creed-shadows-map-size-is-roughly-similar-to-origins<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="339" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is the upcoming open-world title in the series, and one of the most obvious questions surrounding the game’s world is about the size of the map in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. Simon Lemay-Comtois, associate game director at Ubisoft Quebec has now given a rough idea about how big the map based in Japan will be.</p> <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true">Lemay-Comtois told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-shadows-japan-is-roughly-similar-in-size-to-egypt-in-origins/">VGC</a> in an interview that fans can expect <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> map size to be “roughly similar to <em>Origins</em>” which makes it “smaller than Valhalla in terms of territory.” He also explained that there are “some body of water around Japan” but it is not similar to how “[<em>Odyssey’s</em>] Greece was, [which was] half water.” He adds that “coastlines and lake Biwa” will be a part of the <em>Shadows</em> map.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Extended Gameplay Walkthrough | Ubisoft Forward" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjAzNpMYTxw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">Fans can also expect mountains and valleys, with some temples situated at the top of the mountains. However, most of the mountains are too steep with “impregnable bush” so it would not be possible to reach the top of many of these mountains.</p>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">The associate game director elaborated that Ubisoft decided on the map size, based on the scope of the story they wish to cover. “The story that we focus on is mostly on central Japan, so we don’t expand all the way to the entirety of Japan, so therefore we knew we had a rough idea for the territory we wanted to cover,” Lemay-Comtois said during the interview.</p> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">With important events taking place in Kyoto, Osaka, and Azuchi, it was important for the team to be “faithful to these castles” which will have “a very big footprint.”</p>

While a big open-world map sounds attractive at first, ensuring that the world feels alive and its nooks and corners are worth exploring, is a challenging task.</p> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="false"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is set to take players to 16th-century Japan with two playable protagonists. Naoe is a female shinobi whereas Yasuke is a male samurai. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will be released on November 15, 2024, for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

<p data-characters="293" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Whether you use Steam or not, anyone who’s a gamer knows it’s the biggest digital platform for PC. Valve’s storefront has been a staple in the modern gaming world for two decades, but with that power, there comes a decent amount of backlash. This time it’s from the UK.</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">According to a recent report from the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwwyj6v24xo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a>, Steam is being sued, with accusations that the Valve Corporation is “using its market dominance to overcharge 14 million people in the UK.” The company is also being accused of “rigging the market,” which in turn is taking advantage of gamers.</p> <figure data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Game Developer.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">The antitrust lawsuit is being filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, and was initiated by digital rights campaigner Vicki Shotbolt. The claim is also being backed by the Milberg London LLP law firm, with the report going on to say that Steam/Valve is being sued to the tune of £656m (around $839m, according to <a href="https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=656&amp;From=GBP&amp;To=USD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XE.com</a>).</p> <h2 id="h-we-ve-been-here-before" data-injectable="false">We’ve been here before</h2> <p data-characters="202" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">As noted by the BBC report, Shotbolt has been accusing the company of “breaking UK competition law for at least six years.” Indeed, this is not the first time the issue has come to the fore.</p>
 <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false">The fact that Steam takes a 30% commission has been a point of contention in the past. In 2022, a US judge ruled that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/u-s-judge-rules-valve-should-face-antitrust-lawsuit-over-steam-policies/">Valve should face antitrust litigation</a> for how it operates in the world of PC gaming. As well as the high commission, the company was also accused of “imposing its own conditions on how even ‘non-Steam-enabled games are sold and priced’.”</p> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="false">This is just one of a number of complaints and cases that have been filed against the platform. While Steam is many people’s go-to digital storefront, it’s worth remembering that it’s also a massive corporation that’s not above the law.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/sonic-x-shadow-generations-preview-crush-40-intensifies<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Sonic </em>games can be hit or miss, especially when it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/sonic-hedgehog-30-year-anniversary">comes to his 3D games</a>. <em>Sonic Generations</em> was a solid entry into the canon, and <em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em> is bringing it back to modern consoles with a few extras.</p>
<p>Part remaster and part expansion, <em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em> adds some Shadow levels to the game, and I got the chance to play two of them at Summer Game Fest Play Days.</p>
<p>The Shadow content felt laser-focused to appeal to fans of the old <em>Sonic Adventure</em> games here, particularly <em>Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</em>'s Team Dark campaign. It was accompanied by the kind of edgy butt rock you might expect, and I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

<p>The first level I played was Space Colony Ark, which came with a lot of gravity-defying rail grinds and high-speed platforming. Shadow can do a homing attack, though he teleports instead of zooming into an enemy. He can also launch projectiles, though that only really felt useful in a boss fight.</p>
<p>After all, a common platforming trick in 3D <em>Sonic </em>games is using the homing attack to defeat enemies and get across gaps. The projectile just didn't feel like a useful tool in a platforming-heavy level.</p>

<p>There are some big shifts though from how these games typically go that are unique to Shadow. He can use Chaos Control, which freezes the entire level for five seconds, and it's useful for avoiding large-scale hazards or to keep certain platforms in place.</p>
<p>At some point in the level, I ran into a giant tunnel where a missile was on the other end of it. In this moment, the game gave me a full charge of Chaos Control and prompted me to use it. Then it launched into an interactive cutscene, where I had to play out a quick-time event to make Shadow beat up the missile.</p>
<p>It's kind of silly, but it also fits the edgy nature that Shadow's become known and beloved(?) for. The same sort of QTEs came up during the boss battle stage, which was against the Biolizard from <em>Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</em>.</p>

<p>The boss fight is pretty standard here; first, I played defense until an opportunity opened up, and then I homed in on the weak point to do some damage. It's nothing mind blowing, but it's serviceable and offers a good space for Shadow to say some edgy one-liners.</p>
<p>One last thing that stood out to me was the last quarter of the Space Colony Ark level, which got really psychedelic. The enemy, Doom's Eye from that old <em>Shadow the Hedgehog </em>game, transforms the stage into something straight out of <em>Dr. Strange </em>or <em>Spider-Verse</em>.</p>
<p>Mechanically, it shakes out to be a high-speed platforming section where you have to time your jumps right. But visually, it was a treat to see buildings and debris collapse, multiply, and defy the laws of time and space. If there's more weird stuff like that in the other Shadow levels, I'm excited to see more.</p>

<p>If you missed out on <em>Sonic Generations</em> or are looking for your next Shadow fix before the upcoming Paramount movie, <em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em> is just around the corner. Keep an eye out for it when it launches on Oct. 25.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177114/the-imaginary-netflix-release-date-studio-ponoc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="w39MtB">Imaginary friends are having a moment. This year has already seen Blumhouse’s <em>Imaginary</em>, a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24093592/imaginary-review-horror-movie-blumhouse-teddy-bear-chauncey">not-so-great movie</a> about a murderous imaginary friend, and <em>IF</em>, an even-less-great movie about a whole world of imaginary friends, complete with a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161804/if-ending-explained-john-krasinski-nostalgia-bait">fairly toxic message about childlike wonder and fantasy</a>. And now there’s <em>The Imaginary</em>, the latest anime movie from Studio Ghibli successor Studio Ponoc, founded by Ghibli veteran Yoshiaki Nishimura shortly after Studio Ghibli <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/8/4/5966439/studio-ghibli-shutting-down-restructuring-ni-no-kuni">announced its planned shutdown in 2014</a>. Much like <em>IF</em>, <em>The Imaginary </em>centers on a world of lost imaginary friends, and on the relationship between a young girl and the friend she created. Unlike <em>IF</em>, though, it looks pretty terrific.</p>
<p id="EU2rcx"><em>The Imaginary</em> comes to Netflix on July 5 as part of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24049777/studio-ponoc-the-imaginary-netflix-release-date">an ongoing deal between Netflix and Ponoc</a>. Based on a 2014 novel by British author A.F. Harrold, and directed by Ghibli animator Yoshiyuki Momose (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/27/21271278/spirited-away-watch-best-studio-ghibli-movie"><em>Spirited Away</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/29/21275119/porco-rosso-studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki-ending"><em>Porco Rosso</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/28/21273717/take-me-home-country-roads-song-movies-studio-ghibli-whisper-of-the-heart"><em>Whisper of the Heart</em></a>), the movie follows Amanda and her imaginary friend Rudger, whose playful adventures through Amanda’s imagination are derailed by a predatory interloper. Here’s Netflix’s description:</p>
<blockquote><p id="GWVqEa">Studio Ponoc’s <em>The Imaginary</em> portrays the depths of humanity and creativity through the eyes of young Amanda and her imaginary companion, Rudger. Their fantastical adventures, launched from her attic, lead them to discover a magical world of creatures and places never before seen until a sinister force threatens to destroy their imaginary world and the friendship within it. Directed by renowned animator Yoshiyuki Momose (<em>Spirited Away</em>), <em>The Imaginary</em> is an unforgettable adventure of love, loss, and the healing power of imagination.</p></blockquote>
<p id="SPXf2S">This is Ponoc’s first feature-length film since its debut, 2017’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/12/16/13984298/studio-ghibli-director-new-movie-mary-and-the-witch-flower"><em>Mary and the Witch’s Flower</em></a>. Interim projects include the compilation movie <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/studio-ponoc/modest-heroes"><em>Modest Heroes</em></a> (featuring three short stories, one directed by Momose), and promotional material like the lovely <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22590291/olympics-2021-anime-studio-ponoc-short-tomorrows-leaves">2021 Olympics short “Tomorrow’s Leaves,”</a> also directed by Momose. <em>The Imaginary</em> was released in December 2023 in Japan. </p>

  <p id="Uo9w0n">It’s almost as if they planned it. Hot on the heels of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_LtO6Mekjk">new trailer</a> and a wave of coverage for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24176506/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-impressions-summer-game-fest"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a> out of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164106/summer-game-fest-2024">Summer Game Fest</a>, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-june-monster-hunter-rise-football-manager-2024-crusader-kings-iii-after-us-and-more/">Sony has announced</a> that <em>Wilds</em>’ predecessor, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22344620/monster-hunter-rise-review-switch"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a>, is coming to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog on June 18. Perfect timing, if you’re full of renewed excitement for hunting monsters and want to get your eye in ahead of the new game’s 2025 release.</p>
<p id="gAdPqJ">As a reminder, the Game Catalog is available to subscribers to the Extra and Premium tiers of PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p id="x7iclM"><em>Monster Hunter Rise </em>was a Nintendo Switch-first release in 2021, with Windows PC, PlayStation and Xbox versions following over the next couple of years. Its Switch origins are evident — it’s hardly the most graphically rich game, and visually it pales a little next to its predecessor <em>Monster Hunter World</em> — but it’s still as deep and engrossing as these games get. It’s on both PlayStation 4 and 5.</p>
<p id="2r3As1">Elsewhere, June’s Game Catalog selections incline toward sports and strategy, with games in the Crusader Kings, Anno, Football Manager, and... Monster Energy Supercross series. For a break from all that tinkering and competing, try the beautiful abstract platformer <em>After Us</em>. Here’s the full list of new additions, all coming on June 18.</p>
<ul>
<li id="7uuOVG">
<em>Monster Hunter Rise </em>(PS4, PS5)</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/giant-helldivers-2-update-buffs-a-ton-of-stratagems-and-weapons.900321/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177578/helldivers-2-update-notes-patch-01-000-400-stratagems-weapons-changes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="d5m6vB">Arrowhead Game Studios issued a major update for its smash Starship Troopers simulator <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24071317/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-video-game-great"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> on Thursday, featuring sweeping balance changes, a more informative Galactic War map, and the addition of invite-only lobbies.</p>
<p id="cO3fKl"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4150709804553746157?l=english">Patch 01.000.400</a> begins a change of pace at Arrowhead, which <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1800166499363012867">said earlier in the week</a> that it planned to slow down the rate at which it updated the game, delivering bigger, higher-quality patches less frequently.</p>
<p id="Es3h9u">It’s certainly a substantial update. There are some new features, but the headline for <em>Helldivers 2</em> players is probably the huge set of balance changes that (mostly) buff stratagems and weapons across the game, with the goal of increasing viability and loadout variety.</p>
<p id="pRbtC7">In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/5998312279129319530?l=english">very detailed blog post</a>, Arrowhead’s chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt — evidently making good use of the time he freed up by <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1793267296682520846">resigning as the studio’s CEO</a> — laid out the thinking behind the balance changes, going into some detail on each one. </p>
<p id="lWIsY9">“With these balance changes we wanted to buff up some of the weaker stratagems to make them more viable and add more opportunity for variety in loadouts,” Pilestedt said, adding that there were few nerfs in the patch. “We also changed a few to make them more consistent, but the goal was to keep a similar or higher power level. We are looking into the stratagems more to see if there are any other stratagems that might need some buffs or changes to make them more viable.”</p>
<p id="yOdJlQ">Some examples: Several of the game’s sentry stratagems have been made more effective (and durable), the HMG emplacement and minefields have been buffed, and Orbital strikes are now more readily available and flexible in their use to make them competitive against Eagle stratagems. On the weapons side, at least eight of the game’s firearms are buffed — including the grenade launcher, HMG, explosive crossbow, Adjudicator, and Tenderizer — and changes have been made to how <em>Helldivers 2 </em>handles recoil and rifle damage to durable body parts.</p>
<p id="eWwPjw">Away from balance changes, supply lines and attack origins were made visible on the Galactic War map to give players more information on the progress of the galactic conflict; the community will now be able to see which planet an attack is originating from, and potentially be able to stop it at its source. The option to create invite-only lobbies has been added — which anyone who plays in a set group of friends will surely welcome.</p>
<p id="XqH6lh">Super samples, an important resource in the game, now drop on difficulty level 6 (they previously only dropped at levels 7 and above). “We feel that their existence only on difficulty 7+ forced some players to play the game on a harder difficulty than they wanted to comfortably play on. We do however still want a gating of them but a less punishing one,” Arrowhead said.</p>

<h2 id="Vs11nl"><strong>Helldivers 2 update 01.000.400 patch notes</strong></h2>
<h3 id="nGDpat"><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p id="BmY0zY">For this patch, some of the major areas of interest are</p>
<ul>
<li id="fn2HbA">Visible Supply Lines &amp; Attack Origins in the Galactic War.</li>
<li id="Nf2d4s">Stratagem, weapon, planet, and enemy balancing updates.</li>
<li id="yR5sUc">Various crash fixes, stability improvements, and other updates.</li>
<li id="apsTCa">Invite-only lobby creation.</li>
<li id="EaeRSp">The right most option in the Lobby settings. Currently only localized in English. Additional languages coming in the next patch</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="NMs4Hd"><strong>Balancing</strong></h3>
<p id="TxqZTW"><strong>Goal with stratagem balance changes this patch: </strong>With these balance changes we wanted to buff up some of the weaker stratagems to make them more viable and add more possibility for variety in the loadouts. We also changed a few to make them more consistent, but the goal was to keep a similar or higher power level.We are looking into the stratagems more to see if there are any other stratagems that might need some buffs or changes to make them more viable. We also want to be better at explaining what our goals are with the changes, please see the linked blog post for more information.</p>

<p id="NrCi8D">See the blogpost for a more detailed description.</p>
<h3 id="pUQmVD"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h3>
<p id="zmqB7f"><strong>General</strong></p>
<p id="qaMmSA">Removed operation modifier AA-Defenses: Reducing the stratagem slots by 1</p>
<ul><li id="Ujk2V1">We want to look over the operation modifiers in the future. Right now there are too few of them which become repetitive and the ones we have do not create variety or promote different playstyles. For now, we removed this one because it only encourages the players to bring the best stratagems and does not promote variety</li></ul>
<p id="KRotbT">Disabled the Retrieve Essential Personnel defend event mission for the time being</p>
<ul><li id="NIfrEa">This is to give the mission the proper attention and care that it deserves as it is now deemed not fun enough or performing as we want it to.</li></ul>
<p id="QFEXTb">Super Samples</p>
<ul>
<li id="kt7l8y">Super samples now spawn on difficulty 6. The reason for this change is that we feel that their existence only on difficulty 7+ forced some players to play the game on a harder difficulty than they wanted to comfortably play on. We do however still want a gating of them but a less punishing one.</li>
<li id="h8qOFD">The SEAF Artillery stratagem is no longer blocked by stratagem jammers or Ion Storms, and is available after the mission timer ends and the destroyer leaves close orbit.</li>
<li id="aukhBA">Enemies in melee range of the gates in the Evacuate High-Value Assets mission will now attack it more consistently.</li>
<li id="0tFJmG">Added the ability to chat from in-game menus and mission loading screen.</li>
<li id="Pwjzb9">Updated some first person crosshairs to improve readability.</li>
</ul>
<p id="hQFp3r"><strong>Social</strong></p>
<ul><li id="9CHLzy">Invite-Only lobbies are now supported</li></ul>
<p id="A06ewV"><strong>Armors</strong></p>
<ul><li id="JuviNK">New armor passive Peak Physique (+50% melee damage, +30% weapon ergonomics)</li></ul>
<p id="ZKgzAU"><strong>Planets &amp; Hazards</strong></p>
<p id="Jns6rx">Spike Plant</p>
<ul>
<li id="1yg5Bu">The spike plant that appears on certain planets has been reworked.</li>
<li id="w0HW64">No longer causes bleed or stamina drain if hit by the plant explosion or spikes.</li>
<li id="uDn0r5">Now “pops” three times sending spikes everywhere, dealing increased damage.</li>
</ul>
<p id="SYLhhd">Fire Tornados</p>
<ul>
<li id="BXl6ef">Fire tornados have had their behavior changed, they should no longer feel like they actively respond to player movement, and should move more randomly.</li>
<li id="kRJZFe">While a fire tornado storm takes place, enemy vision is reduced. Player vision is unaffected.</li>
</ul>
<p id="x3yl4e">*Fire tornados being more random should result in more variance in situations players find themselves in. Tornados are significantly less likely to pile up and overlap on extraction points or objectives, and will generally be a bit easier to deal with.</p>
<p id="IFi03P">Tremors</p>
<ul>
<li id="w0HPpI">Tremors have had their spawning tweaked to be slightly more random.</li>
<li id="sTvgqv">Tremors have had their epicenter size and effect range increased.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Xtiuvy">*These changes should result in more situations where enemies away from the player get stunned, as well as reducing how consistently the player has a tremor occur next to them.</p>
<p id="eucDiS">Ion Storms</p>
<ul><li id="ViusTY">Added additional VFX for Ion Storms.</li></ul>
<p id="qDGUF5">Visibility</p>
<p id="T0ed27">A lot of planets have had their fog amounts tweaked to be a bit less harsh and dense, to provide less fatigue from constantly fighting on planets with bad visibility. We still intend there to be foggy planets with worse visibility, but the balance was a bit off.</p>
<ul>
<li id="TDYexm">Desert planets such as Erata Prime, Chort Bay, Hellmire, and similar.</li>
<li id="zhiUrq">Highlands planets such as Varylia 5, Matar Bay, Oshaune, and similar.</li>
<li id="WIoSqb">Artificial light sources have had their intensity rebalanced and reduced across the board to fix situations of lights completely blinding the player.</li>
</ul>
<p id="1eTvKu">Unexploded Hellbomb</p>
<ul><li id="95ZBaW">The unexploded malfunctioning hellbombs that can sometimes be found on planets will now explode immediately if hit with strong explosions or heavy weaponry. They will still have the same delay if hit by small arms fire or weaker attacks.</li></ul>
<p id="JVQ79i">Vegetation</p>
<ul><li id="deym20">Vegetation that’s large enough to slow the player now has an extra function. When inside the vegetation helldivers will be harder to detect, reducing their detection range by enemies. This effect stacks with other detection reducing effects such as nighttime, being crouched or prone, or things such as the scout armor passive.</li></ul>
<p id="xCEbYw"><strong>Enemies</strong></p>
<p id="FBFOpf">Acid Effect</p>
<ul><li id="kSgRXO">The acid effect applied by hunters, bug mines, etc. now allows you to sprint while under the effect and slows you by 30% instead of 50%. Duration has been increased from 3 to 4 seconds. These changes are intended to make it less punishing for players to be slowed while fighting the Terminids, This allows us to use it in more places without making the experience very punishing, for example the Bile Spewers.</li></ul>
<p id="31kt8h">Armored enemy balance</p>
<ul><li id="SVJU5h">We have toned down the amount of heavily armored enemies like Bile Titans, Chargers on higher difficulties and instead spawn more hordes of smaller enemies, the difference should be quite noticeable and the amount should be at least 30% less than before during bug breaches. We have also toned down slightly how many Hulks that spawn for the Automatons. Our intent is to ease up on the demand of anti-tank weapons and by having more of the other enemies give a better incentive for the group to bring stratagems and weapons that take care of hordes.</li></ul>
<p id="mJBrYj">Patrols</p>
<ul><li id="iSvHAa">Patrol spawning is now back to how it worked before patch 01.000.300 with some slight tweaks so that the levels are less empty if you are far away from important locations with enemy presence.</li></ul>
<p id="7EqYUL">Stunning</p>
<ul><li id="rlLTCY">Medium and large sized enemies now don’t get stunned as easily. This will not affect the stratagems that stun, and will mostly just affect how easily the Pummeler can stun larger enemies</li></ul>
<p id="kF5CVL"><strong>Terminids</strong></p>
<p id="eSi0P2">Bile Spewer and Nursing Spewer</p>
<ul>
<li id="oYKSPb">Spewers will now get slowed if they lose their legs.</li>
<li id="PujKZF">Spewer puke now applies the acid effect.</li>
<li id="J7kgyt">Spewer puke now can only damage helldivers up to 4 times per second and the helldiver cannot take damage multiple times from the same projectile. This should reduce instances where you are instantly killed by it.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Th4T2R">Bile Titan</p>
<ul>
<li id="q7CpEP">The Bile Titan’s head is slightly less durable against weaker anti-tank weapons. It’s not a large change, and will mostly matter for weapons like the railgun.</li>
<li id="nxVZVS">The Bile Titan’s puke can now only damage the helldiver 4 times per second and the helldiver cannot take damage multiple times from the same projectile. The damage is still very deadly so running through their puke is not recommended. Their puke now also has a bigger spread.</li>
</ul>
<p id="t8h4FS">Charger Behemoth</p>
<ul><li id="cA4XM4">The Charger Behemoth is now joining the battle on higher difficulties, it can now also take more damage than before. This enables us to spawn fewer chargers but still retain the difficulty.</li></ul>
<p id="kJEAhZ">Chargers</p>
<ul><li id="KEsgBV">Will now only show bleedout effects from the body if the bleedout state has started. It can still show bleedout effects from the mouth without having started the bleedout state.</li></ul>
<p id="43IGfW"><strong>Automatons</strong></p>
<p id="aay8z8">Hulk Scorcher</p>
<ul><li id="u9hofm">The Hulk’s flamethrower now does less damage and cannot damage helldivers more than 4 times per second. In addition, the helldiver cannot be damaged multiple times by the same flame projectile. This should reduce instances where you are instantly killed by it.</li></ul>
<p id="CcpKVl">Automaton Tanks</p>
<ul>
<li id="Q1Pp5C">The Tank armor value on the front has been lowered to be the same as the non-vent sections on the rear of the tank. The intent was initially that it was supposed to be more armored in the front, but the visual language did not show that.</li>
<li id="SJFLhm">The vents on the back of the Tanks turret still has the same armor value as before, but will check for explosion directions correctly now.</li>
<li id="AhBpk6">The damage of exploding automaton jump packs has been decreased by 50%, it will still set you on fire though.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lNyWTD"><strong>Galactic War</strong></h3>
<p id="xSVa0d"><strong>Introducing Supply Lines &amp; Origin of Attacks</strong></p>
<p id="PNjRkX">Supply lines were previously not shown on the Galactic War map to reduce clutter and improve readability. However based on the feedback from our community we have made an implementation showing them on the map. This solution tries to maintain the general readability while still exposing the system to players in game.</p>
<p id="uPVFU3">You will now also be able to see which planet an attack is originating from, potentially allowing for the community to stop the attack at its source. We have also updated visuals in the sector and planet info pop-ups.</p>
<h3 id="HyBWto"><strong>Fixes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li id="dmlJFT">The FAF-14 Spear targeting has been reworked and should now function much better. However it has lost the ability to target Automaton Spawners, this is not intended and will be fixed in the future.</li>
<li id="7ocMl8">Intense Heat and Extreme Cold environmental modifiers will now affect the Quasar Cannon’s reload speed and will show correctly in the HUD.</li>
<li id="qDDGZ3">Reload speed on Cold planets -2.5 sec</li>
<li id="Es1xOs">Reload speed on Hot planets +2.5 sec</li>
<li id="ILcs41">The radar pulse that detects enemies on the mini-map is now visible.</li>
<li id="QXaF9y">Most of Automatons weapons have now gotten tighter limits to how much the projectile they shoot can deviate from its weapons muzzle angle. What this means is that situations where devastators shoot sideways and similar should be fixed.</li>
<li id="lTG66j">The weapons of the Exosuits are now allowed small adjustments in the angle they fire their projectiles versus their muzzle angle. This should make their weapons more accurate.</li>
<li id="2IYoRq">Ballistic shield now collides with grenades.</li>
<li id="lrdOcW">The unblock button should no longer disappear from the social menu.</li>
<li id="sL3PzI">Blocked players can no longer join the blockers lobby through recent players.</li>

<li id="PmVqY3">Fixed some text overlap in various locations.</li>
<li id="Lho7Jj">The burning effect applied to the player when a combat walker dies is now a normal burn. The intent is that you should be able to escape it alive. But you will be on fire so hit the ground!</li>
<li id="PI12ow">The extraction shuttle can no longer take damage preventing extraction. New high grade materials directly from Super Earth R&amp;D have been utilized.</li>
<li id="Z5jgbG">On PC you can now navigate the super credits menu with “WASD” keys</li>
<li id="kQoFuK">Fixed an issue where sample count in missions were incorrectly displayed</li>

<li id="KhcA2P">The warbond menu now displays correct emote &amp; victory poses in the thumbnail.</li>
<li id="LIFbVn">War Medals cap is now displayed in the UI.</li>
<li id="0oekq5">Fixed a bug where the Helldivers armor could appear invisible for other players.</li>
<li id="AgslEg">Refined player reporting UI.</li>
<li id="bK1kAt">Fixed issue where Helldivers could be launched into the air if close to a Bile Titan or Factory Strider corpse.</li>
<li id="fon8We">Fix for Factory Strider sometimes spawned an extra model after being destroyed.</li>

<li id="qxfrj1">Defend event attack origin now visualized when hovering the planet with the defend event or the attack origin planet.</li>
<li id="IqpMVy">Implemented outlines for previously poorly readable texts.</li>
</ul>
<p id="1zcdb5"><strong>Crash Fixes</strong></p>

<p>A new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38Xzz5BQhE4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer</a> via IGN revealed Peni Parker gameplay for Marvel Rivals, the anticipated team-based superhero shooter from NetEase Games.</p>



<p>The trailer is brief, but it describes Peni Parker as a vanguard and showcases combat involving the signature SP//dr mech-suit. </p>



<p>Much of the footage features mobility such as wall climbing and dashing. However, there’s also a glimpse of a transformed SP//dr with “Spider Sweep” and “Arachno-Mine” abilities. </p>



<p>These appear to include a Naruto-style run, and further emphasize the role Peni Parker will have in Marvel Rivals.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the roster, Peni Parker is a fan favorite character. However, they likely gained mainstream popularity following the animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse film.</p>



<p>During PlayStation’s recent State of Play, NetEase Games confirmed Marvel Rivals is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-announced-for-console-at-playstation-state-of-play/">coming to consoles</a>. It will also boast a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-characters-are-in-marvel-rivals-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive roster of characters</a> for players to choose from, including Spider-Man, Storm, and more.</p>



<p>Early on, NetEase Games faced some backlash after restricting criticism during the closed alpha test. However, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-team-apologizes-for-restricting-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devs later apologized</a>, and the game is building plenty of renewed hype ahead of the closed beta.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals does not currently have a release window or date. It will be available on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>The Finals continues expanding its roster of multiplayer maps, weapons, and tools for competitive players to duke it out with. In this season of The Finals, we’ll explore Kyoto 1568, a brand-new map with bamboo forests, temples, and iconic architecture to traverse. But if you want to know more, then let’s delve into The Finals Season 3 patch notes!</p>

<figure><p>
<iframe title="THE FINALS | Season 3 | Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8kWYWa3Jv2Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

</li>

</ul>







<h2 id="h-full-the-finals-season-3-patch-notes">Full The Finals Season 3 Patch Notes</h2>



<blockquote>
<h2 id="h-balance-changes">Balance Changes</h2>



<h3 id="h-builds">Builds</h3>



<p>Light</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased health regeneration delay from 10 seconds to 7 seconds, meaning health starts regenerating sooner. Does not apply in the Terminal Attack game mode</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev Note: The dynamics of Terminal Attack mode, with its limited health regen up to 100 HP, means that the Light archetype with their precise and high DPS weapons, can be very effective later in rounds. For that reason, we’ve chosen not to extend these new health regen rules to Terminal Attack for now. We’ll monitor these changes closely, as the season develops and adjust where needed.</p>



<p>Medium</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased health regeneration delay from 10 seconds to 9 seconds, meaning health starts regenerating sooner. Does not apply in Terminal Attack game mode</li>



<li>Healing Beam has been replaced with Guardian Turret as the default Medium Specialization</li>



<li>Defibrillator has been replaced with Glitch Trap as one of the default Medium Gadgets<br>Dev note: As Terminal Attack becomes the Ranked mode, we want to make sure new players have a loadout that works in all modes. Healing-focused items are still available.</li>
</ul>



<p>Specializations</p>



<p>Goo Gun</p>



<ul>
<li>Getting hit by goo will now block movement Specializations such as Evasive Dash, except Charge ‘n Slam</li>
</ul>



<p>Winch Claw</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased max range from 20m to 17m</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Increased cooldown when missing targets from 6s to 7s</li>



<li>Increased cooldown when hitting carriables or teammate’s statues from 6s to 7s</li>



<li>Increased cooldown when hitting players, Cashout Stations or Terminals from 12s to 14s</li>
</ul>



<p>Gadgets</p>



<p>Breach Charge</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased ammo count from 1 to 2</li>



<li>Increased cooldown from 15s to 26s</li>



<li>Decreased player damage from 200 to 80</li>
</ul>



<p>Data Reshaper</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased ammo count from 1 to 2</li>



<li>Increased cooldown from 15s to 26s</li>
</ul>



<p>Gas Grenade</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased radius from 4.5m to 5m</li>
</ul>



<p>Glitch Trap – ITEM REWORK</p>



<ul>
<li>Glitch trap is no longer a proximity detonation device</li>



<li>Glitch trap now has a line-of-sight application. If an enemy player stands within range and in line-of-sight to the trap it will attach a tether to them. Tethered players have the Glitch effect applied to them, preventing them from using Specializations and Gadgets, and disrupting their HUD. Players will need to break the line of sight to the trap, destroy it, or get out of range of it, to remove the effect.</li>
</ul>



<p>Goo Grenade</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased the size of the goo wall created by the Goo Grenade from 2×4 to 2×6</li>



<li>Getting hit by goo will now block Evasive Dash and Grapple Hook</li>
</ul>



<p>Guardian Turret</p>



<ul>
<li>The cooldown regeneration on the Guardian Turret now starts when the turret is destroyed, not when it is deployed.</li>



<li>Added the ability for players to remotely destroy their Guardian Turret, allowing them to trigger the cooldown if their turret is not nearby. This is done by equipping the Specialization again and holding an interaction for a brief duration.</li>
</ul>



<p>Motion Sensor – ITEM REWORK</p>



<ul>
<li>Motion Sensor no longer sends out impulses at regular intervals for detection</li>



<li>Motion Sensor now has line-of-sight application. If an enemy player stands within range and in line-of-sight to the device, the sensor will attach a tether to them. Tethered players will be scanned by the Motion Sensor, allowing friendly players to see them through walls. Players will need to break the line of sight to the sensor or destroy it, to remove the scanning effect.</li>
</ul>



<p>Smoke Grenade</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased ammo count from 2 to 3</li>



<li>Increased cooldown from 45s to 50s</li>
</ul>



<p>Sonar Grenade</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased detection radius from 10m to 15m</li>
</ul>



<p>Stun Gun</p>



<ul>
<li>Players are now unable to use Specializations while the Glitch status is applied</li>
</ul>



<p>Weapons</p>



<p>93R</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated recoil pattern, making the weapon much easier to control and hopefully making headshots easier to achieve</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev Note: To increase viability for the 93R, we’ve made it considerably more precise but lowered the DPS slightly to offset that. Our aim is to make the weapon more effective when using precise aim and going for headshots, and we’ll continue to monitor its performance following these changes.</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased fire rate from 260 RPM to 210 RPM</li>



<li>Decreased automatic recoil recovery duration from 0.72s to 0.7s, making the weapon easier to control</li>



<li>Increased the damage fall-off start distance from 15m to 23m, meaning the weapon will do max damage at longer ranges now</li>



<li>Increased the damage fall-off max distance from 22m to 35m, increasing the range before damage fall-off is fully applied</li>



<li>Decreased the damage fall-off multiplier at max range from 65% to 45%, meaning the weapon will do less damage at longer ranges now</li>
</ul>



<p>CL-40</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased damage from 110 to 93</li>



<li>Increased fire rate from 250 RPM to 275 RPM</li>



<li>Decreased pump-action duration from 0.7s to 0.65s</li>



<li>Decreased self-damage multiplier from 1 to 0.75, reducing how much damage the grenades do to the player using them</li>
</ul>



<p>FAMAS</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased automatic recoil recovery duration from 1s to 0.8s, making the weapon easier to control</li>



<li>Decreased the delay before recoil recovery begins from 0.8s to 0.7s, making the weapon easier to control</li>



<li>Increased damage from 23 to 24</li>
</ul>



<p>KS-23</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased pump-action duration from 0.7s to 0.575s</li>
</ul>



<p>Lewis Gun</p>



<ul>
<li>Further updated recoil pattern, making the weapon easier to control for the first few bullets in the sequence, but making the weapon recoil more the longer the trigger is held</li>



<li>Decreased damage from 25 to 22</li>
</ul>



<p>LH1</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated firing animation, which should make the weapon easier to use</li>



<li>Decreased fire rate from 300 RPM to 280 RPM</li>



<li>Decreased bullet dispersion when crouching and standing still, making the weapon more precise</li>



<li>Increased player damage from 49 to 52</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev Note: Overall the effective damage of the LH1 should remain roughly the same, but it should now be easier to use, less nauseating, and more precise when standing still, as well as incentivizing headshots. The lower RPM should help make it feel distinct and make it easier to maintain targets in sights</p>



<p>M60</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated recoil pattern, making the weapon recoil more during the first few bullets, but making it easier to control for the rest of the sequence</li>



<li>Decreased damage from 22 to 19</li>
</ul>



<p>SH1900</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased damage from 10 to 13 per pellet</li>



<li>Decreased fire rate from 100 RPM to 80 RPM</li>



<li>Increased the size of the pellet dispersion pattern, making the weapon less accurate at range</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev Note: We’ve wanted for a while to make the SH1900 more effective against Heavies without making it oppressive for Lights. With higher pellet dispersion the SH1900 is now optimized for very close range only, which has allowed us to buff the damage, hopefully making Heavies easier to kill. This is a change we will be monitoring closely to measure its impact</p>



<p>Sledgehammer</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated camera animation when sprinting, which should reduce motion sickness for some players</li>
</ul>



<p>Throwing Knives</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased projectile speed of primary attacks from 16.5 m/s to 14.75 m/s</li>



<li>Decreased projectile air drag of primary attacks from 7.5 to 7, allowing the projectile to travel farther</li>



<li>Increased projectile speed of secondary attacks from 13.8 m/s to 18.5 m/s</li>



<li>Increased projectile air drag of secondary attacks from 4 to 5.5, increasing the speed at which the projectile slows down<br>Dev note: Our last balance changes on the Throwing Knives pushed them in the right direction but ultimately felt too powerful, changing the weapon’s character too much. We have here dialed down the velocity of the regular projectiles so that leading your throws becomes a requirement again, but not to the same extent as before the last changes. Similarly we sped up the secondary projectiles so that they become a more long-range option with a focus on timing rather than leading.</li>
</ul>



<p>V9S</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased damage from 36 to 37</li>
</ul>



<p>Carriables</p>



<p>Glitch Barrel</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased radius from 6m to 3.5m</li>
</ul>



<p>Goo Barrel</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased the size of the goo wall created by the Goo Barrel from 2×6 to 2×4</li>
</ul>



<p>Toxic Gas Barrel</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased radius from 5m to 3.5m</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev note: Overall, we’ve seen a low use of certain gadgets when there are overlapping items available in the arena. Therefore, we are swapping some values around on arena items and gadgets to ensure the latter have a stronger effect while still ensuring players can adapt to different situations even when out of gadget charges.</p>



<p>Game Modes</p>



<p>Terminal Attack</p>



<ul>
<li>Players must now interact with the terminal in order to deliver the decryption key, rather than throwing it into the terminal</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev Note:</p>



<p>It was too easy for attacking teams to rush a terminal and throw in the key to start a decryption, without needing to secure the objective first. This change should force attacking teams to seize the area around the terminal to start decrypting.</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased the throw distance of the decryption key now that it cannot be thrown into the terminal, allowing for more passing of the key</li>



<li>Added ‘warm-up zones’ to Terminal Attack, limiting where players can move to for the first 25 seconds of the match. This provides more time for the defending team to prepare</li>



<li>Carriable canisters now respawn at the start of each round in Terminal Attack, making sure each team gets access to the same amount each round</li>



<li>The specific combinations of team and objective spawn locations in Ranked Terminal Attack now occur in the same sequence in both halves of the match, making matches fairer.</li>



<li>Added unique names to all terminal locations in the arenas, these are displayed when looking at the terminals and in the lobby screen</li>



<li>Added a player count notification when contestants are eliminated</li>



<li>Added icons in the arena and to the HUD to highlight eliminated teammates and their location</li>



<li>Added Ranked Terminal Attack mode with a best of 13, first to 7 format</li>



<li>In Ranked Terminal Attack, if the match starts without full teams, the game will be automatically abandoned early and players will return to the queue. This is done to ensure games start in a good condition</li>



<li>Added a half-time reset of destruction to Ranked Terminal Attack mode, so that both teams have the same starting conditions as their opponents when defending or attacking</li>
</ul>



<p>Maps</p>



<p>Las Vegas</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated Terminal Attack spawn scenarios</li>
</ul>



<p>Monaco</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated Terminal Attack spawn scenarios</li>
</ul>



<p>Skyway Stadium</p>



<ul>
<li>Added to the Terminal Attack map pool</li>



<li>Tweaked the Power Shift related spawn points inside the Construction area so that players are better oriented toward the platform’s path</li>
</ul>



<p>SYS$Horizon</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated Terminal Attack spawn scenarios</li>
</ul>



<p>Content and Bug Fixes</p>



<p>Animation</p>



<ul>
<li>Added inspect animation for carriables</li>



<li>Blocked left arm gestures in third-person when riding ziplines</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where bullets clipped with the mesh when reloading XP-54</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the first throw animation on Gateway sometimes didn’t play properly</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where an immediate melee attack was not properly displayed after using a Mesh Shield</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where your contestant was not centered during the “tunnel run” match intro</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where melee animations were sometimes not shown when exiting the emote camera.<br>Dev Note: This was a purely visual error, melee timings were not affected by this bug.</li>
</ul>



<p>Audio</p>



<ul>
<li>The audience has been reworked and will now be more responsive to various events in the arena and cheer for the contestants</li>
</ul>



<p>Career Rank</p>



<ul>
<li>Added 10 new Career ranks with associated rewards<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Fire Propagation</p>



<ul>
<li>Added a distance limit to all fire sources, to prevent fire from spreading infinitely</li>
</ul>



<p>Gameplay</p>



<ul>
<li>Made it possible to skip the elimination camera after a short while and go directly to spectating teammates</li>
</ul>



<p>Game Modes</p>



<ul>
<li>Added a dedicated Spectator slot to Private Matches</li>



<li>Updated available game modes
<ul>
<li>“Terminal Attack” remains as a base mode</li>



<li>Added “Terminal Attack – Ranked”</li>



<li>Added “Terminal Attack – Tutorial”</li>



<li>Added “World Tour” mode</li>



<li>Removed “Single Round Cashout”</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Added more info to the game summary screen
<ul>
<li>Team name</li>



<li>Game mode</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Disabled the Deathmatch game show event as it was not working as intended</li>
</ul>



<p>Maps</p>



<p>New map: Kyoto</p>



<ul>
<li>Available in Quick Cash, Tournaments, Bank It, Power Shift and Terminal Attack game modes</li>



<li>Features shallow water that will slow the player’s movement speed, making it risky to cross large open bodies of water</li>



<li>Shoji paper walls that allow bullets to pass through easily</li>
</ul>



<p>Settings</p>



<ul>
<li>New volume slider in settings for changing the commentator dialogue volume separately from the in-world dialogue</li>
</ul>



<p>Store</p>



<ul>
<li>Enabled single-item purchases for bundles from previous seasons<br></li>
</ul>



<p>UI</p>



<ul>
<li>Text chat added to the PC version</li>



<li>Player cards
<ul>
<li>Added background customization</li>



<li>Added badges that display your rank in World Tour and Ranked Mode</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Updated the end-of-round screen to include player cards and to highlight stats</li>



<li>Added a shortcut button to the Play menu from the Career screen</li>



<li>Added a cooldown for the event log when spamming pings and voice lines</li>



<li>Updated event log messages for various types of pings
<ul>
<li>Updated event log messages related to Cashouts and Terminals to be consistent and always include information about which objective was pinged</li>



<li>Added missing event log messages for certain pings on various objectives, like Cashboxes and Decryption Keys</li>



<li>“Attacking here” ping wheel action was renamed to “Attack here”</li>



<li>“Defending here” ping wheel action was renamed to “Defend here”</li>



<li>Updated “Attack Here” and “Defend Here” event log messages to match the character voice lines</li>

</ul>
</li>



<li>It’s now possible to zoom in on pets in the Battle Pass and Store screens</li>



<li>Temporarily disabled the re-rolling of Daily Contracts</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev Note: We currently have a very small pool of Daily Contracts and felt it was unfair for players to spend VRs to re-roll a contract to only keep getting limited options in return. We hope to introduce more Contracts during the season and then re-enable re-rolls at some point when they offer more value.</p>



<p>Weapons</p>



<ul>
<li>Added Season 3 items
<ul>
<li>Thermal Bore – Light Gadget</li>

<li>All Grenades</li>



<li>All Mines</li>



<li>C4</li>



<li>Breach Charge</li>



<li>APS Turret</li>



<li>Barricade</li>



<li>Motion Sensor</li>



<li>Thermal Vision</li>



<li>Riot Shield</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Added 1 more progression level, with associated reward, for all weapons and gadgets. All item based Specializations (e.g. Guardian Turret or Goo Gun) also received this.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where equipped charms would disappear when standing close to walls</li>



<li>Fixed emote animation exploit with the Sword which allowed multiple lunches in rapid succession.</li>
</ul>



<p>Dev note: While these moves discovered by players increase the effectiveness of some melee weapons, they are ultimately exploits and ones that most players find hard to use or unintuitive, adding confusion to the game (especially for those on the receiving end).</p>



<p>Security</p>



<ul>
<li>Updates to our Aimbot detection system</li>



<li>In-game reporting feedback – We’ll inform players who report unfair gameplay when appropriate actions have been taken.</li>
</ul>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-40335">League of Legends</a>' controversial <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-gets-450-bundle-fans-react-with-shock/1100-6523790/" data-ref-id="1100-6523790">Immortalized Legend Ahri skin</a> is available now for those with a spare $250-$450 to spend, and fans are still not happy about it. Game director Pu "PuPuLasers" Liu spoke with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/league-of-legends/ahri-skin-backlash-justified" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a> about the backlash, saying it's "justified."</p><p>"People were very upset about it, not just a little," Liu acknowledged in the interview, adding, "I also think it's kind of justified." He noted that with the game being over a decade old, League of Legends players are "used to everything living under a certain price point." </p><p>Despite that, he defended the expensive bundle, explaining that products priced at this level were a rarity, and even taking some time to explain how they fit in with League of Legends' monetization strategy as a whole.</p><p>"These kind of products are designed for a very small percentage of our players to be able to purchase and flex," he explained. "In terms of what role [they're] going to play in our portfolio of skin products moving forward, it will continue [to be] a very small minority. I think last year we probably released over 130 or 140 skins, of which less than a handful were priced at that point. I would expect it to continue to be a minority rather than a majority."</p><p>"It's very important that we share with our players the situation that League of Legends is in," Liu continued. "It's a game that's competitively orientated; we only sell cosmetics, we don't want anything that even infringes upon pay-to-win or pay-for-power. As a consequence of that, the vast majority of our players play League, watch esports, enjoy all the content, cinematics, and music for $0. The majority of our revenue comes from a small, single digit percentage of players; it's just the reality that the hobbyist deep spenders are a disproportionate amount of business viability."</p><p>Liu shared some of the thought that went into pricing the premium-level bundle "on the morality side," comparing it to Warhammer fans who spend $200 a month on their hobby. He added that Riot prefers to target cosmetic items to those players who already have a history of spending in-game, rather than trying to convert players who aren't currently spending.</p><p>"We believe there's such a thing as having too high a percentage of your players spending on a free-to-play game," Liu adds. "That means your free-to-play experience relative to your paid experience is not good enough."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRM0yZvVn2E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hRM0yZvVn2E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The contentious skin, Immortalized Legend Ahri, was revealed as part of the Hall of Legends event created this year to honor Faker, one of the game's most successful and well-known esports players. The skin can only be bought in a bundle--either the $250 Immortalized Legend collection, which includes the skin along with a number of unique VFX and extra cosmetic items, or the $450 Signature Legend collection, which adds even more exclusive effects to the skin, more exclusive cosmetics, and a handful of chromas for other Faker-related skins.</p><p>The skin is so extravagant--with unique voice overs, animations, and other visual effects--that Riot created a new skin tier called Transcendent just to describe it. The previous highest tier is called Ultimate, with each Ultimate skin costing around $23.</p><p>The high price of the new skin celebrating one of the game's most popular figures <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-gets-450-bundle-fans-react-with-shock/1100-6523790/" data-ref-id="1100-6523790">didn't sit right with fans</a>, with many promising to permaban Ahri in retaliation, and others pointing out the irony of releasing a $450 skin to celebrate a player who famously doesn't use skins in matches.</p><p>The Hall of Legends event is live now and will run until July 8.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/warframe-best-railjack-build/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=warframe-best-railjack-build<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="211" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Getting the best build for your Railjack in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe</a> </em>is quite the task. The play style and flow are quite different from the base game, but you still may want to get it up to snuff with the rest of your arsenal.</p> <p data-characters="117" data-current-count="117" data-injectable="false">With that said, here is an entire breakdown of what you should be looking for to get a strong and versatile Railjack.</p> <h2 id="h-best-railjack-build-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">Best Railjack build in <em>Warframe</em></h2> <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">To start off, let’s go with the Plexus mod setup you will want to use for your ship. We’ll go through the three sections as well, including the Integrated, Battle, and Tactical setups on the top of the mod menu:</p> <p data-characters="10" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false"><strong>Integrated</strong></p> <p data-characters="21" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false"><strong>Aura:</strong> Ironclad Matrix</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"> <li>Forward Artillery</li> <li>Conic Nozzle</li> <li>Hyperstrike</li> <li>Ion Burn</li> <li>Ordnance Cheap Shot</li> <li>Section Density</li> <li>Predator</li> <li>Waveband Disruptor</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="132" data-current-count="132" data-injectable="false">With this setup, your Railjack will have great survivability, turret damage output, and sustainable Ordnance. Now for the abilities:</p> <p data-characters="6" data-current-count="138" data-injectable="false"><strong>Battle</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false"> <li>Blackout Pulse</li> <li>Tether</li> <li>Seeker Volley</li> </ul> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">To properly play this setup, you want to use Blackout Pulse to disable Crewships. Use Tether on low and mid-level fighters to group them up and deal huge damage to them. At all levels, you can use Seeker Volley to destroy multiple fighters.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="34" data-current-count="34" data-injectable="false">And finally for the Tactical mods:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="154" data-injectable="false"> <li>Form Up</li> <li>Battle Stations</li> <li>Void Cloak</li> </ul> <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">You won’t be using these too often unless you find yourself in a dire situation. They’re nice to have in a pinch, but the cooldowns are very long, so use them in rotations.</p> <p data-characters="58" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">Now for the ship’s actual components, use the following:</p> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Shield:</strong> Zetki Shield Array MKIII</li> <li><strong>Engines: </strong>Vidar Engines MKIII</li> <li><strong>Plating:</strong> Vidar Plating MKIII</li> <li><strong>Reactor:</strong> Vidar Reactor MKIII</li> <li><strong>Turret 1:</strong> Vidar Pulsar MKIII</li> <li><strong>Turret 2: </strong>Zetki Vort MKIII</li> <li><strong>Ordnance:</strong> Tycho Seeker MKIII</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">While it may take a while to get every variant of these to MKII, it’s what you should be building up to. The setup is boosted by the earlier mod setup, making your Railjack have great damage output, survivability, and mobility. It’s also a versatile setup against all enemy types.</p> <figure data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-the-best-crew-for-railjack" data-injectable="false">The best crew for Railjack</h2> <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">Finally, for your crew. If you’re a solo player and need a few extra hands on deck, you can recruit new members from Ticker <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-is-fortuna-in-warframe-how-to-access-fortuna-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Fortuna</a>. It’ll cost a hefty amount of resources to hire the top-notch ones, but the payoff is worth it.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">Look for crew members who have high stats in Repair, Combat, and Endurance. They can do all the stuff to maintain the Railjack on the inside as you can easily clear fighters and Crewships at the cockpit.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">Finally, equip all of your crew with AoE weapons with strong mod setups. For some reason, they don’t run out of ammo and can destroy high-level enemies with ease, especially if their Combat stat is high.</p> <p data-characters="108" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">Of course, to also achieve this, you want to upgrade your Intrinsics with Railjack to all tens if you can.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-reveal-gets-seal-of-approval-from-the-series-creator/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-reveal-gets-seal-of-approval-from-the-series-creator<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="360" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dragon-age-the-veilguards-gameplay-needs-to-win-back-fans-as-reveal-trailer-reaches-198000-youtube-dislikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than popular reveal trailer</a> for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> at the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-at-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, the subsequent gameplay demonstration on June 11 was BioWare’s chance to win favour back with displeased fans. At the very least, <em>Dragon Age</em> series creator David Gaider likes what he saw, saying the development team have done a “great job.”</p> <p data-characters="592" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="true">Gaider, who served as lead writer on the <em>Dragon Age</em> games until he left BioWare in 2016 (making <em>The Veilguard</em> the first entry without his involvement), recently got round to watching <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-shows-varrics-tragic-loss-of-bianca-at-solas-hands-and-eldritch-demons-from-the-veil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the gameplay trailer</a> for himself and shared his thoughts <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1801050867975819542" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitter</a>. Said trailer covers a curated segment of an early mission, with new player character Rook and their party doing some exploring and combat before confronting antagonist Solas. It honestly does a better job of demonstrating what <em>The Veilguard</em> is like than its weirdly <em>Borderlands</em>-esque reveal trailer; something Gaider also feels is the case.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Overall, I'd say this made for a better introduction than the reveal trailer. We see some story, and tone-wise it feels a lot darker and more DA. Like I said, trailers often need to be taken with a grain of salt, and my impression is that many fans are relieved. Which is great.</p>— David Gaider (@davidgaider) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidgaider/status/1801051741741289831?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="794" data-injectable="true">“I’d say this made for a better introduction than the reveal trailer,” says Gaider. “We see some story, and tone-wise it feels a lot darker and more <em>Dragon Age</em>. Like I said, trailers often need to be taken with a grain of salt, and my impression is that many fans are relieved. Which is great.” He does admit the new art style will take some getting used to, but acknowledges this is an aspect that has “changed every game so that’s nothing new.”</p>
 <p data-characters="570" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true">However, Gaider has nothing but praise for the environments, calling them “utterly gorgeous,” adding, “To see the sprawl of Minrathous—wow. I wish we could have done this for Kirkwall or even Val Royeaux.” He wraps his thoughts up by saying it was lovely to see Solas again and the teases for <em>The Veilguard</em>‘s story have left him eager to see how things will play out: “Could probably chatter about the implications for days, and how this aligns (or doesn’t) with where I thought the story would go… but I won’t.”</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">While Gaider has plenty of nice things to say about <em>The Veilguard</em>, it does seem like the gameplay has done little to appease a significant number of fans. At the time of writing, the gameplay trailer on YouTube has approximately 199,000 dislikes compared to 72,000 likes. Although that’s still a better split compared to the reveal trailer, which now sits at 234,000 dislikes and 41,000 likes.</p> <p data-characters="591" data-current-count="990" data-injectable="false">The fact that the gameplay trailer has scored more likes than the reveal trailer does suggest it’s won over some people, and <a href="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1800543538314371194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a quick glance at Twitter</a> shows, amid the harsher criticisms, there are plenty of fans still excited for <em>The Veilguard</em>‘s launch later this year. Early previews of another demo shown to press at Summer Game Fest have been mostly positive too. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/preview-dragon-age-the-veilguard-could-be-bioware-back-at-its-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> called it “exciting, and engaging and made us desperate to see the next 50 to 100 hours of game,” while <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dragon-age-veilguard-sgf-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inverse</a> said it’s “hopeful the secret sauce of <em>Dragon Age</em> is still there.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ps5-update-will-let-you-use-discord-directly-from-your-console.900276/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-ps5-update-discord-integration<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is rolling out a new PS5 update that will let you access Discord directly from your console, bypassing the need to use the smartphone or desktop apps.</p>
<p>An update adding Discord support to PS5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-ps5-beta-adds-discord-support-and-more">entered beta in February last year</a> before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-system-update-adds-1440p-vrr-support-discord-chat-and-more-today">released in full the following month</a>, but it's not currently possible to start a Discord chat without using the app on a mobile device or desktop PC.</p>
<p>That's all about to change, though. When the new PS5 update hits your area (which Sony says should happen "over the coming weeks"), you'll be able to open up Discord within your PS5's Game Base, then select a server and a voice channel and you'll be set.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-update-discord-2024-banner.jpg?itok=al5df1OZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-update-discord-2024-banner.jpg?itok=AmGrRTKT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Direct Discord integration is coming to PS5 at last.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll still need to ensure that your PlayStation and Discord accounts are linked (which also means you'll need a Discord account if you don't already have one), and you'll need to have updated your PS5, of course.</p>
<p>This isn't the only feature that's rolling out for PS5 in the coming weeks, either. Sony has also revealed that the Profile Share function is coming starting from next week.</p>
<p>This feature allows you to generate a link to your PlayStation profile, which you can then share to any social media or messaging app, allowing others to view your profile at a glance without needing to search for you.</p>
<p>It'll be as easy as selecting the "Share Profile" feature from the PS app or your console, upon which a link will be generated. Anyone who opens the link and who isn't already your PlayStation friend will be prompted to add you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-discord-update-2024-profile-share.jpg?itok=OQNDeaWW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-discord-update-2024-profile-share.jpg?itok=6Bl5uOeY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll soon be able to send a quick link containing your PlayStation profile to others.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, Sony hasn't provided any specific dates regarding when you can expect these features to arrive on your PS5.</p>
<p>Make sure you keep an eye out for any prompts to update your system software as and when you get them.</p>

			<p>It's time for a new GeForce NOW Thursday, the weekly moment when NVIDIA updates its cloud platform's library. Starting today, GFN users can look forward to sailing the seven seas in Rare's Sea of Thieves.</p>
<p>The shared world pirate game may have struggled a bit at launch, but it has long since found its groove, and its recent debut on PlayStation 5 only <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-most-downloaded-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded</a> the already healthy player base.</p>

An all-new world event pits pirates against Flameheart's mighty flagship to seize it, raining fire on their enemies with a skeleton crew at their command and reaping the rewards of their dastardly deeds. Season 13 is coming to Sea of Thieves on July 25 as a free update to all players on Xbox, PC, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>The second major addition to GeForce NOW is Bodycam, a first-person tactical shooter game released last week <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2406770/Bodycam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>. The two-man team at Reissad Studio plans a full launch in a few years.</p>
<p>Lastly, Gameloft's free-to-play arcade racing game Disney Speedstorm and indie farming/life simulator SunnySide are the remaining new GeForce NOW games for this week-</p>
<p>● SunnySide (New release on Steam, June 14)<br>
● Disney Speedstorm (Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass)<br>
● Sea of Thieves (Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass)<br>
● Bodycam (Steam)</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-preview-fansll-go-bananas</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-preview-fansll-go-bananas.900270/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-preview-fansll-go-bananas<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No doubt <em>Super</em>&nbsp;<em>Monkey Ball&nbsp;</em>fans are chomping at the bit for&nbsp;<em>Banana Rumble.&nbsp;</em>After all, it's been too many years since we've had a mainline entry in the series. Fret not, for&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>&nbsp;is coming this year.</p>
<p>Me, I've only played the first, but I remember enjoying it immensely as a kid. Playing&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>&nbsp;at Summer Game Fest brought me right back to my childhood, and it's just a pleasure to see the series retains its charm.</p>


<p>One notable difference between this entry and its predecessors is the inclusion of 16-player online multiplayer. Bots are optional too, and since I didn't have 15 other players with me, that's what I opted for. With that many monkeys, things go apeshit.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the Switch took a severe hit in performance with all 16 players on screen, and that is the only platform&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>&nbsp;is launching on. Aliasing is very visible and FPS also takes a dive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not a deal breaker and is still playable, but combined with Nintendo Switch Online, I'm hoping things get ironed out before launch. Playing with that many NPCs is a fun time at least, and there are a plethora of game modes to choose from.</p>

<p>One, for instance, is a race akin to&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>, wonky physics and all. Getting to the finish line with a bunch of monkeys bumping into each other is pure chaos, and it's sure to be a lot of fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each game mode sports a selection of different maps to keep things feeling fresh. All of these really take advantage of <i>Super Monkey Ball</i>s' physics, so this ensured maximum chaos. The AI, by the way, was kind of ruthless, but that made it more fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did get properly thrashed in Banana Hunt mode, tasking players with collecting the most bananas in an arena-like level full of twists and turns. Keep in mind, your fun will be determined by how tolerant you are of lower frame rates and performance dips.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Go on an Adventure in&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em></h2>
<p>Players can express themselves with a plethora of characters. There are costumes, too, and I'm all about cosmetics. This will help differentiate multiplayer a bit and did I mention you can literally play as Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried out the story mode, and as one might expect, it plays just like the others. Hey, I'm not complaining. The thrill of going as fast as possible to the finish and optimizing your run is what kept me hooked during the demo.</p>
<p>At its core,&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball</em>&nbsp;is a simple concept and it executes that concept well.&nbsp;<em>Banana Rumble</em>&nbsp;will certainly entice players with frantic multiplayer action and its story mode. It might even be the catalyst that gets me back into the series after so long.</p>

  <p id="fgAi7V">2025 is looking increasingly — overwhelmingly — crowded with games. </p>
<p id="4vZyie">Which makes sense, as 2024 may be remembered as a weird and uneven year for video games. People who play games are sticking with older, enduringly popular games like <em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Counter-Strike</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>, just as game developers are reckoning with longer development windows, swelling budgets, and a volatile games industry <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24074767/video-game-industry-layoffs-explainer">rattled by layoffs</a>.</p>
<p id="WW6L8y">That’s not to say that 2024 has been a <em>bad</em> year for video games. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24078256/best-video-games-2024">Quite the opposite</a>. Fans of the medium have enjoyed great stuff, ranging from AAA scale (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24122319/dragons-dogma-2-review"><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24071317/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-video-game-great"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24047430/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review-pc-xbox-ps5"><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24033589/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft-switch"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em></a>) to indie-level surprises (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24084564/balatro-review-poker-game-deck-building-roguelite"><em>Balatro</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24079882/pacific-drive-review-steam-pc-playstation-5"><em>Pacific Drive</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24057437/palworld-review-pokemon-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-survival"><em>Palworld</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24151337/animal-well-review-pc-ps5-switch"><em>Animal Well</em></a>). This year’s best games have captured the hearts of millions with their fresh takes on classic genres.</p>
<p id="qg7ZsU">But 2024 will still probably feel like a downer — barring any major, still-to-be-announced releases in the back half of the year — compared to the deluge that’s coming in 2025. Next year alone, Nintendo and Rockstar Games will attempt to repeat the successes of their most popular products of all time: the Nintendo Switch and <em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em>.</p>
<p id="hpOHhH">A <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/23899504/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-power-name-games">new Nintendo console</a> and the long-awaited release of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23952805/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leaks-release-date-trailer"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a> might be enough on their own to carry a full year for many video game fans. Nintendo is said to be working hard to bolster its library of next-generation games for the “Switch 2,” reportedly delaying its new hardware to ensure that its customers have great software to play next year. In other words, expect a long list of great new Nintendo games in 2025 to land alongside the new console.</p>
<p id="1Lp4Gg">As for <em>GTA 6</em>, after racking up 200 million sales of 2013’s <em>GTA 5</em>, it’s safe to say that Rockstar will have a built-in audience expecting a huge, generational shift in play — and that audience will doubtless get dozens, if not hundreds, of hours of playtime.</p>

<p id="pRQ8Ep">Here’s what else those big releases will be competing with in 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li id="peRwYS">
<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24084157/pokemon-z-a-legends-2025-trailer-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em></a>, the new Pokémon Legends adventure that will tide fans over until the 10th generation of the franchise</li>
<li id="79bssm">
<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24168014/monster-hunter-wilds-open-world-gameplay-trailer-state-of-play"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a>, a massive, open-world leveling-up of Capcom’s growing Monster Hunter franchise</li>
<li id="s7IfP8">
<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24173863/civilization-7-trailer-release-date-firaxis"><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization 7</em></a>, the next entry in the grand strategy series that die-hards play for thousands of hours</li>
<li id="f2KFVk">
<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23755219/new-fable-xbox-release-date-playground-games"><em>Fable</em></a>, the first new Fable game in more than 14 years</li>
<li id="qdTaOL">
<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171213/doom-dark-ages-microsoft-xbox-games-showcase-sequel"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a>, the return of the Doom Slayer and hopefully a slight course-correction for the shooter</li>
<li id="klyaOc">
<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24106916/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-captain-america-black-panther-game"><em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em></a>, the cinematic Black Panther-versus-Captain America World War II game from Uncharted game designer Amy Hennig’s new studio</li>
<li id="O5aSVa">

</ul>
<p id="S4RCy9">This past week of not-E3 and Summer Game Fest events has seen even more 2025 games announced: Koei Tecmo’s <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, Compulsion Games’ <em>South of Midnight</em>, <em>Mixtape</em>, <em>Wuchang Fallen Feathers</em>, <em>Cuffbust</em>, <em>Cairn</em>, and others. They’ll join previously announced games <em>Paralives</em>, <em>Little Nightmares 3</em>, and <em>Slay the Spire 2</em> in an incredibly crowded year that will only get more crowded.</p>
<p id="OxwXZF">These games, which could consume hundreds of hours of our spare time, are merely the ones we know about. And they’ll be competing for our attention amid <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24144727/2024-movie-release-schedule-blockbusters-2025-box-office">one of the busiest movie release calendars</a> of the past decade — all of which amounts to a very expensive and competitive year for entertainment. There are far worse problems to have. </p>

Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/13/ps5-players-will-soon-be-able-to-join-discord-voice-chat-directly-from-their-console/?sf273538206=1">update</a> will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wJQehypOr5E" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>To start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center's Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you'd like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you're set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This upcoming update will arrive more than two years after <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/01/31/link-your-playstation-account-to-discord-starting-today">PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord</a> back in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-helldivers-2-update-brings-massive-stratagem-balance-changes.900240/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-helldivers-2-update-stratagem-changes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>has received a huge update that contains a ton of stratagem balance changes, which, as chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt explains, are intended to add extra loadout variety opportunities.</p>
<p>Pilestedt, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo">stepped down as developer Arrowhead's CEO</a> last month, says that this update is aiming to "buff up some of the weaker stratagems" and alter some for consistency.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/5998312279129319530" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam post</a> accompanying the new update's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4150709804553746157" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, Pilestedt goes into great detail regarding the changes made to each stratagem, with options like the Machine Gun Sentry, the HMG Emplacement, and the Anti-Personnel Minefield receiving buffs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-update-stratagem-turret.jpg?itok=2W1-EXgr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-update-stratagem-turret.jpg?itok=a-HiM1Kx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>has received a big update that brings huge changes to some of the game's stratagems.</figcaption></figure><p>The changes are extensive, so we won't list them all here, but highlights include an increase in durability across all Sentry emplacements in order to make them less vulnerable to "small arms fire".</p>
<p>If you're a user of the Orbital Precision Strike (which, according to Pilestedt, pretty much everyone is), you'll be pleased to know it's had its call-in time and cooldown reduced.</p>
<p>Two Eagle stratagems, the Rocket Pods and the Strafing Run, have also been buffed, with the Rocket Pods gaining changes to make them "more consistent" in dealing with heavily-armored enemies and the Strafing Run getting extra armor penetration.</p>
<p>It's not just stratagems, either; several special weapons have also received buffs, including the Grenade Launcher, the Heavy Machine Gun, and the standard Machine Gun.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-update-stratagem-crossbow.jpg?itok=gZY7jZYR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-update-stratagem-crossbow.jpg?itok=IHLJLiCO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>weapons, including the explosive crossbow, have received buffs in the new update.</figcaption></figure><p>Standard weapons like the Purifier, the Explosive Crossbow, and the Eruptor have also seen changes in this patch, so if you've been using any of those weapons regularly, you'll likely notice a change.</p>
<p>It seems that Pilestedt and Arrowhead are intent on bringing bigger and more meaningful changes to&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>. Last week, the developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond">announced a shakeup</a> to the way Warbonds would work, with less frequent and more impactful Warbonds planned for the future.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>right now on PC and PlayStation 5. Make sure to read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy">review of the game</a> if you want to know whether this bug-splattering shooter is worth your time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/flock-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes we all need an injection of pure happiness in our lives, and <em>Flock </em>is here to envelope us all in its wholesome embrace. It's a simple, low-stakes game about cruising through the sky cataloguing funny little animals that can then join you flock and fly with you.</p>
<p>The premise of the game is simple. You're on to see your aunt Jane, who is studying the strange creatures you'll see in the world and needs help cataloguing them all. Of course, you agree to help and then you're off.</p>
<p>Flight is a simple joy. You don't need to worry about height, as the game will adjust that automatically for you. You can just zoom about where you'd like, sitting on perches or not littered throughout the world if you wish.</p>

<p>The simple movement that takes you to beautiful vistas combined with the calming, upbeat music create a meditative mood. Happily, I was lulled into a reverie that was utterly relaxing -- a welcome relief at the end of many appointments at Summer Game Fest.</p>
<p>What helps pull you in is the vibrancy of the world, which I would defy anyone to not be charmed thoroughly. The locales are popping with color, varied, and full&nbsp;of interestingly shaped flora and fauna at every turn.</p>
<p>That unique approach is applied to everything you come across, even with the interesting names of the creatures themselves. There are many different families of creatures you come across, each of which have fun names like gleebs, sprugs, burbots, and more.</p>
<p>When you do come across a new creature, you can observe its mannerisms and habits to try to learn a little about it. Once you're confident, you can prompt your aunt Jane that you've found a new creature to catalogue.</p>

<p>If its a new family of creature you've never seen, she'll reveal its kind to you. But, its up to you to find the specific type in that species. She'll give you a list with brief descriptions like, "Three vertical stripes" or "nose is a different color from the rest of its body."</p>
<p>Some of the descriptions are about their actions, too. If one zips and darts around, or always tries to fly into the brush or hide, that may be a clue for you to correctly identify what you've found.</p>
<p>After they're identified, and you have a whistle for that animal family, you can try to entice it to join your flock. That is simply done by following them and timing a call from your bird, who mimics the whistle, towards the creature. Do it correctly, or multiple times if needed, and it will fly around with you.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that is more or less <em>Flock</em>. There is a wide world to uncover full of interesting creatures and characters as you learn all about the region. It's simple, cozy fun. And one of the best parts is you can do it with a friend, as <em>Flock </em>will have a co-op mode if you wish.</p>
<p>If you're just wanting to sink into a meditative state and meet cute creatures, one of which you'll no doubt fall in love with, <em>Flock</em> is perfect for you.</p>
<hr><p>Flock <em>was previewed for about 30 minutes at Summer Game Fest Play Days. It releases July 16th, 2024 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</em></p>
