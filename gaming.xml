<p>The CEO of Twitch, Dan Clancy, posted a recent update on the site’s blog page detailing some <strong>major </strong>changes coming to the platform. One of the most monumental points was around monetisation, which has long been a sticking point for streamers on the site.</p>



<p>It was revealed that in 2025, <strong>every streamer, </strong>regardless of their status, will be able to earn via subscriptions and ‘bits’. These features have, until now, been locked behind the ‘Affiliate’ wall, but this year, <strong>everyone </strong>will be able to take advantage of them.</p>



<p>Does this devalue becoming a Twitch Affiliate? Perhaps.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changes-are-a-coming">Changes Are A-Coming</h2>



<p>In the post on the <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2025/02/27/what-s-next-in-2025-an-open-letter-from-twitch-ceo-dan-clancy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch Blog</a>, the company’s CEO wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want you to be able to take advantage of our monetization tools, whether you’re just getting your community started, or have been on Twitch for a while.</p>



<ul>
<li>In 2025, we’re excited to open up monetization tools—subscriptions and bits—to most streamers, from day one. This will allow creators, regardless of their status, to grow their communities and start building earnings through direct patronage.</li>



<li>We’re also introducing an option, which will allow all streamers to use their earnings on purchases within Twitch.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>If you join Twitch <strong>right now</strong>, you’ll need to become an Affiliate streamer before you can accept bits and subscriptions. That means you need to jump through a few hoops first.</p>



<p>These new terms will mean that anyone can earn on Twitch regardless of their follower count or stream time.</p>



<p>The ‘most streamers’ clause is interesting, though. I’d assume it’s put there to suggest that streamers with infractions on their account can’t take advantage of these features.</p>



<p>Twitch is also preparing to offer more sponsorship opportunities to creators, and in 2025, the site wants to run more promotional events. </p>



<p>This year, it’s all about collaboration, and that’s reflected in pending changes being made to ‘Shared’ features, such as Hype Trains, Stream Together, and Shared Chat. It was also revealed in the blog post that mobile viewing is getting an upgrade, enhancing the options available to users consuming content via a mobile device.</p>



<p>Furthermore, <strong>clips </strong>will be upgraded, with creators unlocking more ways to edit and share their content as quickly as possible across a diversified portfolio of platforms.</p>



<p>I hate to admit it, but this update is a massive W for Twitch.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-steam-next-fest-demos-to-play-right-now.1121292/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/10-steam-next-fest-february-2025-demos-to-play-right-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam Next Fest is the all-digital event where you can play literally hundreds of demos on Steam for free, so you can find your next favorite game. But with so many demos to play and the event lasting only a week – it ends 3 March at 10am PT – it can be daunting to know where to start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's team has been downloading and trying out the best and most interesting demos, which we've compiled below. It's not a comprehensive list of everything to check out, more a starter list of demos you should definitely go to first and, if you want more, well, there’s hundreds of others to choose from.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Train 2</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I still play the Monster Train daily challenges on my phone to this day, and I’d just finished one when the announcement of Monster Train 2 and the demo popped up. So I was pre-grabbed on the roguelike, deck-building fantasy game series. But so far I like what I’m seeing of the sequel. It’s not a radical reinvention of the idea, but it’s layering on some new stuff like equipment and room cards where you have to upgrade on the fly moore, and building resources like Dragon’s Hoard and Valor are different enough from the original that it’s refreshing - <em>Dan Stapleton</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dark Deity 2</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like Fire Emblem, you’ll like Dark Deity 2. As somebody who enjoyed the first game despite its rough edges, the second game is shaping up to be a significant improvement with even more room for player creativity. The standout feature is build flexibility, as each unit has four mid-tier classes and an additional four high-level classes. My personal favorite unit is the hunter who is given the choice of an orangutan, toad, lion, or hyena to fight with them. The story has you playing as the children of the first game's protagonist. I really enjoyed the sibling dynamic, along with Alden, a returning character acting as the chill uncle. The demo also showed off some early choices with branching paths which is promising for a more memorable and replayable adventure. - <em>Eric Zalewski</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Out of Sight</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In Out of Sight you play as Sophie, a blind girl who’s trapped in a mansion and trying to escape. You see through the eyes of her teddy bear and you have to guide her through environmental puzzles to help her escape the building, while avoiding the adults who want to keep her there. Sophie carries the teddy (you) much of the time, giving you a first-person perspective as you play. But in order to climb or manipulate items in the environment, she has to set you down, shifting the perspective to third-person. It’s a clever trick that adds to the off-kilter vibes of this creepy puzzle game that reminds me of parts of Resident Evil 7, but with enough new ideas to make it worth a look. - <em>Chris Reed</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monaco 2</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can never rely on your friends, but sometimes that’s what makes hanging out with them so fun and funny. That’s a big reason why Monaco 2 is so much fun. It’s a co-op stealth experience where you’ll have to rely on your teammates to not get caught, and react accordingly when they inevitably do. Monaco 2 isn’t the next live service phenomenon, but when you’re itching for a new game to get deep into with your friends, it’ll be there for you. It’s got fun and often hilarious stealth mechanics, tons of ways to strategize, and an aesthetic that brings everything together. It’s definitely not one you’ll be able to enjoy on your own though, but who’d want to do a heist on their own anyway? - <em>Tyler Robertson</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: Humble Games is the publisher of Monaco 2 and shares a parent company with IGN.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Everhood 2</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Everhood, released in 2021, was an incredible indie mashup of Undertale, Yume Nikki, and Guitar Hero that asked players to meditate on life, death, and existence in a trippy, mushroom-filled world. I loved it, and it had absolutely no business getting a sequel. Yet here we are, and I'm already hooked by whatever the heck is going on in Everhood 2. The dance battles are better than ever, its wacky cast has me constantly on my toes, and I have no idea where this wild story about soul weapons and mind dragons is going but I am absolutely buckled up for the ride. - <em>Rebekah Valentine</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Haste: Broken Worlds</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for the speed of a 3D Sonic game with stylings that seem to have come out of a Dreamcast launch title, Haste: Broken Worlds might just be it. The main gameplay mechanic revolves around landing perfectly on the back edge of slopes in order to fill a meter that lets you give yourself more hangtime. From the short amount of time I’ve spent with it, it seems to nail the “just barely hanging on” nature of the good “Fast Games.” The soundtrack is also a bop. - <em>Aaron Barrier</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Skin Deep</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Skin Deep is the perfect marriage of immersive problem solving and slapstick humor that has you protecting a spaceship crew of cats from strange pirates who also want you very dead. Much of Skin Deep's charm comes from just rolling with the absurdity of it all: Don't think too hard about why you're the lone unarmed human insurance agent on a ship of tiny felines, or why the pirates' heads slowly float back to respawn points when killed. How you defeat the armed pirates while sneaking through the sandbox-like spaceships is entirely up to you, but what really makes Skin Deep stand out is how all of your tools can also be hazards. Pepper can stun foes, but also gives away your position if you sneeze. Windows into space can be broken to create new entry points, but leave glass shards to slice up your feet. The dynamic of what helps you can also hurt you sets the stage for some truly hilarious bouts of unintended consequences that I cannot get enough of. - <em>Brendan Graeber</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Teenage Mutant Ninja Tturtles: Tactical Takedown </h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who LOVES the Turtles, but has never fully fallen in love with a turn-based tactics game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown has the sauce. Fast, fluid actions taking place right as you hit the button make it feel less turn-based than other tactical games, and the potential of its story makes it one of my most anticipated games of the moment. Some fonts and UI elements need some work, but that’s why it’s a demo! That’s what Next Fest is for. - <em>Tyler Robertson</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Promise Mascot Agency</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Described as an “open-world narrative adventure mascot management simulator, “Promise Mascot Agency feels like a Yakuza side-quest, partly because it kind of is. Playing as an exiled Yakuza member named Michi, your new job is to help a cutesy mascot agency find financial success by hiring different mascots and sending them out to events where they can be as cute as they can be, bring in more fans, and unlock more jobs. It’s a very madcap kind of game combining the numbers go up stonks feeling of a management sim, but with the sense of humor and style of cult-Japanese games like Yakuza and No More Heroes. - <em>Matt Kim</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Labyrinth of the Demon King</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m a sucker for old-school, first-person dungeon crawlers and Labyrinth of the Demon King certainly scratches that itch. Developed by a lone developer, Labyrinth of the Demon King is a throwback to games like King’s Field, but with splashes of J-Horror like Siren thrown in for good measure. As a lowly footsoldier to your lord, you decide to enter the nightmarish realm of the demon king to try and avenge your master. But the hellish monsters and a nightmarish version of feudal Japan might not be worth your honor. Great visuals, classic vibes, and a lot of style makes this one demo to keep an eye on. - <em>Matt Kim</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And those are just some of the demos we’re playing at this Steam Next Fest. Check out the games on our list and, again, there are hundreds of game demos currently available to play on Steam Next Fest until March 3. So let us know in the comments which demos you're playing.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fans-are-frantically-trying-to-work-out-how-pokemon-legends-z-a-connects-to-other-pokemon-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">This morning, we got our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-trailer-reveals-rooftop-running-gameplay-and-late-2025-release-window">first lengthy look at Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, Game Freak's futuristic new Pokémon game set in the familiar Pokémon X/Y locale of Lumiose City. But even though we saw a number of features such as running on rooftops, changes to battling, and Mega Evolution, we still have loads of questions about exactly when Pokémon Legends Z-A takes place relative to the other Pokémon games, and which returning characters we might see in Lumiose City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's where the community comes in.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, while most Pokémon games tend to be standalone affairs, the first Pokémon Legends game dealt with time travel. It also heavily featured familiar locations from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl set hundreds of years in the past, numerous characters who were clearly ancestors of characters in other Pokémon games...or, in one case, just a Pokémon Black and White character plopped down in the past by Pokémon God themself. With that in mind, fans are eager to know when Pokémon Legends: Z-A is set, if there are any time traveling shenanigans, and if we'll see any familiar faces in Lumiose City whenever this game takes place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the last few hours since the trailer debuted, fans have been combing it for connections to other Pokémon games...and they've found a surprising amount. The most obvious connection is the presence of AZ, which is called out directly in the trailer. AZ is a character who was granted immortality 3000 years before the events of Pokémon X and Y, so it makes sense that regardless of when Z-A takes place, he'd be around. In Z-A, he seems to run a hotel in Lumiose City, and he looks a lot happier now that he's been reunited with his beloved Floette.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are far more subtle ties. One of my favorites that fans have discovered is the potential presence of the Looker Bureau in Z-A. Looker is a fan-favorite detective character who first appeared in Pokémon Black and White, but has since made appearances in several other games. Several eagle-eyed fans have noticed that one office shown in the trailer looks nearly identical to the Looker Bureau in past games, which they believe confirms the presence of either Looker or his protege Emma in Z-A's Lumiose City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another really bonkers theory floating around is the connection between the two main protagonists and some other familiar faces. Now that we've got full character art for the protagonists of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, fans have pointed out that the two characters look suspiciously similar to Ethan and Lyra, the two player characters from Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver. This has led to speculation that Legends: Z-A may feature a time traveling scenario where Ethan and Lyra are pulled out of their version of Johto and sent to a futuristic Lumiose.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But another interesting, protagonist-related theory suggests a different origin story. Fans are also pointing out that the pair look somewhat similar to Kalos Pokémon scientist Professor Sycamore and the mother of the protagonist in Pokémon X and Y, named Grace. This one, especially the bit involving Grace, is a bit more of a stretch, but still a super interesting theory in light of past plays on ancestry in the Legends series:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's most curious about all those theories is that some version of them could all be true at the same time. As multiple fans have pointed out, we have absolutely no idea where Pokémon Legends Z-A takes place in the timeline. Pokémon games over the years have had a very loosely sequential timeline that also occasionally involves alternate realities (don't worry about it, it's fine) and, again as in the case of Legends: Arceus, time travel back to the past. If AZ is running a hotel, fans are pointing out that this game must take place after the events of Pokémon X and Y.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's possible that could mean hundreds of years after, given AZ's immortality. The greatest evidence of this is Lumiose City itself, which is ginormous and futuristic in Legends Z-A in a way that would have taken decades to build. If that's true and this takes place that far into the future, that would mean the two protagonists, as well as whoever is running the Looker Bureau, are descedents several generations down the line of the characters they resemble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is one more character that fans are obsessing over, and that's this creepy woman from the key art:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This woman looks like a Hex Maniac, which was a trainer type that appeared in Pokémon X and Y. While a number of returning trainer types have been spotted in today's news, this girl is particularly interesting due to an ongoing Pokémon mystery: the Ghost Girl.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Pokémon X and Y, there's a <a href="https://gaming-urban-legends.fandom.com/wiki/Lumiose_City_Ghost" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scene you can view</a> by entering a building in Lumiose City and heading up to the second floor. When you arrive, the lights will flash, the music will stop, and a Hex Maniac will appear behind you, glide toward the front of the screen, and say, "No, you're not the one," before disappearing. It's a weird, creepy scene that to this day has absolutely no explanation. This girl is never seen again, does not unlock anything, and just appears to be a strange easter egg. So because that Hex Maniac has remained a mystery for years, the sight of one creepily wandering around Lumiose in Legends Z-A has a lot of fans hopeful this thread might finally lead somewhere. After all, if she's a ghost, she could have continued to haunt that building for hundreds of years...</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the coming days, there will almost certainly be more new discoveries, easter eggs, and connections found throughout all the footage, art, and news we received today about Pokémon Legends: Z-A. We have a bit of a wait for the game's release, as it's currently planned for "late 2025." But in the meantime at least we have lots of new information to obsess over. You can catch up on everything announced at today's Pokémon Presents, including Legends Z-A news, mobile gaming news, Pokemon Champions, and more, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <p>
PUBG creator Brendan Greene's "ambitious" three-game project will soon get underway with the launch of Prologue: Go Wayback! in "Q2" this year. And in the run up to the survival game's release, Greene's studio PlayerUnknown Productions has shared a first trailer.
</p>
<p>
For some backstory, Greene <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-creator-announces-three-game-plan-one-of-which-has-a-demo-that-you-can-play-today">unveiled his studio's three-game plan last December</a>, explaining that each project would build on the last, culminating in something called Project Artemis. That started with last year's early access release of Preface: Undiscovered World - not one of Greene's three planned games, but rather an "immersive tech demo" giving players the opportunity to explore an Earth-scale world generated by machine learning agents in real-time.
</p>
<p>
With that project now out in the wild, things are about to step up a notch with the release of Prologue: Go Wayback!. This builds on last year's tech demo by introducing more traditional survival game elements into a wilderness generated by machine learning - enabling "millions" of maps and delivering what's being described as a self-contained "single-player open-world emergent game within the survival genre".

<figcaption>Prologue: Go Wayback! trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI6H_WNHUlU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Go Wayback! promises a world where "emergent systems subtly influence gameplay", with players needing to brave unpredictable weather and ever-changing landscapes as they attempt to reach the Weather Station and call for help to escape the wilderness. To that end, they'll begin with an old, weathered map and essential tools, utilising resources, foraging for food, making repairs, and building shelters to improve their chances of survival.
</p>
<p>
"No one will tell you where to go or how to survive," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/">explains the blurb on Steam</a>. "There are no hand-holding mechanics, no fixed paths, and no guarantees. It's a world where preparation is key, and improvisation is often the difference between life and death." That's about all the information shared so far, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI6H_WNHUlU">Prologue: Go Wayback!'s first trailer</a>, which you can see above, gives an approximate idea of how it'll all unfold as players explore vast expanses of autumnal forests, crystalline lakes, and looming mountains in snow, ice, and driving rain.
</p>
<p>
Go Wayback! is the first of three standalone games that'll serve as "building blocks" for the studio's ultimate project, Artemis - "a massive multiplayer sandbox experience that leverages the technological advancements tested" across earlier games. "After Prologue, two more games are planned for release in the coming years," Greene explained previously, "each addressing critical technical challenges that will bring the studio closer to the final product."

			<p>Hazelight Studios has revealed the Split Fiction PC requirements, and from what has been released, they are incredibly reasonable, in both the minimum requirements and the recommended requirements. This announcement has been<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2001120/view/500565775095959232?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted on Steam</a> in the events tab, where it dives into Split Fiction being Steam Deck Verified from the outset, as well as its PC requirements and having Steam Native support. In Hazelight's <a href="https://wccftech.com/split-fiction-includes-crossplay-and-expanded-friends-pass/">previous post</a>, it spoke about cross-play being available, as well as the tried and true Friend's Pass being back and available for Split Fiction, too.</p>
<p>"We have worked tirelessly to ensure the game will be optimized on launch, completing hours and hours of performance and compatibility testing with the goal of making sure that the game will run as smoothly as possible, even on PC's configured at the game's listed minimum system requirements," said Hazelight Studios.</p>
<p>Along with the PC's system requirements, the post also announced that Split Fiction will be receiving Ultrawide Resolution Support from the outset, with support for 21:9 and 32:9 resolutions.</p>
<p>Below is a table that states both the minimum PC requirements and the recommended requirements for Split Fiction, so you know what to expect from your experience with the game.</p>

The ideal place to start is Metroid Prime Remastered, an overhauled version of the original GameCube classic rebuilt with gorgeous graphics and modernized controls on Switch. Metroid Prime Remastered released in February 2023, but it still almost always sells for its $40 MSRP.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, MercurySteam has revealed the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mercurysteams-new-dark-fantasy-arpg-blades-of-fire-to-be-unveiled-this-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Blades of Fire game. From its looks, it will be a single player action/adventure in the vein of Sony Santa Monica's God of War titles. The protagonist is one Aran de Lira, the firstborn of the King's Ward. In this fantasy world, the newly crowned Queen Nerea has cast a spell that turns steel to stone. Only her army of abominations wields the divine metal against which other blades shatter.</p>
<p>As Aran, players must find forging scrolls, develop the main character's blacksmithing skills, and craft weapons to suit their favorite fighting style. The chosen weapon family and the materials used while forging it will affect characteristics such as weight, length, durability, penetration, and edge quality.</p>
<p>There are seven different weapon families in Blades of Fire, as well as over thirty unique Forge Scrolls, allowing for a great number of combinations. Picking the right weapon for the job, depending on the enemy's armor, will be critical. The developers promise a unique and challenging combat system that allows players to target specific parts of the enemy's body.</p>
<p>On his journey to liberate the land, Aran won't be alone. His companion, Adso, will be crucial to your adventure as he speaks the ancient language of the Forgers. He'll also provide helpful tips on how to defeat enemies by analyzing them and making notes in his chronicles. It sounds like players will need the info since Blades of Fire features over fifty enemy types, including the Queen's guards, creatures, undead, and more. Each enemy has its own unique attack style, weapon and armor. Throughout the story, Aran and Adso will explore epic environments, including huge castles and labyrinthine palaces.</p>
<p>505 Games president Neil Ralley said:</p>
<p><em>MercurySteam’s pedigree for creating unique and beloved games is just one of the many reasons we’re thrilled to partner with them on Blades of Fire. Their gaming system that transforms weapons customization into an outstanding combat experience is astounding, as is their commitment to telling the best story possible. We can’t wait to share it with the world.</em></p>
<p>The good news is that the game isn't far off at all. It's set to launch on May 22 for PC (via the Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game's pricing is technically $59.99, though there is a 10% pre-order discount. Additionally, pre-order customers will get two in-game armors for Aran as well as additional forging materials.</p>

<p>With 317,522 players at its peak, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870990/Mecha_BREAK_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mecha BREAK demo</a> is greatly outpacing the other demos available during this Next Fest. The third-person multiplayer mecha shooter has become very popular with the international audience, though critical reactions have been mixed. Many players enjoy the mix of games modes and the numerous customization options, but the demo still fields a Mostly Negative review on Steam, which is attributed primarily to the game’s monetization and server issues. Insider Gaming was invited to the NA offices of developer Amazing Seasun Games, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-interview-mecha-break-creator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got to talk to Mecha BREAK’s creator about the game’s development</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-fellowship">Fellowship</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/">Fellowship</a>, which has peaked at 16,721 players, is billed as a game for players that want to jump right into end-game dungeon content like you’d see in World of Warcraft. The game features “endlessly scaling dungeon runs,” and end-game WoW fans will feel right at home with the game’s user interface and group finder mechanic. Groups will need to kill packs of enemies to unlock the boss fight, which will feature unique mechanics and challenges that a team will need to overcome.</p>



<h3 id="h-among-us-3d">Among Us 3D</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Among Us 3D</a>, which has peaked at 6,729 players, is exactly what you think it is if you’ve ever seen Among Us before. 3D uses the same first-person perspective as Among Us VR, but without the need of a VR headset. Among Us 3D features built-in proximity chat, meaning you won’t need to use other programs to manually activate it. There will also be some new and returning mini-game tasks. The game will launch with the Skeld II and Polus Point maps from Among Us VR.</p>



<h3 id="h-roadcraft">RoadCraft</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3456580/RoadCraft_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RoadCraft</a>, which peaked at 12,559 players, is developed by the same Saber Interactive who made Snowunner and Mudrunner. But rather than operating a vehicle offroad, RoadCraft tasks you with rebuilding and reconstructing areas that have been ravaged by natural disasters. In RoadCraft, players will be able to unlock over 40 vehicles to help them replace roads, bridges, and other critical pieces of infrastructure.</p>



<p>While these demos may be the most popular, there are still dozens, it not hundreds of playable demos you should try during this Next Fest. And don’t fret, because <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-2025-steam-sales-schedule-revealed-by-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another Next Fest is coming in October</a>.</p>

            <p>
Some 35 years after experiencing an overwhelming sense of mild disappointment thanks to Ocean Software's Terminator 2: Judgment Day on the ZX Spectrum 128K, I get to tell you a new video game adaptation of James Cameron's movie hit is coming this September. But despite the furious march of technology, this one's also going to be 2D.
</p>
<p>
Terminator 2D: No Fate is the work of developer Bitmap Bureau - the studio behind the likes of Xeno Crisis and 88 Heroes - and it's looking to deliver some good old-fashioned arcade-style side-scrolling action inspired by "iconic scenes from Terminator 2" and "original scenarios".
</p>
<p>
Its obvious selling point is its rather strikingly animated pixel art, but - as per Terminator 2D's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkMFYMG3QLw">announcement trailer</a> - it's also got a bit where you get to wander around a bar as the T-800, smashing up baddies while unabashedly in the nude. As it happens though, the T-800 (nude or otherwise) is just one of several characters you can play as in Terminator 2D.
</p>

<p>
<a aria-label="Terminator™ 2D: NO FATE - Announcement Trailer (PS5®, PS4®, Nintendo Switch™, Xbox &amp; PC)" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IkMFYMG3QLw?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Bitmap Bureau say the T-800 has been designed to emphasise his weight and power, with moves including a devastating shoulder barge. And while he's slower than Terminator 2D's other playable characters - Sarah Conner and John Connor - he also has high durability. As for Sarah, she's agile and reactive, excelling at melee combat with a sliding attack. However, she can also deploy her laser sight, locking her in place but significantly boosting damage.
</p>

<p>
John Connor, meanwhile, will be playable as an adult during the game's Future War missions. He's not as agile as Sarah, but can evade attacks with a tactical roll, and also emphasises mid-to-long-range combat, with a plasma rifle, pipe bombs, and three ammo types. And, of course, the iconic T-1000 is back as the game's main adversary - liquid metal abilities included.
</p>
<p>
Terminator 2D: No Fate - which also includes multiple endings, leaving players to decide humanity's future - launches for PlayStation 5, Playstation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam and Epic) on 5th September.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-users-worry-good-next-fest-games-are-being-crowded-out-by-ai-slop-but-the-real-problem-is-more-complicated.1121196/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/steam-next-fest-demos-ai-disclosure-algorithm<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Next Fest</a> is in full swing, and the hopefully-washed masses are once again partaking of more demos than any one person can reasonably get through. This time around, though, there’s been a recurring theme to people’s hours spent sifting diamonds from the rough: AI art.&nbsp;</p><p>Across sites like Twitter and Bluesky, numerous Steam users have turned up their noses at unpleasant surprises populating their Next Fest feeds.</p><p>"Looking at the Steam Next Fest page, it's so tiresome how many games with AI art there are," The CRPG Book editor Felipe Pepe <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/felipepepe.bsky.social/post/3lixnwg5v4k2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Bluesky. "And it's always the same crap: generic anime girl, grimdark fantasy guy with those 'Balenciaga AI' faces, or obviously fake pixel art."</p><p>"This Steam Next Fest has probably been the most AI infested ever, and it’s all been voice acting and art more than anything," a modder who goes by the handle Manny Calavera <a href="https://x.com/MannyCalavera12/status/1894395629377655087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Twitter. "It's rough."</p><p>This week, Valve also added a mandatory AI disclosure feature to game’s Steam pages, which made headlines when it forced Activision to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-admits-its-using-generative-ai-to-help-develop-some-in-game-assets-and-suddenly-all-those-poorly-made-calling-cards-make-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally admit</a> something that players have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long suspected</a>: AI cosmetics are becoming an increasingly prolific part of the world’s most popular first-person shooter. A quick perusal of Steam Next Fest’s “Simulation” section, especially, yields many similar disclosures from games with titles like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3533100/Wrap_House_Simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wrap House Simulator</em></a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3544050/Gun_Factory_Simulator_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gun Factory Simulator</em></a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3371650/Car_Mechanic_Workshop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Car Mechanic Workshop</em></a>. Other games sport art that looks <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3458190/Pocket_Garden_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspiciously similar</a> to something generative AI would spit out, but they lack disclosures.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s difficult to say for certain whether or not the latest Next Fest is more awash with slop than its predecessors, it wouldn’t be surprising considering the <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developers-still-aren-t-warming-up-to-generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing use of AI</a> in game development circles – even if nobody is actually asking for this. But there’s also an under-discussed factor at play: Valve changed how Steam Next Fest functions late last year.</p><p>"If people think they are seeing smaller or weirder games in this Next Fest – and the one at the end of last year – Steam did switch to this different approach where they cut out the livestreaming elements of Next Fest [and] are showing you a more random selection of games for the first two-to-three days of the Fest,” Simon Carless, founder of <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameDiscoverCo</a>, an agency that analyzes how players find video games, told Aftermath. “They will then show you personalized picks, based on what everyone else has been playing, later in the Fest."</p><p>It is unlikely, however, that Valve’s goal was to surface slapdash trash.</p><p>"This does lead to some odder, tinier games getting randomly surfaced,” said Carless. “But that's Steam deliberately trying to diversify and get more 'egalitarian,' as opposed to just showing the biggest trending games, which is something that was increasingly being gamed by studios launching a demo early and pushing it to influencers to get on top of the Next Fest charts for the first day."</p><p>In my experience, Carless' assessment appears correct. Several days into Next Fest, I'm now seeing far fewer suspicious recommendations, even in oft-criticized categories like "Simulation." Intriguing prospects like <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3482840/Wanderstop_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wanderstop</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585830/Promise_Mascot_Agency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Promise Mascot Agency</a></em>, as well as meme-y but undeniably amusing concepts like <em>Silent Hill</em> soccer game <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3495990/FEAR_FA_98/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FEAR FA 98</a></em>, have risen to the top. Only once I scroll down do I begin to see dicier fare.</p><p>These days, Valve applies this general philosophy to most corners of Steam, explained Chris Zukowski, a video game marketer who <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regularly writes about Steam and discoverability</a>.</p><p>"Overall, this 'Give every game 15 minutes of fame and see who survives' [approach] is a fundamental aspect to the Steam algorithm in several different areas,” Zukowski told Aftermath, pointing to a survey of Steam’s Discovery Queue he ran across 75 games of different sizes.</p><figure><figcaption>Chris Zukowski</figcaption></figure><p>"Notice how Diamond, Gold, and Silver earners all start out with around 25,000 impressions on day one and two? That is the Steam algorithm testing the games. If a lot of people buy the game on day one and two, on the subsequent days, it is given even more visibility. If it doesn't do well, its visibility is cut,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Zukowski then pointed to the brown line on the graph.&nbsp;</p><p>“Those are games that had so few wishlists going into launch that Valve figures that the dev was too unsophisticated or just a shovelware scammer,” he said. “So they don't even give them the default 25,000 views on day one and two. This Discovery Queue algorithm is why I am not worried about an AI shovelware flood. If a scammer could churn out an AI-generated game per day, they would not have had enough time or spent enough effort gathering the minimum number of wishlists to qualify for the ‘15 minutes of fame’ at launch.”&nbsp;</p><p>For years, Steam users and developers raged against <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/asset-flip-simulator-highlights-a-huge-problem-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a glut of "asset flips" and fake games</a> overrunning the platform. This was Valve's solution: to algorithmically create what are functionally two Steams – the one regular people see and the landfill. While games occasionally slip through the cracks in both directions, it's a relatively effective system overall, according to developers I've spoken to over the past couple years. But it does not solve the problem of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mhwilliams.bsky.social/post/3lj4eyb6txs2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 20,000 games releasing on Steam per year</a>; it only mitigates some of them.</p><p>Those who analyze Steam and similar platforms for a living aren’t sounding the alarm bells about an AI slop flood just yet. The bigger issue Steam developers face is the sheer number of high-effort, <em>good </em>games that come out on a daily basis. This is true of Next Fest as well. There are over 1,000 games in Steam's latest demo-palooza, and many of them look solid. Can an algorithm, no matter how much time Valve spends optimizing it to ultimately lure money out of your wallet, solve that problem? Should it?</p><p>For better or worse, the algorithm remains key, and Carless and Zukowski recommend keeping a close eye on it.</p><p>"The net result of [Valve changing its approach to the previous Steam Next Fest] was I think every game got less visibility. Even top-performing AA games got fewer wishlists during SNF. So it was less winner-take-all,” said Zukowski. “There is weird stuff on Steam, but most of it is filtered out by the algorithms.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chinese-cleaver-chefs-knife-caidao-cck-sbz"><h3>Everyone Should Have A Chinese Chef’s Knife</h3></a><p>My Chan Chi Kee KF1812 caidao is one of my most prized possessions and I use it for basically everything.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-bezos"><h3>Jeff Bezos Presents: The News</h3></a><p>Bezos' new vision for The Washington Post's opinion section will destroy the paper</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What isn’t awesome and is in fact shitty, dumb, and greedy is that Xbox is going to charge PS5 players $100 to play the game a few days early, despite <em>Horizon 5 </em>being a game that released back in 2021. </p><p>On February 27, Xbox announced that<em> Forza Horizon 5 </em>would launch on PS5 on April 29.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010647&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> But if you spend $100</a></span> to buy the fanciest, expensive-st version— the Premium Edition—you can start playing the game on April 25. Xbox claims this is “early access,” but uh, I’ve been playing <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>on my Xbox Series X for years now. </p><p>This is all really silly for a few reasons. First, it lays bare the fact that the early access scams publishers have embraced recently are completely arbitrary and nonsensical. A game that you can play right now on PC and Xbox is going to be released “early” for some players on PS5. Give me a break.

Now, in 2025, it seems very strange to suggest that early access is just as valuable or useful. </p><p>Yes, I know that a lot of people who only own a PS5 might be really excited to play<em> Forza Horizon 5</em> and they might be willing to shell out extra money to get their hands on the game sooner. But you don’t even need an Xbox or PC to play <em>Forza Horizon 5.</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/games/forza-horizon-5-standard-edition/9NKX70BBCDRN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/games/forza-horizon-5-standard-edition/9NKX70BBCDRN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can stream <em>Horizon 5</em> via Game Pass Ultimate on your phone or tablet instantly</a></span> and that will cost you a lot less than $100. </p><p>Ultimately, I’m probably wasting my time.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w"> I’ve already written about how greedy and shitty early-access pre-order bonuses are </a></span>and how publishers are just delaying games for most people to squeeze out extra pennies from a few diehard fans who have no patience or self control. </p><p>And yet, despite me and many others pointing this out, a lot of people keep spending extra money to play games a few days early. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w">As a result, publishers keep pushing their luck</a></span>—adding more days, charging more money, or even offering multiple release dates depending on how much extra you pay. Now, we’ve reached the next level of fuckery and Xbox is charging early access for a years-old port of a game that is currently playable on any phone via streaming. The future sucks.</p><p>  <strong><em>Correction: 2/27/2025, 4:05 p.m. ET</em></strong><em>: A prior version of this article incorrectly claimed Forza Horizon 5 didn’t offer an early access launch option on Xbox in 2021.</em></p><p> . <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"If we continue focusing on our mission, Pokemon can probably continue to its 50th or 100th anniversary," he said. "But if we become complacent and go with the flow, that's when Pokemon will go downhill."</p><p>The Pokemon Company is privately held, but it regularly works with its minority investor Nintendo on all manner of projects in the gaming space, including the upcoming Switch game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a>.

Whereas big-time publicly traded companies have shareholders to answer to and have businesses that stretch across numerous different brands, The Pokemon Company is, as its name states, a company all about Pokemon.</p><p>"Pokemon is the only thing we do at the Pokemon Company," Ishihara said. "So whatever profit we make from Pokemon gets reinvested in Pokemon."</p><p>He went on to say that he's happy to not have public shareholders to answer to, because if he did, people might ask why the company doesn't make non-Pokemon projects. If someone were to ask him that, Ishihara said he would reply, "'We'll go bust when Pokemon is no longer popular.'"</p><p>The Pokemon Company made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6286/" data-ref-id="2900-6286">a number of announcements during the Pokemon Presents event</a>, including the reveal of a brand-new game: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-champions-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529754/" data-ref-id="1100-6529754">Pokemon Champions. </a></p><p>Pokemon Day, February 27, is the celebration of the debut of Pokemon Red/Green in Japan on February 27, 1996.

			<p>Playground Games has revealed the PlayStation 5 launch date for its award-winning game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>. The latest installment in the open world racing game franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-playstation-5-in-spring-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will debut on Sony's console</a> on April 29, although owners of the Premium Edition will be able to start roaming the Mexican country roads from April 25. Playground Games also revealed the technical details of this version, including the planned improvements for the PlayStation 5 Pro console:</p>
<p><em>Forza Horizon 5 on PS5 features two rendering modes to choose from: Performance (60fps) and Quality (30fps). On PS5 Pro, the Performance mode receives increased visual fidelity, while Quality mode adds ray traced car reflections to Races and Free Roam.</em></p>
<p>The launch on PlayStation 5 coincides with a major update called Horizon Realms, which will be available on all platforms. This new feature aims to let players immerse themselves in the history of the game's Evolving World updates. In Horizon Realms, players will get to explore twelve Evolving World locations: eleven of the best previously limited-time locations and the first-ever Stadium Track.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stunt Park</li>
<li>Ice Rink</li>
<li>Oval Track</li>
<li>Summer Party</li>
<li>Neon Airstrip</li>
<li>Día de Muertos</li>
<li>Winter Wonderland</li>
<li>Lunar Drift Arena</li>
<li>Retrowave Highway</li>
<li>Cars and Coffee</li>
<li>Stadium Maze</li>
</ul>
<p>Collecting new Horizon Realms exclusive awards will unlock four new Horizon Reward Cars:</p>
<ul>
<li>2024 Lamborghini Revuelto</li>
<li>2023 Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato</li>
<li>2018 Lotus Exige Cup 430</li>
<li>2022 Hennessey Mammoth 6x6</li>
</ul>
<p>Playground has discussed two ways to experience Horizon Realms. In Skill Mode, the Forza Horizon 5 user picks one of the Realms to enter and try to get as many Skill Scores as possible. Each Evolving World will have its own Skill Score Leaderboard, and there will also be an overall Skill Score Leaderboard that adds up all the points you have banked on each Realm. Earning enough Skill Score will also unlock new player badges unique to Horizon Realms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/clue-peanuts-brings-childhood-charm-to-classic-mystery-board-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new version of the iconic Clue board game is coming based on the world of Peanuts. The aptly named <em>Clue: Peanuts</em> reimagines the classic whodunnit mystery board game with the characters and iconography of the comic strip created by Charles Schulz.</p>

<h2>The <em>Clue: Peanuts</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Clue: Peanuts</em> board game is being developed by The Op under license of toy company giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-unveils-new-playing-to-win-strategy-expanding-their-reach-to-more-players" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hasbro</a>. The mystery at the heart of the game isn't a murder, but the disappearance of Linus' blanket. Players will step into the shoes of Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Lucy, and more to solve the classic Clue questions of Who, Where, and with What.</p>

Players will explore Lucy's psychiatric booth, the pumpkin patch, and Snoopy's doghouse to find clues, interrogate various supporting characters, and piece together the greater puzzle. The game is designed for 2-6 players ages 8 and up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“At The Op Games we believe happiness is…playing board games with friends and family,” said Dane Chapin, CEO of The Op Games. “We’re excited to add CLUE: PEANUTS Edition to our growing line of PEANUTS titles in this special anniversary year, and fans can look forward to more of Charlie Brown, Lucy, and Snoopy just around the corner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peanuts is a syndicated Sunday comic strip written and illustrated by Charles Schulz. It debuted in 1950 and continued until Schulz died in 2000. By that time the comic had circulated in thousands of magazines across 75 countries. It is considered one of the most influential comic strips in history for it cementing the four-panel gag comic format, alongside philosophically and psychologically complex humor.</p>

<p>The last major project featuring the Peanuts gang was an animated movie in 2015 developed by Blue Sky Studios. It received positive reviews and was the 7th highest grossing animated film of that year.</p>

<p><em>Clue: Peanuts</em> is available now at physical and online retailers. It is being sold at an MSRP of $44.99.</p>

The Switch game seems like a significant departure from the untamed open zones of <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>, which is exciting because we don’t know what to expect. The stream gave us a trailer as well as a general breakdown, and we skimmed through both to see what details we could find. Here’s everything we noticed.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-recommend-id="image://36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer aims at a Fletchling." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer aims at a Fletchling." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-recommend-id="image://36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer aims at a Fletchling." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the best innovations <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>implemented was real-time capture mechanics. This included over-the-shoulder aiming which let you toss a Poké Ball at a wild critter and capture them without entering a battle. <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>didn’t quite match this. You could throw a ball at a Pokémon as a way of initiating battles, but you would still have to fight the monster before you could capture them. In <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, it looks kind of like a mix of the two. You can still capture Pokémon without battling them, but it looks like it has a lock-on system similar to that in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> rather than the option to freehand it. Kind of a bummer, but hopefully it feels better when you’re playing it.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-recommend-id="image://4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer throws a Pokeball at a Flaaffy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer throws a Pokeball at a Flaaffy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-recommend-id="image://4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer throws a Pokeball at a Flaaffy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the great challenges of a <em>Pokémon </em>game is trying to capture a new addition without knocking them out. This is why abilities like False Swipe exist, which will leave a Pokémon with 1 HP rather than knocking it out. In the first <em>Legends: Z-A </em>trailer, we see a Flaaffy seemingly beaten in battle, but the player still captures it in a Poké Ball. If this is the case, it takes some of the risk out of battles, but will make it a lot easier to capture a rare Shiny or Legendary Pokémon.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-recommend-id="image://cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chikorita attacks Flaaffy with Razor Leaf with Disarming Voice on its ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Chikorita attacks Flaaffy with Razor Leaf with Disarming Voice on its ability wheel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-recommend-id="image://cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chikorita attacks Flaaffy with Razor Leaf with Disarming Voice on its ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile are the starters in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, which has fans convinced their final forms will each get Mega Evolutions. For Chikorita, its final stage is Meganium, and fans are theorizing its Mega Evolution might be a grass/fairy-type because of one small detail in the trailer. The Chikorita shown fighting the aforementioned Flaaffy knows the attack Disarming Voice, a fairy-type move Chikorita has historically never been able to learn. Could this be a hint that Chikorita’s move pool has been tweaked to prepare it for a fairy typing in the late game?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-recommend-id="image://7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Totodile moves out of the way from a Rollout attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Totodile moves out of the way from a Rollout attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-recommend-id="image://7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Totodile moves out of the way from a Rollout attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>’ battles were more cinematic than those in previous games, and part of what added to the chaotic nature of its fights were that you could move your character around as your Pokémon took part in the scrap. In <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, Game Freak is taking this a step further by integrating it into the battle mechanics. Positioning and timing are integrated into combat in ways they weren’t before, and as you run around your active Pokémon follows, setting up and avoiding attacks as they play out. So now you don’t just run around aimlessly during fights; you’re a more active participant in battles.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-recommend-id="image://3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chikorita's ability wheel shows Leafage recharging." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chikorita's ability wheel shows Leafage recharging." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-recommend-id="image://3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chikorita's ability wheel shows Leafage recharging." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Part of that new active system is that Pokémon attacks seem to have cooldowns. We can see when Chikorita is fighting Flaaffy that its moves have a timer before it can use them again. This makes sense given that timing seems to be a core part of battles this time around. Now you’ll have to make sure you’re well-positioned and can use the attack you need at the right time.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-recommend-id="image://1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer floats off a rooftop using their Rotom phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer floats off a rooftop using their Rotom phone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-recommend-id="image://1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer floats off a rooftop using their Rotom phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Since <em>Legends: Z-A</em> takes place entirely in one city, it’s not too surprising that it’s doing away with some of the open-world traversal of <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> and <em>Legends: Arceus</em>. In those games, you would ride on Pokémon to get to high places, glide through the air, or swim across bodies of water. Based on what we can see in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, the only Pokémon you’ll be using to traverse will be your Rotom—which is in your phone—to float between rooftops. That’s a little disappointing considering riding the Hisui Pokémon in <em>Legends: Arceus </em>was one of the best parts about it, but it makes sense given the environment you’ll be inhabiting in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-recommend-id="image://98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Urbain and Taunie in Legends: Z-A." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Urbain and Taunie in Legends: Z-A." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-recommend-id="image://98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Urbain and Taunie in Legends: Z-A." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s become pretty common in <em>Pokémon </em>games to determine members of the supporting cast by which version of the protagonist you pick at the beginning of the game. In <em>Legends: Arceus</em>, if you pick the female character Akari, you’d meet the male protagonist Rei in the main story, and vice versa. In <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, it looks like you’ll meet one of two supporting characters called Urbain and Taunie depending on your character’s gender. We see what looks like a male protagonist meeting up with Taunie and Urbain chatting with a girl hero. The question is: will both characters essentially be model swaps of the same role, or will they have their own goals and quirks for us to learn?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-recommend-id="image://f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-format="jpg" data-width="1362" data-height="766" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AZ and Floette vibing in a hotel lobby." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="AZ and Floette vibing in a hotel lobby." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-recommend-id="image://f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-format="jpg" data-width="1362" data-height="766" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AZ and Floette vibing in a hotel lobby." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While this isn’t a hidden detail, it’s crazy to me that we’re just gonna gloss over AZ. The ancient giant is running a hotel in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, but let’s not forget that this man is a reformed war criminal who created a weapon of mass destruction in <em>X </em>and <em>Y</em>. He is also an innocent babygirl who loves his Floette. We must protect him in the coming game, trainers.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8ba7c86c2021a9a0e23c91f6a637a337" data-recommend-id="image://8ba7c86c2021a9a0e23c91f6a637a337" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zygarde looks out on Lumiose City." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zygarde looks out on Lumiose City." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ba7c86c2021a9a0e23c91f6a637a337" data-recommend-id="image://8ba7c86c2021a9a0e23c91f6a637a337" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zygarde looks out on Lumiose City." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As the name suggests, Zygarde, the dragon/ground-type legendary who never got its own game as was tradition back in the day, will play a major role in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>. We see the Pokémon throughout the trailer in its dog-like form and there’s even a shot of one of its Zygarde Cells scooching throughout the city. But we don’t know what it’s actually doing as Lumiose City undergoes its renovations just yet.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="59674ea34052a3217096f06d8deca38f" data-recommend-id="image://59674ea34052a3217096f06d8deca38f" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Wild Zone gate has a &quot;1&quot; in the center as a trainer approaches." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Wild Zone gate has a &quot;1&quot; in the center as a trainer approaches." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="59674ea34052a3217096f06d8deca38f" data-recommend-id="image://59674ea34052a3217096f06d8deca38f" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Wild Zone gate has a &quot;1&quot; in the center as a trainer approaches." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lumiose City is undergoing a major revitalization effort during <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, and it looks like some areas might not be accessible until you reach certain goals in the game. We can see some of the Wild Zones that Pokémon inhabit blocked off by numbered hologram gates. These might just be labels signifying where more powerful monsters roam, or they might require some kind of in-game signifier like a gym badge to let you through. Whatever the case, it looks like it won’t be easy to stumble into an area you can’t handle.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f982341de8b04dfcec19f4dfe1c89313" data-recommend-id="image://f982341de8b04dfcec19f4dfe1c89313" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Rotom phone floats over someone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Rotom phone floats over someone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f982341de8b04dfcec19f4dfe1c89313" data-recommend-id="image://f982341de8b04dfcec19f4dfe1c89313" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Rotom phone floats over someone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The final scene in the <em>Legends: Z-A </em>trailer shows a first-person view looking at a Rotom phone with a message that reads: “This is a promotion match announcement.” We only really know that <em>Legends: Z-A</em> will revolve around the Lumiose City renovations, but this implies that some kind of competitive tournament will take place during the course of the game. <em>Legends: Arceus </em>didn’t lean into the competitive sport that typically takes place in <em>Pokémon </em>games, but it was a historical game set before much of that was established in the universe. So it’s probable there will be more battles this time around, and perhaps a tournament in the midst of Lumiose City’s redevelopment.</p><p><br>We’ll learn all about that and more when <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>comes to the Switch in late 2025. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Minecraft Movie hits theaters on April 4, and the final pre-release trailer has been released by Warner Bros. Pictures. The trailer gives a deeper look into the movie’s world, creatures, mobs, and the Nether. </p>



<p>“Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival!” the movie’s description reads. “Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. </p>



<p>“To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Jack Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative…the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.”</p>

                <p>A Good Snowman is Hard to Build is a delightful Sokoban-like puzzle game that challenges you to build a snowman in increasingly complex environments. Originally released in 2015, for the game's 10th anniversary, developer Draknek &amp; Friends decided to implement a unique weather-based pricing system in lieu of its normal price of $15.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWJIkfiKmQk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uWJIkfiKmQk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/indie-studio-introduces-a-unique-temperature-based-pricing-system-for-its-snowman-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, over on the game's <a href="https://draknek.itch.io/a-good-snowman" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Itch.io</a> page, the developer has dubbed the new model "pay what the temperature is." The price on Itch.io is set according to the current temperature in London in degrees Celsius every hour--for example, at the time of writing, the temperature is currently 8.3 degrees, meaning that the game is $8.30. This of course means that the game will be cheaper at night and during the colder winter months, and significantly more expensive during the summer months, which you might call thematically appropriate. In the case that London falls to 0 degrees Celsius or lower, the game will be free.</p><p dir="ltr">Because platforms like Steam don't allow this sort of price tomfoolery, this scheme is exclusive to the Itch.io storefront. The developers joke that those who are upset by its use of Celsius can opt to pay for Fahrenheit or Kelvin instead by using Itch.io's "pay what you want" feature. (For comparison, the current price would be $46.94 in Fahrenheit and $281.45 in Kelvin). Draknek &amp; Friends are currently working on its new game, The Electrifying Incident, which stars the same monster as A Good Snowman is Hard to Build.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monaco-2-makes-playing-a-heist-game-alone-more-fun.1121112/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/monaco-2-demo-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was a big fan of 2013’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/113020/Monaco_Whats_Yours_Is_Mine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Monaco</em></a>, a top-down, pixel art heist game with a <em>Rashomon</em>-esque plot. It was clearly meant to be played co-op, where your friends ruin your plans and then you all fight, but I mostly played it as a solo experience. It was a lot of fun that way–stealthing through its sprawling mansions, banks, discos, and art galleries until I ruined my plans all on my own, at which point I’d run around in a panic and then hide in a vent. Developer Pocketwatch announced a sequel in 2022; there’s currently a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063030/Monaco_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> available as part of Steam Next Fest, which makes single-player a more viable way to play.</p><p>The core of <em>Monaco 2</em> is essentially the same as <em>Monaco 1</em>–a group of characters is drawn together to break into glamorous buildings, locate some coveted object, and try to get out alive–but how all that works has gotten an overhaul. Most noticeable is that the sequel has nixed the pixel art, and has shifted to an isometric perspective. I wasn’t quite sold on the game’s new look when it was first announced, having such fond memories of the first’s bright, blocky colors and relative simplicity. But the new style grew on me quickly while playing the demo; the more detailed art brings life to the levels, and the new perspective makes heists feel more akin to playing a <em>Hitman</em> level than the somewhat cerebral remove of the original’s overhead design. Levels feel busier, which makes them more engaging to move through, if not sometimes a bit more chaotic, especially when things go south.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Monaco 2 OFFICIAL Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKF0feOQcPU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Developer Andy Schatz told Aftermath in an interview that some of the visual changes were due to ways Pocketwatch saw players struggle to understand the original. This is especially true of the way <em>Monaco 2</em> iterates on the first game’s most unique visual feature, which is that parts of a level outside your immediate vicinity were greyed out. Schatz said, “Some people's brains literally cannot parse [the original look]... and I wanted to be able to make the sequel something that more people could parse.” The original game had a blueprint vibe, which is preserved in the sequel through your ability to pore over the map before you start or during gameplay. But the moment-to-moment is different now; while in the first game, areas outside your line of sight were essentially invisible, here, you can see a lot more of their contents. This reduces some of the first game’s tendency to feel like a disco when things went haywire, but still maintains enough mystery to keep you on your toes. Schatz said, “There’s basically like a shadowing [in <em>Monaco 2</em>], but it's a more subtle shadowing that doesn't completely change the visual style of the region that is unseen versus the region that is seen.”</p><figure><figcaption>The original Monaco's line of sight</figcaption></figure><p>Drawing on the lessons learned from players over a decade of the first game influenced other changes for the sequel as well. One is the new way that characters work, especially when playing single-player. In the first game, you could only change characters when you died; here, you can swap them out at various checkpoints. While Schatz admitted <em>Monaco</em> will never have quite as much “riotous fun” in single-player as in co-op, he thinks the single-player experience in <em>Monaco 2</em> is better than in the first game. As a solo player, being able to change characters more often lessened the feeling that I was the wrong person for the job as I moved deeper into a level and faced new challenges.</p><p>The game’s eight characters fall into basic archetypes, each with their own distinct look and powers, like the ability to heal or a drone that can hack alarms. The variety within the team is a reflection of the heist movies <em>Monaco</em> is inspired by, in which Schatz said “the people within the crew are all unique from one another because they have a unique role within their team.” My favorite demo character was The Socialite, who has a little dog she can deploy to distract single guards. (Schatz told me that, alas, other players can’t pet the dog.) Playing alone, I’d use her in the early parts of a level, where her dog could handle the scattered enemies. When later areas got too populated, I’d swap to The Prowler and use her dash ability to sneak by multiple patrolling guards.</p><p>“The primary approach is really that we're designing for different player personalities and player styles more so than player skill,” Schatz said of the differences between the characters. “<em>Monaco</em> is designed around the idea that everyone always has the opportunity to be the hero under different circumstances.”&nbsp;</p><p>Characters also have “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1063030/view/542222803385975570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trinkets</a>” they can unlock through diamonds earned by completing challenges; trinkets give characters new abilities at the cost of some of their health. Schatz said there’s more like 40 different characters, given how much a trinket can change your playstyle. He said that trinkets largely follow a certain progression: “For the most part, they all stay within the theme of the character. I did always try to make sure that there was one trinket that was like a speedrunning trinket, and another trinket that was a team-based trinket. Then the other two were typically just like, well, this would be a cool variation on the character. I generally tried to order their unlock order so the first one is, how do I make this character a little bit easier to play?”</p><figure></figure><p>Another change that makes single-player a little more approachable is the change to how weapons work. Schatz said he didn’t like the way you picked your weapon at the beginning of a <em>Monaco 1</em> stage, and then unlocked ammo for it while collecting coins scattered around a level. In <em>Monaco 2</em>, you spend coins to unlock different weapons you find, which, like the ability to change characters, gives you more gameplay options. In the first game, similar to how I sometimes felt I was stuck with the wrong character, I’d also feel like I had the wrong tool. In the demo, I could deploy a smoke bomb to hide from guards, flee to a stairwell, then swap to a disguise to calmly stroll through the next floor. It’s not the same team-based vibe as a heist movie or co-op play, but it made me feel clever, and gave me more options when I didn’t have teammates to get me out of a jam.</p><p>But no amount of character or weapon swaps can prevent a <em>Monaco</em> level from devolving into chaos, no matter how much I want to play it like the <a href="https://aftermath.site/stealth-game-no-detection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perfect stealth game</a>. It’s not that the enemies are challenging–Schatz said the game’s guards are “particularly dumb”--but that running afoul of one has a cascading effect. You can’t really fight them head-on– Schatz said that “everyone always asked for combat back in the day [of <em>Monaco 1</em>], they wanted to be able to fight the guards... [But] that's just not how <em>Monaco 1</em> was: plan A is stealth and then plan B, we called it the ‘oh shit’ button.” Fleeing from one guard inevitably runs you into another, and they all start to chase you as you race around corners and deal with the game’s particular take on line-of-sight. Schatz said the game treats enemies like “a flock as a whole, and a giant system where you’re making waves.” This brings a slapstick vibe to things going wrong that feels core to the experience of <em>Monaco</em>, and I was glad to see it hold true for the sequel.</p><p>“The only piece of code that is literally shared between <em>Monaco 1</em> and <em>Monaco 2</em> is the aggro algorithm, the algorithm for how guards see you, how they perceive you, and when they chase you,” Schatz said. “That's the one that was like, there's special sauce in there that we don't want to mess with.”</p><figure></figure><p>This idea of enemies as a whole, rather than individuals, also feels like it fits with the nature of the heist movies <em>Monaco </em>is inspired by, which Schatz described as being about “a band of misfits that gather together to outsmart the squares.” The original <em>Monaco</em> was inspired by the heist movies of its time–Schatz cited Guy Ritchie movies and <em>The Usual Suspects</em>–but heists, and the nature of heist movies, has changed since then. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgdy5e3neko" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern heists</a>, Schatz said, “almost all involve some form of digital trickery… They often are multi-stage at this point… And that was something that kind of went into the original thoughts of some of [<em>Monaco 2</em>’s] story.” We only get a glimpse of that story in the demo, and what I played feels physical in the way of “classic” heists, letting you jetset around locations and put yourself in harm’s way, while also feeling more high-tech, such as through the presence of robot guards. “It’s not so much a sci-fi story, but it’s sort of mildly so,” Schatz said.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Monaco 2</em> is being published by Humble Games, which faced what owner Ziff Davis called a “<a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructuring</a>” over the summer, but which to many looked more like a closure. Humble initially brought in third party The Powell Group to continue its <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/indie-devs-working-with-humble-games-were-also-blindsided-by-the-publisher-reportedly-laying-off-all-employees-this-will-have-drastic-consequences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games</a>, and, later, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/humble-games-calls-in-good-games-group-for-support-following-restructure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">external help</a> in the form of a company founded by ex-Humble employees.&nbsp;When asked how this had affected the game, Schatz acknowledged that there was “healthy and valid skepticism of the initial statements that it's a restructuring.” He said Humble has been “surprisingly really supportive… I say ‘surprisingly;’ I mean just, even I had that kind of skepticism when it all went down. I was panicked, but… they've been supporting [<em>Monaco 2</em>] beyond even sort of initial promises. No corners have been cut; in fact, corners have been added… I have been given every sign that they are extremely excited about <em>Monaco</em>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Monaco 2</em> is set to release this year. I’m enjoying my time with the demo and the way it feels more suited to my solo circumstances, even if solo play isn’t the ideal. (<em>You</em> try making plans to game with friends as a middle-aged adult.) Schatz told me, “I actually think that one of the reasons that Pocketwatch has been successful over the years is… [trying] to discover new niches of people that were underserved by the games that they know and love. And in this case, we're making a sequel… so there are some ways in which we said, if there is something that works better for this game, we can't be afraid to let it go.</p><p>“We've tried to preserve everything we could about the spirit of the original, and the emotions that you have and the types of things you think about while you're playing… [We didn’t want to] change that feeling of <em>sneak, sneak, sneak, CHAOS</em>. That is <em>Monaco</em>.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chinese-cleaver-chefs-knife-caidao-cck-sbz"><h3>Everyone Should Have A Chinese Chef’s Knife</h3></a><p>My Chan Chi Kee KF1812 caidao is one of my most prized possessions and I use it for basically everything.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-bezos"><h3>Jeff Bezos Presents: The News</h3></a><p>Bezos' new vision for The Washington Post's opinion section will destroy the paper</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>The integrated heat spreaders put on CPUs at the factory are not the most thermally efficient material you could have on there, but what are you going to do—rip it off at the risk of killing your $500 chip with your clumsy hands?</p>
<p>Yes, that is precisely what enthusiastic overclockers have been doing for years, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapping">delidding</a>, or decapping (though the latter term is used less often in overclocking circles), chips through various DIY techniques, allowing them to replace AMD and Intel's common denominator shells with liquid metal or other advanced thermal interface materials.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, it can be nerve-wracking, and things can go wrong in just one second or one degree Celsius. In <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/extreme-overclocker-recommends-heating-arrow-lake-cpus-to-165-degrees-celsius-before-delidding-the-cpu-has-to-be-hot-enough-so-the-indium-melts-but-not-too-hot-to-not-damage-the-smds">one overclocking forum thread</a>, a seasoned expert noted that Intel's Core Ultra 200S spreader (IHS) needs to be heated above 165° C for the indium (transfer material) to loosen. But then the glue holding the IHS is also loose at this temperature, and there is only 1.5–2 millimeters of space between IHS and surface-mounted components, so it's easy for that metal IHS to slide off and take out a vital component with it. It's quite the Saturday afternoon hobby.</p>
<p>That is the typical overclocking bargain: You assume the risk, you void your warranty, but you remove one more barrier to peak performance. Now, though, Thermal Grizzly, led by that same previously mentioned expert, Roman "der8auer" Hartung, has a new bargain to present. His firm is delidding AMD's Ryzen 9800X3D CPUs with its own ovens and specialty tools, then <a href="https://www.thermal-grizzly.com/en/amd-tg-delidded-cpu/s-tg-del-cpu-001">selling them with two-year warranties</a> that cover manufacturer's defects and "normal overclocking damage," but not mechanical damage.</p>

                <p>Curious about how to fix Seikret controls in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a>? The Seikret is your trusty bird mount. Think of them as somewhat akin to a Chocobo, except they can carry a ton of loot, including your secondary weapon. Unfortunately, trying to steer your Seikret can prove to be more challenging than the final boss itself, and you'll probably find this fowl's movement mechanics to be pretty foul. Thankfully, we have a guide here to help you with this issue.</p><h2>How to fix Seikret controls in Monster Hunter Wilds</h2><p>By default, the Seikret has an auto-move action. While mounted, all you need to do is press the up button on your controller's D-pad or the tab key on your keyboard. This causes the Seikret to automatically follow an optimal path straight to a waypoint or anything spot you've marked down on the map.</p><p>However, there's also a glaring problem here, because the Seikret, whether they're on auto-mode or manual mode, will continue to move forward even if you're not pressing anything. This can be very annoying, especially if you want to collect herbs or pick up ores.</p><p>The good news is that there's a quick fix for the Monster Hunter Wilds Seikret controls, and it comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgUW6e8KAIY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTuber Gaijin Hunter</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451444-monster-hunter-wilds-fix-seikret-controls-manual-mode-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451444" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451444-monster-hunter-wilds-fix-seikret-controls-manual-mode-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451444"></a><figcaption>You can quickly change the Seikret Manual Controls to Type 2 via the Options -&gt; Controls menu.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451444-monster-hunter-wilds-fix-seikret-controls-manual-mode-1.jpg"></figure><p>The fix requires you to go to the Options menu -&gt; Controls page. If you check the second tab, you should see the Seikret Manual Controls setting. By default, this is set to Type 1--this is actually what causes the creature to move and maintain its current speed even if you're not pressing anything.</p><p><strong>Now, go ahead and set Seikret Manual Controls to Type 2</strong>. This makes the input similar to that of your character--i.e. the creature will only move if you press the WASD keys or tilt the left thumbstick.</p><p>With this, your Seikret's controls should be similar to that of a regular mount in every other game. Now, you can happily roam around without having bird-induced headaches.</p><p>Need more tips as you continue fighting deadly creatures and venture into lands unknown?
