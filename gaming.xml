			<p>It only took them 38 years, but Zelda is finally getting to be the star of her own legend. Sure, she’s had cameos as a badass in a bunch of the games that she lends her name to, but The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the first time that she is the leading protagonist. It’s also the first time that hitting things with a sword or boomerang won’t be your first instinct when playing, and the blend of creative puzzle-solving at the heart of this game is a thoroughly refreshing change of pace.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Preview – Zelda's awakening to a new style adventure" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GXW9sbboA9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hyrule is once again thrown into complete chaos as a malevolent force reveals itself, dark and star-filled rifts spreading across the land, consuming the landscape, buildings and villages, and the people of the world. Some are even replaced by shadowy doppelgängers, including Zelda’s father, the king, who goes on to sentence her to death!</p>


<p>Surely some of the castle’s guards would have objected to such a dramatic change of tone, you’d have thought, but our hands on time with Echoes of Wisdom starts with Zelda locked up in a prison cell with only a mysterious new sprite named Tri for company. Gifting Zelda the Tri Rod, we’re quickly introduced to one of the most fundamental new ideas in the game: echoes.</p>
<p>The Tri Rod allows Zelda to copy and then recall all manner of objects that she comes across on her adventures, from tables and crates, to rocks, pots, trees, signs, trampolines, and even beds, if she needs a quick restorative nap! Right from the off, they lend a huge amount of playfulness to the puzzle-solving in the world, whether it’s creating steps to get up to a ledge, summoning pots to throw as a sound distraction (or to hop and hide in), layering trees and beds to make walkways, and so much more. It’s such a simple delight to use this ability as you’re getting around, and in a similar vein to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, Nintendo really leans into enabling player creativity when applying logic to overcome different scenarios –&nbsp;do you drop a heavy block to smash boxes, or set them on fire?</p>

<p>The only real limitation being that Tri can only provide so many pips of summoning power, with the oldest echo disappearing if you summon something new – you can, of course, manually dispel the most recent echo or all of them together.</p>

<p>But how does Zelda actually fight the army of beasties now roaming across Hyrule? Does she bop them on the bonce with the wand? Far from it. Hers is a more… intellectual approach, shall we say. Yes, you can pick up rocks and items and throw them at enemies, and she does have a grass-clearing spin move, though this might only gently stun an enemy. Once you’ve managed to defeat something for the first time, though, she can absorb it into the Tri Rod and make it as summonable as an overly keen waiter.</p>
<p>Summoning enemies makes combat more like the puzzling and traversal that makes up much of the rest of the game. Moblins can be summoned to chuck spears and Darknuts to wade in and swing axes, while Sea Urchins can be a handy spike barrier, and the Candle Zol is just the kind of summon that will get you to unleash your inner arsonist.</p>
<p>Where things start to get really special is with Tri’s ability to Bind to objects and creatures. This can work in two ways, to either have the bound item move with you, or to lock Zelda to follow the movement of the item. It’s powerful enough to shift huge blocks, flexible enough to reach through bars and pick up statues, or to attach to moving platforms above Zelda’s head, but it also enables a whole host of borderline game-breaking ideas.</p>

<p>Bind to a summoned spider, and that spider and crawl up and over trees, getting you to otherwise inaccessible places. in combat, you can summon and hold a fighter at arm’s length, whether making an Urchin in to spiky shield you bash enemies with, or that Candle Zol to set everything on fire. Again.</p>
<p>It’s all brought together within the dungeons, as is the case with so may classic Zelda games, but in Echoes of Wisdom, these dungeons might have been gobbled up by the rift as well. Tri can open a little gateway into the rifts, revealing to you the Still World with frozen chunks of land suspended in the cosmos. There’s some light platforming to be done here, hopping between islands and across impromptu bridges made of trees, and combined with summoning echoes. Reaching the first dungeon sees a fairly traditional style with room puzzles and using abilities to depress switches, defeat enemies and the like.</p>
<p>A fresh trick found here is the Swordfighter form that effectively turns Zelda into a glowing blue Link with sword and shield. You’ve only got a little time before her energy gauge drains and she reverts to normal though, and topping it up needs you to collect nuggets of blue energy from within the Still World, so you need to use it wisely.</p>
<p>It’s one of the most obvious options when facing off against the first boss, a rock creature that might make you wonder if Nintendo has something against Knack, but since the Swordfighter form can only be used sparingly, it’s a fight that’s about putting echoes and binding to use to hit a weak spot and then attack heavily during a damage phase. As straightforward as that might sound, there’s plenty of different ways to go about it and lots of different summons that can be useful.</p>

<p>All of this is rendered in the wonderful style of the Link’s Awakening remake from a few years ago. It’s a chunky, cartoony world with depth of field liberally used to give a dreamy tilt shift effect, and it’s just lovely in so many ways. However, just as Link’s Awakening had some frame rate struggles and hiccups, I fear that the added burden of spawning items on the fly and having the potential consequences of that –&nbsp;lots of fire, for example –&nbsp;does seem to leave this game with a stuttery frame rate as well. Hopefully the final release code is a touch more stable in that regard.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a wonderful surprise for the tail-end of the Switch generation, a game that’s full of charm, enables player creativity, and is generally just a quirky, playful delight.</p>

			<p>FANTASIAN Neo Dimension, in some ways, is the closing of a circle that began back in 1986 with the release of the original Final Fantasy. After leaving Square back in 2003 following the launch of the tenth entry in the series that changed JRPGs forever, Hironobu Sakaguchi founded Mistwalker, releasing multiple solid titles over the years, including Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey, created in collaboration with Dragon Ball's Akira Toriyama and Slam Dunk and Vagabond's Takehiko Inoue respectively. The latest game from the studio is FANTASIAN, which was launched a while back for the Apple Arcade service and is now about to hit PC and consoles thanks to the company the creator of Final Fantasy left over 20 years ago.</p>
<p>During Gamescom 2024, I had the chance to try out FANTASIAN Neo Dimension on Nintendo Switch, playing through a sequence early in the story that allowed me to experience some of the game's unique mechanics. Even on the little screen of the Nintendo console, it was easy to appreciate the game's unique visuals, which blend 3D character models and hand-crafted dioramas. These visuals are far from being cutting-edge, but they give the adventure a very peculiar feel and a strong visual identity that is hard to forget.</p>
<p>While exploring the small forest the Gamescom demo was set in together with the main character Leo and his companions, who are on a journey to recover the hero's memories and solve the mystery of the mechanical infection that is destroying the world, I was able to test the FANTASIAN Neo Dimension combat mechanics, whose twists give an edge to some traditional game systems. The game's combat system is a straightforward turn-based system, with a turn bar informing players of the turn order, where characters and enemies can use a variety of different attacks and skills, all coming with elemental properties that can deal more damage if a weakness is hit. What sets this simple combat system apart is the skill system itself, which allows players to alter the trajectory of certain skills to hit multiple enemies. This is a mechanic that I'm sure will be used a lot in the full game, as battles against multiple enemies can take a while, especially when using single-target skills.</p>

<p>Thankfully, random battles are never a problem with FANTASIAN Neo Dimension, thanks to the twist to one of the oldest JRPG mechanics introduced by the Dimengeon System. By employing this system, it is possible to send encountered enemies to a dimensional dungeon, and skip the battle altogether. At some point, however, Leo and his companions will have to fight the enemies sent to this dungeon, otherwise the Dimengeon Machine will overflow and force them into a longer battle. To make these battles more manageable, however, players can attack Dimengeon Gimmicks, which grant some welcome buffs, widening the array of available strategic choices to make combat even more engaging.</p>
<p>While 30 minutes or so are too little to provide a proper evaluation of FANTASIAN Neo Dimension as a JRPG due to the little story covered, it is undeniable that the Final Fantasy series DNA is very prominent in the game. As such, it won't have any trouble finding an audience when it launches on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch sometime this Winter.</p>

			<p>Today, Hello Games is releasing a new No Man's Sky update titled <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/09/aquarius-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aquarius</a>. As you can easily surmise, it is centered around water and more specifically it adds the long-requested fishing to the game. Sean Murray said in a press release that fans really loved the new water technology added in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-worlds-update-part-i-refreshes-the-universes-flora-fauna-weather-and-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worlds Part I update</a> a few weeks ago, inspiring the studio to add fishing next.</p>
<p>Players can now explore the universe to find their perfect spot on the water bouncing with fish, sitting alone and relaxing with their thoughts, or with fellow travelers looking out over alien vistas waiting for a bite. Featuring a vast array of fish, from common minnows to wild alien catches, each with its own habitat and fishing conditions. Bait your line to lure the rarest fish, or search the deep for hidden messages in a bottle. There are trophies to earn, fishing logs to complete, and new fishing gear to unlock. There's even a unique fishing expedition that sends No Man's Sky players on a quest for the biggest catch of the day.</p>

<p>Some new equipment introduced in the Aquarius update allows players to fish in deep water with ease from their personal fishing platform. New fishing pots can also be used to bait and trap rare catches. Cook up the day's catch with new recipe combinations waiting to be discovered.</p>

<p>Murray also said that the previous Worlds Part I update resulted in No Man's Sky's largest player base numbers in over five years. As such, Hello Games still has many plans to improve the game further, even now that it is over eight years old (it launched with many controversies back in August 106), and even despite its work-in-progress development of the fantasy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-is-a-planet-sized-fantasy-online-multiplayer-sandbox-rpg-from-no-mans-sky-developer-hello-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light No Fire</a> (which still has no release date).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preview-brilliant-creativity.971712/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preview-brilliant-creative-player-freedom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Finally, close to 40 years after the first game we are getting a mainline<em> The Legend of Zelda </em>game that features Zelda as the protagonist. After having a little over an hour with the game, anyone who has loved the simple mechanics that have given players so much amazing creative freedom, like in Tears of the Kingdom, should be scrambling to get their hands on <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rifts opened up over a Hyrule with people, buildings, monsters, and more falling into the abyss. Started by some magical event Zelda is implicated in, she is blamed and sent to jail. That’s where we see the game begin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While in her cell, a new magical friend named Tri shows up to lend Zelda a hand. Tri has a mutual need to see the rifts closed and people rescued as their friends are trapped because of them as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tri offers Zelda their power, which comes in the form of the Tri Rod. This gives Zelda some really amazing abilities that are both simple to understand yet endless in their possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Echoes Are Simple Yet Powerful</h2>
<p>The main use of the Tri-Rod is the collection and use of Echoes. Echoes are when Zelda absorbs or learns the essence of an object or enemy to then be able to make a copy of them herself later.</p>
<p>For example, the first thing you’ll get access to is a short table. At a touch of a button it is added to your catalogue and Zelda can start producing tables wherever there is space for one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objects get more elaborate, from the classic pots we all love to smash in a <em>Legend of Zelda</em> game, to trees, and a whole lot more. Each has their own properties, like being made of wood or stone for example, and uses.</p>

<p>That table, for example, is just one unit high and Zelda can jump on it. A crate is two high, meaning you need the table to jump on. Quickly put it together and you’ve got stairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond objects, Zelda can use echoes of defeated enemies, which is useful as she has no offensive abilities of her own. Take down a keese (the bat) and you can then get a flock (cloud when its bats apparently) to send after enemies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The one caveat is that it’s not endless. Tri does not have limitless power, though it can be leveled up. To start, Tri just has three triangles of power that can be used to produce echoes, each of which cost a certain number of triangles.</p>
<h2>Echoes Encourage Creativity and Curiosity</h2>
<p>Not all enemy echoes are for simply combat, either. One very useful enemy is a spider that you can then use to make a quick rope of webs to climb up and get around places.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can pick up smaller echoes as well, holding onto them, and they work logically like you would think. Holding onto a keese? Well, jump from a great height and glide to safety thanks to their handy wings.</p>
<p>Echoes keep their properties as well, not just the shape. Wood still catches fire, a trampoline will bounce, and the bed you make can be rested in to restore hearts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a way, this use of Echoes is an expansion on Cappy’s mechanics from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. While not directly taking control of enemies or objects here, you’re still interacting with them in a similar way and they are full of surprising effects that will have you say, “I can’t believe they thought of that.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just like when <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> showed off its gameplay briefly before release, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> delighted me in the wonderful conduits of our imagination we’ll all have at our fingertips soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a playfulness, an encouragement to try new things and mix them together see how things work with one another for just the hell of it in <em>Echoes of the Wisdom </em>that feels the exact same as <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That same feeling of wanting to attach every item you find to an arrow to see what it did in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> is here in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>. How will the various Echoes interact with one another? What other creative ways can I get through this puzzle?</p>
<p>I can see the social media posts of the crazy solves of dungeon puzzles just as we have seen with the shrines in both <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>
<p>Making quick logical leaps in Echoes to drop some pots on the head of an enemy as I stood on a ledge above was just as satisfying as being able to pick up a spear goblin and use it as a mobile turret as it kept hurling spears at enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no loss, no penalty for experimentation, making it all the easier to just try whatever springs to mind. The best part is, Echoes usually has a reward down any path your willing to go down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, what my first logical leap to solve a puzzle is likely very different from someone else but both can be the right answer. There were a few moments in my preview that the Nintendo representative with me said they hadn't though of, even though they were able to complete it as well.</p>
<h2>Ultrahand is in Echoes of Wisdom</h2>
<p>With all that in mind, <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>isn’t done with the simple yet deep mechanics. The Tri Rod also gives Zelda the ability to grab objects and enemies from afar, similar to the Ultrahand ability in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Echoes, the objects or enemies will stay the same distance from you as they were when you grabbed them. You can’t manipulate or spin them around like Ultrahand, though that doesn’t harm its usefulness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, this ability features greatly in puzzles, whether that is moving a distant object onto a button to open a door or to put it in place to complete a walkway to let you progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, grabbing Echoes and other objects is extremely useful in combat and elsewhere in the world as well. Maybe a quick shield is useful, so grabbing a crate to take a hit or two and carrying it close can be useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A likely future go-to is taking a sea urchin and using it as a shield and weapon. Hold it close to run its spikes into enemies for damage and let it take the hit for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s also plenty of things in the environment and potential hazards you can set up to use on enemies. Maybe there’s a pit nearby you can grab enemies and toss them down or a sea urchin or two you can ram them into. Enemy with a shield? Grab and take it away.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> isn’t done there, as that grabbing ability has a secondary affect as well. You can grab an object, or enemy, and link yourself together then essentially attach Zelda to its movements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A platform above moving left and right can then be used to cross a gap that was otherwise unreachable. Maybe a flying creature has a path that takes it over a ledge with no other obvious route to it. Floating in air below, Zelda can attach herself to that creature and hitch a ride.</p>
<p>Once its mechanics became more natural, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> just makes sense and changes your approach to gameplay. The logic of the game is intuitive, meaning the only real limitation is realizing just how much you have at your disposal in any given moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To compare it to Tears of the Kingdom again, Echoes of Wisdom has similar “a-ha” moments in what you can do. Delights at your creations are around every corner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This era of Nintendo is defined by having mechanics you can explain in a sentence but would need hours or days to show all that they can do. The Echoes in Echoes of Wisdom are simple brilliance just as Cappy in Odyssey and Fuse in Tears of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>More than anything, the most exciting element of Echoes of Wisdom is how much it encouraged player creativity, how much it wants you to just try things out. It's simple brilliance done wonderfully.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> releases for Nintendo Switch on September 26th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/we-harvest-shadows-advice<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie dev David Wehle, who's behind the Gamescom horror farming hit&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows</em>, has admitted that he's "pretty much out of money", and he wants to know what the community thinks he should do next.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1559720/view/4584188879511589238" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows&nbsp;</em>Steam page, Wehle says that the&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows&nbsp;</em>demo has been praised extensively, including by none other than Remedy's Sam Lake. Despite that, Wehle is "out of money", and&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows&nbsp;</em>still "needs 1+ year of work at least".</p>
<p>Wehle says he "kinda abhor[s] publishers" because of what he calls their "insanely greedy terms and requirements", and so he's considering liquidating his retirement account in order to self-publish&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows</em>. Doing so would, however, make the game a smaller "$15 game" experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/we-harvest-shadows-indie-dev-no-money-doll.jpg?itok=eS1rn613 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/we-harvest-shadows-indie-dev-no-money-doll.jpg?itok=fdRyhBPP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We Harvest Shadows&nbsp;</em>is in a spot of trouble, and it needs your advice.</figcaption></figure><p>If Wehle takes this route, he says the game will become "a longer version of the demo but with a few more items, a vehicle, places to explore, story, etc...".</p>
<p>The other option, Wehle says, is to seek out a publisher and use their resources to improve the game's quality and scope. He says this would make&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows&nbsp;</em>"truly feel like a $20 experience".</p>
<p>Wehle says he's currently "at a crossroads"; he doesn't want to give into publishers who didn't support him "a year ago when [he] showed it to them", but he does want&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows&nbsp;</em>to be good.</p>
<p>As such, Wehle wants your feedback. He says that if you've got some thoughts about what he should do, you should leave them as a comment on the Steam post, and he'll "definitely read it and ponder your feedback".</p>

<p>At time of writing, it seems like most of Wehle's audience <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1559720/eventcomments/4756451924772751145?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener" target="_blank">doesn't want him to use his retirement fund</a>. Some are suggesting Kickstarter or Patreon, while others are recommending finding a publisher or simply scaling back the experience.</p>
<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows&nbsp;</em>is, Wehle describes it as a "first-person farming horror allegory" in which you must "become a recluse, build up your farm, and survive the lonely nights". You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1559720/We_Harvest_Shadows/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam here</a>.</p>

Pictures</cite></p></div><p>Unsettling imagery aside, <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> looks like some silly family fun, with lots of one-liners, large-scale battles, and Jack Black exclaiming “I am Steve!” very proudly. And obviously there’s both mining and crafting. Aside from Black, the movie also stars Jason Momoa, Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, Sebastian Eugene Hansen, and Jennifer Coolidge. It’s directed by Jared Hess of <em>Napoleon Dynamite</em> fame, and is hitting theaters on April 2nd, 2025.</p><div><p>Of course, we now live in a time when video game adaptations are no longer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23668181/super-mario-bros-movie-live-action-revisited">expected to be bad</a>, so <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> will be released into a world with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24228966/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-keanu-reeves">the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> trilogy</a> as competition. (The less said about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24232389/borderlands-movie-review-interview-video-on-demand"><em>Borderlands</em></a>, the better.) It’s also not the only <em>Minecraft</em> adaptation in the works; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24167317/netflix-minecraft-animated-series-microsoft-mojang">Netflix is working on an animated series as well</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But it’s rather surprising how strongly you can see the influence of those games in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct"><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em></a>, Nintendo’s newest mainline <em>Zelda </em>entry — the first to let you play as the princess herself. During the time I recently spent hands-on with the game, almost everything about <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>made it feel like a crystallization of the <em>Zelda </em>franchise’s recent era of experimentation. And while it’s a little hard to imagine at first how a <em>Breath of the Wild</em>-esque openness could lend itself to a more traditional, top-down <em>Zelda </em>game, Nintendo seems to have found a way to make it work beautifully.</p><p>After years of waiting on the sidelines while Link hacked and slashed his way through Hyrule, <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>turns Princess Zelda into the hero as she sets out to stop Ganon. When we first meet this Zelda, it’s clear that she isn’t a stranger to the dangers Ganon poses and the important role Link typically plays in the grand battle between light and dark. But with Link and many other Hylians swallowed up by one of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s strange portals, Zelda’s left to her own devices to keep her kingdom from plunging into total chaos.</p><p>Lots of things about <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> — like its assortment of monsters and focus on puzzle-centric dungeon crawling — make it feel like a classic <em>Zelda </em>game at first blush.&nbsp;But one of the most novel things about the new title is how much of a Zelda (the character) game it feels like compared to its predecessors outside of the fact that you can finally play as the princess. Zelda is a very different person than her trusted knight. He’s a warrior who runs around yelling and spinning at his enemies, but she’s a thinker who knows that her wits can be sharper than a blade. <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>tries to make you feel that difference as soon as you’re given the game’s new signature key item, the Tri Rod.</p><p>By waving the Tri Rod at certain objects and defeated monsters, Zelda and her companion Tri can create duplicates of them called echoes. Early into my demo, the echoes I learned were of ordinary things you’d find in any top-down <em>Zelda,</em> like a small table and a bed. But rather than simply existing as visual detail, the echoes give you a variety of ways to tackle <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s various puzzles. A single table doesn’t seem like much at first, but a stack of them is perfect for getting Zelda up high enough to sneak out of a prison cell. And in moments when Zelda might need to hide, being able to conjure a large pot she can climb into is very handy.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though the puzzles I played through were relatively simple, there were a handful of ways they could have been solved by using different echoes. One approach might make other onscreen characters behave in a certain way that opened up a previously blocked path, and another method could give me an entirely different route to take by creating walkways. Some of that variability comes from the way that echoes interact with their environments by default — one monster, for example, immediately started hopping around and setting things on fire after I called it out. But much of it boils down to the way <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>encourages you to experiment.</p><p>The number of echoes you can create at any given time is determined by the number of triangles floating behind Tri and a point system that assigns different costs to things you can create. While a table echo costs a single triangle, a Moblin echo requires two. The game will automatically delete old echoes in the order you created them as you make new ones, so it requires you to put some thought into what you’re doing as battles become more complicated.&nbsp;</p><p>I had a ball summoning a swarm of Keese to sic on Moblins once I was able to get out into the open world, but it wasn’t long before I realized that brute force isn’t the easiest way to play&nbsp;when you start out. With just a few heart containers, it doesn’t take much to knock Zelda out, meaning that you have to be somewhat strategic in how to deploy echoes to fight for you while also taking care to avoid incoming attacks. And because your echoes sustain damage as well, you often have to be ready to conjure new ones at just the right time in order to take out difficult enemies. But the princess does have some other options at her disposal.</p><p>Because echoes are such a huge part of the game, it was surprising to see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24231404/echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-sword">Zelda pick up Link’s sword</a> and gain the ability to fight (and dress) the way he does. In her swordfighter form, Zelda’s more nimble and able to block attacks using a magically manifested shield. But Zelda’s transformations are temporary and tied to a magic meter that quickly depletes if you leave it running for too long. <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s first boss battles did an impressive job of teaching me that as powerful as Zelda’s swordfighter form is, it’s not something you can just default to — at least not when you first start playing the game. The sword is important, but it’s just one of many tools you’re supposed to use strategically as the game pushes you to think about the multiple ways its challenges can be overcome.</p><p>Based just on the small chunk of <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>I was able to get through, it feels like Nintendo’s supercharged the classic top-down <em>Zelda </em>formula by infusing it with many of the franchise’s cleverest innovations. It’s not exactly an open world or classic <em>Zelda</em>, but it’s something new — and it’s a perfect fit for the princess.</p><p><small>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom <em>launches on the Nintendo Switch on September 26th.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If it felt like there were already too many games to pay attention to before, things are about to get much worse. A blessing for some, a curse for others, with heavy-hitters like <em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em>, <em>The Legends of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, and more leading the charge. </p><p>With<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em> sneaking out at the tail-end of August, this September is making up for being a mega-blockbuster or two light with a truly overwhelming number of mid-tier releases, indie games, and tons, and tons of remasters. And not just repackaged cash-ins either, but long-overdue revivals like<em> Marvel vs. Capcom</em>. </p><p>2024 will probably end up going down as one of the post-covid hangover “off-years” of this console generation, with 2023 being an unprecedentedly good year, and lots of major games already stacking up with vague “sometime in 2025" release windows. But the overall pace of game releases just keeps getting faster and faster, with more and more great stuff falling by the wayside every month. Here’s a bunch of the games worth paying attention to that come out in September. </p></div></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Narrative-driven horror adventure</p><p>The makers of <em>Until Dawn </em>return with an interactive story set in the<em> Dead by Daylight</em> universe.

It’s also on console this time around. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre: </strong>Mystery adventure game</p><p>The <em>Ace Attorney Investigations </em>compilation includes <em>Miles Edgeworth</em> and <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>, two Nintendo DS-era spin-offs featuring Phoenix Wright’s one-time rival as players take control of the prosecution’s chair to seek justice for people’s crimes. The second game in the collection was never previously localized in North America. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Puzzle platformer </p><p>Sony’s budding mascot for the PS5 makes his standalone debut in an adventure brimming with PlayStation history and nostalgic callbacks as the titular robot saves friends cosmic danger.

<p>Earlier this week, Jyamma Games announced that Enotria: The Last Sony has been indefinitely delayed on Xbox due to communication issues with Xbox, and how now updated players that Microsoft has since apologized.</p>



<p>I spoke with Giacomo Greco, CEO of Jyamma Games, about the issue. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/enotria-xbox-release-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">He confirmed</a> that the studio has had communication issues with the publisher for a number of months. The lack of communication meant that the developers had no choice but to delay the game for the platform, but he assured me that once the issue is resolved, they’ll get the game on Xbox as soon as possible.</p>



<p>Today, Greco updated fans of the game on Discord. Greco wrote on Discord this morning, “They [Microsoft] contacted us and said sorry about the situation, we’re trying to solve everything as soon as possible”. </p>



<p>At the time of writing, Jyamma Games is yet to confirm when Enotria will be released on the Xbox version, but the game will launch on PC and PlayStation 5 on September 19, 2024.</p>

            <p>
By now, I should really should know better than to expect the obvious where <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> is concerned. And here we are again with a brand-new update, titled Aquarius, which this time adds - of all things - fishing to developer Hello Games' wonderful exploratory space sim.
</p>
<p>
Aquarius follows on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">July's behemoth Worlds Part 1 update</a>, which introduced a significant planetary refresh for No Man's Sky's vast universe. That overhaul included much-improved water effects - replacing the tinted cellophane look of yesteryear with proper dynamic waves - and players now have another excuse to relax and admire the aquatic beauty around them.
</p>
<p>
With Aquarius installed, Travellers can take a well-earned breather from the usual interplanetary hubbub down by the water's edge, fishing rod in hand, waiting for something to bite. Hello Games is promising a "huge array of fish", ranging from the common minnow to more exotic alien species, each with their own habitats and catching conditions.

<p>
But that's not all! Aquarius also introduces bait, new cooking recipes, a personal fishing platform for players to construct, plus Fishing Pots used to bait and trap rare catches. And that's alongside new trophies to earn, fishing logs to complete, and fishing equipment rewards. There's even a new limited-time expedition - fishing themed, naturally - starting soon.
</p>
<p>
No Man's Sky's Aquarius update launches today on all platforms, and <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/09/aquarius-update/">full patch notes</a> are available on Hello Games' website. Interestingly, Aquarius seems to be something different from the Worlds Part 2 release teased by the studio back in July, suggesting there could still be a surprise or two for No Man's Sky fans before 2024 is through.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-trophy-hunters-rivalry</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-trophy-hunters-resort-to-drastic-measures-for-platinum-before-shutdown.971637/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-trophy-hunters-rivalry<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Concord&nbsp;</em>players are resorting to some pretty drastic measures in order to secure the game's Platinum trophy ahead of its shutdown on Friday, new reports have revealed.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1831041419756388429" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted by X (formerly Twitter) user Radec</a>, players are heading into&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s Rivalry, a five-versus-five round-based gameplay mode, and immediately hurling themselves off cliffs and ledges in order to quickly complete matches.</p>
<p>Radec points out that this technique is "the fastest way to earn XP for the Platinum". As a reminder, several of&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s trophies require you to reach certain Reputation thresholds, and doing so requires XP, which you can earn simply by finishing games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/concord-rivalry-trophy-hunters-shootout.jpg?itok=BnyFZhgC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/concord-rivalry-trophy-hunters-shootout.jpg?itok=6axdjdMD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Concord&nbsp;</em>players are having some fun repeatedly unaliving themselves for the Platinum.</figcaption></figure><p>Independent verification that this is definitely happening in&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>Rivalry games <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-players-are-jumping-off-cliffs-in-game-as-they-desperately-grind-for-the-platinum-trophy-before-shutdown" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also comes from IGN</a>, so it looks like if you want a proper, regular game of&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>before it shuts down, you'd better pick a different mode.</p>
<p>Of course, the jury's out on whether or not this tactic will actually work. In a <a href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1831054519167529019" rel="noopener" target="_blank">followup post</a>, Radec says they've been using this tactic "for an hour and only went from Level 44 to 45". That Platinum might be out of your reach, even if you start dying as efficiently as possible in&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>now.</p>
<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;Sony announced yesterday that&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, a first-person hero shooter released just under two weeks ago, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">will be shutting down on both PC and PS5 on Friday</a>&nbsp;so as to allow the studio to think about what to do next with the game.</p>
<p>The publisher also confirmed that all players who have purchased&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>will receive refunds, whether that's on PlayStation or PC, so you won't have wasted any money if you were one of the apparent handful of people who bought it.</p>

<p>This is normally where I'd say&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>is available on PC and PS5, but, well, it isn't. The game can no longer be purchased on either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2443720/Concord/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002695" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, and the jury's out on whether it will ever return. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>After <a href="https://x.com/sharkeatsman/status/1826122649963245882">eight years in development</a>, it took less than a month for <em>Concord</em> to die.</p></div><p>Yesterday, Sony announced that the game, which only launched on August 23rd, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc">would be shutting down on September 6th</a>. Ryan Ellis, game director at developer Firewalk Studios, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">said that</a> it “didn’t land the way we’d intended.” That seems to be an understatement: the game is going offline, full refunds are being issued, and it’s unclear if <em>Concord</em> will ever come back. While the speed at which the game ended may be surprising, the fact that it happened isn’t. <em>Concord</em> is just the latest victim of publishers chasing the live-service trend with outsize expectations. Unfortunately, there’s only so much room — and <em>Concord</em> was too generic to find space.</p><p>It’s easy to see why so many studios and publishers want in. The longevity and profitability of games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>League of Legends</em> are impressive. They’re also nearly impossible to replicate. <em>Concord</em> follows other high-profile failures like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22274771/ea-wont-continue-anthems-post-launch-development">EA’s <em>Anthem</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">Xbox’s <em>Redfall</em></a>. Both instances saw beloved single-player studios — BioWare and Arkane Austin, respectively — pivot to persistent multiplayer games with disastrous results. (Each lasted longer than <em>Concord</em>, but still had relatively short lives in terms of updates.)</p><p>There are a few obvious errors specific to <em>Concord</em>. It was a hero shooter, a genre with entrenched competition like <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>, making it a tough sell. Its reach was limited to the PS5 and PC. Worse still, it was a full paid release in a space where free-to-play is the standard. But <em>Concord</em>’s biggest problem was that it was just fine. With generic characters and frustrating map design, there was nothing to make it stand out among so much competition. In the live-service space, where games are designed to suck up as much of your time (and money) as possible, being an average game isn’t enough. There’s only so much of both to go around, and pulling players away from their existing time sinks is not an easy thing. When you’re up against <em>Fortnite</em>, you need a hook.</p><div><p>We’ve seen this play out with the few games that have managed to carve out some longevity in the space. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/13/17003856/sea-of-thieves-game-preview">Rare’s pirate sim <em>Sea of Thieves</em></a> is unlike any other virtual world, while Riot cleverly saw room in the <em>Counter-Strike</em> market when it launched <em>Valorant</em>. These experiences also keep expanding their presence in terms of both content and platforms; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079090/hi-fi-rush-ps5-xbox-release-date"><em>Sea of Thieves</em> hit PS5 this year</a> while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173544/valorant-ps5-xbox-release-date-riot"><em>Valorant</em> made its debut on consoles</a>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24071317/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-video-game-great"><em>Helldivers 2</em> came out of nowhere</a> to offer a distinct co-op experience. Other smaller games have similarly managed to generate buzz with a notable gimmick, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24211078/spectre-divide-preview-mountaintop-fps-game">the dual bodies in <em>Spectre Divide</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23991851/the-finals-embark-studios-launch-xbox-ps5-pc-steam-available-now">the game show theme of <em>The Finals</em></a>.</p></div><div><p>But those kinds of sustained hits are rare, and <em>Concord</em> will almost certainly not be the last to be buried in the live-service graveyard. It probably won’t even be the last from Sony itself. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/23/23735274/sony-playstation-new-franchises-live-service-games-business">The company previously announced plans to go hard in the space</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953640/sony-pushes-back-its-live-service-game-ambitions">then scaled those ambitions back considerably</a>. (Those early plans were the main impetus for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/15/23220335/bungie-sony-acquisition-complete-official-done">spending so much on <em>Destiny</em> developer Bungie</a>.)</p></div><p>It’s becoming increasingly clear that there’s no such thing as too big to fail when it comes to a live-service game, which means that a lot of the high-profile releases coming out soon are not sure things. That includes the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23735830/bungie-marathon-sci-fi-pvp-extraction-shooter">Bungie’s <em>Marathon</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24113437/marvel-rivals-trailer-netease-pc-mcu-disney">NetEase’s <em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game">Valve’s <em>Deadlock</em></a>. (If you think Valve is immune to failure, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314103/valve-ending-development-artifact-tcg-dota-2">might I point you to the existence of <em>Artifact</em></a>.) They might not shut down as quickly as <em>Concord</em>, but it’s not inconceivable that any of them could fail to garner enough sustained attention.</p><p>In the post announcing the game’s closure, Ellis said that <em>Concord</em>’s developers were going to “explore options, including those that will better reach our players.” Most likely, that means the game might appear again in the future, with a free-to-play structure and maybe some gameplay tweaks. But addressing those core problems will be a lot tougher than that. When every game wants all of your time, players need a really good reason to give up their favorites. That’s what <em>Concord</em> was missing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following the announcement that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord will be closing down</a> just a mere two weeks after launch, players have resorted to just jumping off the maps in order to grind XP and get their Platinum trophy.</p>



<p>Posted to X (formerly Twitter), user @realradec showed how most, if not all, Concord games in the mode ‘Rivalry’ now play out.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to the user, this is the fastest way to gain XP and, thus, the fastest way to get the Platinum trophy before the game shuts down.</p>



<p>PlayStation will take the game offline on September 6 and “explore options, including those that will better reach our players”.</p>



<p>The PlayStation blog reads that “Concord sales will cease immediately and we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased the game for PS5 or PC.”</p>

			<p>Releasing only a PlayStation 5 Pro digital model would help Sony keep the system's price down, as the Japanese company seems to be struggling to contain production costs.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry commented on the yet-to-be-revealed new system and a recent<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/"> leak</a> that suggests a digital model could be the only one to get released. Looking at the split between the PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation 4 Pro, which was close to 80 to 20 in favor of the base model, there's little doubt that the PS5 Pro is going to be a niche model. As such, it's unlikely Sony will bifurcate the market after having done so already with the base model.</p>
<p>In addition, the system's price is definitely going to be a concern. Sony seems unable to keep the production costs low, as suggested by the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-gets-price-rise-in-japan-increasing-by-90/">base model's price increase in Japan</a>. In this regard, releasing only a PlayStation 5 Pro digital model would help the company keep the price low and make the system more enticing, given how the price is undoubtedly going to be higher than that of the base model due to the hardware under the hood.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a PlayStation 5 Pro digital model only release could create some other issues with the enthusiast crowd it targets, which often gravitates toward physical copies of games. The system is most likely going to be compatible with the detachable disc drive, but that would add to the cost of upgrading. Still, Digital Foundry finds that releasing only a digital model would make more sense.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p>Reliable insider Jeff Grubb recently revealed on <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jeffygrubbgrubb/post/C_d1YEePg7G?xmt=AQGz8EE7MeQtLaXWuYFR61AQVYELKGUkC0sncHaT1Rk4IVU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Threads</a> that an announcement for the Destiny mobile game, ‘Destiny Rising’ could come “soon”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, a known gaming news source, Kurakasis, stated that Destiny Rising is “an unannounced Destiny mobile game” developed by Bungie. Jeff Grubb added to the news, saying that this information is indeed “real” and that “not many people from Bungie” are working on it. Grubb said that the game might receive an announcement soon.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the comment section, Grubb was also asked whether he knew what type of game Destiny Rising would be. He replied, “It’s going to be Destiny on mobile but with a lot of changes”. Grubb provided an example, stating that the developers will include “hero characters” instead of allowing players to build their own characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bungie announced large-scale layoffs and restructuring in July 2024, letting go more than 200 employees. During that time, information about ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-was-bungies-payback-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Payback</a>‘ popped up. Payback was supposed to be a completely different style of game set in a Destiny universe but was cancelled a few months ago to allow Bungie to work on more “imminent games.” It seems that this Destiny mobile game was one of the titles that survived the restructuring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-regrets-guitar-hero-destiny/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer</a> recently admitted that he regrets passing on games like Destiny and Guitar Hero. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-cheat-seller-appeal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the court has denied the cheat seller’s appeal</a> over the $4.3 million win to Bungie. What are your thoughts on the Destiny Mobile game? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

Those with a penchant for pageantry can leverage a delightful and downright deadly set of tools to craft their very own dungeons. Others with a taste for adrenaline can then run the gauntlet solo or in groups of up to four players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although the title will launch with a set of courses cobbled together by developer Glowmade–the UK studio founded by Media Molecule and Lionhead veterans in 2015–</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>King of Meat</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will ultimately need players to buy into the idea of crafting their own devilish dungeons if it wants to go the distance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer at Gamescom 2024 about how Glowmade intends to stack </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>King of Meat's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Create Mode–which is where players can turn their own dreams into somebody else's nightmares–with tools that compel and delight, studio co-founder and creative director Jonny Hopper explains the team had a simple mantra.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A consistent visual language is key to empowering creators">A consistent visual language is key to empowering creators</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It has got to be hard to make something bad," says Hopper. "There's a midline, which is where most of us can sit, where we can put stuff together and make a level. It has to be simple to make the basics and hard to make something that's unworkable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hopper notes Glowmade sought to create a toolkit that felt "tactile." That means every tool or item that players can leverage should behave in ways that meet, rather than subvert, expectations. "What we're doing is giving [players] this tactile toolkit built around visual things," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There are a bunch of menus, but when you place down a spinning spike trap it does what you expect it to do every time. That's how we approached visual language. You know, a button is a button. We chose to go down the route of 'here's your button, it's a pressure pad,' rather has making players construct all the logic to make their own pressure pad."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In honing that visual language, the studio looked to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario Maker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for inspiration. Fellow Glowmade co-founder Mike Green feels that project worked because players approached it with an innate understanding of how items and abilities function in a Super Mario level. That subconscious knowledge ensured it felt approachable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In our first game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>WonderWorlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we had a really comprehensive logic system. You could do so much in that game, but it made it inherently more complicated. If you wanted to make a door, for instance, you couldn't just put a door down. You had to build a thing out of wood and then put rotators on it," says Green.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But you know, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Maker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, everyone knows Super Mario so we all know what a green pipe does and how the enemies work. What I like about it is there's just this consistency. It doesn't matter what level you go into, because you know how these things behave."</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xPmUWMUKWQY?si=eRzdKwK9QYA69Rvf" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Green explains Glowmade is using the same technology it deployed in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>WonderWorlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to rapidly prototype gameplay tools and objects. That means the team can iterate quickly, building new items before reviewing and refining them to create "better versions" that can be coded up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those impending additions are approved or rejected based on whether they're enjoyable to use and feel intuitive. Some of the most obvious red flags during that vetting process is the demand for specificity and complexity over simplicity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I remember there have been conversations where there has been a very specific request, which is very much a case of 'I need to solve this incredible edge case of a problem that I have invented and I would like this tool to do it," says Hopper.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At that point we need to step back because that's just adding complexity for a tiny, tiny edge case. Does it really solve a problem, or is it just helping you in [this one instance]? We need to keep that balance between what a professional level designer wants in an all-encompassing level design tool and what we should offer to everyone else."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite their insistence that UGC tools need to be universally approachable, Hopper acknowledges there'll be groups of players who simply want to create–and others who purely want to play. With that in mind, he suggests </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>King of Meat</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> needs around 10 percent of players to really commit to creation in order to deliver sustainable success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If 10 percent of the player base [choose to create] then that's great. If 10 percent of what they make is any good, then you've basically got more levels than you're ever going to need," he says. "You don't need 100 million players for that to be viable. That's our success metric."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> fans have pledged more than $2m to ensure a new, official board game version of CD Projekt Red's role-playing game is made.
</p>
<p>
The crowdfunding campaign for Cyberpunk 2077 - The Board Game on <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/go-on-board/cyberpunk-2077-the-board-game">GameFound</a> obliterated its initial $100k goal in just 10 minutes and four seconds. As of writing, almost £2.1m has been pledged, and counting. 16 days of the campaign remain.
</p>
<p>
This tabletop version of Cyberpunk 2077 sees you taking on missions and follow branching, replayable stories as V, Panam, Jackie or Judy across Night City. It's been created by Game On Board, the company that previously made a couple of official The Witcher board games, with support from CD Projekt Red itself.

<p>
A standard edition of the Cyberpunk 2077 board game will set you back $79 (about £60) and include stretch goals that would otherwise cost extra once the base game is launched. 
</p>
<p>
A fancier deluxe edition costs $139 (about £106), upgrades various tokens from cardboard to plastic, and includes deluxe stretch goal rewards.
</p>
<p>
Back in the world of video games, work has begun on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiplayer-being-considered-for-cyperpunk-2077-sequel-says-cd-projekt">may finally include the franchise's long-awaited multiplayer option</a>. Don't expect Cyberpunk 2078, or whatever the game ends up being called, for a while though. The bulk of CD Projekt is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-the-witcher-4-will-enter-full-production-soon">currently focused on its upcoming fourth major The Witcher game</a>, which is set to release first.

<p>As with previous months, five percent of Choice membership will go towards charitable causes.</p>
<p>This month, Humble is supporting Action Against Hunger, which is committed to ending world hunger. "The organisation works to save the lives of malnourished children while providing communities with access to safe water and sustainable solutions to hunger," Humble explains. "With 30 years of expertise in emergency situations of conflict, natural disaster, and chronic food insecurity, ACF runs life-saving programs in some 40 countries benefiting seven million people each year."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQGddOAZGLU">learn more about Action Against Hunger here</a>.</p>
<p>(And a quick note - Eurogamer has covered Humble for years, but the company is now also a part of the same parent company, IGN Entertainment.)</p>
<p>As for the games themselves, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is an action-adventure game from Eidos-Montréal which gives us an original take on Marvel's oddball spacefaring family. "Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is enjoyable enough at times, but weighed down by a deluge of unnecessary systems and bullet-sponge combat," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-breezy-but-unfocused-action">Eurogamer's Guardians of the Galaxy review</a>.</p>
<p>For more, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guardians-of-the-galaxy-developer-addresses-square-enix-sales-expectations-how-it-wanted-to-create-a-new-marvel-ip">I spoke with the team behind Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a> back in 2022 all about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s sales expectations and how it wanted to create a new Marvel IP.</p>
<p>Coral Island, meanwhile, is a tropical farm life sim heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>'s more modern take on the genre. However, it sets itself apart with a focus on ocean exploration and conservation.</p>
<p>Coral Island was published by Humble Games, and developer Stairway Games recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/coral-island-developer-blames-humble-games-layoffs-for-leaving-switch-port-in-a-place-of-uncertainty">blamed layoffs at the publisher for leaving its Switch port "in a place of uncertainty"</a>.</p>
<p>Next up, You Suck at Parking - which incidentally is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-titles-for-september-include-big-rigs-in-space">leaving Xbox Game Pass later this month</a> - tasks players with parking their car as quickly as possible, regardless of any style or finesse. "It's a hot race against the clock as you drift, cruise, and go airborne over 250 frustratingly fun, wild levels," the game's description boasts.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-dlc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon%E2%80%99s-dogma-2-dlc-may-be-in-the-works-judging-from-some-recent-findings.971565/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-dlc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Dragon's Dogma 2 DLC expansion seems to be in the works, and its reveal could be edging closer, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As reported on the Gaming Leaks subreddit, there's been some behind-the-scenes activity on Steam. According to the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2054970/dlc/">Steam Database</a>, there have been some encrypted DLC updates that have only been affecting the game's main app, as well as multiple updates for an unnamed DLC pack that has been in the works for at least 5 months.</p>
<p>With this type of behind-the-scenes activity, there's usually something cooking, so it could definitely be the same for Dragon's Dogma 2. Still, without an official announcement, we should take everything with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>This month's Tokyo Game Show would be the perfect avenue to show how the Dragon's Dogma 2 project is still alive following the departure of its director <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/">Hideaki Itsuno</a>. The first game's Dark Arisen expansion, which turned the whole game into a memorable action RPG with tons of tweaks and improvements, was directed by Kento Kinoshita, who also worked as a lead designer on the sequel, so there's a good chance that he will lead the further development of the game and its potential expansions, and possibly a new entry in the series, from now on.</p>
<p>In its current state, Dragon's Dogma 2 is definitely not the game that should have been. While the experience is fine for the most part, it feels more like a reboot of the original than a proper sequel, with some under-baked features that fail to reach their full potential. You can learn more about the game by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">review.</a></p>

</div><div>



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babbdi">Babbdi</a> was a game of stark and severe Brutalist aesthetics, and also, a game about playing scales with a trumpet, walljumping with a baseball bat and using a leafblower to fly. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-a-brutalist-city-with-climbing-axes-and-a-trumpet-in-this-great-free-indie-game">Snuck out over winter 2022</a>, it was a sombre but delightful freebie with immense though well-hidden imagination, in which your only explicit objective was to find a way out of a small concrete city.</p>
<p>Now, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Technically, this isn't news. Straftat has been public knowledge since last year - find some unedited WIP capture from March below. But this is the first time I've laid eyes on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2386720/STRAFTAT/">the Steam page</a>, and I adhere to the epistemological position that reality only exists when it is observed. As such, I consider it entirely logical and coherent to assert that Straftat has <em>only</em> existed as of the writing of this news post. You're welcome.</p>

<p>There are several schools of thought on the name. One is that Straftat is German for "criminal offence", perhaps a reference to, like, an edgy Berlin club of some kind. There are certainly many offences being committed in the game, from crimes against windows (Straftat is part of the unofficial defenestration genre recently re-popularised by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tactical-breach-wizards">Tactical Breach Wizards</a>) to crimes against fashion.</p>
<p>Another take on the name is that it's an abbreviation of, like, "Strafe Tactics", a Modern Warfarelike techno-flourish that seems out of synch with the game's bleached and swooping vibes. And thirdly, there's the argument that Straftat is "Tat Farts" written backwards, which is the speculation I favour - it certainly describes a lot of free-to-play live service games. I'm not clear how Lemaitre Bros are funding development of Straftat, but then again, I wasn't clear how they funded development of Babbdi either - will they be selling those hats and hairdos or allowing player-trading, a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike </a>and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo</a>? Whatever their approach is, I hope it carries on working.</p>
<p>I really like the pace and variety and energy of this, and it's a pleasure to see the developers' talent for first-person environments applied to such a vast album of maps, though I naturally have some concerns about diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Some of the maps are more suspenseful with fog and trees, almost Darkroot Garden-esque, while others are fleshed-out urban spaces with signage and props that might have been cribbed from Babbdi's infrastructure. The combat gives me flashbacks to the duelling communities of games like the Jedi Knight series. It doesn't look like there's any progression bullshit to worry over - just on-map power-ups. You can learn more over on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/qeMEaMEkDa">developer Discord</a>.</p>
<p>Too upbeat for a game with Brutalist architecture? You might prefer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazingly-grim-retro-sci-fi-android-spelunker-lorns-lure-finally-has-a-release-date">Lorn's Lure</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
