		<p>Marc Meyer, President of Oxide Games, announced on the Official Xbox Podcast that the 4X grand strategy game, Ara: History Untold, will be released on September 24th. Additionally, it will be accessible on PC Game Pass from day one. Ara: History Untold will be sold on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2021880/Ara_History_Untold/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ara-history-untold/9pddrvkpf6kg">Microsoft Store</a> too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ara: History Untold Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rydV9OxFzwA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Ara: History Untold has a living world where life can be observed from planes flying in the sky, to kids playing in playgrounds, and wildlife roaming the natural habitats. In each new game, the world of Ara: History Untold will be randomly generated. The aim in Ara: History Untold is to become the most powerful and prestigious country, which can be done through multiple means. There is the classic way of conquest to expand territory and exerting military power, to being an economic or religious powerhouse. Your nation can even gain Prestige as a nation that leads as a beacon of hope.</p>
<p>In the podcast, Marc Meyer said, “<em>Each of the leaders has sort of this unique hero trait that that sets them apart from everyone else. They’ve got these set of traits that they share with each other and they kind of dictate a little bit of the underlying pieces of their personality and they dictate how they’re going to get along with each other… It lets us have a huge variety in the different leaders that we offer and so that playing each one of them is very different. As your nation grows, and as you gather people, you’ll gain claims that will let you take over pieces of land and grow your empire and find new places to build and new resources to exploit. And so, it’s all this self-fulfilling system where you grow so that you can grow more, and you can get more land and you can get more resources. And then you take those resources, and you refine them through our crafting system to produce amenities that will improve the quality of life of your people.”</em></p>

<p>Meyer also spoke about how multiplayer works in Ara: History Untold. The game will use a simultaneous turns, where everyone submits their move at the same time. The game will then resolve the moves at the same time, instead of completing one action at a time for each player. This is seen as a fairer way because it means all players have a chance at claims, regardless of if they submit first or last.</p>

For folks looking to do everything, the creative director suggested between 50 to 60 hours. </p><p>“For a guy with a family and a job, it’s still a fair amount of time,” Gerighty told <em>VGC</em>, “But it’s not <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> epic, 200 hours’ worth of gameplay. So that allows us to really focus on the detail, it allows us to focus, maybe with a smaller team, on executing something that is manageable.”<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894">In <em>Kotaku’s </em>hands-on preview of <em>Outlaws</em></a></span>, Alyssa Mercante noted the amount of detail on display in the game, explaining that she sometimes just wanted to stop playing and look around the incredibly dense <em>Star Wars</em> locales in the game’s SGF demo. So it seems that the decision to focus on quality over quantity will pay off in the long run. </p><h2 id="h13107"><a id=""></a>You can’t swim in <em>Outlaws</em>, but you can play arcade games</h2><p>Elsewhere in <em>VGC’s </em>interview, the creative director behind <em>Outlaws </em>explained that he’s a “big believer” in creating a plan early on that is “exciting, ambitious” but also “achievable.” </p><p>As an example of making sure the game doesn’t get too big or hard to manage, Gerighty shared a story about how, early on, Massive wanted to add swimming to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-pc-xbox-ps5-timeline-1851141003&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-pc-xbox-ps5-timeline-1851141003"><em>Outlaws</em></a></span>. </p><p>“So, for example, removed – we wanted swimming, like the first few iterations of the pitch that we did, we’d have loved to have had swimming. It’s not possible, animation said, it’s not possible in terms of the scope. So, OK, we can live without that, we’ll do without it, there’s plenty of other things that we can explore,” said Gerighty. <br></p><p>But, the director also explained that sometimes plans change and you end up making stuff you never intended to when you first started development. </p><p> “All of the mini-games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-video-game-arcade-canon-ubisoft-gamer-1851531170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-video-game-arcade-canon-ubisoft-gamer-1851531170">[like Sabacc and the arcade games</a></span>] that we have...none of those were planned originally, so those were added during the development, so there’s a little bit of give and take.”</p><p>  <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> launches  August 30 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="257" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Aksys Games has announced that the next installment of their <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-fitness-boxing/">Fitness Boxing</a></em> series is coming West this Fall. Previously announced for Japan, <em>Fitness Boxing feat. Hatsune Miku</em> is a version of <em>Fitness Boxing</em> that features <em>Hatsune Miku</em>, if that wasn’t clear.</p> <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">If you’re unfamiliar, <em>Fitness Boxing</em> is an alleged exercise game where you perform various boxing punches in time to pop music instrumentals. If you’re unfamiliar with <em>Hatsune Miku</em>, she’s a Vocaloid voicebank that broke free from her software prison to become a full-fledged pop star. If you’re unfamiliar with Vocaloid, it’s a voice synthesizer so you can experience what it’s like to control a computerized voice before they control us.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Fit Boxing feat. 初音ミク -ミクといっしょにエクササイズ- [Nintendo Direct&nbsp;2023.9.14]" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLV7C14B_80?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="672" data-injectable="true">It’s not a terribly weird mix when you consider that <em>Hatsune Miku</em> is a music… thing and <em>Fitness Boxing</em> is a rhythm game. However, she’s not what I think of when I think about fitness or boxing. We last saw <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-download-fitness-boxing-fist-of-the-north-star/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fitness Boxing: Fist of the North Star</a></em>, and while that’s a license that isn’t focused on boxing, it is at least fighting-adjacent. Punches are often thrown.</p>
 <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false"><em>Fitness Boxing feat. Hatsune Miku </em>will set you up to train with Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Rin, Kagamine Len, and Megurine Luka, with Lin and Evan from the core <em>Fitness Boxing</em> series joining as instructors. I don’t know who any of these people are. It will feature 24 songs from Piapro, along with “Melt” and “The Vampire” which I’m guessing are popular.</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="642" data-injectable="true">I don’t have much familiarity with <em>Hatsune Miku</em>. I was considering getting <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-fitness-boxing-2-rhythm-and-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fitness Boxing 2</a></em>, since I recently started taking Muay Thai kickboxing lessons. Not that I think it will <em>help</em>, but it might at least be fun exercise that aligns somewhat with my new interest.</p>
 <p data-characters="178" data-current-count="178" data-injectable="false"><em>Fitness Boxing feat. Hatsune Miku</em> has a vague release date of Fall for the West on Switch. It’s already out in Japan and is supposed to come out in the rest of Asia on July 12.</p>

It’s the best excuse to load up <em>Warframe</em> and do something interesting while watching everything unfolding at TennoCon 2024 online.</p>

There are rare drops happening throughout the day, including a free Saryn Prime from the Prime Vault and Arthur’s AX-52 weapon. I’m really excited about the latter here because the expansion looks so great, and I want any part of it I can get. </p>
 <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">Players who keep an eye on the <a href="https://x.com/PlayWarframe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Warframe</em> social accounts</a> will notice that some competitions for giveaways have already started. There’s going to be opportunities to win an MSI Claw, a <em>Warframe</em> hat, and a <em>Warframe</em> Kishi Ultra Controller. Those who think they’ve got some digital photography skills can submit their <em>Warframe: 1999</em>-themed screenshots to be in with a chance of being rewarded with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warframe-hotfix-adds-protea-prime-alongside-small-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Protea Prime</a> if they’re lucky.</p>

 <p data-characters="170" data-current-count="170" data-injectable="false">Fans can also attend a set of workshops at TennoCon 2024.

Players can meet the voice actors and developers behind the game, see reveals before anyone else in the world, and hang out with those they’ve met while playing online. This year’s event feels electric because of the impeccable style of the focal expansion, <em>Warframe: 1999</em>, and I can’t wait to see more of it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-reveal-trailer-bad-bowie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I know that a new video game is more than just its initial trailer. And I know that a game that’s been in development for as long as the new <em>Dragon Age</em> is bound to be compared to the imagined, perfect version of it in my mind. And I know that, as a fan of <em>Dragon Age</em>, as long as I get to kill Solas I will be fine. But still the question remains: why did the reveal trailer for <em>Dragon Age: Veilguard</em> suck so bad?</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Reveal Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4F3N4Lxw4_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Veilguard</em> having a weird and bad trailer is part of the long legacy of EA not knowing how the fuck to market their own games. <em>Dragon Age</em> has been the victim of this before—for whatever reason, a 2009 trailer for <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrFSKkQRW8A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“This Is The New Shit” by Marilyn Manson</a>. It was a bizarre choice for a dark fantasy game at the time, and now gives the game the stink of being associated with an artist who has been <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/marilyn-manson-sued-sexual-assault-minor-1234670671/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credibly accused of sexual assault by multiple women</a>, including in <a href="https://people.com/marilyn-manson-settles-lawsuit-over-sexual-assault-and-abuse-allegations-before-trial-begins-8303153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one case assaulting a minor</a>.</p><p>Given what I know about <em>Dragon Age</em>’s fanbase (this game has broken up more than one real life friendship that I know of because someone played <em>Inquisition</em> and then fell in love with Solas and got very defensive about their new parasocial relationship with a fictional bald elf who committed genocide and wants to do it again), licensing a David Bowie song for this new trailer seems, at first, like a better choice. But the pieces just don’t come together. While I think that the art style looks much better in the gameplay video, combined with the Whedonesque quips, it comes off like <em>Dragon Age</em> with all the rough edges sanded off.&nbsp;</p><p>As a player, those rough edges—the places where the characters are alienated by your choices as a player, or where the lore doesn’t quite make sense so you get <em>more</em> lore to make it all sort of congeal, or where the writing humanizes characters who would otherwise be irredeemable—those things are <em>Dragon Age</em> to me. Not necessarily darkness and grittiness, like a Marilyn Manson song choice suggests, but a sense of a world that is much bigger than simply good and evil, light and dark.</p><p>Most frustrating is this really weird cover of one of David Bowie’s best songs ever. It’s “Heroes” interpreted as an unironic arena rock song rather than a melancholic longing for the idea of heroism that the singer knows doesn’t actually exist. It is such a wrongheaded rendition of the song that it honestly feels disrespectful of the dead. Worse than that, it does a poor job of setting the tone of what the wildly different and much better gameplay reveal trailer shows: this is a game where one of the members of your party has to stop their old friend from ending the world. The original version of the song would have matched that tone handily!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Gameplay Reveal" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The gameplay trailer does actually show all the things I wanted to see. It is much darker in tone and also in its color palate. The dramatic lighting does a lot of work to highlight the sharp edges in the stylized art, bringing it closer to <em>Dishonored</em> than <em>Overwatch</em>. It also demonstrates the central conflict of the story in a much better way, and in a way that makes the stakes much clearer. You aren’t just getting a team together for some generic purpose. You’re in the final act of a conflict that has been brewing for centuries, and the way you navigate it will be reflected in the world and characters.</p><p><em>Dragon Age</em> is a series that differentiates itself from the glut of dark fantasy slop in its specifics. The <em>Veilguard</em> reveal trailer doesn’t really show you any of that—I’m happy to know that it’s there, but I wish EA had a better understanding of the game they’re trying to sell.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sigma-ruined-ninja-gaiden-2-ninja-gaiden-sigma-2-so-a-modder-is-fixing-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ninja Gaiden</em> for Xbox is one of the greatest games ever made. When it came out in 2004 it was a jaw-dropping HD showpiece for the console. Mechanically, it is a work of art that turned basic actions in a space into a ballet of violence. Few games since have felt as good, and one of the few that does was the follow-up <em>Ninja Gaiden II </em>for the Xbox 360. Of course, <em>II</em> was not initially perfect: the game was badly optimized, brutally difficult, unbalanced and about a third too long. As a result it was not received as well as the first game. So when it came time to port <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em> to other platforms like the PS3 with <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</em>, Team Ninja radically changed the game. That is the version you can buy on Steam, and a <em>lot </em>of diehard fans dislike it. One modder has spent years building modding tools to right the wrongs of <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="NGII | how to smartly use delimbs" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sjhN2jaKWV8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The delimb system and obliteration techniques are key to the flow of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em>.</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Ninja Gaiden II </em>&nbsp;features many radical changes from its predecessor. Both games are unforgiving character action games, but <em>Ninja Gaiden II </em>introduced several key mechanics that changed the way it is supposed to be played, starting with delimbing. Foes in the game can have limbs severed but still fight. A delimbed foe is easy to finish with a move called an Obliteration Technique. Delmibed foes can also be tactically spaced, but those foes are prone to far riskier moves, oftentimes throwing themselves at you in explosive, self-destructive attacks. Furthermore, the overall balance of the game shifted between <em>I</em> and <em>II</em>. <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>is a more defensive game, one that rewards cautious action, while <em>Ninja Gaiden II </em>is far more aggressive, rewarding a player who presses their advantage. What’s more, <em>Ninja Gaiden II </em>downright throws enemies at you, often too many for the Xbox 360 to handle.&nbsp;</p><p>This poor performance is no longer an issue thanks to emulation and backwards compatibility. The original version of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em> will run like butter on a Series X thanks to the fantastic job Microsoft did with backwards compatibility (you can still purchase and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ninja-gaiden-ii/BSCSRTX27ZH3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download it here</a>, as well as the best version of the first game, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ninja-gaiden-black/C17KKS83S9GS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ninja Gaiden Black</em></a>), but that version is exclusively limited to the Xbox ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>This fight is boring. Credit: Tecmo Koei</figcaption></figure><p>The re-release of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em>, dubbed <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2,</em> is a very different situation. It was first introduced on the PS3, and so many changes were made to compensate that they threw the baby out with the bathwater. Mission structure was retooled and optimized, and one very mediocre boss was replaced. The lighting was tweaked. Several bosses were added, like a big Buddha statue and The Statue of Liberty. These fights are mindless and awful, and both bosses devolve into the player slashing at their hands until they die. New weapons and side missions with other characters were added; these side characters have very interesting movesets, but the missions themselves add nothing to the overall experience. The worst change, however, is that <em>Sigma 2</em> radically reduces the number of enemies on the screen and makes them far less aggressive. The rate at which your weapons delimb enemies is also radically reduced, completely altering weapon balance and flow. Instead of managing a swarm of murderous foes, you are instead dealing with a few somewhat spongey enemies. For all of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em>’s flaws, and there are many, that is seen by many hardcore fans (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/comments/96ot09/comment/e4256ff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but not all</a>) as<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1580780/discussions/0/3112531165377352543/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an unforgivable slight</a>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN 2 &amp; NINJA GAIDEN SIGMA 2 : COMPARISON OF CHAPTER 11 to 14" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VDAiYc_sy8A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A comparison of the two releases.</figcaption></figure></div><h4><strong>Undoing the damage.</strong></h4><p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/ninjagaidenmastercollection/mods/292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Black</em></a> is an in-development overhaul of the <em>Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection</em> version of <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 </em>by modder Fiend Busa. It’s an attempt to undo the changes done in the remastering process in the most readily available version of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior to the mod, Fiend Busa had no substantial history with modding. “As soon as [<em>Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection</em>] was released for PC - I was learning as I was going the entire way,” he told me via Discord.&nbsp;</p><p>Busa has been working on it for more than three years, dissecting the code daily trying to figure out how it works and teaching himself Assembly in the process. For a while the mod ran on<a href="https://cheatengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Cheat Engine</a>, but as of the last month that is no longer the case, and the newest version of the mod is in Alpha. It adds back respawns previously removed, and makes many under the hood tweaks. As of this writing, the current version of the mod is only playtested on the ultra hard Master Ninja difficulty, but in the coming weeks it will be ported to other difficulties in the game.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Fiend Busa dissected the game by hand over a period of years dissecting how it works. For the recently added UI changes, he used GPT-4 to write the code. Credit: Tecmo Koei</figcaption></figure><p>“In terms of feel, the big one is micro stuttering,” Busa said when I asked about the changes between the vanilla and <em>Sigma</em> versions of the game “In <em>Sigma 2</em>, when you perform certain actions such as Izuna drop, OT, delimb an enemy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4HKw7Hqqd0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game purposely freezes the frame</a> (I assume this was to give added "oomph"). There are some slight differences in attacks but I won't get into that too much as most casual players will not notice it.”</p><p>“The other complaint I hear a lot is regarding AI aggression, where <em>NG2</em> enemies are more aggressive than <em>NGS2</em>. For [the] majority of the enemies they behave exactly the same and the difference comes in grab speeds, if enemies can grab you on block etc. There are changes to attack properties and such, but these changes only the pro players will notice them (and can be modified pretty easily).”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="NGS2B - Quick Run of 0.9" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b9SHEAmtVaM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Fiend Busa regularly streams the development progress of the mod on his YouTube channel. Here is a quick look at version 0.9.</figcaption></figure></div><p>“The third biggest one is delimb,” he said. “Each enemy is essentially assigned a ‘delimb resistance value.’ What it seems like they did in <em>Sigma 2 </em>was for certain enemies they basically upped the delimb resistance by 50% (i.e., [Incendiary Shuriken] Ninja) and then <em>Sigma 2 </em>decided to also add additional properties to certain moves that would bypass the resistance so even if you set the delimbs to very high certain moves such as (scythe wall throw) would ignore it.”</p><p>I asked how he was getting the mod to run as close to the original game as possible. “Most [of] the stuff in <em>Sigma 2</em> [is] just ‘disabled’ so the majority of it is debugging and ‘enabling.’ Certain stuff is a bit more complex as it's not 1:1 so I would end up hooking into multiple functions to get it working exactly how I want and as close to <em>NG2 </em>as possible.”&nbsp;</p><p>For the spawns, Fiend Busa wrote his own custom spawn system and simply played the original game in the 360 emulator <a href="https://xenia.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xenia</a>. “I essentially just run through Xenia to note down the amount of enemies spawning per battle, enemy type, and deleted battles and punch those into my spawn system.” In some cases, like in the area around the Buddha statue fight, Busa added enemies to make the game harder than it originally was.</p><figure><figcaption>Some of the additions from <em>Sigma 2</em>, like the side characters, are good and may be integrated into the mod at a later date. Credit: Tecmo Koei</figcaption></figure><p>Busa sees possibilities outside of simply returning <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</em> to its original state. Down the line, he wants to make the additional content an on/off toggle, and he believes that the spawn system could be used to add custom difficulties to the game, potentially adding fiend variants of the side characters as enemies.</p><h4><strong>Enter the Ninja&nbsp;</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>Gore is a hallmark of Ninja Gaiden II that was patched out in Sigma 2. Above: Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Black. Credit: Tecmo Koei</figcaption></figure><p>While writing this article, the only difficulty in <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Black </em>with the spawns fully enabled was the ultra hard “Master Ninja” mode. Unlocking this mode requires beating the game on the hard difficulty, called “Mentor,” so I decided to make a go of that on the original <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</em>. It was a cake walk. Enemies were easy to space and slightly tedious, save for an occasional one hit insta-kill that would come out of nowhere. I got 60 percent of the way through the game on Mentor before Busa just gave me his save file. I loaded it up (noting the timer had been maxed out), started a new Master Ninja save, and immediately got my shit rocked. The game had become merciless.&nbsp;</p><p>“The core gameplay seems to reward aggressive playstyle as the more aggressive you are, enemies will back down,” Busa explained. “Next time you hop in, if you see an enemy coming your way from afar, just lightly tap an enemy close by and you'll see it'll back off (most of the time).”</p><p>With<em> Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Black </em>enabled, all of the systems immediately complemented each other better. The flow of combat was faster, room for error was shaved down to mere frames, and even when I knew exactly what to do I never felt complacent. More foes meant more possibilities to account for, but the higher delimb rate meant I was constantly decapitating enemies, the beheading animation of an Obliteration Technique giving me brief and precious windows of invulnerability. My conscious mind receded to the background and gave way to that familiar <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>flow as the game dared me to push harder, faster, and forward. In a word, It felt “correct.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="NGS2B - Quick Global Ray Tracing Comparison (SSRTGI)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VCuILyg76oM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A test of Screen Space Ray Traced Global Illumination applied to the game.</figcaption></figure></div><h4><strong>The Return Of The Ninja</strong></h4><p>If you’re wondering why I care so much about granular changes between multiple versions of a game from 2008, it’s because few games have ever matched it, including ones developed by Team Ninja themselves. It can be tempting to attribute this to the messy departure of director Tomonobu Itagaki, but the reality is that games are not made by single people, and Team Ninja still makes solid games with tight combat after Itagaki left to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_Third" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Devil’s Third</em></a>. Team Ninja’s games still have unparalleled combat. <em>Stranger of Paradise, </em>while a train wreck, is still the most interesting single-player <em>Final Fantasy</em> game since <em>Lightning Returns. </em>But<em> </em>their output often feels tethered to chasing the success of <em>Nioh,</em> and they all are burdened by comically complicated inventory systems. Though their games approach greatness, none of them, save for the totally rehauled <em>Ninja Gaiden III: Razor’s Edge,</em> have the stripped-to-the-bone clarity of vision and singular flow state of those original two <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>games.</p><p>To play a Team Ninja game today is to see a glimmer of the old games peeking through. I think Team Ninja still has it in them, and Fiend Busa agrees. “[<em>Ninja Gaiden III : Razor’s Edge’s</em>] combat was amazing and they had little time with that!” Perhaps it’s unfair to demand that from them again. But I know that they have that dog in them still. For now I’ll stick with the old games, modding <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</em> and banging my head against the unforgiving Master Ninja difficulty until Ryu Hayabusa or his spiritual successor finally returns.<br></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Wccftech recently had the opportunity to get an intimate behind-closed-doors look at <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> with a 30-minute gameplay demonstration from the Director of the title himself, Yuya Tokuda. During this hands-off demo, Capcom showcased a selection of early game content, from departing the main village and venturing out into the wilds with a map size that they’re already touting as over two times larger than previous titles and featuring a seamless transition with no loading from camp to quest.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MHWilds_Balahara_Hunt-01.bmp"></a></figure>

<p>As the player Hunter ventures out from the base camp riding on a Seikret, the new pack animal and mount for Monster Hunter Wilds, both his Palico and the Handler, Alma, tag along as well. Before getting into any combat or hunts proper, Capcom took us to one of the smaller satellite villages where the townsfolk were preparing for an imminent sandstorm. The dialogue is dynamic to inform the player of world events in real-time and they won’t be static in one place either, as villagers will wander around with their own tasks to do. Once again, the localization team is peppering in puns and comedic dialogue to help set the tone of Monster Hunter Wilds. “Cheese and thank you,” so says the local Cheesemonger, thanking the Hunter for their custom.</p>
<p>By being accompanied by a Handler for the first time in Monster Hunter Wilds, players can get a taste for emergent quest design that was introduced in a way through Monster Hunter World’s Investigations. Map markers can lead the players to quest points, but they are just as likely to discover a quest by coming across a monster in the Wilds. The enhanced map is modeled in 3D to showcase different levels of elevation and can also be freely rotated. On the map, players can see the local Upsurges where rare materials or subspecies might be more prevalent. Time of day is also a major focus of the exploration and timelines can be broken down into colored chunks, each representing a different event or opportunity depending on the time of day.</p>
<p>For the quest chosen in our Monster Hunter Wilds presentation, Tokuda-san picked out an Alpha Doshaguma from the map that was nestled within a pack of normal variants. Once a target is selected and tracking begins, Scoutflies once again illuminate a path to the target monster by way of glowing trails. Even along the way towards a quest, players will get notified of other opportunities for hunts, including one popup that mentioned that a Balahara had appeared in the region and showed off a list of possible rewards (including Decorations and jewels going by the icons shown).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MHWilds_Balahara-Hunt-04.bmp"></a></figure>

<p>It appears that players can build mobile camps around the world to prepare while out on patrol, from changing weapons and gear to grilling up a meal for the usual passive stat increases. These camps cost Guild Points to build and aren’t permanent (as the camp was destroyed later on in the demo by a Doshaguma while the player was busy in combat half a mile away). Capcom hasn’t yet mentioned if these mobile camps can be built anywhere or require fixed points as they did in Monster Hunter Rise. The Meat and Kunafa Cheese meal showed off a delicious cheese pull animation and rewarded the player with a 50-minute buff that increased their health and stamina while also providing the Defender Meal (Lo) ability that activated quite often during the following hunt.</p>
<p>After donning a Ghillie Mantle, the hunter snuck up on his target Alpha Doshaguma from the middle of the pack and was greeted with an on-screen prompt to Sneak Attack, dealing significant damage and opening a Wound on the monster as the Quest Start banner popped up to indicate he found the correct target. The Wound system is one of the new mechanics that Capcom wanted to show off during the Monster Hunter Wilds presentation and offers more than just the typical part breaks: these wounds exist as cracks in the monster’s armor, allowing the player hunter to deal with increased damage by focusing on one of these points. Each of the fourteen weapon types in Monster Hunter Wilds features a form of Focus Mode to pinpoint these weakpoints on a given monster. Players can also jump onto and grapple a monster to stab it with their hunting knife, causing little damage compared to a regular weapon but capable of toppling a monster with relative ease. One of the new attacks shown off with the Great Sword was jumping onto a monster, stabbing the sword into it, and running across its back while dragging the sword and dealing a lot of damage in a short period.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Monsters rarely want to stay in one place in Monster Hunter Wilds and will routinely try to escape when getting tired or hungry, or chase the player if they decide to book a hasty retreat. Players can take advantage of these tendencies for monsters to chase by utilizing the local endemic life to trap or damage the monster, such as a bramble bush that can slow and scratch up a large monster or stalactites that can be shot down with a slinger shot to fall onto a passing monster.</p>
<p>Turf Wars are back in Monster Hunter Wilds and just about every other monster has one reason or another to stroll up and pick a fight with both the player and his intended foe. The Balahara, a new monster introduced in Wilds that appears to be a sandy variant of the Almudron, created a quicksand pit to trap the Alpha Doshaguma and deal a modest 300-400 damage, saving the player’s sharpness from having to do a few extra strikes. While the two monsters were wrestling with each other, the sandstorm that the small village was preparing for rolled in, instantly changing the environment to a twilight setting as a weather anomaly struck. Lighting bolts rained down on the field of battle as the Balahara departed, but Alpha Doshaguma remained. The lightning also heralded the apex of the windward plains, which Capcom explained would only show up during one of these storms. The lightning dragon Rey Dau rolled up as another contended and did heavy damage with its lightning attacks, striking the Alpha Doshaguma for some 3,800 damage with a bolt.</p>
<p>Players could reap the rewards of this new kind of turf war and collect a variety of endemic life that would only appear in weather conditions such as this. A large number of Great Thunderbugs, Wiggly Litchi, Vigorslugs, and Sparkflint (perhaps a new type of Slinger Ammo given the icon when picked up) were all gatherable by Seikretback as the hunter darted around to evade lightning bolts and keep his target distracted by the apex wyvern that showed up briefly.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MHWilds_Balahara-Hunt-01.bmp"></a></figure>

<p>After the Rey Dau departed and the Alpha Doshaguma was once again on the move, the clock showed 9 minutes had passed out of the full 45-minute duration. At this point in the demo, Tokuda-san fired an SOS flare to bring in 3 NPC support hunters to help even the odds. The Alpha Doshaguma ran into yet another Turf War with the Balahara with two of them latching onto the Doshaguma, one grappling it while the other bit onto the monster. The Alpha Doshaguma was eventually able to break free and grab one of the offending Balahara, ripping its lower jaw before tossing the monster aside. Meanwhile, the player resupplied during the hunt and changed weapons to the Heavy Bowgun. It was still a relatively early-game weapon, featuring the following ammo types: Normal 3, Pierce 1, Spread 1, Sticky 2, and Cluster Bomb 1. There was also a rapid-fire attack on the Heavy Bowgun that didn’t consume any ammo but rather a separate resource gauge. Of the three NPC supports brought in, one brought a Lance, another brought a Hammer, and the third also brought in another Heavy Bowgun and would use that gatling fire ability to try and pin and stun the Alpha Doshaguma in place.</p>
<p>Even during combat, the Hunter was able to fast-travel out and change his primary weapon to a Long Sword. Sometime during this phase, the sandstorm dissipated and the environment entered a phase of abundance called The Plenty that changed up the endemic life once more. A great number of Vigorwasps showed up during this phase. It didn’t take long for the Hunter and squad to chase down the Alpha Doshaguma one last time (a skull icon appears when the target is near death, just like the previous titles) and a variety of LS techniques, including a Crimson Slash that chained from level I to level III with repeated use. Only a few seconds of fighting remained before the Alpha Doshaguma finally succumbed to its injuries, allowing the Hunter to carve up precious resources from its body.</p>
<p>Upon besting the foe, a quest completion popup appeared, and rather than returning to a lobby screen following a successful hunt, players can stay out in the Wilds and hunt down other opportunities. There were various awards and even a nameplate unlocked for quest completion, but Capcom didn’t allow us to look deeper into what those could have been. Instead, they showed off a quick tease of a new monster with three large spikes on its back and harassing it with a large barrel bomb. New for Monster Hunter Wilds, players can tip their barrel bombs over and roll them into the monster rather than always waiting for the target to approach.</p>

<p>Everything shown during the hands-off demonstration for Monster Hunter Wilds felt like a natural evolution from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator">Monster Hunter World</a>. It introduced mechanics and systems that I’ve wanted for a long time including the multiple weapon switching and being able to continue questing in an area even after completing a hunt. If anything, this brief demo only pushed Monster Hunter Wilds to the top of my most anticipated games of 2025. Capcom doesn’t have much else to say on Monster Hunter Wilds beyond a vague 2025 release date and full crossplay across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC (cross-save, however, still doesn’t seem likely).</p>

Systemically, these two games could not be more different. There will undoubtedly be people who are disappointed that <em>Dragon Age </em>is leaning harder into the action RPG subgenre after <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>pulled off the tactical approach so well, but to that I say: Just play <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>again.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="7b3ae15a0c176c949f636233123165f4" data-recommend-id="image://7b3ae15a0c176c949f636233123165f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shep smiles as Gale walks by." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shep smiles as Gale walks by." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Larian Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7b3ae15a0c176c949f636233123165f4" data-recommend-id="image://7b3ae15a0c176c949f636233123165f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shep smiles as Gale walks by." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h9436"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>what <em>Dragon Age </em>should be in 2024?

If you played <em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>in 2009 and imagined the series a decade and two console generations later, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>is probably a close approximation of what the most pie-in-the-sky version would look like. For Morton, this goes beyond sticking to tactical combat,  also involving its darker tone, as <em>The Veilguard</em>’s quippy dialogue and acrobatic action feel like something out of a modern franchise film.</p><p>Morton asks what <em>Dragon Age</em>’s identity is at this point, but I feel the series has had an identity problem for 15 years. BioWare has maintained that each <em>Dragon Age </em>game is a very specific moment in time for its universe, and that’s why it changes locations, protagonists, and styles each time. That has often been used as a shield to deflect criticism of how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/dragon-ages-shifting-perspectives-keep-undermining-its-personal-stories&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/dragon-ages-shifting-perspectives-keep-undermining-its-personal-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poorly it handles continuity and payoff</a></span>, but it’s also why I think the <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>comparison feels like clinging onto something that’s been gone for over a decade. <em>Dragon Age </em>has never been able to successfully reconcile its supposed anthology format and its desire to have interconnected stories, but it does mean that I accepted a long time ago that trying to determine what makes a <em>Dragon Age </em>is as futile as trying to determine <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xvi-16-ff16-action-rpg-combat-fans-1850587235&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xvi-16-ff16-action-rpg-combat-fans-1850587235">what <em>Final Fantasy </em>is</a></span>.</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>is going to be divisive. It already is. When you’ve spent ten years waiting for something with an idea of what it would be in your head, if it’s not that thing, you’re bound to be disappointed. But ultimately, <em>The Veilguard </em>is not trying to accomplish the same things <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>did. Its focus on action-based systems means we’re probably not going to get the highly reactive, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-esque spells and problem-solving mechanics. But it does mean we’re going to get what looks like a frenetic action RPG that continues the story we’ve been waiting a decade for. That might not be what you wanted from <em>Dragon Age</em>, but that other game exists.</p><p>We can unpack whether or not <em>The Veilguard </em>accomplishes what it’s setting out to do when it launches in the fall, but if the conversation starts and ends with “I wanted <em>The Veilguard </em>to be this specific thing,” we’re looking at the wrong franchise. After seeing <em>The Veilguard </em>pivot in such a different direction from its predecessor that inspired <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, I’m just not interested in examining it through the lens of this comparison. It’s the least interesting way to dissect art, and now, it feels like a disingenuous way to dissect these two games. We’ve got two cakes that are similar shapes but different flavors. We can eat them both.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Just over two months after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-sells-gearbox-entertainment-to-take-two-interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the deal was first announced</a>, Take-Two Interactive and Embracer Group have <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-closes-the-divestment-of-gearbox-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially completed</a> the transfer of Gearbox Entertainment.</p>



<p>“On 28 March 2024, Embracer Group AB (“Embracer”) entered into an agreement to divest Gearbox Entertainment to Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc,” Embracer said in a press release. “All conditions for the transaction have now been fulfilled, and the transaction has been closed today.”</p>



<p>The deal sees Embracer issue 8.32 million B shares at $9.56 (SEK &nbsp;98.78) to settle “certain earnout obligations”. To cover earnout obligations to Lost Boys Interactive, an addition 2.08 million B shares have been issued at a price of $7.66 (SEK 79.30) per share.</p>



<p>As part of the deal, Embracer received $460 million in newly issued shares of Take-Two Interactive.</p>



<p>A reminder that this deal includes Gearbox Software, Gearbox Montreal, and Gearbox Studio Quebec all going to Take-Two Interactive along with the Duke Nukem, Borderlands, and Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands franchises, among others.</p>



<p>Embracer retains the former Gearbox Publishing San Francisco, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gearbox-publishings-new-name-is-arc-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is now Arc Games</a>.</p>



<p>Shortly after the announcement of the deal back in March, Gearbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gearbox-layoffs-hit-staff-hours-after-being-sold-by-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was hit with layoffs</a> that saw “countless” people lose their jobs.</p>

<p dir="ltr">To opt in to the preview program, players will need to be an Xbox Insider member (which can be done via the Xbox Insider Hub app) and have Palworld (available on Game Pass) as well as the Xbox Insider Hub app installed. Inside the Xbox Insider Hub app, the option to join the Palworld Update Preview should be listed under the Previews section. Players will then install the preview update for Palworld, after which they will be able to play new upcoming features.</p><p dir="ltr">Palworld has proven to be a big hit for Xbox, with more than 10 million players having tried out developer Pocketpair's Pokemon-esque survival game within its first month. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-reaches-25-million-players-in-one-month/1100-6521294/" data-ref-id="1100-6521294">Over 25 million players have played Palworld when including PC players via Steam</a>. Palworld is not currently available on PlayStation or Nintendo Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">Not all the attention Palworld has received has been good attention, however.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/monke-simulator-is-a-parkour-game-that-lets-you-go-ape/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=monke-simulator-is-a-parkour-game-that-lets-you-go-ape<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="168" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Monke Simulator</em> demo is available as part of Steam’s Next Fest, and if you’re a fan of parkour games or surrealist primate fantasies, you should give it a look.</p> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124360/Monke_Simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monke Simulator</a></em> starts out as so many adventures do: with a group of caged apes being dropped into the heart of a volcano by a small army of drones. After breaking free of your cage, you need to jump, wall run, and dash your way to freedom. From there the game throws you into level after level of unique challenges that, at least in the demo, don’t seem to have any narrative linking them together.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-vine-grind-to-victory" data-injectable="false">Vine grind to victory </h2> <p data-characters="607" data-current-count="907" data-injectable="true">But who needs narrative when you’ve got apelike speed? Maybe these apes were being volcano dumped because of their borderline supernatural powers. Running through levels, you can slide along vines like you’re playing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/former-tony-hawks-pro-skater-devs-reveal-50-player-skateboarding-game-wrekless/">some kind of <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater </em>game</a>, and your super intelligence allows you to use tools like a grappling hook and a banana blaster. Those help you avoid deep trenches of water and break down barriers in your path, but they also let you fight the enemies that are trying to prevent you from getting your next banan (there’s no time for that last syllable in <em>Monke Simulator</em>).&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="512" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">I had an absolute blast splattering nasty humans into gore while swinging my way through the half-dozen or so levels featured in the game’s demo. In between levels you can head to a hub area to purchase upgrades and encounter a few zany apes. Tricking out my ape’s toolset gave me a solid motivation to try and earn the maximum rewards for every level. Initially I had some trouble navigating the strange forest landscapes, but once I tapped into my innate ape brain, my runs started flowing more smoothly.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-monke-see-monke-wishlist" data-injectable="false">Monke see, monke wishlist</h2> <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="774" data-injectable="true">I’m a sucker for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/splodey-is-an-explosive-die-and-retry-speedrun-game-available-today/">a good speedrunning game</a>, and <em>Monke Simulator </em>scratched that itch. I laughed out loud more than a few times when running around the various levels. Discovering a stoner monkey hideout in the game’s hub was a highlight, and blowing humans to bits with my handheld banana canon never stopped being funny. The tone is supported by some solid speedrunning mechanics, and I frequently found myself sitting on a single level until I earned my gold medal. </p>
 <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">Even the early levels featured in the demo provide a varied set of challenges and multiple paths to explore, plus there’s the upgrade system to encourage you to sharpen your skills. <em>Monke Simulator </em>only has a vague 2024 release window for now, but I’ll definitely be keeping an eye out for when developer Totem Softproducts announces the actual date. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/despite-its-best-in-class-action-selacos-pacing-is-where-it-truly-shines/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=despite-its-best-in-class-action-selacos-pacing-is-where-it-truly-shines<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="364" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You’d be forgiven for playing through the entirety of <em>Selaco’s </em>10-to-12 hour campaign and being surprised to learn that the game was not only incomplete, but only a portion of its intended length. The first episode of <em>Selaco</em> launched recently into Steam early access, but there’s more than one reason to avoid judging this shooter by its box art.</p> <h2 id="h-bringing-mindfulness-to-mayhem" data-injectable="false">Bringing mindfulness to mayhem</h2> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">Lately, I’ve been sort of half-assedly practicing that “dopamine detox” thing you see young adults try: setting screen time limits on your phone, disabling certain apps, or even just reading a book before bed instead of scrolling on my phone. It actually works, by the way; I find my time with screens a lot more engaging than I did before. Well, <em>Selaco</em> is sort of like dopamine detox in shooter form. </p>
 <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">I adore breakneck shooters like <em>ULTRAKILL</em>, <em>Turbo Overkill</em>, <em>DOOM Eternal</em>, and <em>Mullet Madjack</em>. I also find them.. kind of exhausting, after a while. Each encounter in these games demands more than just shooting or even proper positioning: they demand a dance with a death that’s double time, every time. <em>Selaco</em> is more evenly paced, punishing poor play swiftly but giving you plenty of time between shootouts to recoup.</p>
 <p data-characters="533" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">Playing on the second-hardest available option, I was regularly having to restart fights, but it wasn’t ever because I missed a super-bounce or neglected to quick-swap to the correct weapon. It was because I played carelessly. Careless play can get you pretty far in “movement shooters” like those listed above, as long as you’re carelessly moving around at Mach 9. In <em>Selaco</em>, you’re going to want to slow down, reposition, and outwit the worryingly intelligent AI before can deposit lead in your flank.</p>
 <h2 id="h-spacing-the-pacing" data-injectable="false">Spacing the pacing</h2> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">A typical fight in <em>Selaco</em> usually applies pressure (in the form of dudes with guns) from one direction, then expands to fill the gaps. Enemies flow in from set points, but will swiftly move through the available space to get the jump on you, obscured by flying debris, smoke, and dust. Your foes are deadly, tanky, and smart. Your best bet is to lay traps, think ahead, and use your tactical power slide to out-position them. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Altered Orbit Studios.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="true">Of course, if a fight goes sideways you’re almost guaranteed a long moment to gather yourself, and some resources, before the next. Rather than smashing from room to room populated with baddies, <em>Selaco’s</em> explorable space is punctuated somewhat sparsely with fights. Some people might call these moments of quiet exploration and light puzzling boring. I call them an exercise in mindfulness.</p>
 <p data-characters="544" data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true">There’s a wide range of enemy types to fight, and they evolve in both weaponry and tactics as you progress. Later on, “Squad Leaders” will intelligently command their soldiers while buffing them. If you manage to kill a Squad Leader, their underlings will helplessly scatter, ripe for the gibbing. Shotgun goons will flank so aggressively and so mischievously you’d swear they spawn in right behind you. The only way to stay alive is to peek, kill, and reposition. A dance with death, but more of a waltz than a shuffle.</p>
 <h2 id="h-a-world-worth-getting-lost-in-most-of-the-time" data-injectable="false">A world worth getting lost in.. most of the time</h2> <p data-characters="669" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">The world of <em>Selaco</em> is astoundingly rich in detail (made even more impressive when you remember it’s made in GZDoom), interactive options, cleverly-hidden secrets, and worldbuilding. While there’s no through-line of a story (yet), the environs themselves paint a clear picture of the lives of the crew and citizenry aboard this artificial ecosystem. Birthday parties held in office spaces, arcades with playable machines, and shopping malls complete with interior burger joints are just a few of the spaces you’ll be combing through between engagements. They’re liminal spaces bereft of nostalgia, replaced with an eerie, futuristic loneliness. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Altered Orbit Studios.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="801" data-injectable="true">Getting lost in such spaces is fun, for a time. There were a handful of occasions I was stuck hugging the left wall – a tried-and-true technique I use in corn mazes and the like – just to find where to go next. Green lights help most of the time, but there are a few times when a critical switch or path are just a little <em>too</em> hard to locate. I don’t think there should be a waypoint system or anything, but I think a bit more diegetic highlighting of key details would go a long way.</p>
 <p data-characters="612" data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true">If I’m making <em>Selaco</em> sound like a game about wandering liminal spaces punctuated with brief shooter action, it’s because that’s sort of what it is. There’s <em>plenty</em> of shooting to be had and it’s best-in-genre stuff, with satisfying weapons that feel and sound powerful as they shred enemies to bits. The level of viscera and flying debris is enough to make <em>Brutal DOOM</em> blush. But blasting guys is only a piece of the formula, and despite getting turned around a few times I found the interspersed methodical secret hunting and resource gathering just as essential to the experience. </p>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="false">In its current state, <em>Selaco</em> is a no-brainer for anyone who’s in the mood for something a little more <em>Half Life</em> than <em>DOOM</em>. There’s still some headway to be made in terms of storytelling, and I’d love to see some additional bosses and set pieces, but the meditative pace, tight action and incredible attention to detail across its generous runtime were more than enough to win me over.</p>

            <p>It’s been a decade - 10 years! - since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>. It’s fair to assume that you might’ve forgotten what happened during the last Dragon Age game, or some of the specific choices you made back in the misty ages of 2014. Whether you remember or not, this year’s long-awaited sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> should have you covered, with the ability to carry over your story choices from the previous game and get a refresher on what happened last time around.</p>

<p>The Veilguard - which had the objectively better subtitle Dreadwolf <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-dragon-age-game-has-a-new-name-dragon-age-the-veilguard">up until earlier this month</a>, but let’s not dwell on that - recently made a fairly big showing during Summer Game Fest, giving an in-depth look at its high-stakes fantasy drama (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-very-first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-makes-it-look-like-a-fornite-heist-movie">not as Marvel-aping as was feared</a>) that Edwin found to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">happily Mass Effect 2-evoking in tone and properly single-player RPG in form</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-allow-you-to-import-your-choices-from-previous-games-through-the-character-creator">IGN</a> caught up with director Corinne Busche to ask about some of the specifics of directly following Inquisition’s story - in which the player’s Inquisitor takes a starring role, of course - and how The Veilguard will pick up the various branches of narrative woven by players’ differing choices in its decade-old predecessor.</p>
<p>Busche was upfront in admitting that plenty of players might not even remember Inquisition’s story, revealed that The Veilguard’s character creator will open with an interactive recap that the dev dubbed “Last Time on Dragon Age”.</p>
<p>The refresher will let players remake decisions from Inquisition using a set of tarot cards - Busche assured there’ll be appropriate context to the potentially weighty choices you’re making, so you’re not just ticking a random box and hoping for the best - that then set the stage for The Veilguard to continue certain plotlines and hark back to the last game. Busche also shied away from confirming that every major character from Inquisition would appear in The Veilguard: “I won't say everybody, but yes, some of them.”</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/characters_08AwcGw.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You’ll need to go through the interactive recap whether you’ve still got your Inquisition saves to hand or not, Busche added, saying that the change in technology - again, it’s been 10 years - was significant enough that the team decided to handle the ‘importing’ solely within the new game itself. (That also implies that Dragon Age Keep, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/revisionist-history-dragon-age-keep-launched">Inquisition’s save importer</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Origins</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age II</a>, won’t be used.)</p>
<p>Once you’ve recreated your choices from Inquisition, The Veilguard’s character creation should then let you recreate your hero from the last game too, with Edwin noting that the character creator has been notably expanded with a choice of body shapes, improved hair styles and other visual knobs to play with (speaking of knobs: there’s also a custom bulge size option).</p>
<p>The Veilguard will finally release this autumn, after a decade in the works. Just about enough time to replay Inquisition if you’re after a more in-depth reminder, I’d wager.</p>

Associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois said in a new interview that fans can expect the world map of the Japan-set open-world game to be similar in size that of Assassin's Creed Origins.</p><p>"It's about roughly similar to Origins, so it's smaller than Valhalla in terms of territory," he told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-shadows-japan-is-roughly-similar-in-size-to-egypt-in-origins/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "There is some body of water around Japan, but it's not like [Odyssey's] Greece was, [which was] half water. With Japan that's not the case. We have the coastlines and lake Biwa is a very big lake, but [the map's] roughly the size of Origins."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Shadows: Extended 12 Minutes Of Gameplay Walkthrough | Ubisoft Forward</p>
      </div>
<p>The world in Assassin's Creed Shadows is "much more mountainous," Lemay-Comtois went on to say, adding that the team visited Japan to scout the local area.</p><p>Japan is a huge place and Assassin's Creed Shadows doesn't cover the whole country, of course, but it does feature major cities like Kyoto and Osaka. The developers spent time considering how much of the world they needed to put between those places to make the game feel credible but also approachable. It wouldn't necessarily be fun for Assassin's Creed Shadows to be realistic in the sense that it would take four days on horseback to get from one place to another, the developer said.</p><p>"So it's kind of a tricky thing to develop, but eventually we find our footing with the types of cities and castles that we want to represent and that’s what justifies the size of our world map," he said.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows releases on November 15 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. An extended gameplay trailer was released during the Ubisoft Forward event this week, highlighting the game's two playable protagonists and their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-showcase-highlights-its-two-very-different-gameplay-styles/1100-6524130/" data-ref-id="1100-6524130">vastly different play styles.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/wordle-uses-manga-as-a-word-some-are-baffled/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordle-uses-manga-as-a-word-some-are-baffled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you did your daily <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wordle</a> </em>this past Monday (June 10), you would have encountered the word manga. To me, this is a common-ish word that I even use when talking to my parents, but to others, this was an affront to the English language.</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">If you’re not deeply immersed in geek or Japanese culture, the word might not be familiar to you. It is a category of comic books used to denote that it is stylistically Japanese. While some would argue that only comics that originate from Japan qualify as manga, it has been applied to some works created outside the country but made in a similar style.</p> <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">As writer Dan Nyugen <a href="https://x.com/dancow/status/1800503654761586776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found and compiled</a> on Twitter, some Wordle fans were incensed by the inclusion of the word. “I never heard of this word and is not well known English language,” strained one user.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="794" data-injectable="true">New York Times Staff Editor Toni Monkovic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/shared/comment/3vjp03?rsrc=cshare&amp;smid=url-share">waded into the comments</a> to try and explain how the word was selected, stating that “MANGA cleared all three hurdles we use to decide what goes in the bot’s dictionary.” He also added that “Manga has around 740 mentions in the NYT since 2000, much more than enough for the bot.&nbsp; But … It’s worth noting that it has only around 75 mentions from 1976 to 2000.” So, if you stopped learning words after Y2K, you might not know it.</p>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">Obviously, the slew of perturbed comments are skewed to complaints because that’s what people post online. Not many are just going to comment that they thought the word was acceptable. However, the lack of knowledge about it is another reminder that I live in a different world from some people. Most bookstores I frequent now have a section specifically for manga, with graphic novels sometimes mixed in with them.</p>
 <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">And yes, the manga is a Japanese loanword. Most languages have a habit of incorporating words from other languages, and English is rife with them. For example, one of <em>Wordle</em>’s previous puzzles was “sushi,” another Japanese loanword. It’s not like they used something more obscure like “ecchi.” I shudder to think of what will happen the day that “anime” shows up in the shuffle.</p>

After recent confirmation that <em>The Boys</em> Season 5 will be the final season, showrunner Eric Kripke has now revealed that he’s actively trying to figure out a way to bring in Jared Padalecki for the show’s next season.</p> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">Kripke told <a href="https://screenrant.com/the-boys-season-5-jared-padalecki-cameo-eric-kripke-response/">Screen Rant</a> in a recent interview that he has been texting with Padalecki about this, and he would love for “Jared to come in and do a guest spot on the show.” For those unfamiliar, Jared Padalecki is known for playing Sam Winchester in <em>Supernatural</em>, the TV show directed by Eric Kripke.</p> <figure data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="The Boys – Season 4 Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EzFXDvC-EwM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">There have been several instances of actors from <em>Supernatural</em> appearing in <em>The Boys</em>, with the most obvious example being Jensen Ackles portraying Soldier Boy. Ackles and Padalecki shared the screen in Supernatural as its protagonist brothers for 15 seasons.</p> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">The Boys showrunner added that he wants to bring Padalecki to the show “not just because it’s fun to bring <em>Supernatural</em> characters onto the show, but just because I love working with people I love and if I have an opportunity to bring family back and work with family, I’ll take it and I have a lot of actors from that show who have really become family.”</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">The sentiment can be backed up the appearances we’ve had in <em>The Boys</em> by actors who have previously worked in <em>Supernatural</em>. Christian Keyes, who portayed Michael in <em>Supernatural</em>, was seen as Nathan Franklin in the show. Jim Beaver, who portrays the US Secretary of Defense in <em>The Boys</em> was <em>Supernatural’s</em> Bobby Singer.</p> <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">Moreover, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is set to play a crucial role in <em>The Boys</em> Season 4, and the actor has portrayed John Winchester in <em>Supernatural</em>, the father of Dean and Sam Winchester.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Best of Soldier Boy | The Boys | Prime Video" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4zj4ACPGpUA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="741" data-injectable="true">So, there is a clear intent from Kripke to find a way for Padalecki to show up in Season 5, but the showrunner said during the interview that the team is in “very early” stages for Season 5, and he does not have “a character in mind quite yet” for Padalecki. He concluded on a hopeful note by adding: “But I’m aiming towards it and I’m just keeping in rough touch with him so that hopefully our schedules do line up.”</p>
 <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="168" data-injectable="false">When suggested if Padalecki could play a character related to Jensen Ackles’ Soldier Boy so that they share the screen once again, Kripke said he liked that idea.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/one-btn-bosses-is-the-most-confident-steam-next-fest-demo-ive-played-so-far/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=one-btn-bosses-is-the-most-confident-steam-next-fest-demo-ive-played-so-far<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="273" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s always nice when a game presents a sole conceit and executes on it as promised. That’s exactly what you get with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1910600/ONE_BTN_BOSSES/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>ONE BTN BOSSES</em></a>, a single-screen shooter that, true to its name, has you using a single button to dodge and destroy increasingly complex bosses.</p> <p data-characters="520" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true">Games that don’t demand more than a single input aren’t necessarily anything new. There’s the whole sub-genre that <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-very-beginners-guide-to-vampire-survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire Survivors</a> </em>summoned into wider popularity, in which players need only move their characters around the screen as they automatically attack in an attempt to survive as long as possible. <em>ONE BTN BOSSES </em>doesn’t quite fit into that niche, instead tasking players with pressing a single face button to switch the direction (or another aspect) of their ship along a fixed plane.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="180" data-injectable="false">Between the simple and clean gimmick to the overall look, developer Midnight Munchies has delivered one of the most confident demos I’ve played so far during Steam Next Fest.</p> <h2 id="h-just-press-the-button" data-injectable="false"><strong>Just press the button</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true"><em>ONE BTN BOSSES </em>recently appeared as part of a showcase for Outersloth, an indie games fund created by <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/among-us-animated-tv-series-in-the-works-at-cbs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Among Us</em></a> developer Innersloth. Prior to that, an earlier version of it could be found floating on various browser game communities like <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/793986" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Newgrounds</a> dating back to 2021. Now that the team has funding, they can finally build toward the full release. There’s currently no date in place, but what’s available in the demo shows a ton of promise.</p>
 <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">In the few seconds you’re introduced to the concept at hand, you’ll know exactly what to do in this unique spin on the boss rush. As each battle begins, your ship automatically orbits the boss. That “one button” you’ve heard so much about is just there to switch the direction of your orbit. Doing so will kill your momentum, and the faster you move around the boss the faster your ship fires its bullets.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">Survival in <em>ONE BTN BOSSES </em>quickly becomes a game of risk vs. reward. If you can keep your momentum going, you’ll chip away at their health bar that much faster. Sounds easy enough, but are you sure you’ll circle the boss in time to skirt past the incoming wave of missiles? If you’d rather play it safe, you can continuously dodge left and right along the line and take your time. As the difficulty increases, though, it becomes clear that being bold and efficient has its advantages.</p>
 <h2 id="h-mix-it-up" data-injectable="false"><strong>Mix it up</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="803" data-injectable="true">While the demo just outfits you with the basic loadout at first — with at least one more unlocking after — it looks like the final game will have a lot of ways to change up your playstyle. You can customize your ship with different attack and movement upgrades, which even switches up how the button works. If the direction-swapping move isn’t cutting it, you can opt for a dash, or you can fire lasers instead of bullets. Midnight Munchies promises over 100 combinations in the final version.</p>
 <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">All told, there are 50 planned fights as far as handcrafted levels are concerned. You can choose different paths of progression along the way, so if you’re stuck on a particularly tough boss you can always try another route. Beyond the main game, there’s a roguelite-inspired R&amp;D (Rifts &amp; Discoveries) department that tosses randomly-generated bosses into the mix. New power-ups and upgrades can be picked up after fights, offering up a bunch of different playthrough possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-s-next-two-buttons" data-injectable="false"><strong>What’s next? TWO buttons?</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="657" data-current-count="957" data-injectable="true">It’s amazing what a little presentation can do. <em>ONE BTN BOSSES </em>comes out of the gate with the notion that you already get it. It has a sense of humor and its die-and-retry stylings are, at least in the small slice the demo has to share, well handled. I’m most interested in how they plan to make each boss unique without leaning on “more bullets and obstacles.” There are already examples in the demo of different type of lines for your ship that aren’t traditional orbits. One of the fights has you gliding across an angled line that teleports the ship back from one end to the other, like a looping single-screen arcade game.</p>
 <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">You can try <em>ONE BTN BOSSES </em>for yourself right now. If you don’t have time for that, the three-person dev team has been sharing some live-play broadcasts on Steam. One thing’s for sure, by the time this one launches in full, I’m pretty sure I’ll still remember how to play.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Square Enix has confirmed that Visions of Mana will be released on August 29th, and pre-orders are now live across PC and consoles. Visions of Mana was announced in December, making it the first mainline Mana entry in 15 years, and today Square Enix has released more details alongside the game’s release date.</p>
<p><iframe title="Visions of Mana | Launch Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Io4_CfCLlW4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>When it comes to the Vision of Mana characters we already know of Val and Hinna. Val is Hinna’s lifelong friend and soul guard, accompanying her on the journey to the Tree of Mana.&nbsp; Additional characters include Careena and her sacred beast companion Ramcoh, Morley of Etaern, the Moonlit Parish, Palamena who is the young Queen of Illystana, Capital of the Deep, and carer of her brother Iain, and Julien who is the custodian of Verdeus Borough. All of these characters, bar Hinna, are playable in the game.</p>
<p>Previously, we were introduced to Pikuls, giant wolf like steeds you can ride to traverse the land at speed. Pikuls are not the only creatures capable of carrying the party though. Vuscavs are turtle like creatures that allow the party to cross the seas, and the legendary Flammie can take to the skies and soar through the air. All three creatures will help you explore and find the secrets of the open world, which is also fraught with dangers.</p>
<p>Combat is a key aspect of Visions of Mana, and it is real time combat. The Ring Menu makes its return to the series, with moves equipped in this menu the only ones that can be used in combat. That will mean switching out moves for others to get the best advantage against the various foes that pose a danger to Hinna, Val, and the rest of the group. Battle parties will consist of three characters, each one with their own skills and abilities that can provide different supports. Characters are not limited and their class can be changed through the use of Elemental Vessels. These vessels can be used for combat and exploration, with the power bestowed by them unlocking new areas in the world. Each class has its own special, elemental attacks, weapons, and moves. You can equip any character with any vessel, allowing for experimentation in combat.</p>

As it turns out, most players on Steam haven’t even progressed far enough in the original game to access the DLC - something publishers Bandai Namco have now issued a friendly FYI about.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with developers FromSoftware’s other Soulsborne games, you probably weren’t expecting a straightforward “pick the DLC from the menu” kind of approach to booting up Shadow of the Erdtree. (<em>Laughs in Artorias of the Abyss</em>.) And rightly so: the upcoming expansion is hidden away behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/to-play-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-you-must-defeat-some-of-elden-rings-toughest-bosses">two of the game’s harder bosses</a>, including one right at the end of one of its more easily missable areas.</p>
<p>Those bosses are Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood. The former is fairly easy to find - if less easy to beat - as he’s the main threat in the vast region of Caelid and one of the five shardbearers you can choose to take down to advance in the main story. (You’ll have to kill at least two, but can fight as many as you like.)</p>
<p>Mohg, meanwhile, is less obvious. Spoilers abound ahead! He’s found in the <span tabindex="0">Mohgwyn Palace</span>, which can only be reached by <span tabindex="0">using a teleporter in the secret Consecrated Snowfield region</span> - accessible by <span tabindex="0">collecting two halves of a secret medallion spread around the rest of the Lands Between</span> and using it to <span tabindex="0">travel on a mysterious lift to the frosty realm</span>. From there, you’ll need to <span tabindex="0">defeat a nearby NPC invader</span> to <span tabindex="0">activate the teleporter</span>. That’s just to get to <span tabindex="0">Mohgwyn Palace</span>, mind - then it’s a case of actually fighting your way through the fairly lengthy level and <span tabindex="0">defeating Mohg himself</span>. Phew! (Luckily, the nearby area is a great place to level up - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/psa-please-leave-my-horrible-silver-frog-sons-alone-as-you-grind-for-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">unless you're a frog fan</a>.)</p>

</span></p><p>Given all that, it’s perhaps not all that surprising that almost two-thirds of Elden Ring players on Steam haven’t defeated Mohg, going by Steam achievement stats as spotted by Twitch streamer <a href="https://x.com/CohhCarnage/status/1800313422535364790">Cohh Carnage</a>. Around 38% of players have the achievement for besting the boss, while over 62% don’t have it. Bandai Namco shared the post as a “friendly PSA”, emphasising the need to have bested Mohg in time for the DLC.</p>
<p>As we already know, the entrance to Shadow of the Erdtree’s new area will be the <span tabindex="0">withered arm hanging from the cocoon behind the arena where you fight Mohg</span> - the <span tabindex="0">physical body of DLC-centric character Miquella, brother of Malenia</span>, who appeared in the original teaser for the expansion.</p>
<p>In other words, if you’re hoping to play Shadow of the Erdtree when it releases on June 21st, but are one of that 62%, you’ll need to get a wriggle on and take down Mohg asap. We do know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-more-elden-ring-dlc-after-shadow-of-the-erdtree-says-souls-boss-miyazaki">there won't be another Elden Ring DLC</a>, at least, so you've got all the time in the world to get through it. Good luck!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177048/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-set-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="a3JiZZ">Ravensburger’s successful trading card game, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/disney-lorcana"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>, is getting its fif﻿th set — <em>Shimmering Skies</em> — and it includes lots of top-tier characters you’ll want to collect. The set includes two starter decks with characters like Wreck-it Ralph, Elsa, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24175403/new-donald-duck-movie-short-diy-duck">Donald Duck</a>, to name a few. There’s also The Great Illuminary, a new location card set in a “radiant ballroom.”</p>
<p id="aDn5AD"><em>Shimmering Skies</em>, announced Wednesday in a livestream, includes gameplay mechanics that’ll be further explained closer to the release date: Aug. 9 for local game stores and Disney properties, and Aug. 23 for mass market retailers. For now, enjoy these peeks at the new cards.</p>
<p id="mmjt9n"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/14/18095040/ralph-breaks-the-internet-review-wreck-it-ralph-disney"><em>Wreck-it Ralph</em></a> makes its <em>Lorcana</em> debut with several character cards including two Vanellope von Schweetz cards and Ralph himself. The Vanellope von Schweetz, Random Roster Racer card is especially exciting, granting players the ability to rush, aka challenge a turn. There’s also a Donald Duck card, an Elsa rush card, and (most exciting to me) a Kronk card that slates him as head of security. </p>

<p id="E1JNim">As for non-character cards, players will have two new locations and a new action, You’re Welcome, which lets you shuffle the chosen card into your deck and draw two. Locations include the ballroom, mentioned earlier, and Bad-Anon, Villian Support Center where villain characters can work on improving themselves.</p>
<p id="sliWX6">Check out the rest of the new cards below, or browse the previous set, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24141466/disney-lorcana-ursulas-return-madrigal-family-encanto-cards"><em>Ursula’s Return</em></a>, to hold you over while you await the new decks.</p>

The three-part series launched back in 2020 for $19.99, and while the first part of the trilogy has been free since 2021, Dontnod has made the adventure available in its entirety for free during June in honor of Pride Month for the past couple of years.</p>

<p id="NJB2xc">Focusing largely on how your decisions impact the unfolding narrative, <em>Tell Me Why</em> tells an engaging story while staying light on mechanics. Fans of Telltale’s adventure titles, or Dontnod’s seminal adventure, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/29/7945795/life-is-strange-review-xbox-one-ps4-360-ps3-PC-episode-one"><em>Life is Strange</em></a>, will feel right at home. </p>
<p id="llzrJx">As with previous entries in the Dontnod catalog, the dialogue is occasionally cringe-y and can be a bit heavy-handed in its delivery, but the game still displays a <a href="https://www.tellmewhygame.com/resources/">surprising amount of literacy</a> surrounding the lived experiences of trans people. </p>
<p id="3zJW7p">If you’re a fan of some of Dontnod’s other adventure titles, or you’re just looking for a thoughtful and emotional game to play during Pride Month (or any month, really), you should take a minute to add <em>Tell Me Why</em> to your backlog. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177061/twilight-of-the-gods-zack-snyder-netflix-animated-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9R2Gwg">Zack Snyder’s long-in-development Viking series, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22527795/zack-snyder-twilight-of-the-gods-cast-netflix-anime"><em>Twilight of the Gods</em></a>, finally has a trailer and a release date. The first look at the series is full of Viking violence, and plenty of blood, and the show is set to hit Netflix on Sept. 19. </p>
<p id="hEDvSD"><em>Twilight of the Gods</em> follows Leif, who is saved from a battlefield death by Sigrid, a warrior who he later marries. However, on their wedding night, the pair are attacked by Thor, setting them on a journey through hell and across the many treacherous lands of Norse mythology. </p>
<p id="OOegQG">The trailer is a little lighter on those plot details, but it does have some pretty impressive action. The series is animated by French studio Xilam Animation (<em>Chip ‘n’ Dale: Park Life</em>), and looks reminiscent of shows like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23435354/dragon-prince-mystery-aaravos-season-4-review-netflix"><em>The Dragon Prince</em></a>, with brief flashes of action from series like <em>Samurai Jack</em>. The characters look slick and unique, while the action itself looks beautiful, well-choreographed, and plenty bloody.</p>
<p id="0F1CAp">The series is co-created by Zack Snyder, Jay Oliva (<em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em>), and Eric Carrasco (<em>Foundation</em>). Snyder directs the first and last episode, while Oliva, Andrew Tamandl (<em>Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous</em>), Tim Divar (<em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em>), and Dave Hartman (<em>Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire</em>) direct the rest. </p>

The choice is yours to make, tarnished.</p><h2 id="h9811"><a id=""></a>How to level up quickly before entering the Land of Shadow</h2><p>If you’ve reached <em>Elden Ring</em>’s endgame and are looking to level up a bit more before diving into <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, we’ve got a really good spot for you: Palace Approach Ledge-Road Site of Grace in Mohgwyn Palace.</p><figure id="" data-id="2211181b0b79088852085b0f8cf5b3c0" data-recommend-id="image://2211181b0b79088852085b0f8cf5b3c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Elden Ring map screenshot highlights the Palace Approach Ledge-Road" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Elden Ring map screenshot highlights the Palace Approach Ledge-Road" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2211181b0b79088852085b0f8cf5b3c0" data-recommend-id="image://2211181b0b79088852085b0f8cf5b3c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Elden Ring map screenshot highlights the Palace Approach Ledge-Road" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you’ve warped to the Palace Approach Ledge-Road Site of Grace, walk forward and look left down a slope. Here, you’ll see a ton of Albinaurics you can take out. Most of these little guys are passive until you attack them, meaning you have plenty of options for taking them out as you see fit.</p><p>Your best course of action is to use an AOE spell to destroy them all very quickly, then rush back to the Site of Grace to rest and repeat the process. This will net you thousands upon thousands of runes per run, making this one of the very best rune farming spots in the entire game.</p><figure id="" data-id="618018dde72c05e2ab6714bd8e0d8895" data-recommend-id="image://618018dde72c05e2ab6714bd8e0d8895" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A shrouded Elden Ring protagonist stands in a grassy, rocky environment with several Albinaurics behind them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A shrouded Elden Ring protagonist stands in a grassy, rocky environment with several Albinaurics behind them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="618018dde72c05e2ab6714bd8e0d8895" data-recommend-id="image://618018dde72c05e2ab6714bd8e0d8895" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A shrouded Elden Ring protagonist stands in a grassy, rocky environment with several Albinaurics behind them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Moreover, if you have the Golden Scarab talisman (found in the Abandoned Cave in Caelid), be sure to equip that as well to further improve the amount of runes you receive per run of this farming method.

It’s not attempting to be a one-to-one, brick-by-brick recreation of the expansive open-world RPG or even an abridged version. Think of it more as a Shakespeare for Kids spin on the sci-fi adventure, except instead of translating the Bard’s iambic pentameter into contemporary English, it’s taking the familiar bones of a Lego adventure game and putting a pre-historic robot-smashing twist on it.</p><p>It was a bit of a shock when Sony revealed that it’s bringing <em>Horizon Lego Adventures</em> to Switch as well as PlayStation 5 and PC, but playing it for roughly half an hour at Summer Game Fest, it quickly becomes clear that it’s the perfect fit for Nintendo’s handheld hybrid. Out this holiday, the game features two-player co-op and was designed to be playable with just one joystick so that multiplayer would be an option right out of the box with players using an individual Joy-Con each. </p><p>Tim Symons, franchise development lead producer at Guerrilla Games and the person who led me through my demo, seemed thrilled to be making a childhood dream of sorts come true. He joined the Dutch PlayStation studio five years ago after more than a decade at, surprise, Nintendo. He also loved playing with Lego as a kid and confided in me that his favorite set he never actually got to have was the giant pirate ship called the Skull’s Eye Schooner (he wasn’t alone, that was also the set I coveted while incessantly browsing the home catalog back in the day). </p><figure id="" data-id="504bf97be0f7618aae4516b3a2453651" data-recommend-id="image://504bf97be0f7618aae4516b3a2453651" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aloy fights machines out in the wild.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“For us, it’s super exciting to make a Nintendo game for the first time, right?” Symons told me. He said that, rather than make the game for PS5 and scale it down, both versions were made simultaneously. “We do it actually all at the same time, in parallel, so we have a dedicated team of engineers optimizing all this for Switch, but it will be exactly the same.”<br></p><p>Instead of two-player split-screen, both heroes, selected from Aloy, Varl, and two others, share the same game space and follow one another around through verdant, post-apocalyptic forests, villages, and caves. Players have a single projectile attack—a bow and arrow in Aloy’s case and a spear in Varl’s—with the option to pick up additional limited-used power-up abilities during the course of exploring each level. Machines you encounter still have weak points like their counterparts in the original PlayStation 4 game, but there’s no pausing to target specific pieces or using Aloy’s abilities to override and control them. </p><p>She does still have her Focus though, which can be used to highlight interactive objects and other useful info on each level, and you can still deploy makeshift traps by lighting things on fire, blowing up ice barrels, and taking advantage of other elemental effects. I didn’t really see the traditional build mechanics of a Lego game put to use, with much of the exploration and combat feeling more like a stripped down version of<em> Horizon</em>, complete with a light upgrade skill tree, than something reimagined in the world of Lego. You can fight cultists and pick them up and throw them into one another, though. </p><figure id="" data-id="cd5bb037f8429af8bfc67b29dbb15086" data-recommend-id="image://cd5bb037f8429af8bfc67b29dbb15086" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aloy fights a machine inside a cauldron.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This narrower focus can make <em>Horizon Lego Adventures</em> feel simplistic but still compelling. Movement and action control well and the crunchy, tactile feel of Lego is everywhere, from stop-motion animations to the fact that everything in the game was designed out of real pieces first, a requirement by the Lego company.</p><p>“They’d be checking it all to make sure every brick is real,” Symons said. “It’s all  their brick library, essentially. So we’re just rebuilding the game in Lego, which was a cool challenge because we were inspired by the movies. The movies are also made fully out of Lego and we have a bit of stop motion animation because we didn’t want to bend the plastic. We want to be true to the actual product.”</p><p>Even the <em>Horizon </em>story has been re-tuned to introduce the goofy, irreverent humor the other Lego games and movies are known for. Ashly Burch returns to voice Aloy and you can tell she is having a lot of fun re-interpreting the character and her story through comedic moments that vary from slapstick to knowing parody.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="79347bd433ddf0433b3a217e69279ad1" data-recommend-id="image://79347bd433ddf0433b3a217e69279ad1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aloy customize's her hut.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Horizon Lego Adventures</em> feels specially designed with the Switch in mind, it will have some bells and whistles on its home platform of PS5, including a 60fps performance mode. There’s also a bevy of customization options with light settlement-building mechanics and costumes from other Lego franchises and themed sets that can be unlocked over the course of the game. The main campaign runs about eight hours and Symons promised post-story content and other unlockables would keep players busy beyond that.<br></p><p>I peppered him with a few more questions before my session ended. How did Hermen Hulst, managing director of Guerrilla back when<em> Horizon </em>shipped and now co-CEO of PlayStation, react when he first played the new game? “He loved it,” Symons responded, chuckling. What’s Symons’ favorite Lego game? “The Marvel one is pretty good because there’s so many different playstyles,” he said. And finally, does this new partnership mean Aloy might eventually come to the next <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>? “That’d be nice. If you speak to Nintendo and they want to invite us let me know.”</p><p>It’s clear that <em>Horizon Lego Adventures </em>is a carefully selected touch point to get the <em>Horizon</em> brand into more people’s hands, especially kids’, thanks in part to an abridged story that tones down some of the dark parts of the source material (I bet we’ll see some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-real-gameplay-ps5-pc-trailer-1851526168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-real-gameplay-ps5-pc-trailer-1851526168">more <em>Horizon </em>Lego sets as well</a></span>). At the same time, based on playing the opening stages, it seems like an obvious recommendation for any parent like me who loves <em>Horizon</em> and has kids who want me to play games with them. In that way, it feels similar to the purpose <em>Minecraft Dungeons</em> served for parents who love <em>Diablo</em>-inspired dungeon crawling. Whether <em>Horizon Lego Adventures </em>will manage to justify itself as a game that stands alone on its own two feet remains to be seen. <em>Minecraft Dungeons</em> certainly did that. I hope <em>Horizon Lego Adventures </em>can too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Everything To Know So Far</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Season_4_Reloaded">What to expect from Season 4 Reloaded</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 4 added a new battle pass with the Kar98k marksman rifle and Superi 46 submachine gun, but players can expect two new weapons to arrive with the midseason update. Season 4 Reloaded introduces the sledgehammer melee weapon and the Reclaimer 18, which is a rebrand of Call of Duty's popular SPAS-12 shotgun. These weapons will be available to unlock for free with in-game challenges.</p><p dir="ltr">Two "redacted" events were teased for later in the season. One doesn't give a date or any details, with all information listed as "most secret," while a second "top secret" event is bookmarked for June 19-26. One of these is likely related to the leaked-but-still-<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-call-of-duty-crossover-with-fallout-reveals-vault-dweller-skins/1100-6523789/" data-ref-id="1100-6523789">unconfirmed crossover with Fallout</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Modern_Warfare_3">Modern Warfare 3</h2><p dir="ltr">Two more core 6v6 multiplayer maps arrive. Incline is a brand-new mid-sized map, which is themed as a snowy outpost map set in the mountains of Warzone's Urzikstan. The second map is Das Gross, a gory reskin of the popular Das Haus map, which is described as having orange mist, preternatural tendrils, and flapping tentacles.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also brings more game modes. Players can expect a headshots only TDM playlist, and the return of MW2's Havoc mode, which is a TDM variant that rotates random game modifiers throughout the match, such as low gravity, crossbows only, swapping to third-person mode, and having an Advanced UAV always on.</p><p dir="ltr">For Zombies, the Season 4 Reloaded won't include a new story mission, but it will introduce "Unstable Rifts," to Urzikstan. These new rifts let players fight waves of zombies, and completely clearing an Unstable Rift will offer the reward of immediate refreshes on all weapon and schematic cooldowns.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4317885-mwiii-s4-announcement-006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317885" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4317885-mwiii-s4-announcement-006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317885"></a><figcaption>Das Gross map variant for Season 4 Reloaded</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4317885-mwiii-s4-announcement-006.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">The midseason update for Warzone is a bit of a mystery. There are "Redacted" modes and powerful classified weapons that are teased to arrive at some point. The weapons are described as being "impressive and rare weaponry" meant to deal with "enhanced threats across the battlefield." This could mean the return of zombies in Warzone, or possibly something new like radioactive ghouls if there truly is a big Fallout crossover happening.</p><p dir="ltr">One confirmed addition for Season 4 Reloaded is the Runaway Train public event, which will alter the endgame of matches to require players to survive the match on Urzikstan's train.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone_Mobile">Warzone Mobile</h2><p dir="ltr">Thanks to Warzone Mobile's shared progression, the sledgehammer and Reclaimer 18 weapons will also arrive in the mobile version.</p><p dir="ltr">More limited-time modes, weekly challenges, and battle-royale map changes are announced for Season 4 Reloaded, and players can also expect updates to the event store and the Keep.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the Season 4 Reloaded news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> has been officially announced, and here are all of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/">our highlights from the big reveal</a>, including details on the campaign, multiplayer maps, and Treyarch's new omnidirectional movement system.</p>

		<p>Dontnod Entertainment’s narrative adventure game, Tell Me Why, is available for free on Steam and the Xbox Store. This offer will last until the 1st of July. Dontnod has a history of offering <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/01/tell-me-why-free-to-keep-pride-month-xbox-pc-download-links-steam/">Tell Me Why at no cost</a>, a gesture they repeat to celebrate Pride Month.</p>

<p>Here are the links to get Tell Me Why for free.</p>

</ul>
<p>Tell Me Why tells the story of a trans man and his twin sister revisiting their past and the traumas they went through together. Giving the full game away is a nice away to celebrate Pride Month and show support for LGBTQIA+ communities, hopefully getting more people to engage with a mature story told from a perspective that is very rarely seen in video games.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/27/tell-me-why-review-episode-series/">Tell Me Why Review</a></h2>
<p>We had some rather positive things to say about the game when it released last autumn. In our Tell Me Why review, Alan said: <em>“Reining in on the supernatural, Tell Me Why is a more nuanced, intimate and mature story that explores family trauma that challenges our memories and relationships, while making another bold step in representation for video games.”</em></p>

            <p>When I was a kid, one of my absolute favourite things to do on the PC was to mess around with a free virtual Felix - like the cat from the cat food adverts - who would roam around the Windows XP desktop, chasing balls of string between program windows and curling up to take a nap on the taskbar. I have no idea where the game came from - a dream, perhaps - but 30 years later, I still think about it as a perfectly formed way to lose hours on the PC without actually doing anything.</p>

</div>
<p>For that reason, a first glance at Weyrdlets initially had me worried. It’s more of a game than that virtual cat simulator, but scratches that same moreish itch of drifting into a zen-like state while watching a virtual pet just wander around and do its thing on your monitor screen. It seems like the kind of thing I could lose hours to without realising, looking up from the slightly clay-like animals’ idle digging for treasure to find night has turned to day or that it’s still 3pm, but the date has skipped forward.</p>
<p>Developers Weyrdworks seem to understand that there’s a dangerously distracting appeal to staring at colourful little oddballs just doing their thing, so they’re aiming to flip that power of procrastination into something a bit more productive. As well as being an Animal Crossing-style life sim you can casually mess with around whatever else you’re doing - with your pets able to use the treasure they collect to buy new clothes, snacks you can feed them and items to decorate their adorable island home with - Weyrdlets can also be used as a productivity tool, letting you set timers, create to-do lists and log a daily reflection in the company of your desktop pal using a set of handy widgets.</p>

<p>The life sim elements are all a lot less demanding than something like a Tamagotchi, though you’ll still need to chuck your pet a bit of food, give them some fuss and keep them active unless you can stand the guilt of seeing a sad little face hover on your screen. You can send off some encouragement in a bottled message to another player’s screen too, which is a cute Kind Words-like social touch.</p>
<p>It’s a neat mix of much-needed wholesome distraction and actual real-life utility that I can’t help but be drawn to - even if I know, deep down, that I’m far too much of a sucker for cute virtual critters to truly hone my focus on working while there’s a fun little lizard there to pet.</p>
<p>Weyrdlets <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366060/Weyrdlets/">has a demo on Steam now</a>, if you’re curious to try it out yourself, with the full thing arriving on July 23rd.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-gets-skyline-valley-map-expansion-today-caravan-outposts-in-fall-2024-playable-ghouls-in-early-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few weeks ago, Bethesda Game Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-map-is-getting-bigger-thanks-to-the-addition-of-skyline-valley-shenandoah-national-park/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the Skyline Valley Fallout 76 update on the public test server. Today, the studio is launching the patch (around 27GB on Steam) on live servers.</p>
<p>This is the first expansion to the open world map. Whereas previous new locations, such as Pittsburgh and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-gets-stunning-first-teaser-trailer-fallout-76s-boardwalk-paradise-shown-in-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlantic City</a>, brought players elsewhere, Skyline Valley introduces a whole new area to the Appalachian map. More specifically, Bethesda has added the Shenandoah National Park area toward the south, below the Great Divide. Here, Fallout 76 players will find Vault 63, which is inhabited by non-feral ghouls.</p>
<p>The leader of Vault 63 is Hugo Stolz, who the developers described as having a 'particularly charged personality'. He's a friendly example of a new ghoul type called the Lost, who tend to be wary of outsiders. Throughout the new storyline, players will have the opportunity to either befriend or betray Stoltz.&nbsp;The new fearsome foe added with Skyline Valley is a trio of supersized robots called Storm Goliaths, developed by Vault 63.</p>
<p>There's also a hefty chunk of new quest content, twelve new quests to be exact, as much as the previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-steel-dawn-update-released-ahead-of-schedule-by-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steel Dawn</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-steel-reign-update-patch-notes-legendary-crafting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steel Reign</a> updates combined. There are new factions, new creatures, and new rewards. Lastly, a new public event called Dangerous Pastimes takes place in Skyline Valley. In this event, players take on the role of a storm chaser who needs to power up a big lighting rod to kickstart an electrical light show. The update kicks off Season 17 as well, which is themed around camp rewards.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/F76_Season17_CommunityCalendar_03-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Bethesda Game Studios also teased the next Fallout 76 update. Called Milepost Zero, it will be released this Fall, expanding Skyline Valley with brand new experiences. For example, the Blue Ridge Caravan Company has established a trade route on Skyline Drive and will need the adventurers' help to defend their Brahmin caravans. Funnily enough, the Brahmin can be slapped on the back to make them run a bit faster for a while.</p>
<p>Running missions for the Blue Ridge Caravan Company will eventually unlock a caravan outpost for the player character. Bethesda likened this to Skyrim houses in that the outpost can be decorated and host exclusive vendors.&nbsp;The Fall update will also add the Mischief Night Halloween-themed event, but the most exciting new feature might just be playable ghouls, which are coming to Fallout 76 in early 2025, likely on the heel of the excitement for Cooper Howard, the ghoul character played in the TV show by Walton Goggins.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 76: Skyline Valley Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yHLtDrbLqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ghouls can be unlocked at level 50 when a quest will allow them to undergo the mutation process. Ghouls have unique benefits against radiation as well as 'dozens' of unique Perk cards to be used in addition to the existing Perks. The flip side is that the character's new appearance might not sit too well with some of the factions.</p>
<p>Lastly, Bethesda teased that the addition of Ghouls is linked to a new challenging endgame activity that will be detailed later this year. Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-passes-20-million-players-milestone-bethesda-is-planning-future-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 million player milestone</a>, it's clear that support for Fallout 76 is here to stay.</p>

<h2 id="YjJThl"><strong>Astel, Naturalborn of the Void weakness</strong></h2>
<p id="6NNKAM">Astel can be a tricky boss. Some of their attacks can wipe out over half of your health bar if you’re unprepared, but there are some weapons, incantations, and spells that’ll make the fight much easier.</p>
<ul>
<li id="S0rmsW">
<strong>Astel is</strong> <strong>immune</strong> <strong>to frostbite, sleep, and madness</strong>, <strong>but is susceptible to poison, scarlet rot, and bleed damage</strong>. We recommend incorporating these status effects into your build by using a corresponding weapon, incantation, or spell.</li>
<li id="TZW0ob">
<strong>Astel is also particularly</strong> <strong>resistant to every type of elemental damage (magic, fire, lightning, and holy)</strong>. They’ll still take damage as they aren’t immune, but it just won’t be the amount you’re used to.</li>
<li id="fbrfJ4">
<strong>On the other hand, Astel is not as resistant to physical damage. </strong>Magic users should not be afraid. You still have an advantage with your range and you can use gravity spells.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ynSYRI"><strong>How to prepare for Astel, Naturalborn of the Void</strong></h2>
<p id="flTMIQ">Here are a couple of weapons, incantations, and spells that will help you in your fight against Astel, Naturalborn of the Void:</p>
<ul><li id="Te6WTO">
<strong>Any weapon with</strong> <strong>poison, scarlet rot, or bleed</strong>. We know this is <em>extremely </em>vague, but these status effects can and will deal a lot of damage to Astel. Find a weapon with either of these status effects in a category of your liking and <strong>upgrade it as much as you possibly can</strong>.</li></ul>

<ul><li id="O7if5N">
<strong>Rock Sling sorcery</strong> (found in a chest in the <strong>northern section of the Street of Sages Ruins</strong> in Caelid). Rock sling is a gravity spell that has great tracking and range. You can spam this spell from a distance, allowing you to avoid a majority of Astel’s attacks. If you couple this sorcery with the <strong>Meteorite Staff</strong> (found on a <strong>corpse in the Street of Sages Ruins</strong>), Rock Sling will <strong>deal 30% more damage</strong>, making the fight even easier.</li></ul>
<p id="UMIVLm">As always, before you head into a boss fight, you should level up your attributes and upgrade your weapons and spirit ashes. We recommend using the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23938595"><strong>Mimic Tear Ash</strong></a> to divert Astel’s attention and tank a large portion of their damage.</p>
<hr id="L6xn6z">
<h2 id="QvsHhm"><strong>How to beat Astel, Naturalborn of the Void</strong></h2>
<p id="PdZHyS">Astel, Naturalborn of the Void has a <strong>weak spot on its head</strong>, but that doesn’t mean you should always stand directly in front of it. Some of Astel’s most damaging moves involve the use of its pincers, which are, <em>of course,</em> attached to its head. Instead, stand slightly farther away to the point where you can see most of Astel’s body. This will allow you to see a majority of Astel’s telltale attacks, which can be very telegraphed.</p>
<p id="KOWRZ7">The general game plan is to learn the attack’s wind-up, avoid it, and get a few attacks on its head. Listed below are some of the moves that you’ll <em>need</em> to know to defeat Astel, Naturalborn of the Void.</p>

<ul><li id="MfXRBG">Astel will rise into the air with a <strong>purple orb in each of their six hands</strong>, then proceed to slam into the ground, releasing <strong>three shockwaves that grow in size</strong>. This attack is similar to the previous one, but the wind-up time is significantly longer. Again, run a considerable distance away from Astel as the shockwaves can grow deceivingly large.</li></ul>

<ul><li id="3Sl6CH">Astel will create a single <strong>purple orb</strong> in one of their hands, then sweep their hand in front of them, leaving a <strong>purple shroud that explodes in a second</strong>. Depending on your distance to Astel, you may have enough time to run through the mist and land a couple of hits on their head before their next attack. There are <strong>multiple variations </strong>of this attack and they all function similarly, but just keep an eye out for the single purple orb.</li></ul>

<ul><li id="QnLFAq">One of the banes of this entire fight is Astel’s <strong>teleport </strong>that leads to their <strong>grab</strong>. Particles will begin to gather above Astel, creating a large orb that teleports Astel away. When Astel begins their teleport, sprint away and rotate your camera so that it’s pointing behind you. If they do teleport above you, try to stay aware of their arms and dodge when they begin to swoop in to grab you — almost like they’re hugging you. This grab will do a <strong>TON of damage</strong> and potentially kill you, so do your best to roll away from it. Do note that Astel can teleport to other locations, but this attack is the deadliest.</li></ul>

<li id="mP9Dvz">Another of Astel’s teleport attacks is one where they’ll teleport away from you and summon a multitude of rings behind them. Meteors will shoot out of the rings and fly at you, but these can be avoided by continuously running to the side and dodging when needed.</li>
<li id="MGzyYU">Lastly, watch for any movement in Astel’s major bodily features. If their pincers begin to twitch, look out for an attack from their pincers; if their tail begins to sway, look out for an attack from their tail.</li>
</ul>
<p id="BQMncw">Once you’ve defeated Astel, Naturalborn of the Void, you’ll receive the <strong>Remembrance of the Naturalborn</strong>, which can be traded in for the <strong>Waves of Darkness Ash of War</strong> or the <strong>Bastard’s Stars</strong>.</p>
