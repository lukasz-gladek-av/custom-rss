		<p>Splitgate 2 has been announced by 1047 Games, a sequel to what the surprise FPS hit of 2021. Splitgate 2 is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One and PC in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splitgate 2 Cinematic Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8zPMku7q9hU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Splitgate 2 is a full sequel to the original, retaining core aspects of its arena shooter action like portals, but aiming to use Unreal Engine 5 and a full new production cycle to create a much higher quality product. The quip-filled chit chat of the announcement trailer will almost certainly grate with an older generation of player, but the snippets of gameplay looks on the money for this genre and from the original.</p>
<p>1047 Games co-founder and CEO Ian Proulx said, “The original Splitgate‘s development was ambitious but scrappy. The game was created from a dorm room, and the massive success and community it earned surpassed our wildest dreams. This time around, Splitgate 2 has been designed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 to deliver the AAA first-person shooter experience our fans deserve, with the series’ signature <a title="Genres > Action [2,015 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> completely overhauled by an all-star team composed of the most talented individuals in the industry. This is a revolutionary step forward for competitive <a title="Genres > Shooter [3,818 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a>s. It’s the perfect entry point for players new to the world of Splitgate and a comprehensive upgrade worthy of our existing community.”</p>
<p>There’s some key new features that 1047 is introducing into the game, with a progression system that will have players unlock new capabilities for different Factions, upgrade weapons and improve their player loadouts. Those factions will have specific abilities, such as Aeros being able to dash, Meridian having time-manipulation gear, and the raw power of the Sabrask.&nbsp;With a 4v4 shooter set up, you’ll be able to build a quick and complimentary team composition, though you’ll fundamentally have to master the weapons and use of the portal gun.</p>

<p>Splitgate 2 has been on the cards since 2022, when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/05/splitgate-development-to-end-so-1047-games-can-work-on-aaa-sequel/">1047 halted production on content for the original game</a>. While the original release into beta had quickly raced to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/20/splitgate-beta-will-continue-as-shooter-hits-10-million-downloads/">over 10 million players</a>, satiating some of the appetite for a tight arena shooter and drawing comparisons to the Halo series as it did so, 1047 quickly realised that they needed to revamp many aspects of the game, and not just produce more content for it. While they started down that path with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/01/splitgate-beta-season-2-building-a-better-shooter-for-the-future/">two seasons of support</a>, it was eventually decided to start over completely.</p>
<p>It will be very interesting to see how everything has come together when Splitgate 2 launches next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netherrealm-mobile-shut-down-rumor-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Injustice&nbsp;</em>developer NetherRealm has apparently closed down its entire mobile team, leaving an unknown number of employees without work.</p>
<p>According to QA analyst <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tony-lazzara-83b00319_opentowork-activity-7219362131924672513-snus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tony Lazzara</a>, NetherRealm's mobile team was "shut down" recently. Lazzara doesn't give a reason for the shutdown, nor does he state how many employees have been affected by this shutdown.</p>
<p>While Lazzara's report seems to be the only one claiming a full team shutdown, his account is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7219442604168368128/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">corroborated</a> by at least <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/samanthaedward_opentowork-activity-7219060836563079168-9MXz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" rel="noopener" target="_blank">three other</a> NetherRealm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7219144299609829378/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">employees</a>, all of whom are now looking for work. Another employee didn't directly say they were laid off, but did <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamoritz/recent-activity/all/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">share a link</a> to recently-posted jobs in the gaming industry.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netherrealm-mobile-injustice-2.jpg?itok=rUmISNvZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netherrealm-mobile-injustice-2.jpg?itok=Z3cnBJXo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The future of NetherRealm's mobile games appears to be in doubt.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, since NetherRealm hasn't made an official statement about these layoffs, we don't know whether the future of the studio's mobile games is safe or not, but it's probably reasonable to assume games like&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat Mobile&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Injustice 2&nbsp;</em>could be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>If that's the case, the timing of this decision seems a little strange given that&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat Mobile&nbsp;</em>received a major new update just yesterday, and it's one that seems to have gone down pretty well with fans of the game, too.</p>
<p>Warner Bros' gaming division is in a strange place at the moment. On the one hand, sales of February's&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>were a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win">huge disappointment</a>, with WB chalking up a loss to the tune of $200 million thanks to the game's failure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, however, last year's single-player RPG&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>was a huge success for WB Games, racking up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-smash-through-15-million-barrier">millions upon millions of sales</a>. A Director's Cut version of the game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report">reportedly in the works</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-suicide-squad.jpg?itok=1nLHEDG6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-suicide-squad.jpg?itok=CYdJtbWh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Not all of Warner Bros' gambles have paid off recently.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to find somewhere to lay the blame for&nbsp;these purported NetherRealm mobile layoffs, you could perhaps do worse than&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s failure, but there's another elephant in the room, too; Warner Bros' <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warner-bros-discovery-wbd-zaslav-struggles-streaming-media-strategy-analysis-2024-7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">failed Discovery merger</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be716ec2-1c02-467c-94af-7c8ef9ae1963" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported by the Financial Times</a>, Warner Bros' share price is dropping, and the company is apparently currently eyeing up a breakup plan that would see its movie and streaming divisions spun off into a different entity.</p>
<p>While these problems aren't directly related to Warner Bros' gaming division, it's all part of the same corporate structure, and so problems in one area will almost certainly have a knock-on effect in others.</p>
<p>For now, though, we'll just have to wait and see what happens next. We've reached out to Warner Bros for comment and will update this story as soon as we hear anything back.</p>

It’s an accessory that many Switch gamers would have welcomed seven years ago when the handheld launched, and while third parties have long offered alternatives, Nintendo’s arrives with some extra flexibility.</p><p>Unlike most wireless controllers that can be charged with a USB-C cable, the Nintendo Joy-Con, as well as the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200753/nintendo-deal-gaming-nes-gamepad-controller-wireless">retro wireless NES and Famicom gamepads</a>, can only charge when attached to the Switch. A separate charger makes it easier to keep more than two Joy-Con controllers powered up, so it’s an odd move for the company to release an accessory like this as the original Switch’s lifecycle winds down and its successor is expected to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">revealed early next year</a>.</p><p>Nintendo’s Joy-Con Charging Stand (Two-Way) accessory can accommodate two controllers at a time, drawing power from the Switch dock’s USB-C port or another power adapter. The charger’s vertical support can also be removed, improving its portability.</p><p>Nintendo hasn’t revealed pricing for the accessory yet. <em>The Verge</em> has also reached out to the company to confirm that the charging stand will be available in North America, as so far, it has only been announced in Europe and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fjp%2Ftopics%2Farticle%2F8d855df8-7c17-4c40-a11b-d85c9925a2ee">Japan</a>.</p><div><p>The new accessory will be part of what is probably Nintendo’s last big holiday push for the aging console, joining the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24190886/nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition-preorder-price-release-date-zelda">“Hyrule Edition” Nintendo Switch Lite</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a>, which both release on September 26th, as well as new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24180977/a-new-mario-party-game-is-here-to-ruin-your-family-relationships"><em>Mario Party</em></a> titles.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A good immersive sim, by its very nature, offers myriad varied approaches to solving problems. And yet, I find myself wanting to get hyper-specific when writing about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/corpus-edax">Corpus Edax</a>, because it has an incredibly gratifying metal pipe sound, whether you’re stealthy wrapping it around the back of a blissfully unaware fool’s noggin, or lobbing it directly at their knee caps. In fact - although the game does have a delightful array of classic verbs, along with a few surprises - many of them are simply conducive to a stirring round of fisticuffs, to write my most British sentence of the week.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You’ve got other options, of course, although I can’t help feel a little implied judgement in the fact one of the non-fighting stats is simply named ‘Nerd’. There’s also a thoughtful and flesh-out trait-and-stat-based dialogue system that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a>-heads among you are bound to get a kick out of it. Waking up on a hospital bed at the beginning of the game, for example, my character gets a special option to complain about his bones because he’s over 60. This is reactivity I can get behind. My bones hurt too!</p>
<p>However, I surmise you’re here for the punching. Have a combat trailer:</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zG58JbS18Cw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>As you can see, even if you don’t go for the elaborate method of stamping on a wooden chair to use the leg as a weapon, the basic melee is decently fleshed out with blocks and dodges and kicks. Oh, go on, have another one <a href="https://youtu.be/X3fpulkOX_c">here</a>. An impromptu tube light beating that also electrifies your opponents? I am giddy with glee.</p>
<p>A big part of this variety comes from the conceit that guns have been outlawed as part of the setting, which I really appreciate as a creative limitation. Less gun-ching, more punching, as they say. Do they say that? Doesn’t matter. You can download Corpus Edax’s demo on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2017610/CORPUS_EDAX/">here</a>. It's more fun than singing God Save The Queen in a bath of beans, to outdo my previous most British sentence.</p>

<p>The developers of Mortal Kombat have been hit with mass layoffs as the entire NetherRealm  Studios’ mobile team has been let go. </p>



<p>First spotted via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-entire-nrs-mobile-team-was-laid-off-yesterday.930414/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>, posts began appearing on LinkedIn stating that they were being let go and that the team was let go.</p>



<p>“Good morning internet. Unfortunately, yesterday NetherRealm’s mobile team was shut down,” quality assurance analyst Tony Lazzara posted. “A ton of very talented people were put out of work.”</p>



<p>“It hurts me to announce I’ve been laid off from NetherRealm Studios after about 10 years of working there,” Animator Elizabeth Ramirez said.</p>







<p>NetherRealm Studios is owned by Warner Bros. Games. Insider Gaming has reached out to both NetherRealm and Warner Bros. Games for comment on the division closure and layoffs. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>



<p>At least 50 people have been impacted by these latest layoffs. This brings the year total to <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 11,000 people</a> let go from jobs in the gaming industry, that we know of. </p>

<p>Developer 1047 Games has officially announced Splitgate 2 with a release window of 2025, as well as a cinematic trailer. </p>

<p>Splitgate 2 will be available on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. It will also release on consoles via the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. Fans can wishlist the game now.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The trailer description reveals more details about the game and its roster of “Aces.” It confirms that Aeros is agile with dashing abilities, Meridian can manipulate time, and Sabrask will be a tank. The description also teases the Ozone map, a flying super yacht.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement follows a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-developer-posts-cryptic-teaser-trailer-new-reveal-coming-this-week/">cryptic tease</a> from the developer earlier this week. Free-to-play shooter Splitgate, featuring portals similar to the game Portal, last updated in September 2022. After its final update, the devs confirmed a new game in the Splitgate universe, built in Unreal.</p>



<p>1047 Games also spoke to PlayStation in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/18/splitgate-2-portals-over-to-ps5-and-ps4-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new blog</a> today. The devs revealed that “we’ll have a lot more to share in August.” They also confirmed that it will be free to play, and feature a faction system. </p>



<p>The team describes Splitgate 2 as a multiplayer-only AAA shooter. It will have “completely new character models, new maps, new weapons, and even new portal walls and portals.”</p>

                <p>An official Joy-Con charging dock for the Nintendo Switch has been revealed, giving users a new option to charge controllers when they aren't in use. Traditionally, Joy-Cons are charged when connected to the Switch, but this new dock is recommended for users looking to refuel their spare controllers while they use their Switch in docked mode.</p><p>"Charge your Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers and Nintendo Entertainment System controllers with the Joy-Con Charging Stand (Two-Way) accessory," the listing for the dock reads. This particular model works by attaching Joy-Cons to a grip that is positioned on a stand, but the grip can be removed and placed on a table if you're short on room. With a USB-C cable attached at the top, it may be possible to use the grip as a controller, although it's worth noting that a comfortable Joy-Con grip is included with the Switch. </p><p>The dock has no official US price or release date yet, but it will be available in the UK starting October 17. The Switch's Nintendo Entertainment System controllers will also be compatible with it.</p><p>Nintendo is expected to reveal the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch successor</a> in the coming months, as the company confirmed that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-revealed-by-april-2025/1100-6523222/" data-ref-id="1100-6523222">Switch 2 will be announced during the company's current fiscal year</a> ending in March 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/18/24200304/voicemod-key-xbox-playstation-voice-changer-soundboard<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Popular voice changing software Voicemod is finally going to work with game consoles like the PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch. While Voicemod has been available as an app on Windows PCs for more than five years, platform limitations have forced Voicemod to create dedicated hardware to bring its popular voice changer and soundboard to game consoles.</p><p><a href="https://www.voicemod.net/vmkey/">Voicemod Key</a> is a tiny USB-C dongle that turns your regular gaming headset and mobile phone into a voice changer and soundboard for game consoles, phones, and tablets. “The original idea was from the community, we found it on YouTube,” explains Voicemod chief operating officer Jochen Doppelhammer in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Voicemod can’t build an app for Xbox or PlayStation, so Voicemod users had been using headsets within headsets to get the voice changer working with their phones and consoles. One person even put together a bunch of audio splitters that fed the output of a microphone into Voicemod and then back out into the microphone input on a console. “They put it together and I was like, I need to try that! That was the initial idea, and with the splitter you find problems and to solve them we needed electronic components,” says Doppelhammer.</p><p>Voicemod Key works by using two audio jacks and a USB-C port to route your gaming headset into the Voicemod app on mobile and back out into your console. You plug your wired headset into one port, a stereo cable into the other, and then connect up the other end of the stereo cable to your game console. The dongle then plugs into the USB-C or Lightning port on your phone, where you can launch voice changing features or the soundboard.</p><div><figcaption><em>How Voicemod Key connects to a console.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Voicemod</cite></p></div><p>Voicemod’s AI voices and real-time voice changing features will all be available, alongside buttons to launch custom soundboard audio that your friends will hear in a party chat. Voicemod is also planning to get its Key hardware working with voice chat apps on a phone in the future. Voicemod will turn its Key dongle into a virtual device so it loops back the audio and any iOS or Android apps will then receive the modified voice changing audio as if it were the real microphone. It’s similar to how Voicemod works on macOS or Windows, with virtual audio devices.</p><p>Doppelhammer and the Voicemod team have had to create hardware to solve a software restriction in closed platforms like iOS, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch. You can publish apps on many of these platforms, but Apple, Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo don’t let developers get deep access to the audio components.</p><p>I get the sense that Voicemod Key is a solution that Doppelhammer and the team are reluctantly having to build to try and prove to platform holders that they should open up and allow apps like Voicemod.</p><p>Voicemod Key will only work with wired headsets, largely because of the way it captures the audio and modifies it. Proprietary solutions like Xbox Wireless won’t be supported, and the latency of Bluetooth would make a real-time voice changer like Voicemod challenging. Doppelhammer says the “vast majority of our target audience” is more inclined to use a wired headset or have access to one, so he’s not too concerned about the lack of support for wireless headsets at launch.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Voicemod Key hardware will be bundled with subscriptions.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Voicemod</cite></p></div><p>If Voicemod were able to build a native app on Xbox and PlayStation consoles, the wireless problem would be solved. “We don’t want to build our own device. This will enable a lot of conversations, because people will see how it works, what it takes, and that there’s a market,” says Doppelhammer. “This whole thing made me realize one thing: PC and Mac are the only platforms left that are half-way open. Everything else is locked down.”</p><p>Voicemod has grown in popularity in recent years as people look to real-time voice changing software and soundboards to be more expressive in online words like <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Roblox</em>. Voicemod was once a niche app for Twitch streamers, but Voicemod Key aims to bring the software to people who play <em>Fortnite</em> on console or <em>Roblox </em>on a tablet or mobile phone.</p><p>The first version of Voicemod&nbsp;Key, with support for a console mode, will soon be available for <a href="https://www.voicemod.net/vmkey/">registered beta testers</a>. Voicemod is planning to bundle the hardware with its Voicemod Pro subscription, so you won’t need to purchase it separately. The team is targeting a launch later this year in the US, with a second version supporting both console and mobile early next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>1047 Games have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a>, sequel to the gambolling free-to-play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> from 2021 in which you could blast people through wormholes. The new game brings back said wormhole-based carnage together with newly "faction-forward" teamplay, and if you want to know what "faction-forward" means when it's at home, I encourage you to stick your whole head into the below crackling cinematic trailer-vortex. I promise nothing bad will happen to it on the other side.</p>

<p>Splitgate 2 sports three factions, each favouring a particular style of quantum superpositional skull-splattery, in addition to new arenas, weapons and modes. We see a bit of that in the trailer: one character has a pop-up holo-shield, another has an electric frisbee, a third keeps things simple with a homing rocket launcher. It's apparently a big step up in production scale from the 2021 game, which the developers characterise as something they slapped together in their pyjamas at a sleepover, using detergent bottles and jam. Since then, 1047 Games have swelled to around 150 people, amongst them veterans of such venerated gunalots as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/halo">Halo</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/call-of-duty">Call Of Duty</a>.</p>
<p>"The original Splitgate's development was ambitious but scrappy; the game was created from a dorm room, and the massive success and community it earned surpassed our wildest dreams," 1047's co-founder and CEO Ian Proulx observes in a release. "This time around, Splitgate 2 has been designed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 to deliver the AAA FPS experience our fans deserve, with the series' signature action completely overhauled by an all-star team composed of the most talented individuals in the industry.</p>
<p>"This is a revolutionary step forward for competitive shooters," he went on. "It's the perfect entry point for players new to the world of Splitgate and a comprehensive upgrade worthy of our existing community." Thank you Mr Proulx, I have filled out my press release bingo card now, though you forgot to tell me how laser-focussed Splitgate 2 is on delivering immersion.</p>
<p>Hark at me and my jadedness! I'm just grumpy because I keep accidentally writing "Slipgate". You'd think I'd be more receptive to the sequel to a game Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-review">tagged with a Bestest Best</a>, summarising it as a "raucous shooter that goes beyond its portal gimmick, with first-rate arenas and gutsy gunfights". For my part, I can only comment that the screens below remind me of Halo's louder map designs. I'll have to give the 2021 game a try.</p>

			<p>It's a pretty big GeForce NOW Thursday, as NVIDIA has confirmed that its cloud streaming service has been integrated into Xbox.com game pages, making it even faster and easier to launch supported PC games. As you might recall, a few Xbox users <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-streaming-seems-to-be-available-directly-on-xbox-game-pass-for-certain-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> GeForce NOW on game pages a couple of weeks ago, and it looks like the feature is now officially rolled out to everyone.</p>
<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg, though. NVIDIA is also discounting Premium Memberships for a limited time; both the Priority and the Ultimate tiers are half off until August 18, allowing GeForce NOW users to subscribe for a monthly $4.99 or $9.99, respectively. If you're a regular cloud user, you may want to pick the discounted six-month subscription, which would be $25 for the Priority tier and $50 for the Ultimate tier.</p>
<p>Of course, there's also a wave of nine games added to the library, seven of which have just launched or are launching today.</p>
<p>● The Crust (New release on Steam, July 15)<br>
● Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder (New release on Steam, July 16)<br>
● Nobody Wants to Die (New release on Steam, July 17)<br>
● Dungeons of Hinterberg (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, July 18)<br>
● Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, July<br>
18)<br>
● Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (New release on Steam, July 18)<br>
● Norland (New release on Steam, July 18)<br>
● Content Warning (Steam)<br>
● Crime Boss: Rockay City (Steam)</p>
<p>The highlights of this GeForce NOW round are Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess and Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, which we have recently reviewed favorably:</p>
<p><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-night-full-terrors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.5/10</a>) is a breath of fresh air. Despite a slow start, a low challenge level, and an almost non-existent narrative, this action game-meets-tower defense experience is engaging and can be enjoyed by all sorts of players, even those who aren't typically into the genre. Hopefully, the game will turn into a series in the future, and a sequel will address the few shortcomings that hold Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess back a little.</em></p>
<p><em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-accessible-and-fun-soulslite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8/10</a>) is an enjoyable and highly accessible Soulslite. A44 created a great entry point for the genre, not to mention an exciting fantasy setting that mixes black powder, magic, and influences that go beyond the usual European medieval style. The combat is fun and won't cause you to break any controllers. The story is also worth following, although the game perhaps ends up too soon, leaving narrative and gameplay possibilities to be explored by a sequel.</em></p>

<p>As spotted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-sues-social-media-user-for-excessive-slanderous-and-insulting-comments-against-employee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Eurogamer</a>, Sega has issued a <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/release/240717_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> via its Japanese site confirming that it reached a settlement against a social media user who harassed an employee.</p>



<p>Loosely translated, the press release explains the individual “made excessive slanderous and insulting comments” against one Sega employee for a long time. </p>



<p>Sega continues that “the subject will pay damages to our employee, delete the slanderous and insulting comments, and refrain from such actions in the future.” It is currently unclear just how extensive the payments are.</p>



<p>Following the settlement, Sega reinforces that “we will continue to take appropriate action based on our Customer Harassment Policy when we judge any behavior to be malicious.” Sega seems prepared to take further legal action when necessary against social media harassment.</p>



<p>Last March, workers at Sega of America became the first staff of a major gaming company to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-workers-become-first-major-gaming-company-to-ratify-union-contract/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ratify a union contract</a>. It spans a variety of offices, and it covers approximately 150 full-time and temporary employees.</p>



<p>However, that same week, Sega also revealed plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-layoffs-studios-hit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lay off hundreds of employees</a> across a wide range of studios. Jurgen Post of Sega said in an email that “we need to respond to the changing economic landscape.”</p>



<p>On the content side, gamers are looking forward to the new Crazy Taxi, which Sega recently revealed will be an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-new-crazy-taxi-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open world multiplayer title</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24200542/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-review-ps5-xbox-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In a world terrorized by gods, <em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</em> sees you step into the vengeful boots of Nor Vanek — armed with a cutlass, a flintlock, and a tiny magic god. The steampunk, open world of Kian needs saving as the armies of the dead flood from a magical doorway. But despite some clever ideas, an intriguing cast with excellent performances, and varied environments, this third-person souls-“lite” action RPG can’t escape the trappings of a clearly limited budget and lack of polish — which is a shame because it could’ve been an excellent way into the genre.</p><p>Players are thrust into the shoes of Nor during a battle that looks like it’s straight from both World War I and every generic dark fantasy. There are soldiers in uniform, with muskets and flintlocks, firing at zombies pouring out from some strange gateway in the distance. There are trenches and barbed wire, helmets on infantry, and medals on generals, while magical beings tear apart Nor’s comrades.&nbsp;</p><p>While the game does an acceptable job of introducing you to its mechanics, it does absolutely nothing when it comes to the setting. Even now, I cannot tell you much about the world. I can’t even tell you what “gods’’ are, aside from the fact that you are tasked with killing them.</p><p>Kills earn Nor reputation points that linger like “souls” or <em>Bloodborne</em>’s Blood Echoes. However, unlike soulsborne games, you can immediately claim the reputation. If you do not claim the reputation, you bolster a multiplier, which exponentially increases how much reputation you then earn, through each subsequent kill. However, if you’re hit even once, you lose it all. It’s a brilliant risk-reward system, balancing the unfairness of losing everything against the safety of immediate usage. You can use reputation points on upgrades, to purchase items, and so on.</p><p>The combat is fast-paced, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23437043/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-sony-ps5">the new <em>God of War</em> games</a>, allowing Nor to use a variety of melee weapons, her flintlock, or a sniper rifle on the fly. She also gains access to magic after she meets an adorable god called Enki. He is in the shape of a cute fox with a soothing voice and wants to assist Nor in her goal of defeating the other gods. Like <em>God of War</em>, you have a constant companion, with whom Nor exchanges charming dialogue, commenting on the world or situation. Their relationship grows from one of distrust to friendship and proved the golden thread for me throughout the experience.&nbsp;</p><p>With Enki as both the source of magic and a wielder himself, combat turns into a balletic foray into weapon usage, dodging, and spells. Unfortunately, unlike soulsbornes or <em>God of War</em>, the animations are stiff and do not feel responsive. Fluidity and timing are key in such games, and the lack of polish isn’t merely “nice to have” but essential, given the split-second decisions and sense of flow constitutive of these experiences. This is especially felt in boss or miniboss fights, or against larger enemies, where their stiff animation is readily apparent.&nbsp;</p><p>The game is also cursed by repetition: similar enemies resulting in similar fights, with only the background changing. Dying and respawning alongside enemies is of course a key staple of soulsborne games, but enemy variety helped undermine sterility. Flintlock does not really have this.&nbsp;</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kepler Interactive</cite></p></div><p>The lack of polish is most damning here. You can see it in the game’s dated graphics, even if the designs remain creative. Stiff animations are compounded by faces that lack expression. The environments — ranging from snowy mountains to rock lands, deep caves to magic arenas — are varied, but it’s hard to ignore the ugly textures, poorly drawn nature, and questionable lighting.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a pity because the game relies a lot on dialogue and interaction with NPCs. For example, Nor travels initially with her surrogate father Baz (with the iconic voice of Elias Toufexis). He’s a merchant and smith of sorts who assists Nor in her travels, having injured himself in an initial foolish raid that led to many soldiers’ deaths. But, due to the poor character details, it was often hard to tell his emotions and feelings. The voice acting did all the lifting.&nbsp;</p><p>The frustration also rests with how the game communicates information. Those of us who suffer through FromSoftware games are used to obfuscation. However, those games don’t rely on dialogue, as they do not even feature a voiced protagonist (unless you count your choice of screaming and ignoring Sekiro for now). But <em>Flintlock</em> drips in dialogue, yet provides no background, introduction, or setup that allowed me to understand who Nor is or what the fight is about.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of that can be conveyed through well-designed cutscenes, with silence and expression doing a lot of work as with Kratos and Atreus in the new <em>God of War</em>. But, because <em>Flintlock</em> does not have that level of polish, we are denied that. Cutscenes are generally spartan and devoid of frills, simply guiding you from one area to the next.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kepler Interactive</cite></p></div><p>I felt like I was playing the sequel to a game that had introduced me to this world and these characters. Like I’d opened up to a late chapter in a thick fantasy book, without a glossary.&nbsp; While it was wonderful uncovering the weird world of Kian, I still felt detached from it.&nbsp;</p><p>I did love that Nor and Enki’s journey to defeat the gods does tangibly change the world. Villages can be rescued from bandits and others, returned — in the blink of an eye, with zero cutscenes — to the people. This opens up merchants and quests. Nor can also recruit NPC who provide permanent bonuses and equipment on her quest.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Flintlock </em>makes for a comfortable introduction to the intimidating soulsborne genre and even creates its own unique spin with its risk-reward mechanic. However, I am hesitant to outright recommend it, given its lack of polish and repetitive play. Its varied environments and the central relationship between Nor and Enki deserve praise, but it doesn’t quite stick the landing for veterans of such action RPGs, let alone for newcomers. </p><p><small>Flintlock <em>launches July 18th on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Why don't we just wait here for a little while, see what happens?</p>

</div><div>



            <p>I've been fumbling for a grasp on Bokeh's skull-splitting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slitterhead">Slitterhead</a> since I first heard the words "brought to you by Keiichiro Toyama, former designer of Silent Hill, Siren and Gravity Rush". Thanks to a new interview, I now have a proper description of the relationship between protagonist and antagonist. Friends, Romans and countrymen: this is a game about a war between two sets of body-stealing monsters, waged in the neon shadows of a fictional East Asian city. It all puts me strongly in mind of a certain John Carpenter movie about squelchy goings-on in Antarctica.</p><!--more-->
<p>Never seen The Thing? A quick summary: it's a creature feature in which a bunch of scientists near the South Pole find that their base has been invaded by an alien monster that can assume the form of whatever it eats, prompting an immediate spiral into foam latex and KY jelly-flavoured chaos. Slitterhead takes the idea, shifts it a few thousand miles north, and swaps out Kurt Russel for a bodiless force, the Hyoki, with the ability to possess human beings and enhance their skills. </p>
<p>You play the Hyoki, and your job is to chase down the Slitterheads - nasty insects who are <em>also</em> able to possess and transform human bodies, but rather more messily. In <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/slitterhead-how-silent-hills-creator-is-building-2024s-craziest-horror-game/">a demo attended by the active and avid folk of VGC</a>, the player begins as a stray dog, recalling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku7qnh261CY">the opening scenes of The Thing</a>, with perhaps a touch of commentary on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/animal-human-disease-kill-epidemic-covid-b2440567.html">real-life zoonotic diseases</a>. Can you pet the dog? Possibly, but I strongly advise that you stay away from dogs in the context of anything remotely influenced by The Thing.</p>
<p>Each hapless host has different capabilities. Some are armed. VGC feels that Slitterhead's combat isn't anything to write home about, despite the ability to warp into a bystander's head for a cheeky backstab, but there are some amusingly grisly mechanics involving traversal and exploration. For example, you can portal through a fence gap to a body on the other side, or leap your current host off a roof so that you can bounce to another in the street below. Toyama says the developers have leaned into the idea of civilians as disposable fodder. "Originally, they were supposed to be powerful, but that proved to be not entertaining," he told the site. Please say that again, Toyama, with a drawn-out, sinister pause between "not" and "entertaining".</p>
<p>My thoughts gravitate immediately and predictably to stealth gameplay. I like the idea of posing as a shopkeeper, eyeing up the clientele for wriggling temples and other symptoms of infestation. Perhaps it'll be like Assassin's Creed's old PvP modes. That said, I'm not sure how amenable Slitterhead will be to such foetid, forensic sandboxing in practice. "One decision we made early in the game was that we originally wanted an open-world setting for the game, but it wasn't reasonable with the budget," Toyama told VGC. "That decision worked well, boxing in the missions and progressing through the storyline."</p>
<p>Here's hoping the neighbourhoods are nicely crowded, at least, because I have seen more Quit/Restart screens than you've had hot dinners, and as such, I'm going to burn through plenty of hosts in my time with Slitterhead, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bokehs-silent-hill-and-siren-esque-slitterhead-gets-release-date-and-new-in-game-trailer">out on November 8th</a>. Take a few cues from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/will-we-ever-get-to-play-one-city-block">Warren Spector's legendary single city block RPG pitch</a>, maybe?</p>

			<p>A Final Fantasy IV high-quality AI movie was recently shared online, and it's so good it could pass for an official adaptation.</p>
<p><em>(Light spoilers for Final Fantasy IV will be found ahead. Avoid reading if you haven't experienced the first few hours of the game.</em></p>
<p>The movie, which was created by the same <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AILab.-fv8qb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user</a> behind an earlier<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vi-ai-live-action/"> Final Fantasy VI AI movie</a>, covers the events from the beginning of the game up until Cecil becomes a Paladin, giving viewers a look at some pretty accurate recreations of Cecil, Rosa, Kain, Rydia, Kain, Edward, Tellah, Yang, Palom and Porom. While it is evident even at a glance that it is an AI-created movie, it's still impressive how accurately it depicts characters and events from the classic entry in the Square Enix series.</p>
<p><iframe title="【FF4】AIでオープニングからパラディンになるまで再現してみた  (Final Fantasy 4 AI generated movie)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HwCJrh4KI64?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unlike the sixth entry in the series, which was only remastered and ported a few times, Final Fantasy IV did get a full 3D remake, originally released on Nintendo DS before being ported to other gaming systems. The 3D remake introduces new gameplay mechanics, CGI cinematics, and voice-acted cutscenes that breathe new life into the classic.</p>
<p>Those looking for a more authentic experience can play the Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster. This remaster is available on PC, PlayStation consoles, and Nintendo Switch, alongside the remasters of the other 2D entries in the series.</p>

<p>On July 13, a would-be assassin took several shots at presidential candidate Donald Trump during a rally in Pennsylvania. He only succeeded in wounding the former U.S. President but shot and killed an innocent bystander in the crowd before being eliminated by the Secret Service. In the days that have followed the assassination attempt, plenty of information has surfaced online regarding the shooter.</p>



<p>It was revealed by a UK-based news outlet that ahead of his attempt, the gunman wrote a cryptic message on Steam that directly foreshadowed his actions.</p>

<h2 id="h-watch-as-it-unfolds">‘Watch as it Unfolds’</h2>



<p>Thomas Crooks travelled to the Trump rally in Pennsylvania with the intention of assassination the controversial presidential candidate. He managed to climb up to a nearby rooftop and lay prone as he lined up his target, opening fire but missing as Trump moved his head at the last second.</p>



<p>As internet users probed into the identity of the shooter, they uncovered a Steam profile that was verified as being owned by Crooks. It has since seemingly disappeared from the platform, but not before news outlets <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13645939/Trump-shooter-Thomas-Crooks-wrote-July-13-premiere-watch-unfolds-gaming-platform-Steam-shooting-former-president.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">obtained a single comment</a> posted by Crooks before the shooting took place:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>July 13 will be my premiere, watch as it unfolds.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lo and behold, on July 13, Crooks attempted to make history by assassinating a former U.S. President (and potential future president). </p>



<p>This connection is sure to prove inflammatory, as many sitting in the United States government have been outspoken against the impact violent video games have on young people worldwide. Donald Trump has directly condemned ‘gory’ video games and has suggested that exposure to such games creates violent people who want to go on shooting sprees.</p>



<p>It’s an age-old debate that has been running rampant since the 1990s when violent games – especially shooters – started emerging. It was arguably kicked off in earnest by the Columbine shooters, who in 1999 killed 13 people in their high school in Littleton, Colorado. The pair’s connection to games like DOOM became widely publicised, and from then on, gory games were linked to several more prolific shootings, such as the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre and the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting.</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see what’s said about this in the coming days.</p>

    <div>
        

        <p>And here's how much they're paid.</p>

    </div>

            <p>
Court documents have revealed detailed employment statistics for Valve, the company behind ubiquitous PC storefront Steam, the Steam Deck handheld, and - still - a team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-leaked-footage-of-valves-new-game-deadlock">dedicated to game development</a>. 
</p>
<p>
How many people work on the world's most-used PC game store and launcher? As of 2021, just 79. Valve's hardware team stood at just 41 people as of the same year, a fraction of its games team which employed 181 people. A further 35 staff were described as being employed in "admin" roles. 
</p>
<p>
Altogether, that's just 371 people employed by Valve in 2021, for a company believed to bring in around $6.5bn a year. EA, home to FIFA/FC, which also generates around $6.5bn annually, had 13,700 staff on the payroll this year.

<p>
So, how much did Valve pay its team of 371 people, back in 2021? We know the figures divided up for each team, too. As laid out by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/13/24197477/valve-employs-few-hundred-people-payroll-redacted">The Verge</a>, Valve's 79 staff working on Steam were paid a combined $76,446,633 - so, an average of $967k each. Its hardware team was paid a combined $17.7m - an average of $431k each. 
</p>
<p>
Valve's games team was paid a total of $192m for an average of $1m each. Even better off were its admin staff, who were paid a total of $157m, for an average of $4.5m each. Is this the team that Gabe Newell is in?
</p>
<p>
How do we know all this? Well, Valve is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gabe-newell-has-been-ordered-to-testify-in-person-at-a-steam-anti-trust-lawsuit">currently being sued by Humble Bundle's initial creator Wolfire Games</a> over the company's 30 percent cut taken from store purchases. (It's a similar fight to the one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-boss-pledges-more-legal-action-as-supreme-court-dismisses-apple-lawsuit-appeals">Epic Games is having with Apple and Google</a>, albeit over PC rather than mobile.) 
</p>
<p>
Wolfire has argued Steam has an effective monopoly over the PC market, and should end its power to block Steam games being sold for cheaper on rival storefronts - something it says has impacted its ability to do business via Humble. (Full disclosure - Humble is now owned by IGN Entertainment, which also owns this website.)
</p>
<p>
Back to Valve, and while the numbers above are just averages, and also three years out of date, it's worth noting that Valve's own public employee handbook claims the company offers "profitability per employee... higher than that of Google or Amazon or Microsoft". Valve is yet to comment on the document, which was removed from court records after its contents were first reported.

            <p>
Tickets are now on sale for The Genshin Concert Tour, coming to the UK for one night only at Wembley Arena.
</p>
<p>
The concert will see music from Genshin Impact performed by the Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg (conducted by Gast Waltzing), alongside visuals from the game.
</p>
<p>
Alongside the Wembley show on 29th October, the tour will also arrive in Berlin and Paris in December. Tickets are available to <a href="https://www.genshinconcert.live/">purchase online</a>.

Genshin Impact has certainly become a phenomenon since its release in September 2020. Its original music is produced in-house by HOYO-MiX at developer Mihoyo.
</p>
<p>
Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg is a German orchestra known for its performances of film music and concert works since its founding in 1918.

<p>
Game music concerts are thriving at the moment. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-concert-tour-visits-london-in-april">The Stardew Valley Festival of Seasons tour</a> has been ongoing this year, which added new dates due to its popularity.

<p>Still, Genshin Impact players and voice actors have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hoyoverse-voice-actors-speak-out-over-lack-of-diversity-in-genshin-impact-natlan-character-designs">criticised the lack of diversity in the character designs</a> from the game's new region.</p>

<p>A report by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/ea-sports-fc-25-paid-season-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a> reveals that EA Sports FC 25 will incorporate a paid season pass, which will net players rewards in three popular game modes: Ultimate Team, Career Mode, and Clubs. The ‘Premium Tier Pass’ will be an additional tier system for the existing free tier system.</p>



<p>The producer of EA Sports FC 25’s Ultimate Team mode, Karthik Venkateshan, revealed that the free tier in the new game will work similarly to what we saw in EA FC 24. “The premium pass will be something we’re adding on top,” added Venkanteshan. This season pass will be shared across their Ultimate Team, Clubs, and Career modes.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Richard Waltz, the game design director for the Ultimate team on EA FC 25, shared that players will only notice something extra in the premium tier compared to the free tier at a high rank. The premium season pass will have “no exclusive rewards that will mean that you have to do that. We’re going to be having players, packs, that sort of thing, in Clubs, customisation options”, Waltz explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players will have the option to purchase the EA FC 25 Season Pass using coins or FC points. However, the price of this Premium Tier pass is not known at the moment.</p>



<p>At the same time, EA FC 25 is a paid flagship title that already includes microtransactions, and introducing a paid season pass might raise some concerns among the players. For instance, the Apex Legends community isn’t too happy about the new battle pass system, and they are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-review-bombed-over-new-battle-pass-move/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressing their disappointment on Steam right now</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-mode-everyone-buy/</link>

<p>Battlestate Games has just released a new Escape from Tarkov update, and this one gives anyone the ability to purchase the new PvE mode that was introduced several weeks ago. Until now, only Edge of Darkness and Unheard Edition players could access PvE (Player vs. Environment), but this latest offer now means that anyone can get involved – <strong>for a price</strong>.</p>



<p>It costs $20 to secure PvE forever – once you’ve bought it, you own it until you decide to delete your Escape from Tarkov account, or something.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-pve-is-now-platform-wide">Tarkov’s PvE Is Now Platform-Wide</h2>



<p>Everyone can now play on Tarkov’s PvE mode, which has proven to be something of a solid alternative to the traditional PvP experience. For those who aren’t too emboldened by the idea of playing against savvy, skilled players who are unpredictable, talented, and at times overpowered, PvE represents the perfect mode to soak up everything the game offers.</p>



<p>In PvE, you’ll get the full experience – quests, trading, PMCs (AI), bosses, and the crushing disappointment of having a great raid only to be one-tapped by a Scav at 100m through a bush.</p>



<p>It’s a comprehensive offering that has some key advantages. Firstly, you can play PvE with other players, which means you’re not losing that team element. Second, it isn’t subject to regular wipes, so you’re not bound by time to complete as many quests as possible before your account is reset. But with that being said, you can still initiate a wipe yourself, if you want that experience. </p>



<p>Also, running an ‘offline’ PvE raid – which means playing solo (not as a Scav or on Streets of Tarkov) will load you into your raid in a matter of seconds, and not minutes. It’s a like-for-like replica of Tarkov, you’re just losing the element of fighting other players – that’s it. </p>



<p>Now that Battlestate Games has released this update, anyone can sample PvE – it just costs $20 to get that opportunity locked down.</p>

Even famous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> character designer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> director Tetsuya Nomura, who has a “huge number of game proposals lying dormant” in a mish mash of folders on his PC. You're just like him!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Nomura made the comments in an interview with Famitsu (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enixs-tetsuya-nomura-has-a-huge-stock-of-game-proposals-lying-dormant/">translated by Automaton</a> - thanks!) where he spoke alongside Takumi Isobe, director of upcoming action RPG Reynatis. When asked about the number of projects he has, Nomura jokes that his computer is a "labyrinth" replete with scenarios and synopses. He's unsure if any of them "will ever see the light of day". A bunch of game ideas and proposals get plopped into a folder simply called "NEW".</p>
<p>The veteran Square Enix man talks some more about his creative habits in the interview. I'll let you delve deeper if you want. I just wanted to evoke some sense of common humanity to all those frantic souls with fifteen first drafts languishing in the dark corners of their desktop. Because reader, I am also he. In many ways, I too am the man who designed the characters of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-final-fantasy-games-pc">the best Final Fantasy game</a>. I too have been credited on <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/33342/tetsuya-nomura/">103 video games</a>. We are the same. </p>
<p>I'm being silly. But I really do like it when the people we look upon so often as the legends of an industry reveal something mundane and ordinary about their working life, like the state of their folder hierarchy. All those people you admire, they do not only pee and poop, but they close the wrong tab by accident too. They get lost in their own sub-directories and have to quickly scribble down any idea that comes to mind into hasty documents so they don't "forget what the proposal is about", in Nomura's own words. If you spend a lot of time working on a PC, there is something genuinely unifying and levelling about the idea that even those we call the greats must click "remind me later" multiple times a day. Even Shigeru Miyamoto has probably typed his password with caps lock on and only realised it after hitting enter.</p>

            <p>
To celebrate today's launch of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Capcom has released a video performance of a traditional Japanese theatre show detailing its story.
</p>
<p>
It's performed by the National Bunraku Theatre, an Osaka-based company celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. Bunraku theatre combines narrative recitation, puppetry, and music, dating back to the Edo period from 1603 to 1868.
</p>
<p>
The performance is a tribute to the new game, which is steeped in Japanese folklore.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dungeons-of-hinterberg-review-airbrushed-brochure.930543/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dungeons-of-hinterberg-review-airbrushed-brochure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let me preface this review by stating that it was a weird experience. It’s been a while since I’ve been a spectator of so many peaks, valleys, troughs to trawl through, and clarity to connect the dots. If anything, I’ve left the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-of-hinterberg"><em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em></a> a changed individual, and whether that’s a good thing? Well, I guess we’ll see.</p>
<p>This is the debut title from Austrian-based developers Microbird, who’ve made <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em> as a love letter to their country of origin. You play as Luisa, a trainee for a law firm who is taking a hard-earned break to Hinterberg, based in the Austrian Alps. Not only is she using it as a chance to decompress, but to also master the new-found dungeons and magic that have cropped up in the area.</p>
<p>The game runs on a day-by-day basis. In the morning, you’ll get up, figure out where to go, and then decide whether it’s a day of dungeoneering, slaying beasts and looting up, or relaxing and taking in the sights. Both options have their benefits – the former more so than the latter – but once the evening clocks in, it’s time for a bit of shopping, socializing, and sleeping.</p>

<p>I will say that my first impressions weren’t great. When combat is introduced, you’ll quickly find how shallow it becomes, even in the later stages. You’re relegated to a light attack/heavy attack button layout, with a dodge roll and a rather meager stamina system added for good measure. There isn’t a combo system attached, so you’re largely just smacking your chosen attack until everything drops.</p>
<p><em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em> does try to make combat a bit more exciting and involving, in the form of “conduits”; massively powerful attacks that tend to devastate groups of enemies too easily. The game does know this and tries to limit how frequently you can use these conduits, but some might say not nearly enough, as energy for it drops all the time in battle.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the enemy variety is there, but visual design is not. All of the enemy designs are a murky brown with silver streaks running through them, and it makes readability a nightmare since a lot of enemy strategy boils down to clumping up together. Thankfully, there are the occasional bosses that break up the monotonous flow with some genuinely good combat design that makes the best out of <em>Hinterberg</em>’s gimmicks.</p>

<p>Of the 4 hub areas you’ll be looking for dungeons in, each one has a “skill shrine”. These offer you two magic spells exclusive to the area – one special attack, and a ranged attack – which not only can be used in combat but also in environmental puzzles <em>Hinterberg </em>offers inside and outside of the titular dungeons. This is where the game shows its hand a bit further.</p>
<p>They’re not complete brainbusters, but they’re a welcome break from just how dull <em>Hinterberg</em>’s combat can be, even in numbers. What does suck is that when I say the magic spells are exclusive to their specific hub areas, I mean it. The magical floating snowboard can only be used on the wintery peaks of Kolmstein, as the rest of the world cannot account for its special abilities.</p>
<p>Regardless, it makes for a better break than the rest of what the game has to offer, as the structure is largely obfuscated by its ludicrously fast pacing. The closest comparison one could make is with the eerily similar <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/boyfriend-dungeon-review"><em>Boyfriend Dungeon</em></a>, where the holiday appears to be on a time limit. <em>Hinterberg </em>offers several places where it treats the world as an actual spectacle, rightfully so but with rewards that are pitiful in comparison to what you can simply find and buy elsewhere.</p>

<p>There are also a lot of NPCs who are just downright unlikable. If you run into anybody who isn’t a local, they’re written with such a smug air of cynicism, that even the promise of a helpful character upgrade isn’t enough to spend a night with them. If you want to use the game's photo mode, you’ll have to spend a minimum of one night with a depressing and arrogant journalist who refuses to engage in even the smallest amount of whimsy, and that's before things turn sour.</p>
<p>Spend time with the locals however, and you’ll see <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em> switch from a middling dungeon crawler to an interesting and arresting commentary on privilege. I’m not even kidding, when you hear from the locals, the perspective changes, and suddenly it’s no longer a cutesy dungeon crawler with a charming cel-shaded aesthetic, but <em><span><span>Pokémon </span></span></em>by way of Alan Moore.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the energy is alive as you begin to realize just how much Microbird cares – not just about the game world they’ve created, but the world they inhabit outside of it. The amount of disdain it appears to host for “instagrammable” ideals, tourist traps, and theme parks built into decades of culture. Now I was playing to stop it, for the sake of a world that uses the town of Hinterberg as a perpetual name tag.</p>

<p>And then… I’m not going to say it drops the ball, but <em>Hinterberg</em>’s combat fails to make up for the spectacle the world starts to present. The final handful of bosses struggle with camera placement, legitimate strategy, and a narrative that doesn’t really know where to go from the conclusion it sets up. Without going into heavy spoilers, imagine if the goal of brushing your teeth was just cleaning the front set.</p>
<p>Sure, no one else can see the back row, but they're going to be thinking about it.</p>
<p>Still, there was an urge to return to the <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em>, even if it was for a short while. The game has a fantastic trick that nearly every player is going to gloss over on their first playthrough, so I was raring to go. However, trying to get through the combat a second time just wasn’t cutting it for me.</p>
<h2><em>Dungeons of Hinterberg </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>
<p>I love the world of <em>Hinterberg</em>, I love the people that inhabit it, and the soft characterizations Microbird applies to each and every one of them. It's just that the core combat can be so tedious, that it became an obstacle I had to contend with to get to the good stuff. Sure, I could use Hinterberg as a retreat, but I care about this world, and as the game goes on, it’s quite clear that a lack of action doesn't help anybody.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
A flowery, gorgeous world that is enthralling to listen to, but abrasive to interact with, to the point where its structure can confuse players with its intent. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)
