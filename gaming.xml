            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/886848/lenovo-legion-go-fold-concept-windows-foldable-pc-gaming-handheld</link>
            <guid>1450129</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Lenovo put a foldable display on a gaming handheld. The Legion Go Fold Concept is a Windows-based handheld with a flexible POLED display, detachable Joy-Con-like controllers, and a folio case to turn the whole thing into a mini laptop.</p><p>You can use it as a standard Steam Deck-esque handheld with the display folded down to 7.7 inches and controllers attached at its sides, or you can unfold it for a bigger experience. When unfolded, the controllers can be repositioned to all four sides, allowing you to play with the screen in vertical or horizontal orientations.</p><p>In vertical splitscreen mode, you can put your game on one half of the screen and a second window (like your chat or game guide) on the other half. Horizontal fullscreen mode gives your game the full 11.6 inches of real estate in a 16:10 aspect ratio. To go into laptop mode, you remove the controllers and mount the handheld into a folio case with a stand, built-in keyboard, and trackpad. The controllers can be put into a separate grip mount to unify them as one gamepad.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Standard 7.7-inch handheld mode.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>There are a lot of ways you can use this folding handheld, including turning one of its controllers into a vertical mouse like on other Legion Go handhelds, but there’s one thing it doesn’t do: fold down to close and protect its screen. The Go Fold only folds outwards, so don’t expect a Nintendo DS or GameBoy Advance-like clamshell that closes for portability. Instead, it’s all about getting bigger than your average gaming handheld and offering more. (Though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment">we’ve tried <em>bigger </em>before</a>.)</p><p>The Legion Go Fold has some formidable specs: an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V Lunar Lake processor, 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and a 48Whr battery. The plastic-covered OLED has a resolution of 2435 x 1712 and 165Hz refresh rate. And there’s even a second, circular toushscreen on the right controller, under the face buttons. It doubles as a touchpad and can be a support display, allowing you to swipe between extracted UI elements from a game (which I wouldn’t expect to be widely supported), a clock, system monitoring, or an animated GIF (just for fun).</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->13</strong><span><figcaption><em><em>While the screen is positoned here to prop the handheld up for the photo, it can fold all the way back on itself and hold together.</em></em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>During my brief in-person demo I didn’t get to play any graphically-intense games — just <em>Balatro</em>, which can practically play on a potato. The screen looked plenty sharp, but like any foldable there’s a crease down the middle; it’s very visible, but you learn to look past it and ignore it after just a bit. The build and feel of the whole thing felt a little fragile, and detaching and reattaching the controllers was definitely janky. Build quality will hopefully be improved if this device ever actually makes it to market.</p><p>The laptop mode was a pleasant surprise for me though. I did not expect a gaming handheld to double as a conventional computer you could get work done on. The Legion Go Fold’s case took quite a bit of fumbling before I set it up correctly, but it shouldn’t take too long to get used to if you actually lived with it.</p><p>Then again, I don’t know if anyone is going to be able to live with this thing — ever. I’d love for the Legion Go Fold to go from concept to real product like other out-there Lenovo ideas, but I shudder to think what it might cost. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost">Legion Go 2</a> is already priced well over $1,000. And with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/880812/ramageddon-ram-shortage-memory-crisis-price-2026-phones-laptops">ongoing RAMageddon crisis</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/839353/pc-ram-shortage-pricing-spike-news">we’re living through</a>, there’s no telling how much more expensive an actual Legion Go Fold would be if it came out in a year or more.</p><p>But even if it’s not the kind of foldable I expected, and even though it may never come out, it’s certainly cool. Now somebody please make a folding PC handheld that goes from kinda-big to really small. I think that’d be the one for me.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fans-speculate-a-krato-less-god-of-war-spin-off-is-in-the-works-2000674900</link>
            <guid>1450114</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>While <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> came out in 2022, the series as a whole has hardly been in Odinsleep. From remasters to new games and cancelled ones, much has stirred in Kratos’ mythological realm. After spotting <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-santa-monica-studio-is-developing-a-new-franchise-within-the-god-of-war-universe.1449790/">a now-deleted LinkedIn page</a> regarding Sony Santa Monica Studio, fans believe a big new <em>God of War</em> game is in the works, albeit one without its titular vengeance-seeker.</p>

 <p>The page from a Senior Writer at Sony Interactive Entertainment says they “Helped shape narrative vision and creative direction for a new franchise within the <em>God of War</em> universe” and ended their time at the studio last September. While speculative threads on ResetEra don’t hold much water on their own, reporter and industry fortune-teller Jason Schreier chimed in, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-santa-monica-studio-is-developing-a-new-franchise-within-the-god-of-war-universe.1449790/page-4#post-151996075">posting</a> “I suppose now it’s become obvious what I meant by ‘not a new IP but it might feel like one.'”</p> <p>It’s been a busy month for the ol’ <em>God of War</em>. During the most recent State of Play, Sony <a href="https://kotaku.com/original-god-of-war-trilogy-getting-a-full-remake-2000668356">unveiled a remake for the entire original trilogy of games</a>, in which Kratos cleaves the entire Greek pantheon from Hades to Olympus. It was paired with <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-war-sons-sparta-prequel-2d-retro-shadowdrop-2000668367">a surprise 2D prequel, <em>Sons of Sparta</em></a>, which dropped that same day. On the other end, Sony <a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">shuttered Bluepoint Games</a>, who recently saw their live-service <em>God of War</em> spin-off <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">cancelled following the dramatic fall of <em>Concord</em></a>. Somewhere in the middle, <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-the-god-of-war-show-oh-no-oh-noooo-2000674450">the first glimpse</a> at Amazon’s live-action adaptation dropped online, leaving fans to contend with something that resembles a Super Bowl commercial.</p> <p>Prequels and adaptations address the past and present for <em>God of War</em>, but what does that leave for the future? Schreier’s recent post about a new-but-not-new IP seems to refer to one made <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-406#post-142670637">last July</a>, in which he scratched out a rumor that Cory Barlog was developing a new sci-fi adventure. Put together, these two posts suggest that new IP and this spin-off are one in the same. This new game might see another dramatic departure, not only from the series’ main protagonist but its genre as well, similar to when <em>God of War</em> descended from a frenzied <em>Devil May Cry</em> hack-em-up to an over the shoulder affair. It would certainly be more consistent for Sony, who seem more eager to tease out their existing characters with spin-offs, cross-media adaptations, <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-colorful-three-player-co-op-game-ps5-pc-trailer-2000666041">live-service games</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-sony-parappa-1851653602">self-congratulatory cameos</a> than develop something new.</p>

<p>The voice behind Princess Zelda discusses the direction and expectations, or lackthereof, she was given during her audition.</p>



<p>Patricia Summersett has been the English voice of Princess Zelda since the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" id="2579">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> in 2017. Now, she’s opening up about the audition process, the direction she was given by Nintendo, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-summersett-was-given-bleached-script-ahead-of-casting">Summersett Was Given ‘Bleached Script’ Ahead of Casting</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-zelda-turns-40-voice-actress-patricia-summersett-reveals-hopes-for-the-future-and-clarifies-her-thoughts-on-link-and-zeldas-gorgeous-relationship" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Patricia Summersett explained that she was given a bleached script when first auditioning for the role. This means that she was given limited information about the role she was auditioning for and didn’t actually know she was attempting to provide the voice for one of gaming’s most iconic characters. </p>



<p>Summersett was given the description of Zelda as a younger teenage princess who is wise beyond her years. She was also told that the character had the weight of the world thrust upon her.</p>



<p>“Those were key things I’d gone into when I looked at the script, when I started to play around with my voice and decide what to do for that particular character,” she said.</p>



<p>Additionally, Summersett reveals that she’d also tried out for other roles in the game, one of which ended up being Urbosa.</p>







<h2 id="h-summersett-views-her-zelda-accent-as-hylian">Summersett Views Her Zelda Accent As Hylian</h2>



<p>As for Zelda having a British accent, Summersett revealed that it was not a note from Nintendo. Rather, it was a choice she made on her own.</p>



<p>“I schooled in London and so I thought something that sounds a little bit RP would make it heightened and put it into that kind of class system I was imagining for royalty. So I did that,” she said. “It’s a little more comfortable to say this is a Hylian accent versus just a particular version of a UK accent.”</p>







<p>Link and Zelda are coming to the big screen for the first time ever in 2027. Check out the latest on the Legend of Zelda movie at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/link-and-zelda-actors-confirmed-nintendo-legend-of-zelda/" id="132081">this link.</a></p>

<p>NVIDIA’s CFO sets the stage for uncertainty about the company’s ability to grow in the gaming sector amid current memory shortages.</p>



<p>Currently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nvidia/" id="420">NVIDIA </a>is reporting record growth following its Q4 earnings for fiscal year 2026. However, as the company moves toward a heavy focus on AI and data centers, rather than relying on gaming for the majority of its revenue, the question has been raised about whether it will continue to grow year over year in the forthcoming fiscal year.</p>







<h2 id="h-nvidia-cfo-cautions-investors-on-gaming-growth-uncertainty">NVIDIA CFO Cautions Investors on Gaming Growth Uncertainty</h2>



<p>During an investor call following the release of their quarterly earnings, NVIDIA CFO Colette Kress was asked directly if she foresees a continued pattern of year-over-year growth in the next fiscal year. </p>



<p>In response, she said that, as much as the company would love to have an additional supply of memory, they expect things to be tight for the next “couple of quarters.” Therefore, it’s still too early to tell.</p>



<p>“We do believe for a couple of quarters, it is going to be very tight. If things improve by the end of the year, there is an opportunity to think about what that is from a year-over-year growth [angle], but it’s still too early for us to know at this time, and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can,” she said.</p>

<h2 id="h-nvidia-is-skipping-graphics-card-releases-to-focus-on-ai">NVIDIA Is Skipping Graphics Card Releases to Focus on AI</h2>



<p>It was recently reported that NVIDIA was opting not to release new graphics cards this year. This isn’t a concerted effort to focus on AI chips and datacenters due to the RAM shortage. Additionally, the company plans on cutting production of the current RTX 50-series graphics cards due to the shortage.

<p>NVIDIA reports unprecedented growth in its financial results for Q4 of the fiscal year 2026.</p>



<p>On February 25, NVIDIA announced its quarterly earnings for the quarter, which ended one month earlier. The company recorded revenue of $68.1 billion, up 20% from the previous quarter and 73% from this time last year. Also, total revenue for the fiscal year was $215.9 billion. That is a 65% increase from the prior year.</p>







<h2>Data Center Growth Skyrockets for NVIDIA</h2>



<p>As the AI boom continues to take shape, NVIDIA’s Q4 data center revenue was a record-setting $62.3 billion, up 22% from the previous quarter and 75% from last year. Their report attributes this growth to major platform shifts, specifically accelerated Computing and AI. Full-year data center revenue rose 68% to a record $193.7 billion.</p>







<h2 id="h-gaming-revenue-grows-for-nvidia">Gaming Revenue Grows for NVIDIA</h2>



<p>As for gaming revenue, Q4 saw a 47% year-over-year increase. Total gaming revenue for the quarter with $3.7 billion. However, while there was year-over-year growth, gaming and aipc revenue are actually down 13% from the previous quarter. That decrease is attributed to inventory naturally moderating following a season of strong holiday demand.</p>



<p><a href="https://incomeshares.com/en-eu/insights/nvidia-revenue-change-since-2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jonathan Hobbs of IncomeShares </a>noted that back in 2020, gaming was the largest revenue driver for NVIDIA. However, data centers now account for 90% of NVIDIA’s revenue, signaling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-wont-release-a-new-graphics-card-this-year-as-it-focuses-on-ai/" id="174579">the concentrated shift to AI.</a></p>







<p>The AI boom, leading to a RAM shortage, continues to loom over the future of gaming. Currently, it is expected that gamers may not see the PlayStation 6<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-may-be-released-as-late-as-2029/" id="177026"> until 2029</a>. Even Microsoft does not want to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-not-committed-to-hard-2027-launch-for-next-xbox-its-claimed/" id="175153">commit to a 2027 launch window for its next console.</a></p>

<p>It’s a new week, and it’s an important one! This is when you’ll see the 1000th NYT Connections puzzle land, so expect some interesting challenges to surface as the week goes on. Today, we’re one step closer to that milestone with #995, which is a neat one to start your week with.</p>



<p>If you’re coming out of a sweet weekend and preparing to start a busy work week, make sure you kick it off the right way with a spot of NYT Connections success. Below, you’ll find the hints and answers you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>

<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marathon’s Server Slam Didn’t Gain Traction This Weekend, But It Still Topped Some Titans]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-server-slam-traction-top-titans/</link>
            <guid>1450033</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon’s server slam started on Thursday, and within a couple of hours, hundreds of thousands of people had either downloaded it and started playing <strong>or </strong>started watching it on a streaming platform somewhere. It picked up pace, hit more than 143,000 concurrent players on Steam alone, and then promptly <strong><em>fizzled</em></strong><em>.</em></p>



<p>Within six hours, the peak dropped by 30,000 players, and by the following evening, it was peaking at <strong>half </strong>the original high. Many believed the weekend would yield some gains as players worldwide came off work and into Bungie’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98">Marathon</a>, but it wasn’t to be. That being said, the server slam still managed to top some titans on Steam.</p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-could-go-either-way">Marathon Could Go Either Way</h2>



<p>Marathon didn’t make immense waves in the gaming space this weekend, but it still beat the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty/" id="32">Call of Duty</a>.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that these two titanic franchises have had their fair share of issues in the last few months. Black Ops 7 launched to a woeful reception and is suffering immensely at the hands of a disinterested community. On the other hand, Battlefield 6 continues to flounder amidst poor updates and a slow change cadence.</p>



<p>Marathon will be the ‘new shiny thing’ this month when it launches on March 5, marking Bungie’s long-awaited entry into the extraction shooter space. It’s going up against some monumental competition, especially in the form of both ARC Raiders and Escape from Tarkov, but tens of thousands of people have already gotten a taste of Marathon and (likely) want more.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4254230/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon’s server slam</a> product had a 24-hour peak player count of 76,437 users <strong>on Steam</strong>. This is how that stacks up against other, similar games on the platform:</p>



<ul>
<li>ARC Raiders – 227,765</li>



<li>Apex Legends – 201,571</li>



<li><strong>Marathon – 76,437</strong></li>



<li>Battlefield 6 – 71,861</li>



<li>Call of Duty – 52,575</li>



<li>Escape from Tarkov – 19,220</li>



<li>Destiny 2 – 11,623</li>
</ul>



<p>The discourse around Marathon has been pretty mixed. There’s enough positivity there for the game to enjoy a semi-decent launch, but only if Bungie can deliver a strong roadmap and rapid enough updates. The team has already been addressing the game’s biggest gripes, including concerns around the complex UI, the lack of PvP, and optimization issues on PC platforms.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Marathon is <strong>also </strong>going to be a game that lives or dies by its viewership, such is the life of extraction games. If the creators can get hooked, they’ll retain an audience and keep feeding people into the game, but if that doesn’t happen, Marathon will surely plummet.</p>



<p>In the opening hours of the server slam, Marathon secured a peak of around 301,000 viewers <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/407314011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitch</a>, and then, thanks to a huge push from popular streamers, it edged past that to hit 350,000 on Sunday, March 1. That was short-lived, though. The peak came at around 7 PM GMT, and by 10 PM GMT, only 70,000 people were watching the game.</p>



<p>It should be stressed that this isn’t a <strong>negative </strong>take of Marathon’s performance, as such. This is a game that could offer a sorely needed shake-up to the extraction genre, in a way that ARC Raiders managed to do in October 2025. It’s unique enough to leave a mark on the space, but the longevity of the thing is yet to be witnessed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Zoomer Obsession With DVDs Is A Blueprint For Saving Gaming]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dvds-zoomers-physical-media-retro-games-2000674865</link>
            <guid>1450027</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2026-02-23/why-gen-z-wants-to-buy-rent-dvds-blu-rays-in-age-of-streaming"><em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported on a surprising trend</a> among young people. Physical media sales, DVDs especially, are experiencing a new burst of popularity. After a decade of freefall, enthusiasm among Gen Z halved a 20 percent sales decline in 2024 to just 9 percent in 2025. Stores have noticed. The <em>Times</em>’ Karla Gachet spoke with staff at cultural hubs like Cinefile and Vidiots to discover why 2026 is already shaping up to be their biggest year, with the latter renting a surprising 1,000 DVDs a week.</p>

 <p>It begs the question, could this pleasant trend take hold in video games too? “I definitely notice that younger people are actually interested in seeing where the game series of today first originated,” Daniel Teixeira of the long-running <a href="https://acgamesonline.com/">Toronto indie shop A&amp;C Games</a> tells <em>Kotaku</em>. “It’s cool how some are taking such a historical approach and paying respect to the roots.”</p> <p>For DVDs, it’s no mystery. There’s a perfect storm for a new fascination with physical media. Big names like A24, Criterion, and Letterboxd are fostering a new generation of cinephiles who are engaging with more than just routine tentpole blockbusters. On the other end, Netflix and other major streamers are failing to service a generation that actually cares about film. They are raising fees and playing ads, all while the relentless streaming war consolidation is <a href="https://kotaku.com/looney-tunes-max-warner-bros-streaming-original-hbo-1851770395">tossing back catalogues into a black hole</a>.</p> <p>The vinyl revival amongst millennials was partly about fidelity, partly about prestige. The return of DVDs is about necessity. The only practical way to dependably enjoy the films you love without corporate interruption is to own them on plastic. Add in some interesting third spaces to chat with like-minded folks and mill around in and suddenly you’ve got a burgeoning new scene going.</p>

 <p>The conditions rhyme in gaming. Mass distribution has overwhelmingly gone digital. Frustrations with <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-feb-2026-gen-ai-art-demos-2000673280">curation</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mastercard-denies-pressuring-steam-to-censor-nsfw-games-2000614393">censorship</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/john-wick-hex-delisting-steam-removed-three-days-ps4-pc-1851786259">long-term access</a> are as concerning here as anywhere else. The ennui from frictionless blockbuster releases is also clear. Players are picking up fewer games, and those who play the most are sticking with <a href="https://kotaku.com/most-playstation-5-owners-have-been-playing-the-same-games-since-2022-2000672009">games released years ago</a>. It has provoked the likes of Sony and Xbox into half-baked or shortsighted responses, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-closed-beta-open-beta-server-slam-same-time-ps5-pc-playstation-2000673261">live service</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087">AI</a>, leading to results that will inevitably shrink both the industry and the diversity of releases, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-generational-divide-roblox-nintendo-2000672648">intensify disinterest</a>.</p>

 <p>But there are gaping chasms between the two mediums as well. Film and music survive because of the efforts of movie houses, rental, and record shops. Games have historically thrived in permanent third spaces like stores and arcades, but those traditionally put commerce before culture. When you think of them, you think of how much, or how little, is in your wallet. Games culture has more recently thrived in competitive spaces and online file sharing sites, though <a href="https://kotaku.com/myrient-retro-video-game-preservation-roms-ai-ram-cost-2000674477">digital spaces are even more precarious than real ones</a>.</p> <p>Teixeira shared these concerns. While young people are interested in exploring the past, the price point has been a barrier, making the pursuit “elitist” as a result. “I feel bad at how much they need to spend to acquire physical copies,” says Teixeira. “Ever since the pandemic, being able to collect older video games is far more difficult, particularly with whatever is most popular.”</p>

 <p>It puts a lot of pressure on used stores, whose sellers need to respect rising prices to attract goods, even if it locks out younger fans. Correcting this negative feedback loop requires an unorthodox approach.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000674879" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674879"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674879">Photo by the author</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>Diamonds in the rough</strong></h2> <p>Since opening four years ago in San Bernardino County, <a href="https://linktr.ee/itsratnest">RATNEST</a> has also noticed the uptick in younger customers. “My younger demo has seen a significant increase,” says store purveyor Robbie Ratnest. “Especially with the kind of more obscure titles I carry involving anime, as well as the Japanese/Eastern horror, drama, tokusatsu, kaiju, etc. They’re very much looking for more than what modern media is offering for an average experience on top of it.”</p> <p>RATNEST looks a little less like your traditional games store and more like a punk haunt. The original walls are lost behind a mosaic of stickers and old TV feeds. The lighting is dramatic, darkness pierced with bangs of purple and static hums. The trail of vintage games, arcade cabinets and vinyl is like a treasure hunt. Robbie tells me that after working in “far too many places that do not reflect what they claim to be about,” he wanted a space that reinforced the culture first, the cash second.</p>

 <p>“I’m not here to make money, I make money to be here,” says Ratnest. “We generally shun those who are very outspoken about flipping games or getting them graded. Absolutely do not give a shit about that. I want these games in people’s hands who want to enjoy them.” Even if it puts his retirement in peril, he’d rather games be enjoyed than fed into another speculative asset market <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-30th-anniversary-pikachu-plush-scalpers-2000674775">that overshadows the entire scene</a>.</p> <p>Last fall I hit up the <a href="https://www.torontogameexpo.ca/">Toronto Game Expo</a>, a retro convention, at the CNE grounds. When I buy, I don’t buy for commercial value. I already own the most <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-64/clay-fighter-sculptors-cut">valuable Nintendo 64 game</a>. I have it because I was a weird kid who fished it out of Blockbuster’s $5 bin. I buy items that speak to me. A boxed copy of <em>Myst</em> for the Atari Jaguar CD. A strategy guide for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantei_Jing%C5%ABji_Sabur%C5%8D:_Shinjuku_Ch%C5%AB%C5%8D_K%C5%8Den_Satsujin_Jiken"><em>Shinjuku Central Park Murder Case</em></a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuoso_(video_game)"><em>Virtuoso</em></a>. When one vendor asked what I was looking for, I said “something interesting.” He immediately reached for his most expensive item. I respect the hustle, but it illustrates why games fail to foster themselves the way other mediums do.</p>

 <p>Vinyl and film have their intense collectors too, obviously, but unlike in retro games they are not the norm. Likewise, even big box game stores have provided a community space. It’s no secret that GameStop can function like an after-school daycare, the former CEO even <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-11/gamestop-s-new-ceo-adds-couches-and-tournaments-in-comeback-bid">planning to install couches to help students settle in</a>. But if you want to invest in games culture for the long haul, you’ll have to put profiteering aside.</p> <p>Once upon a time home media sales were half the battle. Box office busts like <em>Blade Runner</em>, <em>Fight Club</em> and <em>The Thing</em> were redeemed by VHS and DVD numbers over a lifetime. We’re still a ways out from restoring that ecosystem, and industries across entertainment are more short-term-profit-motivated than ever. But if you want games for 100 years over one, if you want off the live-service ride, it will require more imaginative thinking.</p> <p>“Video games provide you with pieces of your future self in a way that other media cannot,” says Ratnest. “That piece of that culture made from inspiration built upon inspiration will always overshadow the ‘collectability.'”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-onboarding-update-ammo-meds-2000674872</link>
            <guid>1450024</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-server-slam-beta-ps5-review-impressions-guns-extraction-shooter-2000674107"><em>Marathon</em> is brutal</a>. That’s kind of the point. You play a futuristic gig economy worker paid by cyberpunk corpos who’s repeatedly getting murdered as you scavenge a dangerous, abandoned space colony for valuable gear, tech, and data. In a single-player game these vibes could be hitched to a meticulously calibrated campaign where every moment is carefully designed, engineered, and tested to keep things ultra-tense without repeatedly kicking the player’s teeth in. That’s a lot harder in a multiplayer game where every level comes with up to 18 super-sized human variables.</p>

 <p>This is the promise of <em>Marathon</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-ammo-pvp-ui-bungie-feedback-server-slam-2000674385">also its curse</a>. Play a couple of rounds and you will not be shocked to see that the game’s free beta weekend has a massive bounce rate on Steam as people try and it and seemingly don’t return. Bungie’s extraction shooter requires a lot of the player. They are at a severe disadvantage if they’re alone and not on the mic. Their characters start out weak and incredibly impaired. Sprinting quickly overheats your body. Even sliding at the wrong time can leave you hopelessly vulnerable.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">yeah learning how to properly cycle through a map does a lot more for getting people into it then anything else I've found. and without any help learning how to do that is fucking Hard</p> <p>— Paddy (@HorrorBuffPaddy) <a href="https://twitter.com/HorrorBuffPaddy/status/2027771488095306184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>There are nuances to <em>Marathon</em> that are hard to immediately pick up on and the game routinely punishes you for being even a little dumb, impatient, or underprepared. You might think the point of the game is to drop into a match, kill tons of stuff, complete an objective, and escape with great loot. That’s what most other shooters have taught players, including Bungie’s own <em>Destiny 2</em>. In actuality, <em>Marathon</em> is about dropping down to a planet’s surface, hoarding your bullets like gold, and trying to avoid fights whenever and wherever possible.</p> <p>Doing so will help you slowly accrue all the gear and upgrades you need to start projecting yourself as a real badass threat on Tau Ceti IV. Failing to do so will make you feel like you’re hitting your head against a wall and making no progress because you’re terrible at the game and playing it wrong. You might actually be terrible and you are definitely playing it wrong, but one of those things is fixable and can still lead to a lot of enjoyment with<em> Marathon</em>. But the game itself currently offers little in the way of guardrails to steer players into how to approach <em>Marathon</em> and have fun with it while they’re still figuring it out.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Please do not change / make drastic changes to make things easier.</p> <p>The scarcity of resources + focus on stats makes this game completely unique and fun. </p> <p>Overheat is literally solved through a skill tree and items, it's not even remotely a big deal.</p> <p>— aaalex.hl (@aaalexhl) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaalexhl/status/2027926616748527627?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In some ways it’s like the opposite of <em>Destiny 2.</em> Bungie’s ongoing loot shooter, despite its notoriously convoluted and confusing early game, is overwhelmingly generous, showering players with rare gear and second chances at every turn. If I had one main criticism of the game in recent years it’s that it’s gotten too trivial at the bottom end of the grind. But <em>Marathon</em> is like if you introduced players to <em>Destiny 2</em> by throwing them all into one of its end-game raids together. But also friendly fire was turned on, loot was scarce, and you only got to keep what you survived with.</p>

 <p>That’s an incredibly bold and exciting way to shake things up, and also an experience designed to chew most people up and spit them out before they ever catch a whiff of what makes <em>Marathon</em> so special they might want to spend $40 on it. We’re in day four of the game’s free server slam and Bungie has kept reassuring players that it’s listening to feedback about <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2027924343800648062">how to re-tune everything</a> from med pack and ammo economies to the gorgeous but overbearing UI, the lack of PVP, and heat generation during movement.</p> <p>I think it’s easy to look at any of those and understand why they might make <em>Marathon</em> less fun for people. They certainly don’t make it easier to play. But they’re also all things you can start to rationalize and come around on the more you play, especially once you start trying to adapt to the game that’s actually in front of you rather than the one you’re expecting. Unfortunately, I think <em>Marathon</em>‘s initial hostility will stop most people from ever getting to a place like that.</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <p>A former senior writer from Sony Santa Monica has revealed the studio is working on "a new franchise within the God of War universe".</p>
<p>The LinkedIn account that shared the news seems to no longer exist, but a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-santa-monica-studio-is-developing-a-new-franchise-within-the-god-of-war-universe.1449790/">screenshot</a> of their profile, if real, suggests the team is developing the franchise beyond the God of War games we currently know.</p>
<p>The senior writer, who worked at the studio from 2020 until late last year, reportedly <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-santa-monica-studio-is-developing-a-new-franchise-within-the-god-of-war-universe.1449790/">wrote</a> on their <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/lsignorino/">LinkedIn</a> profile that they had "helped shape narrative visions and creative direction and Sony Santa Monica Studio for a franchise within the God of War universe, developing characters, storylines, and original lore that expanded the acclaimed IP".</p>
<p>"Integrated story with gameplay and worldbuilding through scripts and narrative content, collaborating across disciplines to deliver emotionally driven experiences for a global audience," the blurb continued. "Contributed to long-term narrative and franchise strategy."</p>
<p>Given the original LinkedIn account has been deleted, there's no way to authenticate the claim, but it does tie in with prior reporting, including news that Bluepoint – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-closes-acclaimed-demons-souls-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-despite-acknowledging-it-had-delivered-exceptional-experiences-for-the-playstation-community">which was closed last week</a> – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">was developing a live service game within the God of War series</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-santa-monica-studio-is-developing-a-new-franchise-within-the-god-of-war-universe.1449790/page-4#post-151996075">Commenting</a> on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-santa-monica-studio-is-developing-a-new-franchise-within-the-god-of-war-universe.1449790/">ResetEra</a> thread that shared the news late yesterday, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier wrote: "I suppose now it's become obvious what I meant by 'not a new IP but it might feel like one'".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-shares-look-at-ryan-hurst-as-kratos-in-god-of-war-tv-series">Amazon shared a first look at Ryan Hurst as Kratos in its God of War TV series</a>. The picture showed Hurst leaning forward as he taught his son, Atreus, played by Callum Vinson, how to hunt. It's an image that echoes the opening scenes of the God of War reboot, released in 2018.</p>

It's been a busy one with a Nintendo Direct, a Pokémon Presents, and a couple of shadow drops and Switch 2 surprises. That means it's time for a lovely edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a>.</p>
<p>So yeah, a big month for what is the shortest one of the year. Spring is approaching, but that doesn't mean we want to start stepping outside and enjoying the crisp, early sunshine. There's a <em>lot</em> of games on the eShop right now, so let's look at the best of them.</p>
<p>So, the rules: our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from February 2026 from titles we've reviewed, and the three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8vjhrqt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<h3>Honourable Mentions</h3>
<p>This past month gave us eight games to fight over for the top three positions, all scoring at least a 7/10 from us. A couple of them are getting physical releases later in the year, but as with previous iterations of this regular feature, they're eligible for the votes here.</p>
<p>Obviously Switch 2 Edition shadow drops graced us this month, but given that we haven't officially reviewed them, we've opted to exclude them from the vote this time around — sorry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of other game releases, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a> just sneaked in at the end of the month, but we didn't have access to them before release so we're working on our review. And we also want to give a shout-out to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a>, which are <em>technically</em> available physically via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-generation-pack">Resident Evil Generation Pack</a> on Switch 2.</p>
<p>So, let's give it up for the smaller releases that just missed out on the podium.</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">3rd Place - Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>After months of rumours, was anyone surprised to see Digital Eclipse's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition</a> pop up during Sony's State of Play in February? The most shocking part of the reveal was that it was also out within 24 hours of its announcement.</p>
<p>And yes, the collection does have a handful of issues in the form of music and a lack of variety in content, <em>but</em> as always with Digital Eclipse, the magic of the museum, the documentary-style clips, and the added bonuses make this a worthy celebration for an Ubisoft icon.</p>
<p>We hope those issues are fixed by the time the physical release rolls out, because the original Rayman deserves the best, hence its placement in the top three. For now, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition">it gets a 7/10 from us</a>.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disney-afternoon-collection">2nd Place - The Disney Afternoon Collection (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Wait, what's this? <em>Another</em> Digital Eclipse job? And this one goes even further back. We've been clamouring for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disney-afternoon-collection">The Disney Afternoon Collection</a> on Switch, and we've been rewarded for our patience: with the addition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/goof_troop">Goof Troop</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/bonkers">Bonkers</a>, we now have eight retro classics to dig into on both Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Really, Goof Troop is the star here, but we think most of the games in the compilation are great. If you grew up with any of these NES and SNES titles, then you'll <em>also</em> know that some of these games are darn tough. Thank goodness for rewind and some other QoL features then.</p>
<p>It really is a retro fan's dream, and a good reminder of some excellent classic Disney titles. We awarded the collection <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-disney-afternoon-collection">an 8/10 in our review</a> for those reasons and more.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/caves_of_qud">1st Place - Caves of Qud (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>But Rayman and Disney are no match for 17 years of game development and one of the most-ambitious and rich roguelikes <em>ever</em>. After being in Early Access for a long time and releasing on Steam back in 2024, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/caves_of_qud">Caves of Qud</a> made its console debut on Switch in February 2026 with very little compromised for the hybrid system.</p>
<p>Is it dense? Yes. Is it complex? Very. And is there a little too much squeezed onto the little screen at once? Maybe. But what Caves of Qud delivers is an incredibly rewarding experience for those who love good systems and good stories. It's tense, it's tough, but it's deeply satisfying.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/caves-of-qud">We gave Caves of Qud an 8/10</a>, and it sits at the top of the podium for February's eShop Selects. Congrats to Freehold Games for this monumental achievement!</p>
</div></div><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-january-2026"><strong>&lt; Nintendo eShop Selects - January 2026</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-february-2026]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/2027951263602626570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to dataminer PlayStation Game Size</a> (@PlaystationSize on X), <strong>Rockstar Games</strong> has just added title IDs for <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong> on Sony's <strong>PlayStation Store</strong>, possibly hinting at pre-orders opening in the near future:</p>



<p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI title IDs have been added to the PlayStation database. I expect we’ll see something about the game soon, probably the start of pre-orders.</em></p>



<p>When asked how long it usually takes between the time when title IDs first appear on the store and the actual reveal of the pricing information, the dataminer replied:</p>



<p><em>To be honest, it completely depends on the publisher, and it's not something I know for sure. But I don't think there's going to be a long wait.</em></p>



<p>PlayStation Game Size <strong>regularly scrapes the PlayStation Store database</strong> searching for news and details about upcoming games. They'd previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-launch-date-possibly-leaked-via-ps-store-db/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered the placeholder date for <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong></a>, September 30, 2022, which had been entered into the PlayStation Store, and it turned out to be not far from the actual release date, <strong>November 11, 2022</strong>. More recently, they were behind <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ps5-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the original discovery of the native Kingdom Come: Deliverance PlayStation 5 version</a></strong>.</p>



<p>The fact that Rockstar Games has started doing preparatory work on Grand Theft Auto VI's store page will undoubtedly reinvigorate the hopes of fans, who are eager to see the studio confirm the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">Nov</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">mber 19, 2026 date</a></strong>. There have already been two delays, after all, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from Fall 2025 to May 26, 2026</a></strong>, and then again to November. <strong>Rockstar has never delayed any of its games three times</strong>, but there's a first time for everything.</p>



<p>As much as people are waiting to see if it actually releases this year, <strong>there's almost the same level of anticipation to discover the game's price</strong>. Wedbush Securities analyst <strong>Michael Pachter</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launch-for-100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a tremor throughout the industry</a> when he claimed Rockstar (and publisher <strong>Take-Two</strong>) could get away with launching a base game at <strong>$100</strong> for the first time in history. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-should-cost-70-achieve-maximum-sales-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analysts</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-will-cost-70-wont-get-another-delay-ex-rockstar-animator-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former Rockstar developers</a> believe it will still be priced at <strong>$70</strong>, especially because <strong>a lower price opens up the true goldmine - the online mode - to more players</strong>.</p>



<p>There's still a lot we have to learn about Grand Theft Auto VI, though we do know, based on what a veteran developer has heard and revealed to Wccftech, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-could-evolve-into-an-mmorpg-as-many-of-its-planned-features-belong-to-the-genre-developer-has-heard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the online mode could feel a bit like an MMO</a></strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[God Of War TV Actor’s Response To The Backlash Has Fans Praying For An ‘Ugly Sonic’ Fix]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/god-war-tv-kratos-ryan-hurst-amazon-ugly-sonic-2000674861</link>
            <guid>1449988</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon revealed a first look at its <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-the-god-of-war-show-oh-no-oh-noooo-2000674450"><em>God of War</em> TV show</a> on Friday and it went terribly. People rushed to gawk at the live-action adaptation’s set image <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-amazon-show-cast-kratos-atreus-mimir-actor-2000666932">featuring Ryan Hurst as Kratos and child actor Callum Vinson</a> as a very young Atreus. The internet immediately spit out its Kombucha juice in collective confusion and bemusement. Hurst has now responded to the backlash on Instagram with a cryptic message that has some fans praying for an “ugly Sonic” turnaround.</p>

 <p>“Don’t believe everything you see on the internet, kids,” the <i>Sons of Anarchy</i> actor wrote on his Instagram stories <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWarRagnarok/comments/1rgzptt/this_was_posted_on_ryan_hursts_kratos_instagram/">over the weekend</a>. Fans were confused given that the image everyone was reacting to was an official marketing beat from Amazon to promote the upcoming series and not, like, a weird leak from the set or AI deepfake. But some fans are hoping that the image was just terribly assembled and touched up with AI effects and so the <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-amazon-live-action-image-online-reactions-kratos-atreus-2000674479">Spirit Halloween-looking result</a> isn’t actually representative of the real end product.</p>   <p>Look, out of context TV and movie promotional photos often look like crap. Remember everyone freaking out about Superman lacing his shoes while aliens shot purple lasers in the background in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2024/06/29/new-superman-set-photos-generate-strong-fan-reactions/">first photo</a> for James Gunn’s reboot? First looks like these also give studios a chance to adapt costumes and makeup in light of fan reactions. Maybe this was just an elaborate trial balloon to figure out the final design?</p> <p>That’s basically what some <em>God of War</em> fans are hoping for as they stick Amazon’s Kratos in the same bucket as “ugly Sonic.” People reacted so poorly to the initial trailer for CGI Sonic in the live-action movies that the filmmakers ended up going back and spending a bunch of money and time fixing every frame of his face. That’s one possible outcome here, though it’s still unclear what deeper truth Hurst is referring to. Is the image above failing to correctly capture how Kratos actually looks in the new TV series, or is he suggesting the show has already changed things up since back when this was taken?</p> <p>I can’t wait to see how this all pans out.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Resident Evil Requiem is likely now the biggest Resident Evil game in the franchise's history, sporting a concurrent player count on Steam high enough to rival even multiplayer games.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, single-player Resident Evil Requiem has an all-time concurrent peak of 344,214 players on Steam alone, over double that of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>, and three times that of predecessor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2-remake">Resident Evil 2 Remake</a>, on the other hand, has a Steam peak of 74,227 players, Resident Evil 3 a peak of 60,293, and Resident Evil 7, 20,449.</p>
<p>That 344,214 player peak is also bigger than the all-time Steam concurrent records of multiplayer games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> (316,750), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> (313,593), and Monster Hunter: World (334,684).</p>
<p>Of course, concurrent peaks do not reflect players jumping into the action on other platforms – or even via other PC stores like Epic Games Store – so cannot be taken in isolation, but it's typically a good indication of popularity. It also shows that Capcom has sold at least 344,214 copies in Requiem's debut weekend.</p><p>As spoilers popped all over the Internet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-issues-resident-evil-requiem-plea-as-leaks-become-a-flood">prompting Capcom to acknowledge the situation</a> ahead of the final weekend before the game's launch, Resident Evil 2 director Hideki Kamiya had some choice words for the leakers, suggesting "they are cursed to never play the game again."</p>
<p>"Is Requiem uneven? Absolutely. Does it eventually, slightly, run out of steam? I think that's a fair criticism, too. But carried away on a wave of increasing nostalgia, I didn't especially care," Matt wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-review">5/5 Eurogamer Resident Evil Requiem review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-feb-2026-outbound-demo-firewatch-cozy-2000674849</link>
            <guid>1449955</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There’s a game I love called </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-long-dark-is-boring-and-thats-why-its-great-1775860048"><i><span>The Long Dark</span></i></a><span>. It’s a relentless survival sim that pits you against the elements out in the wilderness. You can starve, freeze to death, or get mauled by a pack of wild wolves. It has this oppressive, foreboding vibe to it that few games can match. <em>Outbound</em> is kind of the cozy sim version of that.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I played the Steam Next Fest demo for </span><i><span>Outbound</span></i><span>, a campervan driving survival game from developers Square Glade Games, and it feels like someone ran </span><i><span>The Long Dark</span></i><span> through a Pixar filter. These two games share so much in common: light crafting elements, a need to scavenge to fill your stomach, an intentionally light focus on your sense of direction, and that lonely feeling of living within a world that other people have left behind.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000674851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674851"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674851">Square Glade Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>And yet, </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>is also kind of the very antithesis of </span><i><span>The Long Dark</span></i><span>. You get hungry, sure, but you won’t starve to death: you’ll just pass out. The world is devoid of human interaction, but there’s plenty of cute little animals to make friends with instead (and a co-op mode I, ironically, couldn’t convince a friend to try with me). You can’t even run the animals over with your massive, unwieldy campervan. Trust me, I tried. There’s friction but the world isn’t out to make you fail.</span></p> <p><span>Strangely, that’s what I loved about my three hours with </span><i><span>Outbound</span></i><span>, whose demo is one of the most popular of February’s Steam Next Fest</span><span>. It’s an easy, breezy experience. It’s a survival game about trying your best to live as opposed to one about desperately trying not to die. There’s really no wrong way to play it, either, because the focus is on, if you’ll excuse the pun, simply enjoying the ride. You’re not even really tasked with accomplishing any specific goals. Sometimes you’ll get a prompt telling you there’s a new schematic you can unlock or a location you’ve yet to visit, but there’s always this “only if you want to” mentality to it all. </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>won’t scream at you for playing it the wrong way, because there’s no right way to begin with.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000674853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674853"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674853">Square Glade Games©</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There are plenty of silly systems to interact with, though, if you so choose. You can build a big house, start your own farm, or even amass a friendly army of bunnies by feeding them heaps of berries. All of these mechanics are straightforward to use and, most importantly, extremely forgiving. If all you wanna do is munch on some wild mushrooms and sit by a fire with your dog, </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>doesn’t care, man. Put your hulking brute of a motorhome in park and just watch the sunset go down if you want, dude. No wolves are gonna rip you limb from limb once the moon appears, bro. Just pet the cute bunnies and let the chill, outdoor vibes wash over you.</span></p>

 <p><span>I saw a few reviews poke fun at <i>Outbound</i> for being “cozyslop,” and my heart goes out to those poor souls. Do we always need a deep endgame or a grand cause to work toward? Does there have to be a destination? Because if you go into </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>expecting </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span> meets </span><i><span>Burnout</span></i><span>, you’re gonna come away disappointed (even though that sounds sick). But if you go in expecting </span><i><span>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance </span></i><span>mixed with </span><i><span>Firewatch</span></i><span>, you’ll get what you came for: a relaxing game about doing nothing in particular. I’m already looking forward to cozy-friend-slopmaxxing my </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>playthrough </span><span>when the full release drops sometime before summer 2026.&nbsp;</span></p>

        <ul><li><strong>New Operators</strong><ul><li><strong>Tangtang</strong> (6-star Caster) – Described as a “one-girl team,” Tangtang is specialized in AOE Cryo damage and support. Her Ultimate, DA CHIEF SEES YOU!, introduces a powerful new tactical layer by immobilizing all enemies within its range – including bosses – allowing her squads to create decisive damage windows.</li><li><strong>Rossi</strong> (6-star Guard) – The only operator currently capable of converting Arts Infliction on enemies into Vulnerability (defense break). This specialized mechanic positions her as a vital force multiplier for Physical-focused squads, as she shreds enemy defenses to facilitate massive damage output from the team’s primary carries.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hydro-Industrialization</strong><ul><li><strong>New Tech</strong> – The Hydro Mining Rig allows players to mine Cuprium, a new industrial resource that uses water flow instead of electricity. Unlike existing facilities, Hydro Mining Rigs harness water flow to automate mineral collection, requiring no connection to the power grid.</li><li><strong>New Logistics</strong> – New Conduits for long-distance liquid transport and Water Treatment Units for processing sewage.<br>Forges of the Sky Expansion: Placement limit for Forges of the Sky increased to four units, significantly raising the production ceiling for endgame resources.</li></ul></li><li><strong>World and Story Expansions</strong><ul><li><strong>New Wuling Area</strong> – Qingbo Stockade</li><li><strong>Story</strong> – The Endministrator can investigate the Qingbo Stockade, where tensions with Wuling City are boiling over due to the arrival of Nefarith and Ardashir.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Player Rewards and Progression</strong></p><p>In addition to the launch window offering of 135 free pulls, player rewards will now be supplemented by:</p><ul><li><strong>New Beginner Support</strong> – After reaching specific milestones in Chapter 1, players will receive a new beginner mission reward totalling 10 Chartered Headhunting Permits. Endministrators who have already completed these requirements can claim their rewards directly from the event page upon the update.</li><li><strong>Sign-In Events</strong> – “Gently Flows Qingbo” and “Pearl of the Pack” (7-day logins) for limited-time permits.<br>Battle Pass Update: The Protocol Pass now allows for periodic acquisition of Basic Headhunting Permits.</li><li><strong>Limited-time Activities</strong><ul><li><strong>Exploration Day</strong> – Farming at Originium Science Park.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Survival [513 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a> Training</strong> – Try a different take on combat using only Industrial Explosives!</li></ul></li><li><strong>Systemic Rewards</strong> – AIC Quota acquisition has been expanded, with players now receiving Quotas for obtaining 4, 5, and 6-star operators for the first time. For operators acquired prior to the update, the corresponding Quotas will be distributed via in-game mail.</li><li><strong>Advanced Gear Optimization</strong> – The introduction of the Valley Multi-Line Engraving Kit – available through the Stock Redistribution system—allows players to create Essences with three customized stats. This provides a high-level path for Endministrators to optimize endgame weapon builds and reduce RNG friction.</li></ul><p><strong>Community-Driven Optimizations</strong></p><p>Following launch feedback, Version 1.1 introduces sweeping improvements to the user experience, particularly for controller players.</p><ul><li><strong>Construction Precision</strong> – The buffer range for power lines has been extended to 20m (100m total), and connection will no longer snap during dialogue or combat triggers. Controller users can also now move facilities by long-pressing a dedicated button.</li><li><strong>Exploration HUD</strong> – A new feature allows the minimap and game map to be accessed while using ziplines, improving navigation across the vertical terrain of Qingbo Stockade.</li><li><strong>Combat Ready</strong> – Operators now enter Protocol Spaces with maximum HP and Ultimate Energy. Additionally, the Red Flash enemy attack telegraphs have been re-tuned for better visibility during chaotic encounters.</li></ul><p>The expansion of Talos-II will continue at an even larger scale in Version 1.2. The upcoming narrative arc will see the Endministrator join forces with Tianshi Zhuang to defend the Xiranite Dam against a sudden siege by Ardashir. This future update will introduce two new maps, an outpost, and a new fluid-based production system for the AIC Factory.</p></blockquote><p><em>Arknights: Endfield</em> is available now for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10009205" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [25,613 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via the official launcher and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/arknightsendfield-f0f167" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arknights-endfield/id6752642477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gryphline.endfield.gp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of videos below.</p><h2><span>Version 1.1 “Old Deep Water Dies, by Rising Tide It is Denied” Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Arknights: Endfield - Version 1.1 &quot;Old Deep Water Dies, by Rising Tide It is Denied&quot; Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IFplOgyiiiM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="『アークナイツ：エンドフィールド』バージョン「潮起ち、故淵離る」PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r_EalJhJ1dA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Korean</strong></p><p><iframe title="「명일방주: 엔드필드」 「몰아치는 새로운 물결, 과거와의 작별」 버전 PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wtqo4BU8KU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Traditional Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="《明日方舟：終末地》「新潮起，故淵離」版本PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y7hG998Tu84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Dev Log: Optimization Progress and Version Preview</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Arknights: Endfield Dev Log | Optimization Progress &amp; Version Preview now live." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eKTskrTBZxU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="『アークナイツ：エンドフィールド』開発者日誌" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KrSybpY58mk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Korean</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="「명일방주: 엔드필드」 개발자 일지 | 최적화 진행 상황 및 버전 미리보기가 공개되었습니다." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x_9zCZ6n2eo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Traditional Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="《明日方舟：終末地》開發者日誌 | 優化進展與版本前瞻 現已公開。" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JQhpNba8dlQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/03/arknights-endfield-version-1-1-update-old-deep-water-dies-by-rising-tide-it-is-denied-launches-march-12]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bungie is continuing to respond to your feedback during Marathon's Server Slam event, paying particular attention to your thoughts on the UI, PC performance, and those pesky weasel error codes.</p>
<p>The Server Slam – scheduled to close tomorrow, Monday 2nd March, 6pm UK time – is not only giving players the chance to try before they buy, but it's also helping Bungie stamp out bugs and server issues ahead of its full launch next week on 5th March.</p>
<p>"As we continue through your third full day on Tau Ceti, we wanted to once again share some of the primary discussion topics we've seen pop up - and, share some ways you can provide us intel if you haven't had a chance to just yet," the team explained, before thanking players "for taking the time" to share their feedback and "ensure that the launch goes as smoothly as possible".</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Here's the full update:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UI feedback:</strong> We are continuing to gather your posts and will keep iterating post‑launch (which, we’ll keep you posted on with regard to any future timelines once they’re available). Add your thoughts in the UI thread on our Discord so we can track them all in one place: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1303855380845301861/1476673733358915778">https://discord.com/channels/1303855380845301861/1476673733358915778</a></li>
<li><strong>PC performance:</strong> We are reviewing reports of high CPU use, low GPU utilisation, FPS ceilings ~80–100, and some stuttering. If you’re running into any of these issues (or another one we didn’t mention), please feel free to mosey on over to our Help Forum and let us know! Details on your system specs or links to short video clips are super helpful:<a href="http://bung.ie/marathonsupport"> http://bung.ie/marathonsupport</a></li>
<li><strong>PvP frequency:</strong> As we continue to keep an ear to the ground on this one, we’re further investigating total player density on non-beginner maps to cover all of our bases. If you've got any feedback - be it on Perimeter (Beginner), Perimeter, or Dire Marsh - we want to hear it!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Movement and heat generation:</strong> As the test continues on, we’ve seen continued discussions about heat generation, momentum, and overall movement feedback. Make sure to take a chance and let us know your thoughts!</li>
<li><strong>Med and ammo economy: </strong>These two items have been a regular feedback item, and we’re thankful to see your reports. Discussions about stack sizes, the efficacy of green-tier med items, and more opportunities for ammo to drop have been primary topics – but, our ears remain open. Keep sharing your experiences and please let us know what you brought into any runs where you feel like you’re running dry.</li>
<li><strong>Weasel error codes:</strong> Over the last day we’ve seen a number of Weasel error codes, which are caused by a disruption of your network connection to Marathon servers. We have several investigations under way and will report back with updates. In some cases, this may be caused by issues with your home Internet connection, or with your Internet provider. If you have made changes that have resolved this issue for you, please let us know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Marathon's Server Slam kicked off just before the weekend, and attracted a healthy number of players on Steam. The game <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4254230/charts/">brought in a peak of 143,621 concurrent players, solely on the PC platform</a>, with a Steam peak of around 76K players on Saturday (28th February).</p>

<figure data-uuid="651d040c05574"><a title="30 Pokémon You Probably Forgot That Deserve A Second Chance" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/651d040c05574/30-pokemon-you-probably-forgot-that-deserve-a-second-chance.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Given Pokémon’s roaring popularity for three decades straight, it’s a sheer numbers game to figure that each of its titular beasts is someone’s favourite. It’s also true that over 1,000 Pokémon can’t all share the limelight, meaning some are bound to fade into obscurity.</p>
<p>While the most popular Pokémon take centre stage for the franchise’s 30th anniversary, I figured space should be made to honour the PokéMisfits that didn’t stand the test of time. These include oddities that only the staunchest Poké Maniacs will recall, others of minor notoriety that deserve more love, and phased-out mascots. While they may be easily written off as sideshows, these Pokémon still played roles (in some cases, infamously) in keeping the franchise on top for all these years.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fjtnksl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<p>Before jumping in, a quick note: I left out Gen 9 'newcomers' as their legacies are still being written. I also had regional variants, mega evolutions, and their ilk take a seat to keep the proceedings simpler.</p>
<h2>30 PokéMisfits That Deserve More Love</h2>
<p>First up, <strong><u>PokéWho?</u></strong></p>
<p>This category covers Pokémon that many straight-up forgot about. They’re sure to have their fans — that’s true of any Pokémon — but by and large, they never caught on, or only enjoyed fleeting relevancy...</p>
<div><div><h3>Shedinja (#292)</h3>
<figure data-uuid="aa775a7f274ee"><a title="Shedinja #292" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aa775a7f274ee/shedinja-292.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>If there’s one element of the Pokémon fandom that I’ll forever miss, it’s the schoolyard tall tales that kids told each other when we didn’t have easy internet access. By Gen 3, scepticism had set in, making me disbelieve Shedinja’s existence.</p>
<p>I have to keep a spot in my party empty and have a spare Poké Ball to obtain it? Sounded about as likely as finding Mew under a truck!</p>
<p>Of course, it does work… and that’s about the most I can say. Schoolyard chatter quickly moved on to new leaks and lies. Shedinja’s allure became its undoing as myths were far more compelling than truths. It’s now notable as a historical footnote and its unique Bug/Ghost dual-typing. That’s more than can be said for a lot of the entries in this category, but nonetheless disappointing for such a conceptually cool Pokémon.</p>
</div><div><h3>Klinklang #601</h3>
<figure data-uuid="7e781a410d085"><a title="Klinklang #601" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e781a410d085/klinklang-601.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>There’s not a lot working in Klinklang’s favour. Its design is simultaneously basic, even among Gen 5’s wave of inanimate object Pokémon, and also derivative of Magneton. It’s therefore not too surprising that this gearhead wouldn’t leave much of an impact.</p>
<p>However, I do believe it has the potential to earn a renewed residency in the minds of fans by having it utilise its utilitarian design to help keep the Pokémon world running. For example, imagine a city running on Klinglang-powered machinery, or gadgets that could be brought alive by a Klinglang in your party.</p>
<p>That sort of worldbuilding is what Klinglang is destined for.</p>
</div><div><h3>Zarude #893</h3>
<figure data-uuid="7c7b46306725f"><a title="Zarude #893" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7c7b46306725f/zarude-893.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>This mythical primate was never made available beyond a few online distribution events that occurred a year or more after the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Sword and Shield</a> (let alone after both its expansion packs were available). It’s highly possible that most Sword and Shield players never even learned of Zarude’s existence because of its late addition. Many who did still had a hard time finding love in their heart for this monkey due to a lack of an in-game event to give it the context it desperately needed.</p>
<p>Zarude could see a renaissance if The Pokémon Company decides to reintroduce it with expanded prominence, but for now, it’s a bit of a non-entity.</p>
</div><div><h3>Dhelmise #781</h3>
<figure data-uuid="d90bb525b981a"><a title="Dhelmise #781" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d90bb525b981a/dhelmise-781.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>The concept behind Dhelmise is cool enough: a rusty, seaweed-strapped anchor that can supposedly knock out Wailord in one attack (Pokémon battles don’t back up this claim). The reality is that it’s ultimately just a possessed anchor, something that wasn’t particularly novel by the time of its Gen 7 introduction.</p>
<p>It’s well themed for the tropical Alolan archipelago, but then again, so are many of that region’s newcomers. Still, I give props to Game Freak for giving wacky ideas like this a shot, even if they don’t always catch on. For better or worse, they can’t all be Garbodor.</p>
</div><div><h3>Maractus #556</h3>
<figure data-uuid="f14d447f69b5b"><a title="Maractus #556" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f14d447f69b5b/maractus-556.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>As the second Cactus Pokémon to lay its roots in the franchise, Maractus needed a bit more going for it to stand out. Namely, it’s a type of single-evolution Pokémon that feels like it shouldn’t be standalone. The design concept of maracas growing out of its head is the perfect setup for an evolution to run with.</p>
<p>Without one, it felt like borderline Gen. 5 filler added so that generation wouldn't include any old monsters until its post-game. I hoped that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Legends Z-A</a> might’ve given it a plus-up in the form of a mega evolution, but with that opportunity gone, who knows if Maractus will ever get the treatment it deserves.</p>
</div><div><h3>Huntail #367 and Gorebyss #368</h3>
<figure data-uuid="50e749ef52d2c"><a title="Huntail #367 and Gorebyss #368" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/50e749ef52d2c/huntail-367-and-gorebyss-368.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>These two share an evolutionary base Pokémon in the adorable Clamperl, yet neither share in its fandom. In fact, it wasn’t until researching for this article that I remembered Clamperl even had evolutions at all!</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s because both require trading, which has always been a somewhat frustrating (even if understandably flavourful) barrier to using certain Pokémon, especially if you’re a solo player like me. I have to imagine that’s also true for many others whose only encounters with Huntail and Gorebyss came through trainer battles or rare in-the-wild scenarios.</p>
<p>It’s a shame because these groovy, psychedelic eels have been waiting over two decades for their moment in the sun. Or perhaps they just prefer the deep ocean, in which case, live your best lives, sea misfits.</p>
</div><div><h3>Stakataka #805</h3>
<figure data-uuid="c328a1aae3281"><a title="Stakataka #805" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c328a1aae3281/stakataka-805.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>The alien nature of Ultra Beasts makes them all inherent misfits of the Pokémon universe, but that’s also why some have been fondly remembered. Stakataka isn’t usually part of those conversations, though. Its stone colossus design isn’t particularly original or memorable, especially when you consider that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> introduced the strikingly similar Guardians months prior.</p>
<p>Plus, appearing exclusively in 3DS games that launched after the Switch rocked the world was a surefire way to not rock the world. Still, if Ultra Beasts ever come back, Stakataka might find its footing.</p>
</div><div><h3>The Gen. 8 Fossil Quartet (Dracozolt #880, Arctozolt #881, Dracovish #882, and Arctovish #883)</h3>
<figure data-uuid="0c4381891ac92"><a title="Dracozolt #880, Arctozolt #881, Dracovish #882, and Arctovish #883" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0c4381891ac92/dracozolt-880-arctozolt-881-dracovish-882-and-arctovish-883.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Uhhhhhhh, so yeah.</p>
<p>First, for those keeping count at home, this is one of two scenarios where I’m lumping all four of these… Pokémon?... into one listing since they’re all cut from the same cloth of combining two fossils to create genetic monstrosities.</p>
<p>The Frankenstein creations that this resulted in might be more believable as something found in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/silent_hill_shattered_memories">Silent Hill</a>. In fact, their mere existence is that level of unsettling, which I suppose will be the feature for many players. For others, we’d rather forget.</p>
<p>That said, I’m open-minded. Game Freak, game on. The ball’s in your court to make me love these patchwork Pokémon.</p>

<p>Next up, <strong><u>The Under-Appreciated Misfits.</u></strong></p>
<p>The Pokémon in this category have a steady presence in the franchise but don’t get the love they deserve. Whether they live in infamy or are overshadowed by their immediate peers, let’s give these beasties a second look on the second page...</p>
