            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ananta-project-mugen-gameplay-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Naked Rain and publisher NetEase have revealed a brand new gameplay trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ananta</em>, the open-world anime action RPG formerly known as&nbsp;<em>Project Mugen</em>.</p>

<p>The name change was <a href="https://x.com/Ananta_EN/status/1862316133988409359" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">put into effect in late November</a>, and at that point, NetEase and Naked Rain teased a new gameplay trailer for the game, which has now arrived. It looks exactly as you'd expect; essentially like a cross between the likes of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>and a strange anime-inflected&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto</em>.</p>

<p>The trailer shows off&nbsp;<em>Ananta</em>'s central hub of Nova City, which is where you'll be spending most of your time, whether you're taking on one of the game's missions or engaging in its many minigames and distractions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ananta-project-mugen-gameplay-trailer-beach.jpg?itok=USXTSxJh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ananta-project-mugen-gameplay-trailer-beach.jpg?itok=zznkKgiB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ananta</em>, formerly known as&nbsp;<em>Project Mugen</em>, has a brand new gameplay trailer for you to check out.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer is positioning&nbsp;<em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>as a sort of everything-RPG; not only can you take on exciting, high-octane combat missions in the game, but you can also kick back and relax by driving through the city, playing volleyball, or just grabbing a bite to eat.</p>

<p>In a press release, NetEase and Naked Rain describe <i>Ananta</i>'s world as a place "where the unexpected is the norm and having fun is the ultimate goal".</p>

<p>While you'll be spending most of your time in Nova City, the two studios say you'll also be able to visit other "interconnected cities" to take on challenges, and they're also promising "kung fu movie"-style combat in which you can utilize your surroundings to defeat your enemies.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p><em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>will be a free-to-play RPG, but NetEase and Naked Rain haven't revealed what kind of monetization the game will employ. It does rather resemble a HoYoverse-style gacha game, but we'll likely learn whether that's the case in the coming months.</p>

<p>We still don't know when&nbsp;<em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>will be released, but when it is, it'll land on PC, PS5, and mobile devices. You can check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/project-mugen-interview" rel="nofollow">interview with the game's producer here</a>.</p>

            <p>Developed by Mistwalker, a studio founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-game">Final Fantasy</a> dad Hironobu Sakaguchi, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasian">Fantasian</a> was originally released on Apple Arcade in 2021 and locked within the big fruit's exclusivity cage. Now, though, Mistwalker and Square Enix have come together to re-release the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> for us PC heads, calling it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasian-neo-dimension">Fantasian Neo Dimension</a>. It's actually out today, too, if you're interested in an interdimensional journey to reclaim some lost memories.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Fantasian Neo Dimension has you play as Leo, who awakens in a strange land filled with machines and zero recollection of how and why and who. Soon he discovers that the machines are suffering from a virus called "Mechteria" that's really not a good thing for humans or robots alike. And so, it's up to you and your pals to engage in turn-based fights and free the world from the virus.</p>

<p>Fantasian's neat spin on turn-based battling lies in how you're able to target multiple enemies, whether that's in a straight line, or in an arc, or in large AoE blasts. You're also able to 'collect' random encounters as you're exploring out in the world, so you can fight them all at once for a large cash-in when it suits you - an excellent time-saver.</p>
<p>And on the world front, it's rather nice eh? It blends handmade dioramas with CG, which gives exploration quite the striking aesthetic.</p>
<p>If you're a longtime fan who knows all this stuff and wants the lowdown on the new features, I've got you. There's new Japanese and English voice overs, new difficulty options, 4K resolution, and the option to switch the battle music from the original soundtrack to songs from across the Final Fantasy series.</p>
<p>You can find the game over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2844850/FANTASIAN_Neo_Dimension/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unfortunately, the game doesn’t outwardly tell you how to unlock more icons. The existence of a few is mentioned deep within some menus, and a few more are secrets that require some real dedication to score. </p><h2 id="h184"><a id=""></a>How To New Unlock Profile Icons</h2><figure id="" data-id="fb1358c0ee79498608e8f2493494517e" data-recommend-id="image://fb1358c0ee79498608e8f2493494517e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Themed Collection Missions screen shows a quest to Collect 3 Electrode Cards mission highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Themed Collection Missions screen shows a quest to Collect 3 Electrode Cards mission highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb1358c0ee79498608e8f2493494517e" data-recommend-id="image://fb1358c0ee79498608e8f2493494517e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Themed Collection Missions screen shows a quest to Collect 3 Electrode Cards mission highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>We’ve identified two ways to unlock more <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> icons: completing Dex missions or purchasing them from the shop.</strong> Both of these methods come with some caveats, which we’ll detail below.</p><p>Let’s start with the Dex missions. You can find these by tapping on the Missions button on the bottom right of the Home or Battle screens. You’ll be sent to the Genetic Apex Dex Missions screen, but you want to look toward the bottom right again and tap on the Themed Collections button. At the bottom of this list will be a handful of missions that award you with an icon. These are the icons and associated missions for the Genetic Apex Expansion:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Electrode Icon: Collect 3 Electrode cards</li><li>Gardevoir Icon: Collect 5 Gardevoir cards</li><li>Charizard Icon: Collect 5 Charizard cards</li><li>Mewtwo Icon: Collect 5 Mewtwo cards</li></ul><p>In addition to those above, a set of icons is exclusive to a secret mission. <strong>Registering 226 cards in the Dex will cause a new mission to appear. Completing it will unlock icons for Mewtwo, Pikachu, and Charizard.</strong> Although that is a lot of cards to register, it only counts those with Diamond rarities. You won’t need to collect the rarer Star or Crown cards with full art illustrations. The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/get-the-pokemon-tcg-pocket-card-you-want-with-the-pack-1851702255&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/get-the-pokemon-tcg-pocket-card-you-want-with-the-pack-1851702255">Pack Point Exchange System</a></span> can cut down time for any of these missions, although using it to complete the Dex will be especially useful.</p><p>The second method is to buy icons from the shop. So far, these seem to be limited to events and can be missed. A Meowth Icon was available during the second part of a Wonder Pick Event that ran during the first half of November. It was also exchangeable only with exclusive Event Shop Tickets that naturally expired. Outside of promo pack cards, being tied to the most FOMO-inducing of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684">the game’s currencies</a></span> makes these icons particularly rare, so keep an eye out for them when they appear on the shop.</p><h2 id="h185"><a id="change"></a>How To Change Your Profile Icon</h2><figure id="" data-id="0fceccffed0b2f7cfa88bd4321e0d6e6" data-recommend-id="image://0fceccffed0b2f7cfa88bd4321e0d6e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Select Icon screen shows seven different icons and highlights one of Electrode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Select Icon screen shows seven different icons and highlights one of Electrode." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0fceccffed0b2f7cfa88bd4321e0d6e6" data-recommend-id="image://0fceccffed0b2f7cfa88bd4321e0d6e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Select Icon screen shows seven different icons and highlights one of Electrode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Changing your profile icon is an easy thing to do, thankfully. From the home screen, tap on the small round image of your current icon at the top. This will take you to what is essentially your profile page, where you can adjust options such as your Player Name or what your featured cards are. Tap the larger-sized picture at the top and you’ll bring up the Select Icon menu. You can now switch between any of the initial six profile icons or those you’ve obtained.</p><p>I do want to highlight that this menu only displays what has been unlocked so far. There aren’t any handy greyed-out icons or anything to signify that you might have more to unlock. Be sure to keep up with the events and open boosters whenever possible to add more icons to your selection.</p><hr><p>We can assume that unlocking <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> icons in the future will function similarly to how they do now. Fingers crossed that they add some permanently to the shop, or maybe mix it up with different types of missions.

<p>Square Enix is pulling the plug on future Foamstars season updates, less than a year after the game’s release.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/documents/notice-regarding-foamstars-season-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a>, the studio said that season updates for the game will end on January 17 at the conclusion of the “Party Goes On!” season of the game. With this final season update, the studio is introducing features to “enhance gameplay”.</p>



<p>Those include the ability to customize shots for each character as well as new various enhancement elements.</p>



<p>“All online services will remain available after the “Party Goes One!” season ends,” Square Enix said. “In addition, we plan to hold the Foamstars Cup, a series of in-game events named after each character.</p>



<p>“Furthermore, to ensure that new players can fully enjoy Foamstars, previous Season Passes will be made available again. Players can switch between Season Passes at any time to proceed along the Season Pass track of your choice and obtain items from past seasons. This will make it possible for players to obtain all the items from each season.”</p>



<p>First launched in February 2024 exclusively for PlayStation, Foamstars released to little fanfare. Ultimately, the game went <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/foamstars-free-to-play-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free-to-play in October</a> in order to build its player base.</p>



<p>What do you think of season updates ending for Foamstars? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>It’s not every day that gaming actively prevents someone from succumbing to a catastrophic accident, but here we are. On social media, one user recently told the tale of how an Xbox Series S console <strong>may </strong>have saved his life when he was hit by a truck and sent sprawling from his bicycle.</p>



<p>Per the post, the Xbox Series S in his backpack prevented him from striking his head against the curb, and while he didn’t escape unscathed, he believes that if he wasn’t carrying the Series S, <strong>he could have died</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-divine-intervention">Divine Intervention</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Jonzey8828/status/1864267929463988625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Twitter</a>, ‘Brandon J’ explained his story in full:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was on my way home from my local GameStop with the Xbox in my backpack when I was struck by a truck while riding my bicycle. I managed to keep above the trucks steel bumper at first but I eventually was dragged under. I was slammed to the ground and still he kept going so I assumed he didn’t see me. The Xbox in my backpack prevented me from hitting my head or worse, even dying. </p>



<p>I wasn’t gonna get shredded beneath the truck so I used my left leg to attempt to slow the truck. At this point my bike wedged my right leg so I couldn’t move it anywhere. Next thing I know my backpack was only hanging on by my left shoulder and was slammed into the curb along with me afterwards. I look to my left and I feel the full weight of the front end of this truck roll up on my ribs and roll back off. </p>



<p>The truck hit and dragged me 12 feet and soon I was rushed to the hospital with only a single broken bone in my left foot and a few road rashes. I thought the Xbox was a goner but It started up with no hesitation at all and runs games surprisingly well considering what it went through. </p>



<p>If the Xbox wasn’t in my bag at the time a lot more could have happened…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By way of a response, Xbox offered to send Brandon a new Xbox console. The images shown by Brandon reveal a bashed, beaten, and bruised console that amazingly still works just fine. They were uploaded alongside shots of a hoodie bearing signs of some serious road rash.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image Credit: Jonzey8828 on Twitter </figcaption></figure>



<p>In the comments under the post on social media, some users started joking that PlayStation could never, and others recommended that GameStop should start listing consoles for sale with crash test ratings. </p>



<p>Many jokes are made about the Xbox Series S, especially those focused on the console’s performance, but at least we can say it’s at least structurally sound.</p>

            <p>
Epic Games has detailed a few more details on its much-anticipated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> OG mode, which brings back the game's beloved original battle royale Island as a newly-permanent addition. 
</p>
<p>
As previously suspected, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">Fortnite OG will rotate through the game's original Chapter 1 seasons</a>. Today, we learned that these will begin with a season lasting until 31st January - so roughly two months. 
</p>
<p>
This means, of course, shorter seasons than the original Fortnite Chapter 1 featured - and shorter than the game's main Chapter 6 version. But we're all waiting for the meteor impact and the volcano anyway, right? So this is good news.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite OG will feature solos and squads modes at launch, with both classic building enabled and Zero Build options. 
</p>
<p>
Other improvements from the original Chapter 1 will include modern building mechanics and traversal options to sprint, slide, mantle, door bash and move while healing. Epic Games does not make mention of the very latest mechanics added in Chapter 6, such as wall jumping.
</p><p>
As previously announced, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-permanent-og-mode-will-have-its-own-battle-pass">Fortnite OG will also feature its own distinct battle pass</a>, which will feature 45 tiers of rewards. This is one of the four in-game passes now included in the £10 a month Fortnite Crew subscription, and offers three skins plus other bits and pieces. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games previously revealed brought back its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">hugely-popular original Fortnite map 12 months ago</a> for a limited time, the launch of which saw the game hit 44.7 million players in 24 hours. Last weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-remix-finale-event-smashes-14m-all-time-player-record">Fortnite broke its own player record for a live concert event</a>, with 14 million concurrent players tuning in to watch Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Ice Spice and Juice WRLD.

			<p>Following the Black Friday GeForce NOW promotion that <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-black-friday-deal-halves-price-of-3-month-premium-memberships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discounted</a> premium tiers (Performance and Ultimate) by 50% for three-month subscriptions, NVIDIA has announced another promotion that will run through December 50. The discount is the same (50%), but it will now be applied to new monthly subscriptions.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle by MachineGames will be supported by GeForce NOW on day one. Owners of the Ultimate tier will be able to activate all the technical bells and whistles, such as NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. By the way, the game's official requirements have just been <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-the-first-game-to-require-hardware-ray-tracing-support-full-specs-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>.</p>
<p>The other big weekly addition to GFN is Path of Exile 2, which debuts tomorrow on early access. Our Francesco De Meo had this to say about the action RPG following a recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-off preview</a>:</p>
<p><em>From what I have experienced and what the developers Grinding Gear Games have shown so far, Path of Exile 2 has the chance of becoming one of the best action RPGs ever released, if not the very best, taking everything that made the original great and competently modernizing it while expanding the experience in so many ways that it wouldn't be surprising to see players spend hundreds of hours in the game and still not having seen the full potential of the systems and mechanics powering the game. As such, I really cannot wait for the Early Access version to release and be able to spend more time with a game that I feel I will be playing for a very, very long time</em>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GFN_Thursday-Holiday_Sale.png"></a></figure>

<p>The remaining weekly additions for GeForce NOW users are JR EAST Train Simulator and its demo (both on Steam). NVIDIA also shared the full lineup for the remainder of December.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-battle-pass-mechanic-change-monetisation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Marvel Rivals is out <strong>tomorrow</strong>, and it’s set to introduce a cultural shift in the hero shooter space, challenging the dominant position held by Overwatch 2 and snatching the attention away from Deadlock. Recently, the team at NetEase have been discussing how the game will work, revealing more characters and mechanics, further stoking the hype train.</p>



<p>One tidbit of information about how the game’s battle pass is going to work turned heads more than anything else, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-more-fomo">No More FOMO</h2>



<p>Typically, live-service games have seasonal battle passes that expire at the end of a given window, and thereafter, you’re prevented from unlocking any content you’ve missed and you’ll need to move on to the next season.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals is <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20241205/40954_1198123.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">going to challenge that</a> typical behaviour with a new mechanic: timeless battle passes.</p>



<p>When you purchase the ‘Luxury Battle Pass’, which is the paid version of the free battle pass, you’ll unlock the ability to redeem awards in said pass event after the season has ended. If you don’t dedicate enough time to the game to unlock the rewards in one season, they’ll roll over into the next, but you’ll be free to <strong>also </strong>move on to the next season if you desire.</p>



<p>That means that you won’t miss out on unlocking something <strong>far </strong>into the Luxury Battle Pass in Marvel Rivals just because you might not have the time to grind for it.</p>



<p>Not only that, but NetEase has recognised that the first season (or pre-season) of Marvel Rivals is going to be a shorter one, so they’ve reduced the price of the Luxury Battle Pass by 50% at launch.</p>



<p>Other developers have had their ways of addressing this ‘missing out’ issue. For instance, Bethesda Game Studios often offers ‘catch-up’ bundles in the Fallout 76 store, giving users the ability to catch up on missed rewards, but that comes with a hefty cost.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a good tactic that other developers should mirror? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Crimsix Has Returned to OpTic After Five Years Away]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/crimsix-optic-return-five-years/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crimsix-has-returned-to-optic-after-five-years-away.1052505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/crimsix-optic-return-five-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter has returned home, gravitating back to OpTic Gaming after a five-year hiatus. His Call of Duty career ended in 2022, and since then, he has become a successful racecar driver and iRacing creator. Following his departure from OpTic Gaming in 2019, Crimsix floated with a couple of organisations in the Call of Duty League but ultimately retired in September 2022.</p>



<p>In a seven-minute video posted on social media, OpTic welcomed back Crimsix, explaining why it’s such a natural decision to make all these years later.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-where-he-belongs">Back Where He Belongs</h2>



<p>Crimsix is part of the Call of Duty ‘dynasty’ represented by Scump, FormaL, Karma, and of course, the man himself. He’s the winningest Call of Duty player in the business, and his profile and abilities helped to spearhead the growth of the COD esports scene.</p>



<p>In 2022, he officially retired from Call of Duty and spun off into something completely different: racecars. Those who know Porter recognise his love for cars, and in the video posted by OpTic, he revealed that most of his income was spent in some way on cars, whether it be buying, maintaining, or upgrading them.</p>



<p>Speaking in <a href="https://x.com/OpTic/status/1864461424904302688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the video uploaded on Twitter</a>, OpTic’s CEO, Hector ‘HECZ’ Rodriguez said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s back to normal. Throughout the years, we’ve always kept in touch, he’s of my favourite players of all time, what he did for OpTic – it put us in a position to win every time.</p>



<p>I’ll always be appreciative of the time he spent here, so it was only right that when the time came for him to come back, after years of butting heads with FormaL, butting heads with Scump… </p>



<p>Bringing him back as we are is inevitable, he’s part of the family and he’ll always be part of the family.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Crimsix has been streaming plenty of Black Ops 6 during his downtime, and many have stressed that the former pro player still has the thumbs needed to win big, prompting plenty of long-time fans to demand his return to Call of Duty esports.</p>



<p>That’s not going to happen, though – but he does have a place back under the OpTic umbrella, and that’s worth celebrating.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see Crimsix back in OpTic? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Players will soon be able to have Agent 47 take a few pot shots (other methods are available) at none other than Jean-Claude Van Damme, with the actor lending his likeness to Hitman's next Elusive Target: Max Valliant aka The Splitter.</p>
<p>Max Valliant is described as one of the ICA's "most formidable operatives", and one whom everyone assumed to be dead and gone. But, of course, that isn't actually the case, and now he is back and causing trouble. Agent 47 needs to put a stop to that, and will head to Chongqing for the occasion.</p>
<p>The Splitter will both be available as part of the Free Starter Pack for new players (although, not on Switch) and as a regular Elusive Target for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman World of Assassination</a> players. Interested in giving it a shot? Well, you will be able to take down Valliant from 12th December, until 12th January. Here's a trailer:</p>

<p>"Max Valliant is quite the entertaining character, bringing a lot of action movie villain energy, he is ruthless, and of course, he can do the split!" shared Jean-Claude Van Damme. "The Splitter is a thrilling mission and like in any good action flick, Hitman players will have a few surprises, but I'll let them find out by themselves."</p><p>Van Damme is known for his love of doing the splits, as you can see in the header image above. In fact, when developer IOI first teased The Splitter, <a href="https://www.hitmanforum.com/t/new-elusive-target-the-splitter-winter-2024/22258/20">many guessed</a> the actor would be one of Agent 47's upcoming targets.</p>

<p>Last but not least, when all of this Jean-Claude Van Damme flavoured goodness goes live on 12th December, Hitman World of Assassination will be patched up to support <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> features. This means assassinating at a locked 60fps, with a resolution of 3840 x 2160.</p>

			<p>The rumored PlayStation 5 handheld will unlikely be able to play PS5 games natively and will probably require dedicated versions of new games.</p>
<p>Commenting on the recent<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-handheld-in-the-works-to-rival-nintendo-switch/">&nbsp;rumors</a> regarding Sony's return to the handheld market following the PS Vita, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> made some interesting observations on what the systems could actually be, highlighting how it will not be able to run PlayStation 5 games natively, as what is currently achieved on a 200 watts system will be impossible to achieve on 20 watts system even in a few years down the road. As such, scaling down games will be required to get games to run on the system, similar to how the Nintendo Switch handles running games in handheld mode. Sony already showed how scaling up is entirely possible with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-ultimate-comparison/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, so scaling down shouldn't be impossible.</p>
<p>The real question is how scaling games down will be handled by this PlayStation 5 handheld. The Microsoft handheld, for example, may be similar to how things are handled for the Steam Deck and similar systems due to the company's approach, letting the user tweak the graphics settings of the PC version of games to get games running decently. In addition, Microsoft could use the Xbox Series S profile available for all their games to get them to run decently on their handheld without leaving the user to configure settings. Sony, on the other hand, doesn't have a lower-end PlayStation 5 model, so the handheld would require dedicated versions of games, while older games would need to be patched in order to run on the system. As such, the PlayStation 5 handheld could be the PS5 lower-end system that Sony currently doesn't have that will offer a slice of what the base model offers in terms of visual fidelity and potentially backward compatibility.</p>

But Will It Really Run PS5 Games?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rh3lAfsKdrw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All the current reports suggest that this PlayStation 5 handheld is still far from release, so it will be a very long time before we can see what it will be capable of and if it will ever be able to put a dent into the Nintendo Switch's popularity, whose concept of home console and handheld all-in-one system will likely only get more popular with the release of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/">yet-to-be-revealed</a> successor.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-q1-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ambitious-action-strategy-game-kingmakers-delayed-to-next-year.1052466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-q1-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Redemption Road and publisher tinyBuild have announced that ambitious upcoming action-strategy sandbox hybrid game&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/4445711438670988556" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a> (which is, rather amusingly, worded as though it were an old-timey town crier decree), the two studios say that&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>will now launch "nay later than the end o' Q1 2025". I suppose the originally-slated release window of 2024 was pretty much unattainable given we're in December now.</p>

<p>The premise of&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>is a pretty novel one; it revolves around players being able to travel back in time with modern weaponry and lay waste to medieval armies in order to change the course of a war and "stave off the apocalypse".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingmakers-delayed-shooting.jpg?itok=zY9dK4Ei 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingmakers-delayed-shooting.jpg?itok=WKlZAUh3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>promises some astoundingly historically inaccurate action-sandbox shenanigans.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not a million miles away from the premise of 2009 FPS&nbsp;<em>Darkest of Days</em>, although&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>isn't an FPS; rather, it's an ambitious and sprawling mixture of action, strategy, city-building, and sandbox gameplay.</p>

<p>You'll engage in battles in which soldiers are "controlled by a next-gen multi-threaded AI" and animated by "a unique procedural animation system". In those battles, you'll use modern weaponry like machine guns, attack helicopters, and air strikes to "wreak absolute havoc on the battlefield".</p>

<p>The game will also feature base-building elements and real-time strategy gameplay; you'll be able to zoom out and issue orders to your soldiers before joining the fray yourself, watching the plan you've built be executed in real time.</p>




<p><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>may not be out yet, but its publisher tinyBuild clearly has faith that it's going to be a smash hit. Back in August, the studio announced that a&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">movie is in production</a> in conjunction with movie studio Story Kitchen.</p>

<p>We still don't have a full release date for&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>yet, but given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tinybuild-financials-2023" rel="nofollow">financial straits tinyBuild appears to be in right now</a>, it likely can't come soon enough. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam right now</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward-one-week.1052463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has moved the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>release date forward a week, and there are new goodies coming for the game this week as well.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1864354217139314820" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media platform X</a>, the studio confirms that the game's new release date is February 4th, which is exactly a week before the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">originally intended launch date of February 11th</a>.</p>

<p>That should come as a pleasant surprise for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>fans, especially since the game's original release date technically constituted a delay. It was originally meant for release sometime in 2024.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-early-henry-horse.jpg?itok=2_uzGPdP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-early-henry-horse.jpg?itok=eC1LdW1B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll now be able to play&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>a whole week early.</figcaption></figure><p>In the release date announcement post, Warhorse also says that more info about&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is on the way this week, with a new story trailer for the game set to debut later today.</p>

<p>Additionally, we'll also be learning the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>PC specs this week, as well as "console specs", which presumably refers to what modes the console versions of the game will offer, as well as whether it'll join the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">list of PS5 Pro-enhanced games</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not across&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's the sequel to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a> 2018 RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, an open-world adventure that emphasizes realistic combat and historical detail.</p>

<p>The second game will once again revolve around protagonist Henry of Skalitz, which also means that like its predecessor, it'll be set in 15th-century medieval Europe.</p>




<p>As well as bringing back many elements from the first game, including multiple approaches to combat and quest completion,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>will also feature ranged weaponry like crossbows, as well as firearms.</p>

<p>Lest you think the introduction of new features will cause Warhorse to scale the story back, however, think again; the studio confirmed back in August that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s script <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">contains over two million words</a>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches on February 4th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9N4W31HSMVVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>The world is changing. Geopolitics are fractious and unnerving, environmental catastrophe seems more likely each day, and rampant digitally-disseminated disinformation further erodes our trust in one another. But I'll let lesser reporters tell you about that stuff. I'm here to report that Capcom have made the big bonk feel good again. They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-youre-not-imagining-monster-hunter-wilds-beta-combat-feeling-off-theres-a-good-reason-for-it">lack of hitstop</a> in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://x.com/Axelayer/status/1853123320079663522">handy breakdown of the issue</a> by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.</p>

<p>"Some of the changes in the hitstop were obviously intentional, and some were not implemented due to the settings of the game," director Yuya Tokuda said at a recent press event, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-hitstop-feels-way-better-in-the-non-beta-build-and-the-games-director-was-happy-to-juice-it-back-up-after-overseas-players-apparently-hated-it-in-world/">via GamesRadar</a>. "When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a> was released, many of the users from overseas commented that the hitstop was way too hard and it made it difficult for them to play. So it's very positive feedback seeing the users who experienced the [Wilds open beta test] this time saying that they missed the hitstop that they were experiencing in past titles."</p><p>"It's a very unique <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> experience being able to experience that hitstop," Tokuda continued. "So it's very positive feedback from my perspective. In the current version that I think you guys had hands-on gameplay with, there was obviously a little bit of adjustment compared to the [open beta]. And for the full product version, there will be adjustments. For example, the finishing moves will have adjustments to hitstop as well."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/were-at-the-next-level-monster-hunter-wilds-creators-on-the-secret-behind-capcoms-new-golden-era/">Very Gary Computing</a> also had a big chat with the Wilds team, in which series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto also mentioned some bugs from the beta they’d since ironed out. "The monsters were moving more often than intended," he said. "It wasn’t actually a design intention to have them be so rapidly moving, it was just that every X amount of seconds they just were moving on, and it wasn’t something we were planning for - the general processing of how monsters decide where to go next and what to do, that’s being refined towards the full game."</p>
<p>The VGC piece is well worth a read, not least for Yuya Tokuda going into detail about the new endgame it sounds they’ve got planned for Wilds:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the unique aspects will be related to the environmental change system that happens in Monster Hunter Wilds. You’ll be doing things like having a synergistic relationship between the monsters that you’re hunting and the environment itself.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you hunt this monster now, that might make something happen like this one becomes easier to hunt later or harder to hunt later. The details are going to be discussed later, but I’m confident that players who love [past games’] end-game cycles will be really pleased with what’s in store.</p></blockquote>
<p>In conclusion: bonk. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Google has developed a new AI tool that can generate a fully playable 3D game world from a single image prompt.</p>
<p>Genie 2, as the tool is known, is described as a "world model". So where Genie 1 generated 2D worlds, this subsequent tool can create 3D worlds in a variety of perspectives and includes the consequences of taking actions like jumping or swimming.</p>
<p>Google stresses the tool can be used for "rapid prototyping" as it "enables artists and designers to prototype quickly, which can bootstrap the creative process for environment design, further accelerating research".</p>

<p>It works using a single image prompt, with Google of course using examples from its own text-to-image AI tool Imagen 3, though real world images can be used too.</p>
<p>From there users can jump in and interact with the world, with the AI overcoming challenges like understanding control inputs and remembering the world it's created as the camera pans elements in and out of view. It then generates new plausible content on the fly for up to a minute of gameplay.</p>
<p>It can further generate NPCs and interactions with them; the physics of water or gravity; lighting models and reflections; and multiple animations.</p>
<p>"While this research is still in its early stage with substantial room for improvement on both agent and environment generation capabilities, we believe Genie 2 is the path to solving a structural problem of training embodied agents safely while achieving the breadth and generality required to progress towards AGI [Artificial General Intelligence]," reads a <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/">blog post on the tool from Google</a>.</p>
<p>So while the tool can be used for prototyping, it's also being used to train further AI models.</p>
<p>Discussing how Google developed the technology responsibly, the blog post reads: "Genie 2 shows the potential of foundational world models for creating diverse 3D environments and accelerating agent research. This research direction is in its early stages and we look forward to continuing to improve Genie's world generation capabilities in terms of generality and consistency.</p><p>"As with SIMA [Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent], our research is building towards more general AI systems and agents that can understand and safely carry out a wide range of tasks in a way that is helpful to people online and in the real world."</p>
<p>As such it's purpose as of yet doesn't seem to be directly in video game development, though the potential is clear.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">AI is changing video game development</a> with its use in multiple areas, from NPCs to scriptwriting and voice acting.</p>
<p>Multiple studios have already stated their interest in AI technology, both for and against it. Most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-says-ai-will-revolutionise-gaming-but-must-be-balanced-with-human-touch">PlayStation co-CEO Hermen Hulst</a> stated AI technology has the capacity to "revolutionise" the games industry, but it won't replace the "human touch".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>If you fancy taking a break from shooting alien scum in the face and would like something more relaxing for quite literally ten minutes then Short Trip may just be the thing for you.</p>
<p>It’s not a game as such and is described as an ‘interactive illustration’ which had been hand drawn of the course of five years. You get to control a cat tram through picturesque mountain villages, keeping to a schedule or going at your own pace. That’s it, a full play through will take less than ten minutes but I think it looks quite sweet.</p>

			<p>A stunning Unreal Engine 5.4 Slavic-inspired Medieval Village tech demo is now available for download, hinting at how <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-fix/">The Witcher 4</a> could look.</p>
<p>The demo, whose regular version can be downloaded <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eSL9vdiQYMJmn0cq5PNjBxBK5hEHXD4r/view">here</a> and the NVIDIA DLSS version <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YxD3QoDPIErPv4WZUcazq2Csd7HmS1Rd/view">here</a>, was developed by Scans Factory and features a variety of atmospheric lighting scenarios that are a great fit for any fantasy setting with a dark-leaning tone like The Witcher series. In case you cannot experience the demo on your system, you can watch it in action in the video below.</p>

<p>In the past few months, Unreal Engine 5.4 has been used to power some impressive tech demos, such as another demo by Scan Factory. This demo features an i<a href="https://wccftech.com/stunning-unreal-engine-5-4-ultra-realistic-rome-8k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mpressive recreation of Rome</a>, which looks downright incredible with its attention to detail and how it manages to capture the spirit of the Eternal City.</p>
<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-5-is-now-available">5.5</a>, which brings some new features that promise to be game-changing, such as MegaLights, which allows developers to add hundreds of dynamic shadow-casting lights to scenes without any constraints. You can check out how some of these features can be used by taking a look at an impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-ocarina-of-time-unreal-engine-5-5-remake-download/">Zelda: Ocarina of Time fan made</a> remake demo powered by the engine.</p>

			<p>Occasionally, you question whether a game is for you. Infinity Nikki, a cosy free-to-play open-world experience about wearing the most beautiful dresses, is on first impressions outside of my realms of expertise. However, whether it’s the stunning visuals, the beautiful and evocative fantasy world, or its joyful sense of fun and playfulness, Infinity Nikki dispenses with your preconceptions in moments.</p>
<p><iframe title="Infinity Nikki: Official Release Trailer - About Wishes" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BUFYjUv72Yk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Yes, Infinity Nikki is a game about dressing up, but it plays a more integral part than you might think. While some are purely visual choices, other dresses provide special abilities, whether helping you to leap further with a double jump, or providing the ability to purify darkness-tainted monsters known as Esselings. Heck, there’s one for grooming animals where you sneak up on them, Assassin’s Creed style, and then lovingly give them a thorough brushing down. You learn everything you need to know about the game in the outrageously cute reactions that each of these animals will respond with, including the sassiest squirrel in the world.</p>


<p>Fundamentally, dresses and their accessories function as your skill tree and you’ll need to craft each element of an outfit to unlock its ability. You do this by collecting the necessary components and acquiring a sketch of said outfit to work from, with each also giving Nikki access to a new look, some of which will automatically appear when performing that action, while others you have to select manually when you’re ready for a spot of animal grooming.</p>


<p>Infinity Nikki immediately beds you into its fantasy world with a hefty dose of storytelling, and your first experience of the game sees you transported from your dusty old attic to the broken and evocative ruins of a long-forgotten realm. Ena the Curator has been imprisoned here for thousands of years, but with Nikki’s arrival, and indeed the arrival of her spectacular dress, fashioned from the Threads of Reunion, she’s set free.</p>
<p>It’s a short-lived escape though, and in her last act she grants you the Heart of Infinity, setting you on a path to save Miraland, while undoing all of the wonderful fashion-based powers you’ve only just discovered. Cue a quest – more accurately a series of quests, tasks and asides – to gain back your powers and refill your wardrobe while you attempt to save the realm.</p>
<p>You’re not alone in your adventure, accompanied by the incredibly cute, and actually amusing Momo. This little guy immediately sold the game to my 8-year-old son, and frankly, to me as well, his antics causing us to actually laugh out loud. Very few games manage that. He’s a helpful chap to have along for the ride too, pointing you towards items of interest, and even letting you take direct control for a spot of platforming.</p>
<p>Dada from the Stylists Guild is also along to help with your journey, and she gives you a Pear-Pal tablet to keep you organised, setting you on course to become a Stylist. From here you can check out your wardrobe, Sketches and quests, as well as take Courses, which are milestones or achievements which in turn unlock further rewards.</p>

<p>Your sense of fashion isn’t all about those special abilities, and sometimes you just have to look your absolute best. Styling Challenges see you face off against other Stylists, battling them for fashion supremacy by choosing the most visually powerful outfit. Each challenge is given a theme such as Sweet, Elegant or Cool, and it’s up to you to pick the right look to win the day. Mixing and matching doesn’t always make you an immediate fasionista, but it remains consistently satisfying to win the day.</p>
<p>What might surprise you the most about Inifinty Nikki, is how much of a fully-fledged RPG it is. I know we’re past the point where mobile and free-to-play titles can match or even better their full-price rivals, but Infinity Nikki manages to reel you in from the very start. There’s a keen sense of style to everything here, from the beautiful vistas to the stunningly detailed clothing, and its open world is simply enjoyable to explore. I haven’t meandered quite so readily since playing Breath of the Wild and, if anything, Infinity Nikki offers you more to do.</p>
<p>Platforming plays a major part in your adventure, and thanks to Nikki’s dress-given abilities, you can climb incredibly high in a short space of time, While you do, you’re looking for Whimstars, essential for making progress, as well as the different crafting materials that abound in the overworld. Alongside that, you come across side quests and minigames, each of which will reward you with experience and money to fund your soon-to-be-problematic shopping sprees.</p>
<p>There’s all the hallmarks of the Gacha genre, of course, and if you’ve played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> or any of its peers you’ll know what to expect. Different rewards for a huge spectrum of achievements will constantly pop, and each section of your Pear Pal will regularly sport a red notification, drawing you in for a little spot of euphoric back-patting.</p>

<p>These are the precursor to the monetisation for Infinity Nikki, where the team at Infold Games will be hoping you need that particularly spectacular skirt so much that you’re willing to put down real money for it, rather than embarking on an entirely free, but incredibly time-consuming grind. You can play quite happily without spending money, and I haven’t felt the need to put anything in thus far, but there’s the clawing idea that I will at some point. The most impressive, or stylistically powerful, additions to Nikki’s wardrobe look so much easier to get with real-world money.</p>
<p>You could argue that that’s only fair for a game that I’ve already plunged several hours into and which is genuinely good, easily eclipsing some of Square Enix’ most recent action-RPGs, but there’s still that feeling that you should be spending your money on something with more substance. I’d forget that for now. Overall, it’s not surprising to see Infinity Nikki take a similar route to MiHoYo’s offerings, but you can decide to ignore it, up to a point, and I genuinely don’t think you’ll regret your time spent here.</p>
<p>There have been a few technical hiccups in the pre-launch build we played, particularly through the tutorials, with occasional messages about an unstable network which we’re hoping will be ironed out at launch. Given the number of people waiting for that launch, you’ve got to hope that Infold Games have got as many servers dialled up as humanly possible. It’s also worth noting that your progress is saved to one specific server, so make sure you select the right one when booting the game, unless you want to start again from the beginning.</p>

			<p>20 years after its original release in Japan, Bandai Namco's Tales of Rebirth is finally getting an English translation patch this month.</p>
<p>As recently revealed by <a href="https://www.lifebottle.org/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Life Bottle Productions</a>, a team of dedicated fans who released last year a full English translation patch for what is, in my opinion, the best entry in the series, Tales of Destiny: Director's Cut, the translation patch for the PlayStation 2 version will be released sometime in December. Yesterday, it was specified on the team's official Discord server that they are aiming to have it out on the game's anniversary on December 16th.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Good morning, Twitter! We've got some big updates today. Our Tales of Rebirth (PS2) translation will be releasing sometime NEXT MONTH! Stay tuned for more info! Also, we made a bluesky for all of you who want to follow us outside of Twitter and Insta <a href="https://t.co/eb61cWLz0o">https://t.co/eb61cWLz0o</a> <a href="https://t.co/djSz9c0RsG">pic.twitter.com/djSz9c0RsG</a></p>
<p>— Life Bottle Productions (@LifeBottleProd) <a href="https://twitter.com/LifeBottleProd/status/1857417668669718704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Besides offering an English translation for Tales of Rebirth, which was never released outside of Japan, the Life Bottle Productions patch will also include some advanced features that will improve the experience, such as battle subs dynamically positioned on screen depending on how many items are obtained at the end of a battle or if the player is cooking, as highlighted by some screenshots by Julian Lightfellow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">More Tales of Rebirth refinement. End of battle subs are now positioned dynamically, depending on how many items you get, or if you're cooking. (And I'm cooking!)</p>
<p>Who's excited!? 😃 <a href="https://t.co/PUwts0OBCc">pic.twitter.com/PUwts0OBCc</a></p>
<p>— Julian Lightfellow (@JLightfellow) <a href="https://twitter.com/JLightfellow/status/1864030187093905498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Tales of Rebirth is among the PlayStation 2 entries in the series that were never released in the West and probably never will, seeing as Bandai Namco seems more interested in bringing more recent entries in the franchise on modern platforms. Next month, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/tales-of/tales-of-graces-f-remastered">Tales of Graces F</a> will make the jump to PC and current generation consoles, complete with a variety of enhancements, such as auto-saving, the ability to turn off enemy encounters, improved visuals, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-path-of-exile-2-be-free-to-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If Path of Exile 2 is free to play, then not only does it follow in the footsteps of the original ARPG, but it also shows the community’s willingness and trust in supporting the eagerly awaited follow-up. Making PoE 2 free would be a huge decision, so let’s dissect Grinding Gear Games’ strategy.</p>



<p>Free to play has become the norm over the last decade. I remember PS4’s Warframe being free to play, and I couldn’t wrap my head around the decision to make a AAA title free. Now, everyone’s doing it, and it’s because the business model is highly sustainable—<em>sometimes</em>. </p>



<p>Path of Exile 1 was released in 2013, it was free to play, and it worked like a charm. Now, in 2024, it’s sequel time, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-preload-path-of-exile-2-pre-download-guide-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a>‘s free-to-play status is one of the biggest questions.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-path-of-exile-2-be-free-to-play">Will Path of Exile 2 be Free to Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Keep your money to yourself. Credit to Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Path of Exile 2 is free to play</strong>, and like its predecessor, requires no money to play, and its main way of generating income is through <strong>optional microtransactions</strong>.</p>



<p>After years of supporting the first game, the developer decided it was time for a sequel. The acclaim and adulation PoE received meant it was entirely feasible for Grinding Gear Games to make PoE 2 a pay-to-play adventure. </p>



<p>Path of Exile continually gained in popularity after its release, and <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/238960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Charts</a> shows PoE has barely dipped below 10,000 players a day on Steam since Jan. 2017. The numbers have regularly dipped into the 60K and 70K region—achieving <strong>76,501 concurrent players in Aug. 2024</strong>!</p>



<p>The developer clearly trusts the PoE community, so this is presumably why Path of Exile 2 is once again free to play. If you do intend to support PoE 2, various Supporter Packs are available to buy with the cheapest one offering 300 Points and an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a> Key. </p>



<p>Conversely, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3349430/Path_of_Exile_2__King_of_the_Faridun_Supporter_Pack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">King of the Faridun Supporter Pack</a> includes the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>1000 Points.</li>



<li>A Hideout</li>



<li>A Portal Effect</li>



<li>Early Access to Path of Exile 2</li>



<li>Level-up Effect</li>



<li>Three Pets</li>



<li>Three Weapon Skins</li>



<li>Two Armour Sets</li>



<li>Two Back Attachments</li>



<li>Two Badges</li>



<li>Two Forum Titles</li>



<li>Two Hideout Decorations</li>



<li>Two Portrait Frames</li>
</ul>



<p>Path of Exile 2’s future doesn’t necessarily hinge on selling extras, but this surely goes a long way to helping its stability. I’ve no idea how PoE 2 is going to perform compared to the classic before it, but it’s going to be interesting to find out.</p>
