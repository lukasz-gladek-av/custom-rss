			<p>CI Games, the studio behind the Lords of the Fallen games, has permanently lowered the price of the 2023 Lords of the Fallen title, which was previously available for $69.99 USD on consoles and $59.99 USD on PC. Now, the price is $29.99 USD / €29.99 / £24.99 for the standard edition on all platforms, with the deluxe edition lowered to $39.99 USD / €39.99 / £34.99.</p>



<p>This also isn't just a cut to the 2023 Lords of the Fallen. The entire CI Games catalogue of titles is getting a permanent price cut, with all of the studio's previous games now listed at $29.99 USD / €29.99 / £24.99 or lower.</p>



<p>In a statement on <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1951319064116179355">X</a>, the chief executive officer of CI Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-developer-ci-games-boss-claims-he-has-data-that-proves-modern-audience-is-a-false-myth/">Marek Tyminski</a>, cites the price of physical copies dropping in retail stores as one of the reasons for the digital versions getting cheaper, and also claims it to be part of the studio's "<em>player first</em>" approach.</p>



<p>"<em>Keeping games full price on digital stores while physical copies drop is wrong. Ironically, physical costs more per unit to make and sell. Big discounts from inflated prices look better — but that’s not real value.</em> <em>We’re slashing prices across the entire CI Games catalog — and we’re committed to keeping it that way. Fair pricing. Players first.</em>"</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Lords of the Fallen is now permanently $29.99 (was $69.99 console / $59.99 PC).</p><p>Keeping games full price on digital stores while physical copies drop is wrong.<br>Ironically, physical costs more per unit to make and sell.</p><p>Big discounts from inflated prices look better — but that’s… <a href="https://t.co/FIMeRJ0UZT">pic.twitter.com/FIMeRJ0UZT</a></p></div>— Marek Tyminski (@tyminski_marek) <a href="https://twitter.com/tyminski_marek/status/1951319064116179355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>When Lords of the Fallen launched in 2023, it did so in a poor state, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">with our reviewer,</a> Francesco De Meo, saying that he "<em>was disappointed to see how the game failed to deliver an enjoyable experience. Some die-hard Souls series fans may find some enjoyment in the 35 or so hours-long journey to save Mournstead, but everyone else likely won't be able to see past the game's many shortcomings."</em></p>



<p>A 2.0 update that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/">arrived earlier this year</a> marked a huge improvement, and the game has still been able to surpass <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-reaches-more-than-5-5-million-players/">5.5 million players since launch</a>, but it's definitely not been the journey that Tyminski and the rest of CI Games would have envisioned. </p>



<p>At least the price cuts are a tangible way for CI Games to show its players that it is committed to giving them a product that is worth what they paid for it.</p>

                <p>An official Blizzard forum post has warned players of the perils of buying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> gold from a third party. However, Blizzard's reminder that you can instead buy gold officially hasn't gone over well with some in the WoW community.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW community manager Kaivax recently <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/buying-gold-from-third-parties-is-forbidden/2139797" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reminded</a> players that buying gold from a third-party seller puts a user's account at risk of being hacked, and that players should protect their account and help to maintain a fair gaming environment by shunning the practice.</p><p dir="ltr">"Purchasing gold from other players puts your account at risk of being hacked and supports companies that steal accounts, operate bots, and disrupt the game economy," Kaivax states.</p><p dir="ltr">Buying gold from a third-party seller is also against WoW's end user license agreement. Those who do could have that illegally acquired gold removed by Blizzard or have their account permanently banned.</p><p dir="ltr">"Players should never buy gold from other players with real money," Kaivax states. "Remember--you should only accept gold from players that you know, or through crafting or profession agreements made using in-game chat. Always avoid gold trades intended to cross game variants, realms, or factions that are not explicitly supported by the game."</p><p dir="ltr">It's a fairly standard account-safety PSA that isn't out of the ordinary. But it's the last sentence of the post that has riled up some in the WoW community on places like the forums and on <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/blizzard-wants-players-to-remember-the-wow-token-is-the-only-safe-way-to-buy-377946#comments" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, as Blizzard goes from offering information players can use to protect their account to what comes across as Blizzard trying to sell a product.</p><p dir="ltr">"The only safe way to purchase gold is via the WoW Token, which provides a convenient and sanctioned exchange of gold for game time or Battle.net balance directly through the in-game auction house," the forum post concludes.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard introduced the WoW Token back in 2015 as part of the game's Warlords of Draenor expansion. A player can buy a WoW Token directly from Blizzard for $20. That token can then be sold on the game's auction house in exchange for gold. The player buying the token can then use that token to pay for 30 days of game time or add it to their Battle.net balance.</p><p dir="ltr">The post has ruffled feathers for a few reasons. For starters, it comes off as an advertisement for the WoW Token, which has long been a controversial addition to the MMO. In recent years the WoW community has argued whether the fact that players can officially buy as much gold as they want from Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-cant-decide-whether-or-not-the-game-is-pay-to-win/1100-6494862/" data-ref-id="1100-6494862">makes the game "pay-to-win."</a> Money, as they say, is power, and with unlimited gold a player can buy many of the best items, rare mounts, or pay other players to run them through content in order to reap lucrative rewards. Blizzard isn't selling players power directly, but they are in a roundabout way by letting players buy gold instead.</p><p dir="ltr">Many players would like to see the WoW Token removed entirely. Others would like to see Blizzard do more to combat bots and account-scammers outside of offering its own, legally sanctioned way to buy gold.</p><p dir="ltr">Another issue is that, as many in the replies to the forum post point out, some players are unable to buy the WoW Token in their region or in their preferred version of WoW. Some players on the forums state they play in Brazil and have no way to buy the WoW Token, as it's not supported in the country, while others state they play one of the many versions of WoW Classic, which don't support the WoW Token. Blizzard's post encouraging players to buy gold officially, despite many being unable to do so due to where they live or the version of WoW they play, comes across as tone deaf to some.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard does regularly ban bots, and even occasionally makes in-game changes to make botting more difficult. In 2023, it banned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-wrath-of-the-lich-king-classic-is-making-it-harder-to-create-death-knights/1100-6512418/" data-ref-id="1100-6512418">120,000 "malicious accounts"</a> that were using the ability to make high-level Death Knight characters in Wrath of the Lich King Classic for botting, and added restrictions to new accounts to prevent them from doing so. At the time, Blizzard said it regularly bans tens of thousands of accounts per week.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-will-get-surprises-and-major-midnight-news-at-gamescom-this-year/1100-6532635/" data-ref-id="1100-6532635">Midnight, will be fully revealed at Gamescom</a>. The expansion will introduce the long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">player housing feature</a> to the MMO.</p>

<p>Goldfarb worked at DICE on a number of Battlefield games, including Battlefield: Bad Company 1+2, as well as Battlefield 3.

Major environmental destruction is back, and the game steps away from the unpopular specialist operators of Battlefield 2042 in favor of the more traditional class system.</p><p dir="ltr">"We loved Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, and we wanted Battlefield 6 to be inspired by that," VP and executive producer Christian Grass said when discussing the studio's focus for the game. "We wanted to make sure we nailed the tactical destruction system, we wanted the classes to be great, and we wanted the core combat system to be the best we've ever created."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Combat, Classes &amp; Destruction Breakdown Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"We knew what we knew what we needed to do in the beginning," Ripple Effect creative director Thomas Anderson added. "To take the best parts of Battlefield 3 and 4 and just push those to quality."</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 dives back into this modern setting with a global conflict that provides a pleasant variety of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-maps/2900-6834/">map locations</a>. We were able to get hands-on with five different maps across various modes. We fought gritty, close-quarters fights in the streets of New York on the Empire State map, while Liberation Peak served as a large, mountainous landscape with tons of wide-open spaces for snipers. Siege of Cairo is a sprawling desert map for large-scale modes like Conquest, but we also played a smaller slice of the locale for the more condensed Squad Deathmatch mode. These smaller maps are pulled from the larger map designs, but placement of objects and how destruction is used has been altered to fit the smaller play area.</p><p dir="ltr">The Squad Deathmatch mode provides the opportunity to step away from Battlefield's typical large-scale warfare and go for a more hectic pace with in-your-face action moments that feel more in line with an experience you’d get from a Call of Duty multiplayer match. These feature four squads of four fighting on small maps to be the first to rack up a certain number of kills. You still have roles to play in Squad Deathmatch, and with such close-quarters action and more opportunities to die, the medic-style Support class is very useful here.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, Battlefield 6's large-scale modes are where the game shines. Our multiplayer session included the familiar modes of Conquest, Domination, and Breakthrough. This is where the destruction feels more impactful, as certain buildings can serve as power positions to hold flags, but you can change the direction of the fight by simply collapsing all the floors with well-aimed rockets or a grenade launcher. I've always found the destruction in older Battlefield games to be extremely satisfying, and it feels even more so in Battlefield 6. Targeting a building often doesn't just take away the frontside or a specific chunk; you can collapse several floors and sometimes an entire building of a structure on top of opponents. And that makes it a significant hazard to watch out for when moving through interior spaces.</p><p dir="ltr">Tanks can now more easily drive through structures as well. Enemies behind a wall? No problem: You can just drive a tank right through concrete walls to take them out, while also forging new pathways for your teammates. Tanks were really fun to drive and use to bully right through enemy defenses. As for air support, I'm the pilot most likely to crash and wipe my whole squad. From what I can tell, flying vehicles seem like a blast to use; helicopters and jets were crashing everywhere in a way only Battlefield does.</p><p dir="ltr">All of these destructive and cinematic moments come at a cost, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-skipping-ps4-and-xbox-one/1100-6533611/">Battlefield 6 is moving away from last-generation consoles</a>. When discussing the improvements in technology, Christian Grass said, "It's really difficult from a technological and balancing point of view to create the package that is Battlefield. There are so many things that are competing in terms of computation power that we need. The vision of Battlefield 6 wouldn't have been possible on the previous generation."</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the destruction elements, another Battlefield signature is its class system with weapons tied to each role. Being an Engineer once meant you had to use a submachine gun if you wanted to repair tanks, or you'd need to wield a light machine gun if you wanted to play a support role for the match. Now, Battlefield 6 aims to break that mold without losing the feel of the class-based roles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542165-bf68large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4542165" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542165-bf68large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4542165"></a><figcaption>Tanks in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542165-bf68large.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542166-bf61large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542167-bf62large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542168-bf63large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542169-bf64large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542170-bf65large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542171-bf66large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542172-bf67large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542173-bf69large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4542166,1300-4542167,1300-4542168,1300-4542169,1300-4542170,1300-4542171,1300-4542172,1300-4542173" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542166-bf61large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542167-bf62large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542168-bf63large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542169-bf64large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542170-bf65large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542171-bf66large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542172-bf67large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542173-bf69large.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542166-bf61large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542167-bf62large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542168-bf63large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542169-bf64large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542170-bf65large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542171-bf66large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542172-bf67large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542173-bf69large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The traditional class system was one of the loudest talking points prior to Battlefield 6's reveal. Originally, the developers announced that every weapon would be available regardless of class, but there was backlash from the community, as many players didn't want the game to lean away from the traditional Battlefield class system. Battlefield Studios listened, and now players will have the freedom to choose between having weapons unlocked or choosing a classic weapon-locked system for Battlefield 6.</p><p dir="ltr">As someone who's played a ton of Battlefield games over the years, I was curious which way I'd lean in the great class debate. We spent around seven to eight hours playing the Battlefield 6 closed beta, and I often found myself choosing to go outside the specialized weapons for the Support and Engineering classes. Honestly, call me a Battlefield disloyalist if you want, but I rarely wanted to use a light machine gun when playing Support, and I almost never wanted a submachine gun when playing as an Engineer on the large-scale maps and modes. That's not to say that the submachine guns don't feel great, but I preferred to use them when playing in close-quarters scenarios on the smaller Squad Deathmatch maps.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says the choice for locked or unlocked weapons will be available in the beta and at launch. Additionally, there are no XP penalties for choosing one option or the other. "We're confident in our design," Andersson said, "But if people don't agree or a niche of players don't agree, they can play [weapons locked.]” "They can play however they want," Grass said, jumping in. "We're happy as long as you're having a good time playing Battlefield 6."</p><p dir="ltr">Each class will still have its own role to play, and my time with Battlefield 6 never felt like I wasn't playing a meaningful class type when I did swap my weapons. However, it can be beneficial to stick with a class's specialized weapons, as you get trait bonuses for using that weapon type. For example, the Recon class rewards snipers with faster rechambering between shots, decreased scope speed, and improved breath control to stabilize aim for longer. Non-Recon players who use a sniper might feel at a slight disadvantage, but they can still complement that weapon choice with other tools available to their class.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the specialization bonuses, each class comes with its own unique gadgets and a special class-specific Active Ability that can be used and recharged over time. For example, the Recon class features the Active Ability to call in a UAV, and the Engineer Active Ability allows you to repair more efficiently for a limited time.</p><p dir="ltr">Movement is also improved in Battlefield 6. The game features what Battlefield Studios call a "Kinesthetic Combat System," which is basically a whole mouthful just to say there are new maneuvering actions to help you excel on the battlefield. With this updated system you can now peek and lean around corners, mount weapons against a surface to reduce recoil, hitch a ride on the sides of tanks, and even drag teammates while simultaneously reviving them. These actions are very situational, but the most impactful is the ability to drag and revive downed friendlies while moving them to the safety of cover. I definitely saved more lives during my time with Battlefield 6, and it really makes you feel like a hero while performing these revives .</p><p dir="ltr">These are early impressions that point to a strong start for Battlefield's return to a modern landscape. It's also worth mentioning that this beta build of the game felt extremely polished, and I didn't encounter any lag or performance issues. Out of the several hours played, I only experienced one instance of a bugged optic on my assault rifle, which caused a prismatic color pattern to appear in the scope and block my view.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we only got to play a handful of maps and modes, with a total of nine maps confirmed for launch, including the return of Battlefield 3's Operation Firestorm. The popular game mode Rush is also confirmed to return, but we didn't get a chance to play it at the reveal. There is still content yet to be seen, and we also don't yet have a good indication of what the game's post-launch content might look like.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked if the game would keep thematically appropriate skins and bundles for Battlefield 6, or if they had plans to add wacky Call of Duty-style bundles, Grass said, "Battlefield 6 is a modern military shooter." The developer also referenced the skins designed for the premium Phantom Edition of Battlefield 6, which are soldiers in black suits that still keep the style and gear of modern military uniforms. Of course, that doesn't mean the future won't include something a bit more outlandish. "We're talking about now and not necessarily the future, but we are a modern military shooter," Grass reiterated.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, my early impressions for Battlefield 6 suggests a strong return to the modern-day setting and a positive step towards balancing the classic experience with updated mechanics and freedom for all playstyles. All the big action moments are there, the destruction is exciting and more impactful than ever, and the gunplay feels solid. So far, it's shaping up to be the more direct successor to the beloved Battlefield 3 and 4 that many fans have been waiting for.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>COVID has hung like an albatross around <em>Death Stranding’s </em>neck<em> </em>since lockdown. The original game was released, almost prophetically, at a time when people were exclusively connecting online, akin to the chiral network that players are tasked to complete. Like 9/11 and the social violence of misinformation on the internet in <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em>, <em>Death Stranding</em> accidentally wielded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lathe_of_Heaven" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lathe of Heaven</a> more powerfully than it ever had before in any Kojima-directed game. But being anchored to a physically and mentally traumatic event that everyone on Earth experienced is a difficult thing to build a sequel on. Kojima himself has said in the 2022 announcement that <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>was already written prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, but that he rewrote the entire thing from scratch following that experience.</p><p>“I also didn’t want to predict any more future, so I rewrote it” Kojima joked at the 2022 Game Awards through a translator. The trailer ended with the uncertain tagline: Should we have connected?</p><figure><figcaption>Man this game is pretty. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s a strange thing to call a Kojima game “breezy,” let alone the follow up to <em>Death Stranding.</em> But there is a simple joy that permeates <em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach: </em>winking fun that, while present in the man’s entire career, is now fully unleashed like an unruly dog. In <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, Kojima is having a blast. It is a joy that I find infectious, and the correct choice tonally given everything that the first <em>Death Stranding </em>had come to represent.</p><p>When <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>was announced it was done in a shockingly straightforward way. While there were hints of its development, none of the normal puzzle box horseshit that Kojima pulls was on display here: no <a href="https://metalgear.fandom.com/wiki/Joakim_Mogren" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mummified Joakim Mogren,</a> <a href="https://metalgear.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Gear_Rising:_Revengeance/ARG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no fake severed USB drive arms</a>, no <a href="https://metalgear.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Gear_Rising:_Revengeance/ARG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beguiling trailer hidden inside one of the best short horror games ever made</a>. Just the man stating in a matter of fact way that they were making another one of those, and asking, are you ready for more? I wasn’t sure, given the bloated ending of the original <em>Death Stranding</em>. But the ease of that simple announcement belied a sensation that has carried through the entirety of my second playthrough, a commitment to lean into the things that were fun in the first game and throw out or tweak the things that weren’t.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Death Stranding 2 Full Presentation with Hideo Kojima | The Game Awards 2022" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iAB___ZxgmM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><h3><strong>“The blues they send to meet me won’t defeat me”</strong></h3><figure><figcaption>Showertime. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Death Stranding 2 </em>picks up following the events of the first game, with Sam (played by Norman Reedus) raising Lou (aka BB-28) in a shelter near Mexico. Lou is now a toddler, and Sam is a doting single father. Fragile (played by Léa Seydoux) enters into Sam’s life once again, trying to get the legendary porter back into the game to help connect Mexico to the Chiral Network. After getting back into the swing of things tragedy strikes, and Sam goes back to his old ways as a means of just moving forward, this time connecting the continent of Australia to the network.&nbsp;</p><p>It is not particularly easy or illuminating to summarize the events of the first <em>Death Stranding</em>, although the game does have a rough summary of what went down in case it’s been a minute. It is unfortunately a game that requires, bare minimum, binging a big Youtube compilation of the cutscenes if you haven’t played the first. It is also a pointedly similar game to the first one, with the same core gameplay loop and boss structure.</p><p>Sam still schleps between unconnected shelters and bases like the most daring deliverista-slash-FIOS-technician (his job itself a modern interpretation of <a href="https://www.japan.travel/national-parks/plan-your-visit/guides-and-stories/ozes-mighty-bokka-porters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Japanese porters known as Bokka</a>). You are rewarded with new tools and resources by increasing the connections between people, and those resources can be then invested into building the infrastructure of the world in the form of roads, buildings, monorails, and now mines. You also will have to fight an occasional big sloppy field boss fight (which can be straight up skipped) or a series of complex boss fights akin to the Mads Mikkelsen fights in the first game, with the Clifford Unger character instead being replaced by Luca Marinelli doing his best <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/even-death-stranding-2s-luca-marinelli-was-fooled-by-his-solid-snake-appearance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impression of Snake from <em>Metal Gear Solid</em></a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>I have seen the game called iterative by some and “the same game” by others. I think the first part is technically true but misses the point and the latter is a little uncharitable but speaks to something important. Namely, that the quality of life improvements in the Director’s Cut and the global brain damage of COVID can make it difficult for anybody but diehard fans to parse what is actually new in this game. But I should be clear that <em>Death Stranding 2</em> is categorically a better and more enjoyable game than its predecessor. The first <em>Death Stranding </em>took its sweet time to get off the ground, whereas <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>comfortably shoves you into what would normally be the midgame, with vehicles and weapons given to you early.&nbsp;</p><p>Combat in the first game was largely something to be avoided, lest killing an NPC cause what’s called a voidout—a giant temporary crater that happens in the universe when a dead body is not properly disposed of. <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>tacitly acknowledges that, while interesting, the experience itself of avoiding combat wasn’t as fun as going clown mode on a base of baddies. Weapons are implausibly non-lethal by default now, and the game just throws more tools than you can handle to deal with enemy threats. The grenade launcher is an MVP, and I found myself using it as a “get out of jail free” card in tough situations, but I found myself preferring melee whenever possible. There is an argument to be made that the game is “<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/death-stranding-2-is-too-damn-easy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too easy</a>” (I disagree with this a little when you hit the big ass mountain), but to me the game hews closer to the large open world of <em>Metal Gear Solid V</em>, a game that I feel has been more harshly reappraised in the years since its release but one that I still find a joy to play.</p><p>I thank my lucky stars that I did not have to review this game under embargo. <em>Death Stranding 2, </em>like its predecessor, is a game that is not structured to be rushed. There is an even greater emphasis on infrastructure this time around, and the decreased stress of every interaction gives it an almost cozy feeling. I refused to continue in any story mission until a road to that destination had been at least halfway built, and by the time I hit credits I had built every road and monorail, restored every mine, found every base, and built what was functionally a zipline ski resort on top of the one giant snowy mountain that takes up 50 percent of the mass of Australia. I clocked over 90 hours in the game, and at no point did I tire of it.</p><h3><strong>“Something special, just for you.”</strong></h3><figure><figcaption>The gang's all here.

As the game goes on, the ship collects characters from the previous game as well as newly introduced ones, including the captain Tarman whose likeness is based on <em>Mad Max</em> director George Miller. This conceit is the beating heart of the game, as characters are no longer isolated individuals trapped in their respective spaces, but friends and comrades working towards a common goal.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>George Miller provides the likeness for Tarman and is voiced by Marty Rhone. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>Of all the new cast members, the one you interact with the most is Dollman. Dollman is a guy whose Ka, or soul, was trapped inside a doll. His body moves in a troubling, jerky way which makes him appear as though he is animated via stop motion. He also serves the same purpose that codex calls in previous Kojima games; a means to keep the player on track with the most obnoxious and obvious exposition humanly possible.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Dollman is voiced by Jonathan Roumie and his likeness is based on director Fatih Akin. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>At first this made me deeply loathe Dollman, but I am pleased to report that I was wrong. Dollman rocks. He’s like if Jigsaw’s puppet Billy was your homie; a chipper bit of positivity and a more enjoyable vehicle for information. When the game lets you know that you can chuck his ass into the air and use him to scout terrain or enemy encampments, I was fully on board. We love Dollman.</p><figure><figcaption>We do, in fact, love Dollman. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>Dollman gets to the center of what makes <em>Death Stranding 2</em> distinct instead of a route regurgitation of the previous game: it’s goofy as hell. Another prime example of this is the return of Higgs, played by Troy Baker.&nbsp;</p><p>I cannot stress how much Higgs sucks in the first game. It’s not that he was simply repugnant, he was irritating too. Well now he’s back, he’s worse, and that was absolutely the right move. Higgs in <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>is a queeny-cyborg-cowboy-ninja who is constantly chewing the scenery. I believe it was Ian Broudou who pointed out that he’s basically that one <a href="https://x.com/dril/status/575121631846227968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dril tweet</a> that goes “the jduge orders me to take off my anonymous v mask &amp; im wearing the joker makeup underneath it. everyone in the courtroom groans at my shit.” Troy Baker is clearly having the time of his life hamming shit up, and both this and his uncanny Harrison Ford impression in the MachineGames <em>Indiana Jones</em> video game have elevated him as an actor in my personal esteem. A jarring amount of pathos is yanked out of him in the final act, an incredible feat for a character that’s basically every Jared Leto acting impulse shoved into one weird robot.</p><figure><figcaption>Love this man. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>The thing that I cannot shake from my time with <em>Death Stranding 2</em> is how everyone involved is clearly having a blast. I have not seen a game in Kojima’s orbit that’s so much fun since <em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengence, </em>which is convenient because that’s my favorite <em>Metal Gear </em>game. The last four hours of <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>are some of the most absurd spectacle the man has ever been associated with. Kojima is constantly mugging at the camera through his characters, leaving silly, obvious references to his previous games as if to suggest that even he thinks it’s a bit absurd. Inhabiting the space often feels more like you are inhabiting Kojima’s instagram feed, like he’s gotten all the actors and directors that he personally enjoys together, put them in his weird little scanner, and he’s smashing them together like little action figures a la Rick Moranis in <em>Space Balls</em>. It is like he has reassessed his life, discarded the bullshit he’s tired of, and emphasized the stuff that he really loves.</p><h3><strong>“You of all people should understand. The loneliness.”</strong></h3><figure><figcaption>Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>This is also one of the few times that I have played a Kojima game that feels ruminative instead of attempting to predict the future. Norman Reedus’ physical performance is notably haunting, conveying with his presence a man who has collected more hurt than he can bear. There is a clear message from the beginning that, as Sam enters Mexico over the rusted ruins of Trump’s border wall, the United States is a cancer on the world whose entire existence is extractive and violent.&nbsp;</p><p>Kojima’s metaphorical usage of pregnancy is still fairly sloppy and many of his characters are gender essentialist in ways that <a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/death-stranding-2/the-women-of-death-stranding-2-are-stuck-in-a-sad-cycle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maddy Myers does a fantastic job of cataloging</a>, but I do appreciate that he leans much more heavily on the ways in which the state sees pregnant people as a purely extractive resource with little regard for their safety. And while he has yet to write a woman in his games as complex and self-assured as The Boss in <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>, there are times where you can see him getting closer to that again.</p><figure><figcaption>Rainy, played by Shioli Kutsuna. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>But the more I think about the game the more I cannot see it beyond the albatross of COVID. It is an unprecedented scar we all carry with us that we have neither the strength nor the patience to interrogate any more. <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>swims in the various ways that experience hurt us: children were raised wrong with years of their childhood erased; people were pushed to mental oblivion in a state of lockdown that was neither alive nor dead, the state and capital have extended their grasp with violence and repression; and workers were forced back on the job without being given a chance to assess what had broken inside off them.&nbsp;</p><p>For all its goofiness, <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>is one of the few pieces of media to point out, if only obliquely, that every person on earth is damaged goods now. As Higgs, a former porter, mockingly screams repeatedly in a paroxism of pain at one point “I’ll take the damage and the goods. I don’t break that easy.”</p><h3><strong>“The physical sensation of movement is something that we all crave. That unity of body and soul.”</strong></h3><figure><figcaption>Horizon Dreamer by Daichi Miura, originally showed off at TGS. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>When lockdown finally loosened a few years ago, I noticed club music had changed. Places that had previously played mathematically dire Berlin-style techno suddenly shifted their tone, and people started playing<a href="https://soundcloud.com/2shy2dj/dj-fart-in-the-club-sustain-release-year-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sets that were goofy and fun</a>, often full of aggressive breakbeats like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnxbreSfQ48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toonami ad break</a>. Nobody wanted to be reminded of the drudgery that came before, being trapped in the coffin of your own home. Everyone instead wanted to be present and alive in a physical space with people again. This needed to be fun, and we needed to be surrounded by people in a physical space.&nbsp;</p><p>“We survived the pandemic because of the internet and the fact that people were about to connect online. Now there are people who work for our studio from home and whose faces I don’t even know.” Kojima <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-covid-19-changed-hideo-kojimas-vision-for-death-stranding-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said to Wired in June</a>&nbsp; “Live concerts were canceled, and everything moved to online streaming. I understand that it was inevitable during the pandemic. It was the same with school. Instead of playing with friends or learning from teachers, you watched a screen, as if you were watching a YouTube video.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kojima also credits the trajectory towards the (now failed in one sense) Metaverse as an inspiration “Communication between human beings shouldn’t be like that. You meet people by chance and see unexpected things. With the path we were on, all of that would be lost.”</p><p><em>Death Stranding 2 </em>is the only game it makes sense to make when you are associated with something of that magnitude. AAA titles take a little longer to cook up than DJ sets, but the same impulse is there. It is a goofy, soothing, and occasionally introspective game about coming together with friends and family to heal. It is about being alive and physically present again in spite of an increasingly hostile world. And though it is often overwrought, lumpy in its pacing, and recursively referential, it is the game with a heart that is lighter than a feather, an oddly cozy game to play, a balm to a weary soul, and by far the most human thing that Hideo Kojima has produced in ages.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/harry-potter-jk-rowling-cge-codenames-board-game"><h3>Board Game Company Fucks Around (Announcing A New Harry Potter Game), Finds Out (When Fans Revolt And Media Announce Boycotts)</h3></a><p>'It’s a product to sell to people who prioritise their nostalgia for children’s fantasy over the culture their trans friends and family live in'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal"><h3>Inside The Mass Call Campaign To Stop Video Game Censorship [Update]</h3></a><p>"This is a marathon, not a race," say organizers who plan to keep calling payment processors for months, if need be</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/clues-by-sam-wordle-daily-puzzle-game"><h3>Clues By Sam Is My Favorite Daily Puzzle Game</h3></a><p>It’s a nice little thing to do as my last thing before falling asleep.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/peak-multiplayer-streamers"><h3>Peak Is A Playground For Slapstick Comedy</h3></a><p>Peak creates space for players to really fuck around, punctuated by a swift emphasis on finding out</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-covid-lockdown-hideo-kojima]]></content:encoded>

And in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there has been little news since, leading Starfield players to express their dissatisfaction at the level of communication coming out of Bethesda on the future of the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-starfields-xbox-no-show-even-its-most-loyal-fans-are-starting-to-worry-bethesda-makes-it-so-hard-to-defend-this-game"><u>with its no-show at June’s Xbox Games Showcase considered the final straw for some</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new IP in 25 years, and it went on to reach 15 million players. But it was not as well received as the studio’s previous games in the Fallout and The Elder Scrolls franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion did nothing to improve sentiment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer later revealed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-wondered-if-starfield-should-have-delayed-buggies-for-shattered-space">he had had a conversation with Bethesda development chief Todd Howard about the release cadence for Starfield content</a>. “Todd and I were talking about Shattered Space,” Spencer said. “Starfield is a game I put a ton of hours into and really love, but they've had this thing where they've added features throughout the year and then they had an expansion. I think some of the feedback on the expansion is: ‘We wanted more features.’ And he's like, ‘Well, should we have waited to put buggies out?'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And so, I think you're trying to tune both development effort and the impact of the expansion. And I think there will always be a balance to managing the game month to month. But not every game will do expansions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, though, Shattered Space was criticized more for its lack of space content than its lack of ground content. As IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-review"><u>Starfield Shattered Space review</u></a>: "As far as I can tell there’s absolutely nothing added for spacefarers other than now you have a way to legitimately acquire Va’ruun ships instead of stealing them from Zealots who attack you in space. That’s fine, as an expansion doesn’t always have to meaningfully expand every aspect of a game – but I was surprised that there wasn’t at least a token feature thrown in for space jockeys in an expansion with 'space' in the title."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Bethesda finally broke its silence on the future of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield"><u>Starfield</u></a>, insisting it was still working on updates and would share details on the “exciting things” it had planned in the coming months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda was seriously affected by Microsoft’s latest round of layoffs, with cuts to its London office and ZeniMax Online Studios. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unannounced-mmo-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-dev-canceled-veteran-studio-head-steps-down-amid-microsoft-layoffs"><u>Its unannounced MMORPG was canceled, and its veteran studio head stepped down</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Adult games--and games with adult themes--have been delisted from digital game sales portals Steam and <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch.io</a> recently, following pressure from companies that process those platforms' payments to remove them. After an extended period of silence on the matter, Mastercard has released a statement and says that its recent actions are based on the "rule of law" and aren't an attempt to enforce censorship.</p><p>"Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations," <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" rel="nofollow ">the company said</a>. "Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content."</p><p>It's worth noting that there has been no evidence that the games removed from Steam and Itch.io included illegal content, and for an even deeper breakdown, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gamers-are-furious-about-the-censorship-of-nsfw-games-and-theyre-fighting-back/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/steam-itch-takedowns-credit-cards-1.7597563" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CBC have detailed timelines</a> on the entire situation so far. Visa also put out a pre-written response to complaints (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/616835/visa-mastercard-steam-itchio-campaign-adult-games/" rel="nofollow ">Polygon</a>), adding that it didn't aim to "make moral judgments on legal purchases" and that it was also adhering to the letter of the law.</p><p>The pressure from payment processors was apparently the result of a campaign by the Australian anti-porn lobbying group Collective Shout, which has taken credit for the actions. Collective Shout released an open letter claiming that Steam and indie games storefront <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch.io</a> hosted games with "rape, incest and child sexual abuse" content.</p><p>It has also released statements claiming to have sent about 1,000 emails and calls to payment processors, urging them to threaten to pull support from those portals unless those games were removed. But the result has been the delisting of any game with vaguely defined adult content. Developers say that games with LGBTQ themes or content have been caught in the purge, and many have criticized the payment processors for arbitrarily enforcing their moral standards--and Collective Shout's--on what adults are allowed to buy and play.</p><p>In the weeks since payment processors have stopped supporting payments for adult content, several sites have been forced to take drastic measures. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/">Steam began purging content</a> from its storefront--and it made a vague update to its terms of service--while Itch.io <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-is-reaching-out-to-other-payment-processors-following-ban-on-adult-games/1100-6533545/">also began to de-index content from the site</a>.</p><p>Earlier this week, the site began to "re-index" adult and not safe for work content, adding that it is still in ongoing discussions with payment processors. Itch.io has long used Stripe as its payment processor, but the financial site will no longer support the sale of adult content that fits the description of “content designed for sexual gratification" on Itch.io.</p><p>The last couple of weeks have seen massive pushback against payment companies, as game organizations, developers, and artists have rallied together. The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/international-game-developers-association-seriously-alarmed-by-recent-delisting-of-games/1100-6533536/">has called for "greater transparency and fairness"</a> in the moderation of adult games, while other groups have urged people to put pressure on the two payment processors and flood them with calls to register their concerns about censorship.</p>

<p>"We always said that with all of this investment and with all the potential of this franchise, we would not have put it in harm's way, and we would not have put it out in the blast radius of something really large," she said. "We were pretty unblinking, and we weren't allowing ourselves to play the, 'What if?' game with the schedules and development. We were like, 'No, we have to get this done,' because the opportunity is so big and the potential is so significant for the company."</p><p>GTA 6 was originally scheduled to release in Fall 2025 before Take-Two delayed the game to May 2026. After the GTA 6 delay, EA management said the launch window for Battlefield 6 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">"clearer than before."</a></p><p>As for Black Ops 7, Activision has not announced a release date yet, but a report said the game will launch on November 14, which would give Battlefield 6 about a month's space.</p><p>Timing is important for game releases, and some have theorized that another EA game, Titanfall 2, launching sandwiched between Battlefield 1 and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare back in 2016 negatively impacted that game's sales. There was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfall/comments/amrf7h/jason_schreier_on_the_tf2_release_date_mishap/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more to the story</a>, however.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on October 10. An<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515"> open beta</a> kicks off very soon, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">battle royale mode is coming later. </a></p>

<p>A brand new infographic shared on the <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1951311967353737462">Nintendo of America</a> Twitter account highlights all the games that cropped up in the showcase, split into Switch 2, Switch 2 <em>and</em> Switch 1, and pure Switch 1 categories.</p>
<p>It might not have been the big summer blowout that many of us were hoping for, but seeing all the games laid out like this can't help but get us a little excited. Let's not claim that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a> are anything to be scoffed at!</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gxsprk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>All in all, it felt like a somewhat subdued affair (where the heck was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>??), but we have to remind ourselves that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> are all on the horizon from the first-party side of things, so we're still looking at a <em>hell</em> of a launch year for Switch 2.</p>
<p>If you're after a more detailed rundown of the entire presentation, you'll find our full round-up below, where we've compiled every game's trailer and blurb text for you to check out as you please.</p>

            <p><em>Beware minor spoilers for Chairbound in this piece. I think they're minor. I have no idea what's truly significant in this dreary purgatory of flourescent lights and rippled glass facades. Only one thing seems guaranteed: I have to get out of here in 10 minutes or I'm doomed.</em></p>
<p>I met the weird little girl again. She was loitering in the shadow of a pillar on the eighth floor. I found her goblin-esque <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-strapped-to-a-rolling-office-chair-with-a-ticking-timer-in-a-huge-scary-building">during our first meeting</a>, but up close she seems relatively ordinary, a pale 10-year-old in a nightie with shoulder-length hair. At least, until she burbles distorted sounds at me and runs away into the darkness. I gather she is looking for her "toy". I don't think it's the rubber duck I'm holding.</p><!--more-->
<p>Some other observations about the eighth floor: there are more rubber ducks down here. This is handy intelligence indeed, because it means I don't have to grab the one in the starting office above, saving me 30-60 seconds of abject swivelling and fumbling. I'm still not clear why I would need this rubber duck. It seems perfectly useless. But I don't know for sure that I <em>don't</em> need it, and squeaking the thing pathetically lifts my mood somewhat as I trundle through the office's neat and tidy desolation.</p>
<p>Another thing I've learned: the thing strapped to my chest isn't explosive. When the timer runs down, the display clicks "on", and there's a hiss of initially harmless gas. The first time this happened, I almost died of relief. I figured the timer must have been a prank, a red herring of some kind. Ten minutes to make it down nine stories while tied to a rolling office chair? Of <em>course</em> they were joking. But then my surroundings wobbled and blurred and the shadows took me.</p>
<p>I feel like there must, must be a way to disable this gadget, or extend the timer, because even when I'm being efficient, it takes a good few minutes to descend a single floor. It occurs to me that I dropped the duck on my last attempt, shortly before the gas overwhelmed my senses. Perhaps the duck offers protection from the gas. A voice repeats in my stomach: <em>the duck is the key</em>.</p>

<p>Final observations: I managed to get into some kind of computer room on the eighth floor, just below one of the red lights. It contained a stack of displays and another chair, standing in a pool of what I'm pretty sure is blood. This Bodes, for sure. I don't fancy my chances at fighting anybody or anything off while I'm strapped to this chair. Let's reconvene to compare notes on the seventh floor, assuming I make it.</p>
