            <p>The writer and producer of sci-fi anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners said he doesn't want to write a jolly story for the series, because "when people are sad", it makes him "a bit happy".</p>
<p>Edgerunners is an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-edgerunners-shows-cd-projekts-cyberpunk-is-still-worth-fighting-for">animated spin-off of CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-cyberpunk-2077-anime-edgerunners-arrives-13th-september">first debuted in 2022</a>. Following acclaim, a second season is now in production for Netflix. </p><p>

News of this next season arrived during Anime Expo, along with a new trailer. "Night City lives on," reads the official blurb. You can check out the trailer below.

<p>At the same event, a Cyberpunk: Edgerunners panel was held, where writer Bartosz Sztybor was asked about the human stories told within Edgerunners' dystopian world. Here, the show's writer replied that this type of narrative is incredibly important for CDPR, and the team always wants to "write stories that are character driven".</p>
<p>Sztybor then elaborated on this point further stating: "But the other thing is that we are a company from Poland. I'm from Poland and people in Poland are sad. They are born sad, they die sad, so I just wanted to make the whole world sad." This was met with plenty of laughter from his audience.</p>
<p>When asked if he had ever considered changing things up a bit, and perhaps offering up some joyful story lines, Sztybor replied, "no", with the panel's host joking the writer liked to feast on others' misery.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for the second season of Edgerunners yet, with the team merely saying it will arrive on Netflix when it is ready. We do know, though, that it will comprise 10 episodes, and feature a standalone story within the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>The Edgerunners team promise "a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge" on the second season's debut. "In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter," the blurb teases.</p>
<p>As for Cyberpunk 2077 itself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">it is now available on Switch 2</a>. Our pals at Digital Foundry have taken the game out for a spin on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> already, asking the question: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">Can the new Nintendo console handle it?</a></p>
<p>In addition, the team at CDPR are currently cooking up another update for Cyberpunk 2077, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-new-update-will-have-scope-similar-to-22-as-cd-projekt-announces-delay">which will have "scope similar" to 2.2</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/when-people-are-sad-im-a-bit-happy-cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-two-is-going-to-be-sadder-bloodier-and-darker]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following Microsoft's latest round of layoffs, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw over 9K lose their jobs</a>, including many at various Xbox-owned gaming studios, former Arkane founder Raphael Colantonio <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941503596870369388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to X</a> to explain that, in his opinion, Game Pass is one of the main culprits, not to mention potentially damaging to the industry as a whole.</p>



<p><em>Why is no one talking about the elephant in the room? Cough cough (Game Pass). I think Game Pass is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by Microsoft’s “infinite money”, but at some point, reality has to hit. I don’t think GP can co-exist with other models; they’ll either kill everyone else or give up.</em></p>



<p><em>What might happen once Microsoft has won: the games will start to suck and your sub will go up. Why? Because the current amazing deal you have is subsidized by Microsoft bleeding money into it with the hope they’ll kill the competition, but once they manage to do it, things will get real</em>.</p>



<p>Colantonio is in tune with Rhys Elliott, Head of Market Analysis at Alinea, who also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believes</a> that Microsoft bet on the wrong horse by putting so much effort into pushing its Game Pass subscription service. Games simply do not work in the same way as film or music since they take much longer to consume, and there's only so much spare time that users can dedicate to entertainment.</p>



<p>Anyway, Colantonio later added that Game Pass could only co-exist if it's focused on back catalogue games.</p>



<p><em>I’m fed up with all the BS they fed us at first, like “don’t worry, it doesn’t impact the sales”, only to admit years later that it totally does. “No shit it does! Really?” The only way Game Pass can co-exist without hurting everyone is for the back catalogue.</em></p>



<p>This is essentially Sony's strategy with PlayStation Plus: <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-says-playstation-plus-engagement-has-never-been-higher-still-wont-add-first-party-games-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never put big games there on day one</a>, only add them at a later date, when they enter the back catalogue phase. However, Microsoft is currently still very much keen to maintain its promise to consumers to bring all of its games to Game Pass when they launch. Even so, despite adding franchises like Call of Duty, Diablo, Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and DOOM, the total number of subscribers is believed to be around 35 million, far lower than Microsoft's lofty goals.</p>



<p>As a side note, Raphael Colantonio is the studio founder of WolfEye Studios, which made <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weird West</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank">.</a>&nbsp;The studio is now developing a retro sci-fi first-person action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dishonored-with-more-rpg-elements-and-shooter-gameplay-is-apparently-an-apt-description-for-wolfeyes-next-game/" target="_blank">inspired by Dishonored</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-expands-publishing-portfolio-with-wolfeye-studios-partnership/" target="_blank">published by NEOWIZ</a>. It's not the first time Colantonio slams Microsoft, by the way—</span>that already happened <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkane-founder-slams-microsoft-for-closing-the-austin-studio-explains-why-immersive-sims-arent-mainstream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following last year's decision to close Arkane Austin</a>, his former studio. </p>

            <p>Evacuate your Deep Desert tents, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>'s latest patch enacts a timer tweak aimed at eliminating cheeky PvP zone border camping. It's also added some extra rewards to the Landsraad and switched up how goodies are distributed to PvE players.</p>
<p>This patch comes as Funcom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">continue to respond</a> to player feedback about the endgame loop, having already moved to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-devs-arent-waiting-the-deep-deserts-huge-new-pve-area-has-already-been-patched-into-the-full-game">split the </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-how-to-enter-deep-desert">Deep Desert</a> between PvP and PvE in order to placate folks who aren't a fan of the latter. Griefing's also been a big topic of debate, with ornithopters proving just as deadly as those big worms.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While Dune: Awaking <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-15-0-patch-notes/">patch 1.1.15.0</a> isn't massive, it's delivered some changes that're well worth the attention of those who've been sinking as many hours into the game as there are grains of sand on Arrakis.</p>
<p>First of all, the good news. Those who've been craving Landsraad rewards that don't depend on you getting in uber-quick and being the first to complete a task after it goes live can breathe a sigh of relief. You'll now get a "personal contribution" reward from turning in kills or deliveries on completed tasks, with the winning faction and how many guild votes were awarded staying set in stone.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Beyond that, the patch's other biggest talking point is that the delay timer you're hit with when leaving a PvP security zone has been "increased from five to 30 seconds to prevent border camping and allow PvP players to protect their area." Folks seem <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1ltph12/11150_patch_notes/">pretty split</a> at first glance as to whether this change'll be good or bad for would-be griefers, so we'll just have to see how it plays out in practice.</p>
<p>There are also a number of tweaks to crafting component, resource, and unique loot drops/spawns in the Deep Desert. "Tier 6 resources can now be collected across wider areas in the PvE part of the Deep Desert" is the headliner, and Funcom's added "an element of randomization to the respawn timer of unique loot containers" in the DD.</p>
<p>Rounding out the most noteworthy stuff to my eye, you can listen out for "a new audio alert" signaling PvP zone changes, and they claim they've fixed an exploit that somehow let you build vehicles with items from another player’s inventory.</p>
<p>Funcom have also "reduced the cases where the sandworm can push vehicles under terrain", which is good news for those keen to avoid a gitchy demise. Or maybe you liked having your Sandbike nudged into the terrifying void under the map. To each their own.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-latest-patch-takes-aim-at-pvp-border-campers-and-dishes-out-some-extra-landsraad-rewards]]></content:encoded>

            <p>One of the co-founders of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio Unknown Worlds has made a statement about the dramatic reshuffle of management at the studio, saying that it "stings" to have the game and company taken away from him by publishing overlords Krafton. He also asserts that the game is "ready for early access", but that Krafton may disagree. It doesn't explicitly answer any of the outstanding questions about what actually happened at the studio to cause the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">axing of three senior leaders last week</a>. But it does provide some clues.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For background, three chiefs at Unknown Worlds were "replaced" last week by the studio owners Krafton, who installed a new figure as CEO of the company. Co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max MacGuire, plus former CEO Ted Gill, were all summarily ousted from their positions. In their place Krafton shipped in Steve Papoutsis, a producer who has worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> series. </p>
<p>The exact reasons remain cloudy, but the language of Krafton's original press release suggested a disatisfaction with the pace at which Unknown Worlds was working. Following the power shuffle, Unknown Worlds <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-creators-offer-no-explanation-for-sudden-regime-change-instead-promise-no-loot-boxes">also released a statement</a> that asked fans to be patient while Papoutsis found his feet on the project. It didn't clear much up.</p>

</a>
</p>

<p>Now, co-founder Charlie Cleveland has spoken about the events in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/">a statement posted across social media</a>, saying that it hurts to find himself out of the studio. He writes at length about the studio's history, and significantly notes that Subnautica 2 is the second most-wishlisted game on Steam.</p>
<p>"So you can see why for Max, Ted, myself, the Unknown Worlds team, and for our community, the events of this week have been quite a shock. We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it. And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings."</p>
<p>The assertion that the game is "ready for early access" raises an eyebrow, as it seems to contradict Krafton's version of events. In their statement, they said that the studio under Papoutsis would have to commit to "clearly defined metrics and targets" presumably hitting the demanded quality by set deadlines. "This process is essential to delivering the right game at the right time," they said. They didn't mention any internal disagreement over whether the game was currently ready or not.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Krafton</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Altogether this suggests that the leadership of Unknown Worlds and their business daddies at Krafton were at loggerheads over the quality of the early access build, which was intended to release some time in 2025 with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-early-access-should-last-2-to-3-years-itll-launch-with-several-biomes-and-some-narrative">an early access life of 2-3 years</a> before hitting 1.0. Elsewhere in the statement, Cleveland talks about the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, and says: "There's no way it would've been as successful if we had waited until v1.0 before releasing it to the public." </p>
<p>This may help explain why Papoutsis was parachuted in. For context, Unknown Worlds are known for transparent and steady-paced development through early access. Papoutsis' studio Striking Distance is known for releasing a shonky shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/callisto-protocol-director-takes-responsibility-for-crunching-staff">badly affected by intense crunch</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Cleveland's statement does not go into the specifics of the falling out, beyond those assertions. So there are likely wrinkles to the drama we still don't know. His statement is mostly a nostalgic waltz through his career at the studio, which began as a group of modders. He does end with the line "this is not where the story ends", although doesn't specify if this means a new venture in video games, or something from his <a href="https://www.abyssal.co/">AI-assisted movie company</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the release schedule for Subnautica 2 itself seems to be under review. "An update to our schedule and more information, including the Early Access timeline, will be coming soon," said Unknown Worlds. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has released a special movie to celebrate the 25th anniversary of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>, but fans are still left wondering what's going on with the rumoured remake.</p>
<p>The movie is just a minute long, and is essentially a highlights reel from the game's FMV sequences, edited over a new recording of the game's iconic theme song Melodies of Life.</p>
<p>The video follows a number of other small releases in the run up to the anniversary. Back in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/official-final-fantasy-9-25th-anniversary-website-ignites-remake-hopes-once-again">Square Enix launched a 25th anniversary website</a> for the game that's slowly been updated with new artwork in celebration of the game's Japanese release on 7th July 2000 (it was released in the UK a year later in 2001).</p>

<p>New merchandise has also been released, and - perhaps most interestingly - a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5605">new prequel picture book has been released</a> from the game's event designer Kazuhiko Aoki and character designer Toshiyuki Itahana. It details how adorable black mage Vivi got his name - I won't spoil anything here.</p>
<p>So where, then, is the rumoured remake?</p>
<p>The rumour began back in 2021, as part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidia-acknowledges-leaked-pc-game-list-including-god-of-war-and-final-fantasy-7-remake">infamous Nvidia leak</a> which included a number of unreleased and unannounced Square Enix games. The leak has proven to be accurate so far, following the likes of the Chrono Cross remaster, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-real">recently revealed Final Fantasy Tactics remaster</a>. The Final Fantasy 9 remake is now the only remaining officially unannounced Final Fantasy game from the leak.</p>
<p>As on the anniversary website, a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5481">new vinyl subtitled Timeless Tales</a> is due for release later this week on 9th July - some fans believe this may be the name of the remake itself too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s latest expansion, Dawntrail, also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-patch-72-due-end-of-march-with-even-more-final-fantasy-9-references">heavily references Final Fantasy 9</a>. This could be coincidence considering the MMORPG regularly references past games, but its director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has denied remaking Final Fantasy 9.</p>
<p>With this 25th anniversary, Square Enix seems to be really pushing Final Fantasy 9. The company announced earlier this year the game had sold 8.9m units worldwide, but this is less than many others in the series, not only including renowned favourite Final Fantasy 7 and the widely released Final Fantasy 15, but also Final Fantasy 8 and 10 - the two games either side of FF9. Where was Final Fantasy 8's big 25th anniversary?</p>
<p>Released late in the PS1's lifecycle, Final Fantasy 9 launched a year after Final Fantasy 8, which proved popular for its realistic graphical style, and a year before Final Fantasy 10 on the more powerful PS2. Though critically well-received, Final Fantasy 9 hasn't always been the most popular of the series.</p>
<p>Still, a remake of the game would be great timing for Square Enix. The game's original PS1 release was seen as a callback to the origins of the series, with its more medieval setting and cartoonish art style. A remake release now - if it stayed true to the original - would parallel this callback at a time Square Enix needs it most.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy 7 Remake series</a> has proven divisive in its approach to a remake, despite some welcome modernisation, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-has-me-questioning-the-essence-of-the-series">Final Fantasy 16</a> was exemplary for some fans of Square Enix's decision to move further into action game territory.</p>
<p>A remake of Final Fantasy 9 would return the company to its turn-based roots and bring newer fans into the series with a classic remake. But at this point, Square Enix is just leaving us waiting.</p>
<p>If you're yet to play Final Fantasy 9, a remaster is already available across PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and mobile.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrates-final-fantasy-9s-25th-anniversary-so-wheres-the-rumoured-remake]]></content:encoded>

<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/ImakuniVT/status/1941912231303585925" tabindex="-1">@ImakuniVT</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fans-think-nintendo-accidentally-revealed-switch-onlines-next-wave-of-n64-games/">VGC</a>), the section of <a href="https://youtu.be/wDNg1pwrTVg?si=uw2fvNYef51CLwwT&amp;t=38">the trailer</a> showing off the app's new CRT filter has the blurred game selection screen shown below the settings screen. Playing around with layers and a little Gaussian Blur, fans have been busy identifying potential games in the background, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/forsaken">Forsaken 64</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/glover">Glover</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_smash_bros">Super Smash Bros.</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEee42ub-Hw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Looking at the post above, you might think that's a stretch, but this reply from <a href="https://x.com/NitroExists/status/1942003844927435200" tabindex="-1">@NitroExists</a> helps illustrate how people have been matching the blurred and dimmed box art from the trailer. Observe:</p>


<p>Now, does this mean all these games are definitely coming to the N64 NSO app? Not necessarily, and despite being convincing, it's also possible the matches aren't 100%. It's <em>also</em> possible the team just added placeholder art for the sake of testing and the person making the trailer assumed that no one would be able to ID the art. Even if these are correct, it still doesn't confirm an official NSO release is on the cards.</p>
<p>However, all of the suggested games are possible. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">DK64</a>'s arrival to help promote <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> on Switch 2 feels very obvious, and surely it's only a matter of time until Smash Bros. and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Melee</a> end up on the subscription service. Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/glover">Glover</a> may seem unlikely given that it's already available on the Switch eShop, but so is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/turok">Turok</a>, and that's playable via NSO.</p>
<p>And happily, Forsaken was one of the games we wished could be added in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/9-mature-games-wed-love-to-see-on-nintendo-switch-onlines-new-n64-app">a feature we worked up last year</a> when the 'Mature' app appeared. We'd love to see that one added, too.</p>
<p><em>Do you think we'll be seeing these games on NSO in the future, near or far? Let us know in the usual place.</em></p>

        <p>AI is a "bs excuse" for recent layoffs, says Raphael Colantonio</p>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Seemingly in response to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">latest round of layoffs at Microsoft and Xbox</a>, Arkane founder and WolfEye president Raphael Colantonio has <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941503596870369388">taken to socials</a> to ask why no-one is talking about "the elephant in the room", Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>Microsoft's subscription service is "an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade," Colantonio wrote, "subsidised by MS's 'infinite money'. I don't think GP can co-exist with other models, they’ll either kill everyone else, or give up". Cheers, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/in-the-wake-of-xbox-layoffs-founder-of-dishonored-and-prey-dev-arkane-slams-game-pass-why-is-no-one-talking-about-the-elephant-in-the-room">IGN</a>.</p>

<p>Colantonio then brought up Xbox's public denial and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-admits-game-pass-cannibalizes-sales">later admission</a> - in documents related to the Activision Blizzard merger - that Game Pass impacts direct game sales. He also suggested that Microsoft's stated goal of <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/behind-microsofts-layoffs-a-new-attitude-shaped-by-ai/">cutting costs to invest heavily in AI</a> was a "bs excuse" for the layoffs.</p>
<p>It's worth noting here that Microsoft laid off around 2,500 workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">across</a> its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsofts-mass-layoffs-will-affect-starfield-halo-infinite-and-gears-of-war-developers">gaming</a> division in 2024, with more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-is-laying-off-even-more-of-its-staff-with-potentially-almost-7000-workers-at-risk">across the company this year</a>, prior to the current round. It seems unlikely investments into AI have played no part in numbers like this. A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/">recent Wired report</a> (paywalled) implies significant correlation between studios adopting AI tools for specific disciplines before laying off workers that specialise in those areas, as was the case with ActiBlizz laying off artists after putting up Call Of Duty GenAI cosmetics for sale.</p>
<p>According to Colantonio's own math, however, the funds sunk into Game Pass are still significant. "When a deal is too good, there is a reason," he wrote. "They are still not profitable after 8 years, they are still in customer acquisition phase, hoping one day the subscription revenue will be &gt; to the investments ($100B in acquisitions+licensing+dev costs). Do the math, they have 35m subscribers, including the $1."</p>
<p>As IGN note, Xbox don't report on the financials of Game Pass in detail, though they have shared that "Xbox content and services grew 8% year-over-year, which was in part due to growth in Xbox Game Pass. PC Game Pass revenue increased 45% year-over-year".</p>
<p>"What *might* happen once MS has won: the games will start to suck and your sub will go up," Colantonio wrote. "Why? Because the current amazing deal you have is subsided by MS bleeding money into it with the hope they’ll kill the competition".</p>
<p>This line of argument echoes <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/former-xbox-executive-nervous-about-industry-impact-of-game-pass-3231799">comments made by former Xbox exec Ed Fries</a> on a podcast in 2022. "Game Pass scares me because there’s a somewhat analogous thing called Spotify that was created for the music business,” Fries said. “So we have to be careful we don’t create the same system in the game business. These markets are more fragile than people realise.”</p>
<p>Josh Herrman of The Intelligencer <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/10/spotify-is-eating-the-entire-music-business.html">described Spotify's 2022 financials</a> as a "weird, loser-take-all outcome — which happens from time to time in tech, where dominant firms are allowed to bleed money for years in pursuit of long-term sector domination". The music streaming giant has been long-criticised for giving artists the raw end of the deal, leaving them to rely on touring and merch sales for an income.</p>
<p>Whether this translates directly to games is contested, however. Here's a<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167811625000187"> 2025 study for the International Journal of Research in Marketing</a> arguing that Game Pass and PS Plus have "limited impact on video game revenue (contrary to the cannibalizing effects observed in the music, movie and TV industry)."</p>
<p>"Only the gamers like it because the offer is too good to be true," said Colantonio, "but eventually even gamers will hate it when they realize the effects on the games.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-pass-will-either-kill-everyone-else-or-give-up-says-dishonored-and-prey-dev-arkane-founder]]></content:encoded>

Jigglypuff gets a billion-year-old variant named Scream Tail, for example, while the Legendary Terrakion gets a new variant, Iron Boulder, that looks like an anime robot.

Fans have been quick to point to past teases for Mega Mewtwo and fan-favorite Ghost critter Mimikyu in previous annual artworks, only to not materialise. But Pokémon Go's developer has seemingly become wiser to these expectations — and indeed Paradox Pokémon are the logical choice for the next big selection of creatures to join the game, after the recent debut of Gigantamax creatures, the fully-launched Ultra Beasts and almost all Mega Pokémon now being available. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other teases in this year's artwork include Gigantamax Butterfree, which fans expect to debut soon, Mega Metagross, one of the game's last remaining Mega species yet to turn up, and a player avatar receiving a virtual thumbs up (which some fans are taking as a sign that remote communication or even remote trading might be arriving). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's Zygarde, star of the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> for Switch and Switch 2.

            <p>Are you pretty happy right now? Well, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2, the follow-up to that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> Netflix anime, will make you nice and miserable when it arrives.</p>
<p>CD Projekt <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51617/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-is-now-in-production">revealed</a> this past weekend that the upcoming series, which'll deliver a fresh standalone tale set in Night City, is currently in production. Animation studio Trigger have returned to work on Edgerunners 2, with Kai Ikarashi directing and Bartosz Sztybor wearing many hats as writer/showrunner/producer. Right, from here on there'll be spoilers for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-finally-slides-its-futuristic-motorbike-onto-netflix-today">first Cyberpunk Edgerunners series</a>, so you've been warned.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We didn't get a release date for the 10 episode series as part of this official announcement that Edgerunners 2 is in the works, with CD Projekt only revealing that it'll be hitting Netflix "in the future". Which, er, yeah. There was a teaser, though, which was very clear that the first Edgerunners series' protagonist has definitely kicked the bucket.</p>
<p>"David is dead," it declares amid shots of Cyberpunky anime people doing Cyberpunky anime things, "but Night City lives on." Thankfully, there was a bit more info than that, with multiple hat wearer Sztybor outlining that you can expect "a raw, real chronicle of redemption and revenge, something unlike what we’ve done before."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>That said, one aspect of the first series will be definitely coming to Edgerunners 2, with the writer telling folks on the Tweeter to "be prepared for sadness". Yep, Edgerunners famously wasn't afraid to leave you feeling like you'd just been kicked in the cybernuts and exposed to massive amounts of onion chopping, and you'd better get ready for something like that again.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2503793299">the panel</a> that featured the Edgerunners 2 announcement, Sztybor <a href="https://x.com/sztybor_writes/status/1941300471546904696">outlined his approach to human stories in dystopian worlds</a> with some all-time quotes. Are you Polish? Thoughts on the below welcome:</p>
<blockquote>We're the company from Poland. I'm from Poland. People in Poland are sad. They are born sad, they die sad, so I just wanted to make the whole world sad...when people are sad, I'm a bit happy.</blockquote>
<p>So there you go, start stocking up on tissues and maybe setting aside some time to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-mod-literally-called-weeee-lets-you-leave-your-flat-via-a-big-slide-like-a-bin-batman">slide</a> into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-seeing-more-players-than-it-has-since-launch">five thousandth Cyberpunk 2077 playthrough</a> once CD Projekt release that final, final, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">final patch</a> they recently pushed back.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-gets-its-first-teaser-and-youd-better-be-prepared-for-sadness]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last week was a week of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">cancellations, layoffs and general immiseration</a>, so let's attempt to bless this one with some introductory dad jokes.</p>
<p>Did you hear about the femme fatale who had to phone tech support? You see, her legs wouldn't quit. Did you hear about the femme fatale who had to phone <em>Minecraft</em> tech support? You see, her logs wouldn't cut. Did you hear about the femme fatale with a very high ping who had to withdraw from a Counter-Strike tournament? You see, her lags wouldn't qualify her for competing in a professional esport. True enough, all of these witticisms are an offence against nature and you should write better ones in the comments. But first, let us speak of new PC games - and PC gaming news.</p><!--more-->
<ul>
<h2>Monday 7th July</h2>
<li>Time-poor players rejoice, for annual speedrunning festival <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/">Summer Games Done Quick</a> is now underway. It got started on Sunday, actually, but today is when the any%ing begins in earnest. Viewer donations go to Doctors Without Borders - they've rustled up around $179,000 so far.</li>
<h2>Tuesday 8th July</h2>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790160/Missile_Command_Delta/">Missile Command Delta</a> is Missile Command but turn-based and played inside a game in which you explore a sinister, puzzle-filled base. Someday, one of these batshit Atari revivo-splicings will stick the landing. Will 8th July be that someday? Or will it simply be the first day of <a href="https://www.developconference.com/">Develop</a> in Brighton, the UK games industry's annual mini-GDC and/or shady late night poker game?</li>
<h2>Wednesday 9th July</h2>
<li>Nothing really catches my eye today, so I'm going to steal a release from Thursday 10th: teampunk punkshooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mycopunk">Mycopunk</a>, which is sort of Destiny but set in a mouldy scrapyard.</li>
<h2>Thursday 10th July</h2>
<li>Let us plumb some depths. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/occlude">Occlude</a>, you play baleful transmogrifications of Solitaire to unlock access to an occult archive. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everdeep-aurora">Everdeep Aurora</a>, you are a bright-eyed drillcat tunnelling through a bountiful underground Game Boy world. If you're more builder than burrower, there are archipelagoes to decorate in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/islanders-new-shores-is-the-follow-up-to-2019s-gentlest-town-builder">Islanders: New Shores</a>.</li>
<h2>Friday 11th July</h2>
<li>Time to drag a small child kicking and screaming through the snow in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3775050/DOGWALK/">Dogwalk</a>. Or send troops screaming and possibly kicking into alien hives via banks of datafeeds in autobattler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2983410/Xenopurge/">Xenopurge</a>. Or watch Tony Hawk fall kicking and screaming off his skateboard in the remake du jour, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>. There is no kicking and screaming in turn-based mech strategy sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3415580/Death_Ring_Second_Impact/">Death Ring: Second Impact</a>, I think, unless it's one of those awful Evangelion situations where the mechs transmit battle damage to their pilots.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you hear about the femme fatale who had to take her pond birds back to the petshop? You see, her Lake Ducks wouldn't quack. Did you hear about the femme fatale who went bankrupt? You see, her long shot investments wouldn't quadruple. Did you hear about the femme fatale who had to call off her Roman-themed drinking party? You see, her legionnaires wouldn't quaff. Oh god, I can't stop. Somebody make me stop.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-tony-hawk-eerie-cat-miners-and-all-the-speedrunning-you-can-eat]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Game Pass - Microsoft's subscription service across Xbox and PC that offers members a catalogue of games and other perks - is "unsustainable" and "damaging" the industry.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941503596870369388">Arkane Studios founder Raphael Colantonio</a>, who shared his thoughts on "the elephant in the room" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">following last week's layoffs at Microsoft</a>.

<p>"I think Game Pass is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidised by [Microsoft's] 'infinite money', but at some point reality has to hit," Colantonio, whose works include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> and Prey, wrote on social media.</p>
<p>"I don't think [Game Pass] can co-exist with other models, they'll either kill everyone else, or give up."</p>
<p>Colantonio's observations were spotted by Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who said the "most vocal concern" from within his own network was: "What happens when all that money runs out?"</p>
<p>Douse said this was "one of the main economic reasons people I know haven't shifted to its business model", stating "the infinite money thing never made any sense". In response, Colantonio said he agreed with Douse, adding: "I'm fed up with all the bs they fed us at first like 'don't worry, it doesn't impact the sales', only to admit years later that it totally does."</p>
<p>The duo spoke about the "cannibalisation" of sales, with Douse stating that he recognised that for "smaller teams with new or riskier" titles, getting their game onto Game Pass does help minimise a certain level of risk. However, he personally favours "Sony's 'lifecycle management'" way of doing things.</p>
<p>"Yeah, the only way [Game Pass] can co-exist without hurting everyone is for the back catalogue," <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1941517481463701744">Colantonio replied</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1942054157566795931">separate exchange</a> following his initial post, Colantonio said he could appreciate why gamers like Microsoft's subscription model, calling it a "great deal" for consumers. However, "the maths don't work for [Game Pass], it only works because [Microsoft] injects billions into it to make it a good deal for the players... for now".</p>
<p>The Arkane Studios founder closed: "That's only my opinion, I'm respectful, be respectful."</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/07/maestro-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/maestro-review.1237071/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Maestro VR is a rhythm game with a pretty big difference. Instead of wafting around lightsabers, shooting targets or hitting drums, you’re stood in front of a crowd of people wielding musical instruments at your direction. With a conductor’s baton in your right hand and the ability to cue instruments and sections with your left, I’m sure the leads of the string sections are quite glad you don’t have weapons… heck, thanks to hand tracking you might not even have controllers!</p>
<p><iframe title="MAESTRO: THE COMPLETE EDITION - LIV TRAILER!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D75YnBjWQ98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Inevitably the game begins with a lengthy tutorial that is essential to understanding the experience – this isn’t Beat Saber, where holding a lightsaber and seeing boxes with arrows and scary red walls is self explanatory. Without this tutorial you might be able to figure out the more obvious bits like tempo – moving your baton to the arrows is simple enough – but you’ll probably be a little confused about why there are glowing circles, not knowing that you should point at them with your left hand to cue the musicians. Raising and lowering levels for crescendos and diminuendos with your left hand flat, palm up or down, respectively, also isn’t obvious unless you’ve played or conducted a real orchestra.</p>


<p>This tutorial is given to you by the theater’s librarian, a faintly sarcastic man who looks a bit like a vampire in a courtroom thanks to his pallid skin and white wig. This guy will pop up between performances to give you some champagne, macarons, and anything you’ve unlocked – additional difficulties for the song you’ve just completed for example, or a new baton or environment to perform in.</p>


<p>Once you’ve completed the tutorial, you’re free to try conducting some of the musical pieces in the game. There’s fifteen in the base game, featuring absolute bangers like Beethoven’s 5th Symphony, Prokofiev’s Dance of the Knights, and Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries. It’s not all classical though, with a few jazzier additions to the tracklist like Sing, Sing, Sing by Louis Prima and Levy’s Whiplash, which are particularly satisfying to play due the faster tempo. There are also DLC packs available that add some crowd pleasers – how about the intro theme to Game of Thrones? The Bridge of Khazad Dum, from the Lord of the Rings, or Duel of the Fates from Star Wars, complete with a tiny lightsaber baton!</p>
<p>These aren’t all available from the start, most of them being unlocked as you complete the ones you start with, and they’re all available with three different difficulties as well. This will come as a relief because Hard mode earns its name here, with a significant increase in multitasking, by which I mean tempo with your right hand whilst also cueing or crescendoing with your left, which is very difficult to get used to.</p>

<p>After you’ve had some time to get to grips with it, Maestro feels impressive. It’s challenging and incredibly satisfying. Most of you won’t have ever raised a crescendo with your left hand, palm upwards, and closed the hand to stop an entire orchestra playing all at once. It’s honestly hard to describe how good that feels, or how bad it feels to miss something and mess up In the Hall of the Mountain King with an off or out of time note. I’s tragic. It’s cliched by now, but I do feel like a conductor whilst playing, even though I keep pouring champagne all over the poor librarian’s head whilst eating digital macarons between performances.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not really a conductor, so I can’t speak to the specific of how accurate the actual conducting of these songs is to the reality. You’re not having to read a full musical score, but it absolutely feels like&nbsp;every shred of footage you’ve seen where a conductor is waving their arms around wildly in time to the music.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest difference between Maestro and reality is that in reality, the orchestra likely isn’t dressed as a barbarian horde, performing against the backdrop of a burning revolution, or being conducted with a tiny lightsaber. You unlock these outfits, locations and batons as you progress – my favourite being at the foot of a hill with a very large, creepy mansion on it – and they help add a little more to the visual style. The game looks pretty good, with musicians that are detailed and surprisingly atmospheric locations, but the audience watching you always looks very samey, and is always sat in the same concert half. It would have been neat to have the audience transported to these wild locations as well as the orchestra.</p>
<p>Then there’s hand tracking, which blew my mind. While I initially played with normal PSVR 2 Sense controllers, like some kind of VR caveman, i put the controllers down for the second play session and then my actual hands were in the game. Just…there, being tracked by the cameras in the headset. Admittedly, there’s the slightest little bit of added lag that makes playing on Hard a bit too difficult, and you need to keep your hands in front of you so they don’t disappear, but this is the kind of thing that teenage me dreamt about. Rejoice, for we are truly in the future.</p>

<p>In general, I can’t tell if the game is a touch too forgiving, or if it sometimes registers cues that you’ve missed. I’ve often found that it will trigger musical cues when I’ve missed them, registering my left hand as pointing when it isn’t, but there is some generous timing to ensure that music won’t be interrupted if you’re early, though your score will be lower.&nbsp;If your score drops too low whilst playing, the performance will end whilst the audience throws rotten tomatoes at you, after which you can throw them back because this is a VR game and chaotic shenanigans are VR’s mouldy bread and gone-off butter.</p>

According to one employee who spoke to Irish outlet <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/100-staff-laid-off-galway-romero-games-6753674-Jul2025/">The Journal</a> (the studio is based in Galway), Romero Games have now closed, via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/romero-games-reportedly-met-with-microsoft-just-a-day-before-the-publisher-pulled-funding-for-the-studio-and-there-was-no-mention-of-the-decision-that-put-over-100-people-out-of-work/">PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p>The closure has affected 100 workers, writer The Journal, with one anonymous staff member calling it "a big shock" - especially since they'd had meetings with "the publisher" the day before. While the publisher aren't named directly, former staff have <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346499500342935553/">mentioned Microsoft cuts</a> in their announcements.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The anonymous staffer had "suspected something might be coming given recent layoffs at Microsoft," write the Journal. But, as echoed in Romero Games's statement that they'd "hit every milestone on time, consistently received high praise, and easily passed our internal gates", they assumed the project was progressing well.</p>
<p>“It seemed so far away for us. The title was pretty well developed at the time,” the anonymous staffer told The Journal. For now, they say, the project is "completely closed, and the studio is closed", though add that they're still "trying to find other ways of funding the project."</p>
<p>The unnamed FPS has "already had significant interest", <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346939512960299010/">wrote</a> chief technical officer Keith O'Conor in a LinkedIn post offering hiring recommendations for former staff. He described the interest as "really heartening… but right now our priority is making sure our people are taken care of".</p>
<p>John Romero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/john-romeros-making-a-mysterious-new-fps-in-unreal-engine-5">announced the shooter in 2022</a>, a new IP made in Unreal Engine 5. Details have remained scant since. Prior to this, Romero's most recent new FPS project was his and Adrian Carmack's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blackroom-romero-carmack">Blackroom</a> - a game full of "ruined Victorian mansions", "wild west ghost towns" and "treacherous pirate galleons", itself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/john-romero-kickstarter-cancelled-for-gameplay-demo">cancelled in 2016</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/romero-games-have-completely-closed-doors-but-theres-still-hope-for-the-doom-creators-new-fps]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to Japanese analysts, the Nintendo Switch 2 will remain scarcely available in global stores until at least next Spring. As <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Media-Entertainment/Nintendo-Switch-2-likely-to-remain-scarce-until-next-spring-analysts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by Nikkei, Toyo Securities senior analyst Hideki Yasuda and UBS Securities analyst Zhai Yijia estimate that the console's first-month sales following the June 6 launch might be around 6 million units.</p>



<p>Yasuda reckons that, even with the limited supply, the Nintendo Switch 2 could reach 20 million units sold by the end of this fiscal year (March 2026), while Yijia is a bit more conservative with his 18 million units. Regardless, these goals would outperform the original Switch by 20% to 30%.</p>



<p>Yiija is also more conservative in his long-term outlook on the console's sales:</p>



<p><em>Initial sales are higher than those of the Switch and Sony's PlayStation 5, but this should not be seen simply as an increase in demand. Those consoles suffered from semiconductor shortages at the time of their release that limited production, curtailing supply. It will be difficult to surpass the cumulative sales of the Switch.</em></p>



<p>His colleague Yasuda is more optimistic:</p>



<p><em>It is overwhelmingly popular compared to past game consoles, and consoles that have a strong initial response tend to continue to have high demand.</em></p>



<p>Market analysis firm DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 could sell over 100 million units by the end of 2029, which would definitely keep it on track to surpass the original console over time.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Nintendo has commented on the Switch 2 price, with President Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stating</a> that the company is evaluating the extent to which the pricing may be a barrier for certain consumers, especially the younger ones:</p>



<p><em>We believe the pricing of Nintendo Switch 2 is appropriate for the gaming experience it offers,<br>and what is most important is to provide entertaining experiences that demonstrate the value to<br>consumers. To achieve this goal, we have incorporated various features into Nintendo Switch 2.<br>It is true that Nintendo Switch 2 has a higher price point than our past gaming systems. We are<br>creating various opportunities outside of our gaming systems for young children to engage with<br>Nintendo characters and game worlds, with one of the ultimate goals being that they will eventually<br>play on our gaming systems. We are closely monitoring to what degree the price of the system<br>might become a barrier.</em></p>

A sudden dismemberment murder of the leader of a religious nation that advocates an apocalyptic ideology… Five <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,386 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure games</a> are combined into one, centered around a suspenseful story full of mystery and intrigue.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>“168 remaining until the end of the world…”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Humanity is approaching its end.</p><p>In a world steeped in despair and chaos, a strange religious organization called Shuten Order emerges, yearning for the end of humanity. The group rapidly gains followers, eventually forming a small nation state called Shuten.</p><p>Tragedy strikes during the grand festival celebrating their nation’s founding—the leader of the Shuten Order is murdered. Soon after, the protagonist awakens with no memory, greeted by two self-proclaimed “angels”. They reveal a shocking truth: the protagonist is the murdered Founder, revived by divine power. However, the resurrection is incomplete—their memories are gone, and their life limited to a mere four days.</p><p>To survive, the protagonist must overcome “God’s trial”: identify and kill their murderer.</p><p>With the clock ticking, the protagonist, given the alias Rei, dives into the tumultuous city as a detective. The suspects? Five ministers of the Shuten Order. There’s no time to investigate them all. Choices must be made, and the pursuit of truth demands sacrifice.</p><p>Who killed the Founder? For what reason? Can the mission be fulfilled before time runs out?</p><p>Thus begins a high-stakes, four-day hunt for the truth.</p><p><strong>Gameplay and Game Systems</strong></p><p>The story branches into five distinct routes, each tied to a suspect and completely altering the narrative and gameplay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot on the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">the layoffs that have swept through Xbox</a>, the founder of Microsoft-owned Arkane Studios has hit out at Game Pass, whose subscription model he called “unsustainable.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raphael Colantonio, who founded the Dishonored and Prey developer and served as its president before leaving in 2017 to start <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/weird-west">Weird West</a> maker WolfEye Studios, <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941503596870369388" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media to ask</a>: “Why is no-one talking about the elephant in the room? Cough cough (Gamepass).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked to expand on his thoughts on Game Pass, which Weird West launched straight into as a day one title in March 2022, Colantonio said: “I think Gamepass is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by MS’s ‘infinite money,’ but at some point reality has to hit. I don’t think GP can co-exist with other models, they’ll either kill everyone else, or give up.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Colantonio’s comment sparked a vociferous debate about the pros and cons of Game Pass in industry terms as well as for the customer. Microsoft's subscription service has been called many things over the years: the death of the video game industry; the savior of smaller developers who benefit greatly from payments made by Microsoft to secure their games; and everything in between. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-boss-jim-ryan-many-publishers-believe-xbox-game-pass-is-value-destructive">During the great Xbox FTC trial to decide the fate of Microsoft's $69 billion aquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard</a>, then PlayStation boss Jim Ryan claimed that he had talked to "all the publishers" and that, unanimously, they all hated Game Pass "because it is value destructive." He also said Microsoft "appears to be losing a lot of money on it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in 2021, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-sustainable-phil-spencer">Xbox boss Phil Spencer countered Game Pass doomsayers</a>, saying: "I know there's a lot of people that like to write [that] we're burning cash right now for some future pot of gold at the end. No. Game Pass is very, very sustainable right now as it sits. And it continues to grow."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was four years ago. What about now, in the wake of cuts that have seen Rare's Everwild, the Perfect Dark reboot, and an unannounced MMO in the works at developer behind The Elder Scrolls Online all canceled?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colantonio’s comments were backed by a number of industry peers, including <a href="https://x.com/joekreiner/status/1941661474356687099" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the former VP of biz dev at Epic Games</a>. Michael Douse, publishing director at Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian, <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1941515662037483920" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that the biggest concern right now revolves around what happens when all that money runs out. This, Douse added, is “one of the main economic reasons people I know haven't shifted to its business model. The infinite money thing never made any sense.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(It’s worth noting that Baldur’s Gate 3 has so far not launched in Game Pass or PlayStation Plus.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colantonio then ridiculed Microsoft’s insistence that launching games into Game Pass did not impact sales, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-admits-game-pass-cannibalizes-sales">only to later admit the contrary</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1941517481463701744" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a> to to say he prefers the Sony way of doing things. Sony’s PlayStation Plus policy is to keep first-party games off the subscription service at launch, only adding them some time later. That’s why you won’t see this year’s Sony’s Ghost of Yotei launch straight into PS Plus, but you will see Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 as a day one Game Pass launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The economics never made sense, but at the same time I do recognize that for smaller teams with new or riskier IPs it helped derisk,” Douse said. “Much prefer Sony's 'lifecycle management' strategy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah, the only way GP can co-exist without hurting everyone is for the back catalogue," Colantonio concluded.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/behind-microsofts-layoffs-a-new-attitude-shaped-by-ai/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reports have indicated that Microsoft’s layoffs were more about the company’s high-profile push into AI</a> than any failing with the gaming business, but Colantonio <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941518787037319382" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested</a> this was “a bs excuse.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He then went on to insist that “the maths don’t work for most publishers/devs nor for Xbox once they stop investing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colantonio was also asked why Microsoft would continue to push Game Pass if it were unsustainable, even now, eight years after it launched. He responded to say that Game Pass isn’t profitable, Microsoft is still in the "customer acquisition phase", and the company hopes that one day, subscription revenue will make its significant investment pay off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colantonio explained that Game Pass on its own cannot be considered profitable because you need to factor in the billions of dollars Microsoft has spent acquiring content for the subscription service, and he includes Bethesda owner ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard in that equation. “It’s a spreadsheet trick where they don’t put that detail in a profit and loss section, but instead in the amortization over time,” he claimed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game Pass is of course an incredible deal for the gamer that lets subscribers dip in and out of a long list of games for a fraction of the cost of buying those games standalone. Game Pass is often said to be too good to be true because of how cheap it is relative to what it offers. When you throw in every game Microsoft has on its books as a day one Game Pass launch (Call of Duty included), the deal feels even better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Colantonio, though, the Game Pass deal is “too good.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What *might* happen once MS has won: the games will start to suck and your sub will go up,” he added. “Why? Because the current amazing deal you have is subsided by MS bleeding money into it with the hope they’ll kill the competition, but once they manage to do it, things will get real.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: “... it’s a long game that involves throwing a tsunami at the entire ecosystem of the industry. Only the gamers like it because the offer is too good to be true, but eventually even gamers will hate it when they realize the effects on the games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft does not report on the success of Game Pass either way in financial terms. Indeed, its reporting on its gaming business is vague at best. In its last financial report (for the quarter ending March 31, 2025), Microsoft said Xbox content and services grew 8% year-over-year, which was in part due to growth in Xbox Game Pass. PC Game Pass revenue increased 45% year-over-year. But we don’t have an updated figure for how many subscribers Game Pass has, nor how much money it brings in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an April interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-phil-spencer-minecraft-movie-fallout-season-2-1236352653/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer was asked how he views Game Pass’s ongoing role in the larger Xbox business. Spencer replied to say he thinks about Game Pass as “a healthy option for certain people,” but admitted “it’s not for everybody.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our biggest areas of growth right now are PC and Cloud, which makes sense, since consoles, all up, are a good business, they’re an established business, but they’re not really a growing segment in gaming," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So we’ve got good growth on PC, we’ve got growth on Cloud, in terms of users and hours. And console continues to be a really healthy part of Game Pass. But there isn’t a unique need for Game Pass to be the only way for people to play. If everybody who’s a Game Pass subscriber instead decided to buy their games, that’s good for the business as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For me, I look at Game Pass as a healthy option for certain people. It’s not for everybody. If you play one or two games a year, Game Pass probably isn’t the right business model for you, you should just buy those two games, and that would make total sense. But I want you to have the choice. So we remain focused on everything that’s on Game Pass is also available to buy. We’re making those games available to buy in more places.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I look at the overall hours of people who are playing on Xbox, playing our games, and that’s a number that continues to grow fairly substantially, and that’s really the metric I think about for success. And Game Pass has been an important part of that, but I don’t try to solve for Game Pass specifically on its own. It’s kind of part of the equation for Xbox finding new players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
