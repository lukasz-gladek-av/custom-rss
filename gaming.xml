		<p>SEGA has confirmed that the next game that will be getting the movie treatment will be Shinobi, which has been a dormant franchise since 2011. Shinobi follows the ninja Joe Musashi and the first game of the series released in arcades in 1987 with a home release following in 1988. Following on from that were a number of sequels and spin offs, with the last Shinobi game releasing in 2011 for the Nintendo 3DS. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/08/sega-is-making-new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-shinobi-golden-axe-streets-of-rage-more/">A new Shinobi game</a> has been announced, but there are no details of what to expect with that.</p>

<p>The Shinobi movie is going to be directed by Sam Hargrave, who is most well known for directing Extraction and Extraction 2. He has also been a stunt and fight co-ordinator in a lot of blockbusters including some MCU movies like Avengers: Endgame, as well as Atomic Blonde. Ken Kobayashi has been called in to write the Shinobi screenplay, and his credits include Marvel’s Hit-Monkey and Sunny.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/12/09/shinobi-review-3ds/">Shinobi Review (3DS)</a></h2>
<p>In our last Shinobi review, Dan said, <em>“I’m aware that some of the cons come across as me being a bit of a whining baby. However, if Shinobi was designed so that every death was your fault I would be more than happy to plough on, honing my skills.As it stands though most deaths are caused by some cheap, annoying sequence of events like the one I described earlier, and when this is coupled with a control scheme that never feels right it drags a decent game down to something that feels totally average.”</em></p>

			<p>The third-person Battle Royale shooter Off the Grid is now available for free early access for those on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via the Epic Games Store, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/gunzilla-games-off-the-grid-a-battle-royale-game-set-in-a-cyberpunk-world/">announced by Gunzilla</a>, the title developer. Off the Grid takes you on a journey through Teardrop Island in a cyberpunk world that has been created in collaboration with Neill Blomkamp. Blomkamp has directed movies such as District 9, Chappie, and, more recently, Gran Turismo. This is his first venture in the video game world, and he has helped to create the dystopian cyberpunk world that players will get to explore in the Extraction Royale.</p>
<p>Off The Grid features both PvP and PvE elements, with the worlds colliding to create "the most extreme Battle Royale ever!" In this game, players will fight for their lives on a tropical island that has a dark and intense history of corporate warfare. Currently, there are a few locations, weapons, limbs, and game modes available for players to look through and utilize in the game while they're exploring Teardrop Island.</p>
<p>In this game, players are responsible for their survival by building up their character with high-value gear from the island, such as interchangeable cybernetic limbs mid-battle. There are plenty of cyber limbs and hundreds of weapon combinations to try out, making it a game that anyone can win. Alongside the usage of cybernetic limbs and weapon combinations, players will have devastating abilities that they can utilize, to ensure that they can climb to the top. As listed on the Off The Grid website, there are currently<a href="https://gameoffthegrid.com/#game-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> over 30 cyberlimbs</a> that players can use, each featuring their own unique abilities.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of Early Access, Off The Grid now has a new 4K trailer that showcases just over two minutes of footage, with cinematics and gameplay included. For those who are interested in the PvP prospect of the game, players will get to participate in a 150-player melee, where loot is available, and you can trade items with others to ensure that you get the best possible build.</p>
<p><iframe title="OFF THE GRID | Early Access Trailer - 4K" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sZ1iA9LgQPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PvE aspect of the game features an extensive 6-hour narrative campaign, where you'll be able to complete the story while other players take part in a Battle Royale around you. In the campaign, you'll have to take on jobs for the three video game companies while searching through Teardrop Island to uncover its dark secrets and help Cobra uncover the missing pieces of his past.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-reveals-interactive-alarm-clock-alarmo-coming-early-2025.1004925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-alarmo-interactive-alarm-clock<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced Alarmo, a new interactive alarm clock full of Nintendo-themed sounds and visuals. It's due to land early next year, although you'll want to sign up for Nintendo Switch Online if you want an early chance at grabbing it.</p>
<p>According to a press release, Alarmo is "an interactive alarm clock designed to add some Nintendo charm to your home and your daily routine".</p>
<p>It's got a motion sensor that responds to movement; Nintendo says you can snooze it "with motion alone", and you can stop it simply by getting out of bed, with no button presses required.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-alarmo-clock-in-situ.jpg?itok=yPVZzlik 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-alarmo-clock-in-situ.jpg?itok=ndFV9SDJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Alarmo is an alarm clock filled with Nintendo scenes and sounds.</figcaption></figure><p>The clock features 35 scenes inspired by five Nintendo games, and Nintendo says that you'll "experience immersive sounds and music" from the games you pick in the mornings.&nbsp;Here's the list of games that have inspired scenes and sounds on the Nintendo Alarmo.</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/super-mario-odyssey"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/splatoon-3"><em>Splatoon 3</em></a></li>
<li><em>Pikmin 4</em></li>
<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ring-fit-adventure"><em>Ring Fit Adventure</em></a></li>
</ul><p>Alarmo also lets you check how much you've moved around in your sleep via its Records function, and it features two different modes for your morning alarm: Steady and Gentle.</p>
<p>In Steady mode, the alarm will "gradually get more intense the longer you stay in bed", while Gentle "offers a more consistent intensity level". You'll have to be honest with yourself when you're picking which mode you think you'll respond to best.</p>

<p>If you'd prefer a classic alarm clock experience, you can also put Alarmo in Button Mode, which will let you hit the big button on the top to snooze the clock, just like in classic movies.</p>
<p>Linking a Nintendo Account to Alarmo will let you download extra scenes based on&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>&nbsp;</em>as well, so make sure to do that if you want to wake up to the sounds of a bustling&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>town.</p>
<p>Alarmo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">arrives early next year</a>, and it'll set you back $100 if you want one. Right now, you'll need a Nintendo Switch Online membership if you want to pick one up, but you'll also be able to buy Alarmo at Nintendo's New York store, and you won't need a membership for that.</p>
<p>You can also read more about the clock via <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-14-nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-part-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a new Nintendo Ask the Developer feature</a>, which contains an interview with the developers behind the project.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced new hardware, but anyone waiting to see what the Nintendo Switch 2 could possibly bring is going to be quite alarmed. It’s an alarm clock. Called Alarmo.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo – Wake up to a world of games!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1pDMcREd58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Alarmo will be available exclusively to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers from later this week, with wider availability coming in mid-January 2025. Pricing hasn’t been revealed just yet.</p>
<p>Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo – to give it its full name –&nbsp;is pretty fancy for an alarm clock, that’s for sure. The face is a round LCD screen, and there’s a round dial at the top that features and RGB LED… and then there’s the motion sensor to see if you’re actually getting up and out of bed.</p>
<p>Alarmo features five different game themes –&nbsp;Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 3, Pikmin 4, Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Ring Fit Adventure –&nbsp;and will play music from these games to gently wake you up with accompanying graphics on screen. However, this is an interactive alarm clock, using the motion sensor to see if you’re moving around and getting up to add various game sounds on top of the music. Rolling around will lower the music volume, and fully getting up with turn the alarm off without needing to touch it.</p>

<p>There’s a few different modes, including Gentle Mode, Firm Mode and Button Mode, depending on what works for your morning routine. At night, it can play Sleepy Sounds to help you drift off. Your get-up-ability will also be tracked and rated (after a software update).</p>
<p>This is Wi-Fi connected (of course), with Mario Kart 8 and Animal Crossing themes coming down the line.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hotline-miami-2-australian-playstation-store<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hotline Miami 2&nbsp;</em>has been removed from the Australian PlayStation Store after Sony apparently remembered that the game was refused a classification from the country's ratings board.</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://press-start.com.au/news/playstation/2024/10/09/hotline-miami-2-has-been-removed-from-the-australian-playstation-store-after-mistakenly-being-available/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Press Start</a>, Australian PlayStation users have been receiving notices informing them that the game is no longer available for purchase or download since it "has not received a proper rating from the Australian Classification Board".</p>
<p>Apparently,&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami 2&nbsp;</em>was made available via PlayStation Plus Extra a few months back, and it was also released in Australia as part of a collection containing the two games, but it seems nobody bothered to make sure the second game's rating was intact first.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hotline-miami-2-australia-playstation-kill.jpg?itok=knI5c4vS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hotline-miami-2-australia-playstation-kill.jpg?itok=pUDQz9Zr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hotline Miami 2&nbsp;</em>was refused classification in Australia.</figcaption></figure><p>Those who downloaded the game directly as part of the aforementioned collection are getting a notice that confirms a refund, which could take a month or two to appear on a bank statement.</p>
<p>If you downloaded&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami 2&nbsp;</em>via PlayStation Plus, on the other hand, you'll get a more curt message that simply confirms the game has been removed from the lineup, as well as the libraries of those who downloaded it.</p>
<p><em>Hotline Miami 2&nbsp;</em>was originally released in 2015. It was <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number" rel="noopener" target="_blank">refused classification</a> by the Australian game ratings board, and <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2021/08/a-look-back-at-some-of-the-games-australia-has-banned/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to Kotaku</a>, that refusal was due to the presence of a scene that depicted sexual assault.</p>
<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami&nbsp;</em>wasn't refused classification, though; it was <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/hotline-miami" rel="noopener" target="_blank">granted an MA15+ rating</a> for "strong impact" violence, as well as "mild impact" drug use and "moderate impact" themes and language.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hotline-miami-australia-classification.jpg?itok=MaR_hgOe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hotline-miami-australia-classification.jpg?itok=zg1i5Tj4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can still pick up the original&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami&nbsp;</em>in Australia, assuming you're over 15.</figcaption></figure><p>The Australian classifications board is known for its strict attitudes towards games. Many games have been refused classification in Australia, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rimworld-console-version-leaked-by-australian-ban"><em>RimWorld</em></a>&nbsp;(which was later <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rimworld-unbanned-in-australia-classified-r18">unbanned and classified R18+</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-final-cut-refused-classification-in-australia"><em>Disco Elysium: The Final Cut</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-teams-medium-banned-in-australia"><em>The Medium</em></a>, developed by&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake studio Bloober.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like if you're in Australia, you won't be able to play&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami 2&nbsp;</em>on your PlayStation anytime soon. At least you can still pick up the original, though!</p>

A motion sensor lets you snooze it by moving your arm or shut it off entirely by getting out of bed. It can even spy on you while you sleep to tell you how much you’re tossing and turning. Pre-orders for Switch Online subscribers are available starting today, but the devices themselves won’t ship out until early 2025. </p><p>Mario’s not the only one who will be nudging you to get off your lazy ass and start earning those coins. Alarmo will feature 35 scenes taken from games like <em>Splatoon 3</em>, <em>Pikmin 4</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, and more to start. Later, scenes from <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> and <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>will become available as free updates later on. </p><p> There are two main modes for Alarmo. The first is called “Steady Mode,” an alarm that gradually gets more and more intense the longer you stay in bed. The other is called “Gentle Mode” and provides a more consistent level of gaming cacophony. There are also buttons if you’re old like me and don’t want to put your wake-up routine in the hands of a robot. </p><p>Nintendo’s website walks you through a standard Alarmo sequence. Just prior to the alarm time, a character will pop up on the screen. Then, at the allotted time, sounds will begin playing. Eventually a character like Peach will arrive to patiently coax you awake. Snoozing will repeat the cycle, but if you keep snoozing, eventually Bowser will show up and lecture you on your poor grindset.</p><p>Alarmo certainly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251736/nintendo-mmwave-device-24ghz-fcc-filing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251736/nintendo-mmwave-device-24ghz-fcc-filing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">looks like it’s the mystery hardware</a></span> that FCC filings were recently discovered for.

<p>In September, an FCC filing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-device-filed-with-fcc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed a device</a> was coming from Nintendo. Just weeks later, that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">device has been revealed</a> as Nintendo has officially announced its interactive alarm clock called Alarmo.</p>



<p>This new clock features a number of sounds and scenes from various Nintendo games while also reacting to body movement.</p>



<p>“Introduce a little play to your wake-up routine with Alarmo, the interactive alarm clock from Nintendo,” Nintendo said. “Start the day off right with fun animations, sounds, and characters from some of your favorite games. You can even snooze the alarm with gestures and end it by getting out of bed, thanks to Alarmo’s motion sensor.”</p>



<p>Nintendo says that it has 35 scenes from five games. Those games are Pikmin 4, Ring Fit Adventure, Splatoon 3, Super Mario Odyssey, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. More alarms will be available via free updates in the future, including Mario Kart 8 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The device can be used hands free with gestures being used to snooze the alarm or simply getting out of bed to turn it off. Should you not wake up when the alarm plays, you will be “visited” by characters from the specific scene you chose.</p>



<p>“If you stay in bed too long, your alarm will get more intense and you’ll get a visit from someone more persuasive,” Nintendo says while showing Bowser as an example.</p>



<p>The clock will also track sleep patterns such as movement in your sleep.</p>



<p>Alarmo will be available in the United States and Canada in early 2025 for $100. If you are a member of Nintendo Switch Online, however, you can buy it before the general public.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Nintendo alarm clock, Alarmo? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>It has been a stunning few months for the esports industry, with many tournaments surfacing and effortlessly pulling in millions of viewers of late. In a recent report published by Esports Charts, it was shown in cold, hard numbers exactly how well the esports market did during Q3 2024, with almost ten major events netting more than one million peak concurrent viewers.</p>



<p>We’ve seen plenty of concerns in the last year or two regarding the sustainability of the esports industry, but at least viewership doesn’t seem to be struggling too much.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mobile-madness">Mobile Madness</h2>



<p>In Q3 2024, mobile games shone brightly in the esports space. Indonesia’s MPL tournament stood at the top of the table this past quarter, netting a whopping 71.1 million watch hours. This tournament has so far beaten the likes of the LCK Summer, The International, and VALORANT Champs in both hours watched <strong>and </strong>peak concurrent viewers.</p>



<p>Talking about peak viewers, almost ten tournaments his one million peak concurrent viewers in these last three months, according to data <a href="https://escharts.com/news/top-esports-events-q3-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Esports Charts</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>IEM Cologne hit 1.05 million viewers, while the Esports World Cup (the League portion of it) pulled in 1.12 million peak viewers. Up the chain, The International 2024 netted 1.5 million peak viewers, and the LCK Regional Finals caught the concurrent attention spans of 1.82 million esports fans.</p>



<p>The sweet spot was in the mobile space, though.</p>



<p>The EWC x MLBB Mid-Season Cup pulled in 2.3 million peak viewers, while the MPL Indonesia was just behind with 2.26 million viewers.</p>



<p>Time and again, mobile games are proving themselves to be a dominant force in the esports industry. Their accessibility combined with what’s typically an attractive free-to-play operating model means they’re able to capture massive audiences. While nothing will destabilise the ‘Big Three’ anytime soon, mobile games have earned their place <strong>near </strong>the podium.</p>

It's not the successor to the Switch, however: It's Alarmo, a Nintendo-themed alarm clock that uses familiar music and sounds to help you start your day.</p><p dir="ltr">Alarmo includes motion-sensing technology, which will allow users to snooze or turn off the alarm without physically touching it. The device will also keep a record of how often the user moves around during sleep, while also offering wake-up alarms in Steady and Gentle modes--Steady makes the alarm increasingly louder, while Gentle keeps it at one set volume.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-unveiled-an-alarm-clock-that-plays-mario-coin-noises-when-you-roll-over<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Nintendo has today unveiled Alarmo, an interactive alarm clock that will respond to your body's movements by playing video game sounds, thanks to its motion sensor technology.</p>
<p>On its debut this week (initially just for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, before wider availability next year), users will be able to choose from a total of 35 different alarms across five Nintendo games. These sounds include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s coin noises, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-review-a-lot-more-of-the-brilliant-same">Splatoon 3</a>'s ink splats and Zelda: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>'s Parasail music, to name three.</p>
<p>More alarm options are also said to be on the way as free updates. As for turning it off, all you have to do is get up and out of bed. <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Sound-Clock-Alarmo/Nintendo-Sound-Clock-Alarmo-2670177.html">Nintendo</a> does note that if there is more than one person in the bed, however, the alarm clock may get a little confused.</p>
<p>"Alarmo can't detect a specific person, so if two or more people are sleeping in the same bed within range of the sensor, the alarm may stop when one person gets out of bed, but restart once it detects there is still someone in bed," the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Sound-Clock-Alarmo/About-the-recommended-environment-for-your-bedroom-2670178.html">team wrote</a>. "The alarm will stop completely once everyone is out of bed." There is a button mode, though, which may be handy (literally) for those times when it's more than just you in the bed.</p>
<p>You can check out Alarmo's reveal trailer below.</p>

<p>While Alarmo is, at its core, an alarm clock, it also boasts a number of other features. For example, you will be able to check Records to find out more about your overall sleeping patterns. Additionally, it comes with a 'sleepy sounds' setting, which puts on some gentle music and such to help you relax.</p>

<p>At the other end of the scale, Alarmo also has a Firm Mode, which basically means your alarm sounds will get more intense the longer you stay lying in bed.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch Online members will be available to purchase Alarmo later this week via My Nintendo Store, ahead of its wider launch in mid-January 2025.</p>
<p>Alarmo is likely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-prepping-mystery-wireless-device-that-doesnt-look-to-be-switch-2">Nintendo's mysterious new wireless gadget</a> which popped up recently in US Federal Communications Commission filings that referenced a gadget - that wasn't <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> - which had an embedded motion sensor.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The device is called Alarmo, and it “responds to your movements,” which means you can snooze it with a gesture or stop it by actually getting out of bed. It costs $99.99 and will be available in early 2025, though Nintendo says Switch Online subscribers can <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311%2F">purchase it early right now</a>.</p><p>It appears this is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251736/nintendo-mmwave-device-24ghz-fcc-filing">the mystery Nintendo gadget</a> that hit the Federal Communications Commission last month, which revealed that the device features a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi radio and a 24GHz mmWave sensor.&nbsp;In addition to the motion features, a big part of the device appears to be its immersive sounds, which are pulled from five different Switch games: <em>Breath of the Wild</em>; <em>Pikmin 4</em>; <em>Splatoon 3</em>; <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>; and <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>. There are 35 audio “scenes” in total, though you can also connect the alarm to your Nintendo account for more pulled from <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizon</em>s and <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, which will be free updates coming later.</p><p>There are some sleep tracking features as well. Here’s how Nintendo describes them:</p><div><blockquote><p>You can also check Records to see how much you move around in your sleep, set an hourly chime themed to your chosen title, and change between Steady or Gentle Modes for your morning alarm. In Steady Mode, the alarm will gradually get more intense the longer you stay in bed, whereas Gentle Mode offers a more consistent intensity level. There’s also Button Mode for a more traditional, tactile “hit the snooze button” alarm clock experience. You can even use sleepy sounds to wind down with soothing music and sounds at your set bedtime.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>The announcement comes at a time when Nintendo seems to be focused on everything <em>but</em> its next console. Last month saw the debut of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a>, possibly the Switch’s last major release, while, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">in October, the company opened the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And if they hear you, they come for you. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/19/17253262/a-quiet-place-sound-design-eric-aadahl-ethan-van-der-ryan-interview">Just like in the movie</a>!</p><p>The microphone part is optional, though I’d definitely turn it on myself. While Saber says giving the game access to your microphone could mean that the game’s monsters can “detect every sound you make in real life,” it appears from the trailer that even your controller vibrating or your dryer running could put you in danger. </p><p><em>A Quiet Place </em>is far from the only game to use a microphone as part of play — heck, it’s not even <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.g2a.com%2Fnews%2Ffeatures%2Fhorror-games-that-use-your-mic%2F">the first horror game</a>.

Tempering recipes can drop from enemies, just like other loot types. Use them (right click, if you are using mouse and keyboard) in your inventory to add them to your Blacksmith ‘Tempering’ menu, then you’ll be able to select from new bonus pools the next time you Temper an item.<br></p><hr><p>With this  system, you’re&nbsp;able to tailor random drops far better to suit your specific build, and to improve any dodgy stats they may come with. No more sighing and selling!<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bethesda-bioware-and-naughty-dog-alumni-form-near-studios" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Near Studios is currently working on a project by the name of&nbsp;<em>Hawthorn</em>, which will, according to early players of the game cited by the studio itself, combine "an intimate&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>&nbsp;</em>sandbox" with "a&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>&nbsp;</em>village simulation".</p>
<p>Near Studios will be headed up by CEO Heather Cerlan, whose previous experience includes work with the likes of Wizards of the Coast, Naughty Dog, and EA, as well as Amy Hennig's Skydance New Media.</p>

<p>Richardson says that&nbsp;<em>Hawthorn&nbsp;</em>revolves around "a living village of NPCs and your co-op friends", and that the goal with the game is to "evoke the nostalgic joy and wonder of shared adventures".</p>
<p><em>Hawthorn&nbsp;</em>will take place in a location called Windermere Valley, and you'll play as a tiny little woodland creature looking to build a life for yourself in this idyllic rural pasture. To do so, you'll recruit villagers, explore the world around you, and build up your village by harvesting crops, fishing, and farming.</p>

<p>Near Studios promises the ability to solve conflicts without resorting to violence, as well as "random events that make each player's sandbox story unique", an "enchanting yet believable world", and "memorable NPCs" with their own personalities and backstories.</p>
<p>If you're (quite reasonably) morally opposed to AI art, you may want to note that&nbsp;<em>Hawthorn&nbsp;</em>will use AI-generated art "significantly edited by humans" for its "placeholder 2D art and iconography" during its pre-alpha development stage.</p>
<p>You can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Hawthorn&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3078150/Hawthorn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> if you want to keep up with its progress. It doesn't have a release date or window as yet, so we'll likely hear more in the coming months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-design-director-addresses-fan-concern-as-starfield-dlc-shattered-space-plunges-to-mostly-negative-steam-review-rating<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Maybe it’s a game of expectations."</h2></div><section><p>Starfield’s Shattered Space DLC was meant to usher in a new era for Bethesda’s divisive space game Starfield, rekindling memories of the studio’s great DLCs of the past such as Fallout 4’s Far Harbor. But following its launch last month, things haven’t gone to plan.</p><p>Sci-fi RPG <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new intellectual property in years and its first mainline single-player game since Microsoft bought parent company ZeniMax Media in March 2021. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-review"><u>Starfield review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist.”</p><p>A year later, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield-shattered-space">Shattered Space</a> has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam, as Starfield players complain about everything from a lack of value to boring quest design.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Now, Emil Pagliarulo, studio design director at Bethesda Game Studios, has responded to one fan’s concern about not just Starfield and Shattered Space, but the direction Bethesda is headed. This concern was prompted by a <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/players-can-explore-like-they-used-to-in-fallout-and-skyrim-how-shattered-space-brings-the-bespoke-goodness-of-past-bethesda-rpgs-to-starfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar interview</a> with Pagliarulo who enthusiastically bigged up the expansion. This, the fan said, suggested Bethesda was dismissive of community concern around Starfield.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/Dezinuh/status/1843657966702207366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a series of tweets</a>, Pagliarulo responded directly to this suggestion and more generally to the ongoing discourse around Starfield and Bethesda. “My optimism is in no way meant to be mud in the eye of any dissatisfied fan,” Pagliarulo insisted. “That's not how it works.”</p><p>Pagliarulo went on to say “I’m also very proud of Shattered Space. We all are,” and confirmed that most of the quests and levels in the expansion were developed by designers who worked on previous Bethesda games and DLC, going all the way back to 2002 masterpiece Morrowind. “They’re good at what they do, and it shows,” he added.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If folks have played Shattered Space and still don’t like it, that makes me sad, honestly.</p></div><p>“If folks haven’t played Shattered Space, and they like Starfield, I think they’re missing out,” Pagliarulo continued. “If folks have played Shattered Space and still don’t like it, that makes me sad, honestly. Just know that we’ve also been hearing from plenty of people who love it.”</p><p>Pagliarulo offered an explanation of sorts for this apparent disconnect between the way he views Shattered Space and how fans have reacted to it. “Maybe it’s a game of expectations,” he suggested. “Fans want a lot, and we do all we can to accommodate them. Here’s what I can tell you – nobody, and I mean nobody, at Bethesda is patting themselves on the back while ignoring our players.”</p><p>Now Shattered Space is out, fans have wondered what’s next for Starfield. In June, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2">Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the company was committed to supporting <u>Starfield</u></a>, which has seen 14 million players across PC and Xbox Series X and S, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. Howard said Bethesda is aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p>Pagliarulo reiterated this commitment of support, saying Bethesda will continue to address community concerns and make fixes while “listening to our fans every step of the way.”</p><p>“Starfield is a massive game, and it takes time for us to address things,” he explained. “We move as fast as we can, as safely as we can. Game development is always tricky, but with a game as big as Starfield, every fix could potentially break something else.</p><p>“To close, let me just say… I love games. I love Bethesda’s games. I’ve been playing them since the Terminator days. All I or anyone here wants to do is make those games and then make them better. No ego. No arrogance. Just a lot of hard work, and appreciation of our fans.”</p><p>It’s a busy time for the 450-person Bethesda Game Studios, which currently operates five teams: Starfield; Elder Scrolls 6; Fallout 76; mobile; and external development partnerships. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while"><u>It’s working on the aforementioned Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>, ongoing content for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76"><u>Fallout 76</u></a>, various mobile games, updates for older games, and, eventually, the next Fallout.</p><p>But will Starfield see a sequel? If it does materialize it may be some time before we see anything of it, with Elder Scrolls 6 expected no earlier than 2028 and another Fallout game set to follow.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shroud-fronted-spectre-divide-isnt-dead-ceo-insists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"The servers aren’t shutting down, and the updates aren’t going to stop."</h2></div><section><p>The CEO of the developer behind <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/spectre-divide">Spectre Divide</a>, a new free-to-play competitive multiplayer shooter fronted by streamer Shroud, has insisted the game isn’t dead despite low player concurrent numbers.</p><p>Spectre Divide launched early September on PC via Steam, where it saw an encouraging 30,971 peak concurrent players. But that concurrent figure has fallen steadily since on Valve’s platform where it has a ‘mixed’ user review rating. Yesterday, October 8, Spectre Divide had a peak of 2,769 concurrent players.</p><p>Now, a month on from launch, Mountaintop Studios CEO, Nate Mitchell acknowledged the discourse around Spectre Divide low player numbers, but vowed to stick with the game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s true that Spectre’s concurrent player count is lower than we’d all like.</p></div><p>“Some folks out there have declared Spectre ‘dead,’ mostly as a result of low concurrency,” Mitchell said. “It’s true that Spectre’s concurrent player count is lower than we’d all like.”</p><p>Mitchell admitted that a PvP game like Spectre Divide needs lots of players for healthy matchmaking, and that without them, players will experience longer queues and less fair matches.</p><p>“With that said, I can assure you that Spectre isn’t going anywhere,” he added. “The servers aren’t shutting down, and the updates aren’t going to stop.</p><p>“If player count drops from here, we have strategies for bringing players together, like combining the matchmaking queues. And we'll continue working toward bringing new players in. We love this game – we’ve poured our heart and soul into it these past four years – and we’re just getting started.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Mitchell explained that Mountaintop is an independent studio with a small team, but “we have the funds to support Spectre for a long time. And I promise: We’re going to make Spectre awesome together.”</p><p>As for the future, Mitchell said the developers need some time “to go heads-down, improve the game, and tackle some of your bigger asks,” with Season 1 set to kick off in December or January. Priorities include client performance, ping and server regions, anti-cheat, and game stability.</p><p>Last month, shortly after Spectre Divide launched, Mountaintop cut 13 staff, with Mitchell saying at the time that the layoffs "make sure we're set up to support Spectre and its community for the long term."</p><p>Expanding on the reasoning now, Mitchell said: “We made the difficult decision to reduce our monthly spend to make sure we were set up to support Spectre for the long term. In the run up to launch, the studio grew from more than 85 devs to support a bigger live service roadmap. We’re now back to around 75 full-time devs, but we have plenty of firepower to bring our plans to life.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/09/gettyimages-1054359868-1728470825455.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Michael 'Shroud' Grzesiek in 2018. Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p>As for Shroud’s ongoing involvement, Mitchell said Mountaintop is still working with the streamer on future design iterations, “and he’s been helping us think through ways to make Spectre as compelling as possible for both community members and streamers.”</p><p>But, Mitchell stressed, Spectre Divide does not belong to Shroud, as some had assumed. “The reality is that Mountaintop has been bringing Spectre to life since 2020, and the game belongs to Mountaintop,” he said.</p><p>Spectre Divide launched amid a tumultuous time for the video game market and in particular live service games. 2024 has seen a number of high-profile live service missteps, including the failure of Rocksteady’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and Sony’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a>.</p><p><em>Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>Per an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/segas-shinobi-is-getting-a-film-adaptation-from-the-director-of-extraction" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IGN report</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>movie will be directed by&nbsp;<em>Extraction&nbsp;</em>helmsman Sam Hargrave, who's also a stuntman himself, although it's not clear whether he'll be providing any stunts for this movie.</p>
<p>Writing duties on the project will be handled by Ken Kobayashi, who's worked as a writer on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Hit-Monkey&nbsp;</em>and the Apple TV+ show&nbsp;<em>Sunny</em>.</p>

<p>Casting for the movie also hasn't been announced, so we don't know who's playing series lead Joe Musashi (if, indeed, the movie features him as its protagonist; it could just as easily tell the story of Hotsuma, the main character of the 2002&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>reboot).</p>
<p>As announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2023-recap-check-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals">during the Game Awards last year</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>is one of the IPs Sega is planning to revive in the coming years, along with&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>,&nbsp;<em>Golden Axe</em>,&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>.</p>
<p>In the case of&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>, Sega seems to be reviving it as an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo">open-world game with persistent online multiplayer</a>, but we don't know what's in store for&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>just yet.</p>

<p>Last month, we got our first look at the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>movie (although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer">you might wish we hadn't</a>), and the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movies are still going strong as well, with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-keanu-shadow">third installment due out later this year</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens with the&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>movie, as well as the upcoming video game revival. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> won't be an "open sim" like the 2004 original game, according to Paradox Interactive. Now in development at The Chinese Room, it'll be an action-RPG with a relatively linear story set in the World Of Darkness universe. This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been "mythologised" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply "wouldn't fly today".</p>
<p>All this comes from my interview with Lilja at Paradox's Media Day - unofficial working title, Please Stop Poking Us - last week. To recap <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-still-want-to-make-a-sims-competitor-after-life-by-you-but-we-need-to-start-smaller">my previous article about Life By You</a>, Paradox have spent much of the past two years pushing back release dates, cancelling things, publishing other things in a less-than-satisfactory state, and closing or parting ways with developers - a regular conga line of mishaps that have contributed to a 90% drop in operating profit for the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>Bloodlines 2 in particular has long travelled under a cloud of bats. It was announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the wheel and the original game's lead writer Brian Mitsoda as narrative director. "This is the sequel you have been waiting for," he said at the time. "It is going to be Bloodlines, as you remember it. But better." Alice B (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-preview">thought the preview build she saw in 2019 looked ace</a>, offering a familiar morass of factions and approaches but slathered in high-end visuals, with spruced-up combat. I liked what I saw of it myself at the company's PDXCON expo. But then came <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-into-2021">delays</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brian-mitsoda-has-been-fired-as-narrative-lead-on-bloodlines-2">Mitsoda's abrupt firing</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">change of studio</a> in 2021 that led to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-devs-hit-with-layoffs">layoffs</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-been-delayed-again-this-time-until-the-first-half-of-2025">more delays</a>. So how confident are Paradox that Bloodlines 2 will stick the landing, at this point? The answer, more or less, is "quietly", but it won't be the "same but better" sequel elder Nosferatus are hankering for.</p>
<p>"With Hardsuit Labs, we agreed on a vision of what they were gonna make, [and] they had a problem delivering on that," Lilja told me. "We were in agreement, we moved [development] to The Chinese Room and we said, this is the vision and this is what Hardsuit Labs have made. And of course, we gave them quite a lot of freedom to interpret the vision, based on what Hardsuit Labs had made, or change or remove whatever they didn't like. </p><p>"We have a high trust in The Chinese Room, given what they've done," he went on. "We've announced again a delay, into the first half of next year. I would stand by that. I'm pretty confident that that's going to work. I've seen the game now. The Chinese Room is really invested in it. They're taking a lot of initiatives. They like some things that Hardsuit did, they're changing some other things, and they're making their own game, that's still the vision that we had.</p>
<p>"So it's going to be an action-RPG in the World Of Darkness. If you've seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes The Deep</a>, they know how to do story-driven action games with good voice-acting, all of that, which is basically what we're looking for in this game. I hope and feel that we will be able to deliver a game that puts you in the World Of Darkness."</p>
<p>Those gifted with preternatural vision may detect a careful qualification there. Not "a sequel to Bloodlines" but "a game that puts you in the World Of Darkness". And indeed, Lilja downplayed associations with the original game when I asked whether Bloodlines 2 would still be some kind of immersive sim (piggybacking on a comment made to <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/rebooted-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-wont-be-an-immersive-sim-the-chinese-room/">TheGamer</a> in 2023). He also suggested that Bloodlines hasn't aged all that well, and that taking inspiration from it too zealously could be counter-productive.</p>
<p>"It's about setting the right expectations," he said. "The first Bloodlines game - it is what it is, and people who've played it recently will see that it's a game from 2004, that is now patched so that it works. But there's also a lot of ideas about what that game was, that are more, not to offend anyone, mythical. </p><p>"I like the first game as well a lot, but we want to clarify what this game is, so people have a clear understanding of what they're buying, so they don't come in with weird expectations - because we don't want that, we want them to understand that this is an action RPG with a storyline that is more fixed. It's not the open sim it maybe shouldn't be compared to. Again, we want people to understand what they're getting into."</p>
<p>I'm sympathetic to the idea that older games tend to disappear beneath a cloud of nostalgic make-believe - we're seeing it right now, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-silent-hill-2-remakes-wikipedia-page-briefly-got-transformed-into-a-phantasmagorical-reflection-of-the-psyches-of-idiots-unable-to-accept-reality">certain chunderhead reactions</a> to Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake. So which aspects of the original Bloodlines does Lilja think people are mythologising? Sadly, he didn't go into much detail.</p>
<p>"I actually played Bloodlines 1 quite recently, and it is a good game, but it is also an old game, and there are many things that would not fly today," Lilja said. "But I understand why people were super psyched by it in 2004, because it had a lot of cool [elements], and the feeling of being a vampire is really strong, regardless of other features. But I think people, they remember their feelings about it. And if they replayed it, I think they would see that it's a competently good game by 2004 standards, now that it's patched.</p>
<p>"But mainly we want to clarify that we're making a spiritual successor, not an actual same blueprint type of game, so people don't get disappointed and feel cheated," Lilja went on. "We really don't want that."</p>
<p>If Paradox have learned anything from the past few years of delays and cancellations, it's that making or publishing games outside their traditional grand strategy dominions is a risky business. During our chat, Lilja spoke at length about the need to refocus and make smaller bets on projects in future. With regard to Bloodlines 2, we shouldn't expect another action-RPG from Paradox in the near future, though Paradox do expect the game to at least break even.</p><p>"We do expect it to recover its investment," Lilja said, somewhat to my surprise. "But also saying that, it has changed studios, been in production a long time. My expectation is we will release a good game." He added, however, that "the continuation of this type of games for Paradox should probably be done in a different setup - again, going back to taking risks, how to invest when we're not sure that we exactly know what we're doing."</p>
<p>Fingers crossed that Bloodlines 2's most recent delay is the final delay, and that it doesn't immediately turn to dust on arrival. I'm disappointed that it won't be the frothing cauldron of vampire variables we were promised in 2019, but The Chinese Room do fine work - if nothing else, Bloodlines 2 should have atmosphere and sense-of-place in spades.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
