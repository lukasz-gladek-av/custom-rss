            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-dlc-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch 2, and the game's major second DLC pack,&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune</em>, has also been revealed.</p>

<p>As revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-revealed-at-star-wars-celebration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">during a livestream</a>,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>will land on Nintendo's console on September 4th. The console itself is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">due for launch on June 5th</a>, so you won't have to wait too long between buying your Switch 2 and picking up Ubisoft's open-world&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>adventure.</p>

<p>If you already own&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>and you're waiting for news of the next DLC adventure, Ubisoft has you covered on that front as well.&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune&nbsp;</em>is the name of the game's second story pack, and it's coming in May.</p>

<p>In true pirate fashion, you'll also be raiding a tomb; the Khepi Tomb will offer "secrets and hidden treasures" for you to discover. What's more, a whole new faction, the Miyuki Trade League, will offer up new Trailblazer rewards, and all you have to do in return is smuggle dangerous goods across the galaxy. What's new, right?</p>

<p>Along with the paid DLC,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>will also be getting some free&nbsp;<em>Skeleton Crew</em>-inspired cosmetics on May 15th, including an outfit for Nix. Be sure to check that out if you want to dress up your cute little friend.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, it's an open-world action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft. Taking place between&nbsp;<em>The Empire Strikes Back&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Return of the Jedi</em>, the game follows scoundrel Kay Vess as she tries to pull off the heist of a lifetime.</p>

<p>Originally released last year, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">underperformed compared to Ubisoft's expectations</a>, becoming one of the cornerstones of a change in strategy that involves day-one Steam releases and the adoption of an altered season pass model.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review" rel="nofollow">Erren liked it</a>, though, and if you want to find out whether you do, there's a free demo for the game you can check out across all platforms.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2842040/Star_Wars_Outlaws/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/star-wars-outlaws/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/star-wars-outlaws/9P87S3NP6SR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The Switch 2 version launches on September 4th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-definitive-edition-has-become-more-immersive-than-ever-thanks-to-new-vr-mod.1167735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-immersive-vr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Definitive Edition has become more immersive than ever before this week, thanks to a new VR mod that's now available for download.</p>
<p>The new mod, which has been developed by Holydh and is now available for free on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grandtheftautothetrilogy/mods/922">Nexus Mods</a>, includes everything players need to play San Andreas Definitive Edition in first-person VR with 6DOF motion controls. Thanks to the implementation of 6DOF controls in particular, it's possible to play the game from beginning to end in VR, as they allow the aiming of all ranged weapons, even in scripted shooting sequences in vehicles as a passenger. The functional Sniper Scope and Camera Screen with zoom in and out function also allows specific weapons that require using a sniper rifle to be completed in VR.</p>
<p><iframe title="San Andreas VR with 6DOF motion controls - UEVR Plugin Released" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIVeUHKR9S0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The release of this VR mod definitely makes the purchase of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Definitive Edition more enticing for those who still prefer the original release, although the game, much like GTA 3 and Vice City Definitive Editions, has seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-patch-classic-lighting-mode/">considerable improvements</a> since its launch in late 2021. You can learn more about the issues that plagued Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition at launch by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition collects some truly groundbreaking games that still provide their share of nostalgic fun, but little has been done to make them shine here in 2021. Ultimately, a shoddy visual upgrade, choppy performance, and a lack of meaningful updates or extras may leave you questioning why you loved them in the first place. Perhaps this collection can be brought up to snuff with updates from Rockstar (or modders), but for now, its Wanted Level remains low.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/painkillers-latest-trailer-showcases-some-of-its-weapons/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Following on from last month’s reveal, 3D Realms and Saber Interactive have released a brand new trailer for Painkiller with this one focusing specifically on weapons. The trailer confirms there are seven weapons in total for players to use including the Stakegun, Electrodriver, SMG, Handcannon, Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, and of course the titular Painkiller.</p>
<p><iframe title="Painkiller - Weapons Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2J41CouSSWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Stakegun impales foes with with high damage stakes, the Electrodriver fires off shurikens that will bounce off surfaces, the SMG fires lots of bullets in bursts, the Shotgun will deal high damage close up and staggers foes, the Handcannon hits hard from distance, the Rocket Launcher takes out groups, and the Painkiller hooks on to enemies and shreds them up.&nbsp; All of the weapons will have primary and alternative fire modes along with upgrades with bonuses, and elemental rounds including &nbsp;fire, ice, electro and kinetic.</p>
<p>Painkiller’s story puts you in Purgatory where you have been given a chance to redeem yourself after transgressing against Heaven. The way to redeem yourself is by blasting away the demons of purgatory in an attempt to stop the fallen angel Azazel’s invasion of Earth. Painkiller can be playable solo and will also support co-op for up to three players. Painkiller is due to release this autumn for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-%E2%80%93-what-switch-games-can%E2%80%99t-be-played.1167717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is backwards compatible with most older Switch titles, but not all of them. Nintendo have categorised all the games they have tested into three groups: ‘Games with start up issues on Nintendo Switch 2’, ‘Games that are playable, but have some in-game compatibility issues’, and ‘Games with issues that are planned to be addressed’. Additionally there is a small number of games that will work but not with the Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 controllers, you will need a Switch 1 Joy-Con to play them.</p>
<p>Why are there any issues here? Well, it comes down to a few different reasons. The Switch 2 Joy-Con no longer have an IR sensor, which means games that use this won’t work for those select minigames and modes, and the physical size is different for attachments like the Ring Fit controller. More fundamentally, the Switch 2 is using a translation layer to run original Switch games, and this can cause issues if certain CPU and GPU functions are changed or were used in unusual ways.</p>
<p>Here is a full list of the games that have been tested and their category, but please be aware this list may change as Nintendo continue to test games and work with developers to resolve issues. Check the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Site</a> for the latest updates.</p>


<h2>Games that cannot be played on Nintendo Switch 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit <em>– the Switch 2 cannot be inserted into the Toy-Con VR Goggles, so this cannot be played.</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>Nintendo Switch games with issues that are planned to be addressed</h3>
<p>The issues with the following games have been found and the developers are busy working on a patch or new version. You will note that Fortnite is one of them, one the games used to promote Switch 2!

<ul>
<li>Fortnite</li>
<li>Fitness Boxing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Games with start up issues on Nintendo Switch 2</h3>
<p>These games have been tested and currently are not booting correctly on Switch 2 and therefore cannot be played. However, for all of the titles Nintendo state that “This issue is being investigated” so they may be patched at a later date.</p>

			<p>A new Hogwarts Legacy patch has gone live on PC, introducing ray tracing and stability improvements as well as new features that may bring performance improvements for GPUs that don't support NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation.</p>
<p>The April 17th patch introduces, besides some UI improvements, some ray tracing improvements, such as fixed Hogsmeade watermill shadow not rotating with asset and ray-traced reflections system resolution issues, stability and performance improvements, AMD FSR 3 and Intel XeLL and XeFG support, meaning that users that cannot use NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation now have the option of using either AMD or Intel's tech, depending on their GPU. The patch also introduces support for AMD Anti-Lag 2 and updates Intel XeSS 2.0 to the latest version.</p>
<p>The new Hogwarts Legacy patch also packs improvements to the Creator Kit, with plenty of fixes and enhancements for the game's official modding tools. You can check out every fix and improvement the new patch introduces <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/990080/view/576005583301247566?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. The game will also launch on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the system launches. You can learn more about one of the best games based on the Wizarding World by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/17/john-wick-inspired-action-game-spine-coming-to-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Spine was first announced in 2021 as a multiplayer game, but after a couple of years in development, developer Nekki changed course. Today, Spine is a cinematic single-player game that draws heavy inspiration from action-packed blockbusters like&nbsp;<em>John Wick</em>​​​​​​. Using free-flow gun-fu combat, Spine has drawn the attention of a large population of players, attracting more than 400,000 wishlists according to the publisher. Today, Nekki showed off new gameplay footage of the cyberpunk action title, announced a new ultra-difficult Hardcore mode, and shared that the game will arrive on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>In Spine, you control Redline, the highly trained protagonist who can seamlessly move from enemy to enemy by parrying them, disarming them, and defeating them with her weapons, in hand-to-hand combat, or by turning their own weapons against them. She can also resourcefully use items in the environment as makeshift weapons and smash enemies into various surfaces in the world. The camera is specifically designed to put the player in the action so they feel like they are in an action movie.</p>

<p>In addition to announcing that the game is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, Nekki also revealed Hardcore mode. In this mode, Redline cannot take any damage, which is represented by a special pair of sunglasses she wears in this mode. In order to keep the sunglasses intact, she must make it through untouched by enemy fire or strikes.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer showing off the combat below.</p>

<p>"Freeflow Gun Fu combat means constant tactical awareness – both of your enemies and of the surroundings in which you fight," game director Dmitry Pimenov said in a press release. "For us, everything comes back to that cinematic experience, while always giving players complete control. We want to make players feel like both the star and the director of their own action movie, rewarding them with opportunities for creative takedowns by mastering the combo system and the environment, and showcasing their combos with dynamic camera angles to immerse them in the action."</p>

<p>Spine doesn't currently have a release date, but it was originally scheduled for a 2025 release. However, the Steam page currently says "To be announced," while the press release makes no mention of a release window. It is currently slated to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC.</p>

Naturally, Nintendo sees the first all-new Mario Kart game in more than a decade as a big-ticket item, which could explain the $80 price tag. However, it also explains the confidence Nintendo has to launch the successor to its most successful console of all time with Mario Kart World. During today's Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct, we learned how players can engage with the big launch title of Nintendo Switch 2, as Nintendo detailed the various modes, as well as several of the courses.</p>

<p>Grand Prix</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="9d8a3a5b-fd7a-43b6-871d-b7b88ad76778" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Grand Prix</h4>

<p>As I experienced during my hands-on time with Mario Kart World (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/03/cross-country-karting">read my full preview here</a>), the game features two flagship modes: Grand Prix and Knockout Tour. Grand Prix sets you up with a series of four races as you try and place well enough that you land on the podium at the end of the four races. Players can race through new and returning courses (see below), but the difference in Mario Kart World is that once you complete a race, you then drive to the next course alongside your opponents, hammering home the fact that this is one big, interconnected world. Grand Prix organizes the courses into four-race Cups, with seven Cups available – Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, Star Cup, Shell Cup, Banana Cup, Leaf Cup, and Lightning Cup. However, the Direct heavily implies that if you take home gold in all seven Cups, you will at least unlock Rainbow Road, though it's more likely you'll unlock an entire Special Cup.</p>

<p>Knockout Tour</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3a45d463-4a07-4cf2-97ea-40d866b52163" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Knockout Tour</h4>

<p>The other big mode Nintendo has shown is Knockout Tour. Here, you race in elimination matches across multiple checkpoints. Each time you pass through a checkpont, you must be better than the position shown in the checkpoint gate or you're eliminated. With 24 players available in every race – not to mention the Mario Kart tendency to hit you hardest when you're on top – Knockout Tour competitions are chaotic and stressful, but during my time playing the game, this mode served as the highlight.</p>

<p>Time Trials</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e7018dbf-3973-4acc-be52-07a4e60b5e61" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Time Trials</h4>

<p>During today's Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct, we also learned about the other modes players can participate in. In Time Trials, you can hone your skills to post the best time possible across the various courses without worrying about other racers getting in your way or <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/17/every-new-item-and-trick-in-the-mario-kart-world-direct">hitting you with items</a>. If you go online, you can compete against Ghost data from across the globe. As with previous iterations of the mode, it appears as though players start with three Mushrooms, which must be used judiciously to score the best time.</p>

<p>VS Race</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="123488ba-4d11-4f06-8bd2-8afc0fe477a5" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>VS Race</h4>

<p>If you'd prefer real competition, you can enter into VS Race, which allows you to compete against a full field of 24 racers, including real humans and COM drivers. You can select the courses you want to race with the traditional three-lap format or even compete by racing between specific courses. The ruleset is also fully customizable; you can select what class you want to race in (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, etc), split the 24 drivers into up to four teams, select or restrict specific items, designate the COM driver difficulty, and choose how many races are in the series.</p>

<p>Battle Mode</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b250456e-160a-4f00-9860-ff4651469abb" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Battle Mode</h4>

<p>The franchise mainstay Battle Mode also makes its return in Mario Kart World. The Battle Mode present in Mario Kart World seems more in line with the series' traditional offering as seen in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, rather than the unpopular version found in the Wii U version of Mario Kart 8. Battle Mode can be played locally or online, with two modes announced: Balloon Battle and Coin Runners. Balloon Battle gives players a set number of balloons to represent their hit points. Each time you take damage, one of your balloons pops. You are eliminated from the match if all of your balloons are destroyed. Coin Runners first debuted in Mario Kart Wii, with the main objective of collecting as many coins as possible while preventing your opponents from collecting more than you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Free Roam</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b0010571-26cc-4693-b0fd-f6079fbfbb29" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Free Roam</h4>

<p>If you just want to explore Mario Kart World's vast region free from the fires of competition, you can do so in Free Roam. Here, you can run along the roads, go off-roading, or even speed down the rivers as you uncover every nook and cranny this open world has to offer. As you drive around, you can engage with various side objectives. One such objective presents itself in the form of P-Switches. Once you activate a P-Switch, a mission begins, requiring you to show off your skills. In the Direct, one objective involves jumping between multiple rails to collect blue coins, while another task involves reaching a goal while dodging incoming boulders within a set time limit. Nintendo claims there are hundreds of P-Switches across the world. You can also find collectibles such as hidden coins like the Peach Medallion shown in the Direct, hidden panels to activate, and more secrets. While in Free Roam, which can be done solo or with friends, you can access Photo Mode at any time.</p>

<p>Multiplayer</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8c281b99-2489-49c5-b719-57ee301f33dd" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Local and Online Play</h4>

<p>If you'd like to play with friends (or strangers), you can hop online to compete in the various modes on offer in the Mario Kart World package. Mario Kart World supports up to 4-player splitscreen, as well as local wireless for up to 8 players, with two players allowed on each individual Switch 2 system. Up to 24 players can compete online, with a maximum of 2 players on each system. While you're waiting for players to join and ready up, you are placed in a joint Free Roam session so that you can explore with the other players. By opening the map, you can see where the other players in the session are and teleport to them immediately for cooperative exploration. If you have the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, you can <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/17/mario-kart-worlds-cameraplay-lets-you-broadcast-your-live-facial">use GameChat features</a> and even superimpose each player's face over their character so you can know who is playing as who at a moment's notice and see their reactions in real time.</p>

<p>Course List</p>

<p>Mario Kart World is poised to be the most ambitious Mario Kart game yet. However, the $80 price tag has stirred up sufficient controversy. Nintendo has <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5d07f55a-1a29-495e-8613-f59f3047c54b" href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/nintendo-says-mario-kart-worlds-value-justifies-its-80-price">justified the price tag</a> by saying it priced the game based on the value it brings to players, but many still decry the price as too much. Still, as the flagship launch title of the Nintendo Switch 2, it will likely sell well off the starting line, even with preorder details for the console still up in the air in the wake of the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="884f35ab-23fc-4898-a479-26bb82edbd6b" href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariff-plans-delay-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">ongoing tariff saga in the United States</a>.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World launches alongside Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5. For more on the new game in the beloved franchise, check out our hands-on preview of Mario Kart World <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e91306ba-da57-4a47-8e31-de54d59fabe4" href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/03/cross-country-karting">here</a>.</p>

<p>GameChat allows for in-game voice chat, allowing players to speak to each other during online races using the Switch 2’s built-in microphone. You can also watch each other's live game screens broadcast to the party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that players can use GameChat without subscribing to Nintendo Switch Online until March 31, 2026. After that, a Nintendo Switch Online membership will be required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CameraPlay allows owners of the Switch 2 camera to capture live footage of their face, which appears in-game as a portrait over their driver. This allows players to see each other’s live reactions as they ruin each other's day in the many ways Mario Kart allows. If you’re playing four players locally, a single camera can capture everyone's faces in the room at once.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World launches on June 5 for Switch 2 at <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/nintendo-says-mario-kart-worlds-value-justifies-its-80-price">$79.99</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lords-of-the-fallen-version-2-0-adds-free-friend%E2%80%99s-pass-shared-co-op-progression-and-more.1167678/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/lords-of-the-fallen-version-2-0-adds-free-friends-pass-shared-co-op-progression-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>CI Games has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a> Version 2.0, a huge update to the game that brings improvements to combat, characters, adds shared progression in co-op, and also introduces a free Friend’s Pass scheme to the game.</p>
<p>To mark this milestone update, the game is at steep 67-72% discount through the PlayStation Spring Sale until 23rd April, until 24th April on Epic, and until 1st May on Xbox and Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lords of the Fallen - VERSION 2.0 (Free Friend’s Pass, Shared Progression Co-op) | PC, PS5, Xbox X|S" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2jQ3S2JzA9s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With the free Friend’s Pass, you need to purchase just one copy of the game in order to play co-op, inviting any other person that you like to join, much like the same scheme for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/09/split-fiction-review/">Split Fiction</a>. A special Friend’s Pass version of the game is now available across PC, Xbox Series X|S and PS5, giving offline access to the tutorial and character creator, and also allowing for full crossplay co-op.</p>
<p>Alongside this, the shared progression in co-op now saves all main story progress for both players that start a new game together, so long as you’ve defeated a similar number of main bosses. Both players retain their loot, 100% vigor and can revive one another in an online session. The previous co-op progression style is also retained, if you prefer that.</p>

<p>Read more about the nitty-gritty of how this works in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLordsOfTheFallen/comments/1k1g6bk/lotf_v20_coop_faq/">FAQ on Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>These are already pretty significant additions, but CI Games has continued to iterate on the gameplay since the last update, version 1.7, was released in December. Version 2.0 has revamped combat and movement with smoother animations, weapon response, lock-on, evasions and more. There’s now a dedicated jump button for improved platforming, too.</p>
<p>The character creator has been overhauled, leading into an improved tutorial, and there’s a modernised UI and HUD through the game as well.</p>
<p>“Version 2.0 is the definitive edition of Lords of the Fallen and contains 50+ post-launch updates” said Marek Tymninski, CEO of CI Games. “The Free Friend’s Pass, shared progression co-op, and more are our way of saying thank you to our community. Honestly, the game has grown way beyond what we first imagined when we launched in 2023 – now is the perfect time for new players to join our franchise and current fans to experience Lords in an exciting new light.”</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen underwhelmed upon its original release in 2023, despite having its intriguing twinned world mechanic and looking to be a more distinctive game than the 2014 title that it supplanted. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/12/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review/">Lords of the Fallen review</a>, Jason said, “I desperately want to like Lords of the Fallen, but it’s the first game all year that’s actively annoyed me. I love the Soulslike genre more than any other, but this game took all of the lessons it could have learned since the original Lords of the Fallen and either forgot them entirely, or just misunderstood them so greviously that you’d assume it skipped a class.”</p>
<p>A sequel is in development, with an expected release in 2026, so it’s high time that CI Games wrap up the continued support of this title and put their full focus onto the next game.</p>

		<p>While we all look ahead to gorging ourselves on chocolate eggs in a few days time, the short week and extra long weekend will also give plenty time for playing more games than usual. That’s what the future holds, but what about the past? What have we all been playing the last seven days?</p>
<p>There’s been an awful lot of Blue Prince being played in my house, but not by me outside of when I helped with a light switching puzzle. Instead, I’ve made the smallest of starts on Xenoblade Chronicles 2, finally getting round to a game that I must have bought about 6 years ago now, and I’ve touched on a couple games for preview in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>Dom’s been away all week on holiday, taking his Switch and 3DS along for company – no doubt hoping to snag a StreetPass visitor or two on his travels – though he’s not actually told me what, if anything, he’s managed to play. So I’m going to suggest that they’ve spent the whole week playing Mario Party games.</p>
<p>Aran has found himself managing Promise Mascot Agency, and as he nears the end of the story, he says that Pinky is likely to go down as the best supporting character of this year – something that Pinky and the Brain fans would certainly agree on.</p>

<p>Sticking with the A’s, Ade has played more Atomfall while he takes a break from Assassin’s Creed Shadows. He’s had fun playing a spot of “Danger Cricket”, as I’m calling it, knocking away thrown grenades with his cricket bat, and generally having a lovely time in the Lake District. He’s also made a return to Helldivers 2.</p>

<p>Jim, meanwhile, has not taken a break from Assassin’s Creed Shadows, eliminating a few more targets from&nbsp;Yasuke and Naoe’s naughty lists – “I’m not particularly fond of the game’s ever-expanding objective board which seems to sprout new quests every time you look away, though it does give me plenty to do while travelling between story mission markers.”</p>
<p>Alongsdie that, his daughter is getting more interested in video games, so they’ve been playing My Friend Peppa Pig and Cars 3.</p>
<p>It’s been a bit of Hogwarts Legacy and Terraria for Gamoc, as he’s now wrapped up the main story of the former, while Miguel has been playing&nbsp; Fatal Fury City of the Wolves, a bunch of The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy, and a little pinch of Blue Prince.</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out this week with Steve:</p>
<p>“This week I have played through South of Midnight which I absolutely loved, and took your advice by downloading the soundtrack which has got plenty of repeat plays. I also continued my Sisyphean quest to 100% Lego Skywalker Saga which is ongoing (perhaps eternally). Got lost in Metroid Dread so waiting til I can play it docked for a clearer view of the map. Did manage to deflect one EMMI attack which made me feel like a boss until I got myself stuck in a dead end and was killed immediately after… Finally, I’ve played a couple of small indie games for review.”</p>
<p>That’s us, but what about you? What have you played this week, and what do you have in store for the doubly long weekend?</p>

			<p>Polaris Quest, a Chinese development studio owned by Tencent, has published a new gameplay trailer for Light of Motiram, the game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks a bit too much like Guerrilla's Horizon franchise</a>. Truth be told, there are some gameplay differences. Whereas the Horizon games are action/adventure titles with some light RPG elements thrown in for good measure, Light of Motiram is mostly a survival game where players must establish a base and defend it. The building system will be based on a realistic physics engine.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be a lot of emphasis on taming the over a hundred types of 'Mechanimals'. Each comes with unique skills and growth potential. Players can assign Mechanimals different combat modes and production traits. Combat itself also seems more centered on melee with dodging, blocking, and counterattacking moves. Moreover, Light of Motiram includes seamless cooperative multiplayer throughout the whole game, something that Horizon games have lacked so far - although Guerrilla Games is <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-co-op-game-nearly-confirmed-by-job-openings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now working on Horizon Online</a>, a co-op game that is the Dutch studio's next big thing. Sure, it's hard to shake the visual similarities, which are definitely more than just inspirations.</p>
<p><iframe title="LIGHT OF MOTIRAM | Outcast Forest Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vi-jR03vkPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Anyway, it won't be long before Light of Motiram becomes available for everyone to check out. Polaris Quest plans to launch it in 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, iOS, and Android as a free-to-play game. You can find the system requirements below.</p>

			<p>During the Galaxies Showcase, Anshar Studios and 3D Realms published a new trailer for the Painkiller reboot. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/painkiller-returns-in-fall-2025-reimagined-with-co-op-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in late March at the Future Games Show: Spring Showcase 2024 for a release scheduled later this year.</p>
<p>In the new Painkiller game, players will use these seven weapons to slay all sorts of demons and foes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrodriver: Barrage enemies with rapid-firing shurikens that bounce off hard surfaces.</li>
<li>Stakegun: Hurls high-damage stakes that can impale foes from long-range.</li>
<li>SMG: Unleashes loads of ammo in short, rapid-fire bursts.</li>
<li>Handcannon: Decimate enemies from long range with deadly precision.</li>
<li>Shotgun: Spits destructive pellets at short range that can damage and stagger multiple foes.</li>
<li>Rocket Launcher: Discharges a rocket projectile with a devastating blast radius that can stagger even heavy enemies.</li>
<li>Painkiller: a versatile weapon with a brutal melee attack that hooks onto enemies, shreds them to pieces, and refills your ammo.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Painkiller - Weapons Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dUKtbucEOk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this reboot, players must choose between four playable characters: Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch. Each comes with unique perks and boosts to energy, health, power, or damage. Tarot cards can be used to enhance character abilities and even combined with those of other players. Indeed, the addition of cooperative multiplayer is arguably the greatest change compared to the original. We'll have to wait and see if the game can retain its signature gameplay even when playing with others.</p>

			<p>During yesterday's Galaxies Showcase, independent developer Legion Studio shared the second official trailer for Covenant, an upcoming first-person dark fantasy action game. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/covenant-is-new-first-person-dark-fantasy-combat-game-from-halo-battlefield-destiny-doom-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> at The Game Awards 2024, Covenant is being developed by a 12-person team with industry credits in big franchises like Call of Duty, DOOM, Apex Legends, Battlefield, Destiny, and Halo.</p>
<p>Players will step into the role of a warrior angel sent from the Heavens into Creation to follow in the steps of the fallen angel Malach. According to Legion, this mythical land is designed to be fully interconnected, just like in a Soulslike game. Because of this, puzzles, riddles, platforming, and exploration are going to be part of the player's journey. Discovering shortcuts and seeking out hidden paths will be the key to uncovering every secret.</p>
<p>Of course, combat is the core of the game. The developers said they have put a lot of emphasis on melee combat, which was inspired by fighting games (Tekken, Smash Bros), immersive sims (Dark Messiah, Dishonored), and action games (Dark Souls). There are even different stances that change the player character's entire fighting style, down to the way they run, jump, kick, and slide. Each of the stances drastically modifies the play style. Magic will also play a key role in complementing the build crafting, strategy, and creativity that players will be able to exhibit.</p>
<p>Covenant will support co-op multiplayer as well as competitive multiplayer in dedicated 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 arenas.</p>
<p><iframe title="COVENANT - Official Galaxies Showcase Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpuDEWCyoVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game is said to be still in early development. Legion said they'd like to avoid going into early access, but it may become necessary at some point if the studio needs financial help (they are currently seeking a publisher). They would also wish to port their game to consoles, but for now, they can only promise the PC version, which can be wishlisted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3333990/Covenant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

Our reviewer gave it a 7, saying it was "a fun intergalactic heist adventure with great exploration, but it’s hindered by simple stealth, repetitive combat, and a few too many bugs at launch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft didn't have many details to share beyond reiterating that the title would be available on Nintendo Switch 2 and confirming when, but at least we can update the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/Switch_2_Games_List_-_Release_Date,_Price,_and_Exclusives"><u>Switch 2 Games List.</u></a> With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs"><u>American and Canadian gamers locked in pre-order limbo</u></a> as Nintendo assesses the impact of the new tariffs introduced by the Republican administration, any news on Nintendo Switch 2 games getting released is a welcome distraction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news was announced during a panel at Star Wars Celebration in Japan today, where Ubisoft also gave fans a look at the second story pack headed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-gets-second-story-update-a-pirates-fortune-in-may">Star Wars: Outlaws, titled A Pirate’s Fortune</a>. The add on will see Kay joining allying with Hondo Ohnaka to take on Stinger Tash, leader of the Rokana Raiders. Star Wars: Outlaws: A Pirate’s Fortune will be released on May 15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.

It'll be free for season pass holders, otherwise you're going to need $14.99 in credits to join Kay Vess and Nix on a new adventure. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Pirate's Fortune gives players the chance to join forces with Hondo Ohnaka, head of the Ohnaka Gang. Hondo will be a name familiar to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-the-clone-wars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a> fans and readers of the 2017 comic book series Star Wars: Darth Maul, and has even done time as one of the animatronic characters at the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge attraction.
