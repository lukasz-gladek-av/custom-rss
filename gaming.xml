		<p>Sports Interactive has confirmed that Football Manager 26 will be released on November 4th, with this date being revealed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3551340/Football_Manager_26/">Steam</a>. In addition to the release date confirmation, Sports Interactive has also released a new video that looks at the brand new user interface that players will be using with this being an overhaul for the series, with the old style being done away with.</p>

<p>The user interface for Football Manager 26 has a number of different cards and tiles that can make up your home screen, including fixtures, results, league tables, and inbox. The navigation bar has been moved from the side of the screen to the top, with the options being Portal, Squad, Recruitment, Match Day, Club, and Career. The new Bookmarks system allows you to quickly access the parts of the game that are most important to you. The search function has been overhauled too, allowing you to search for messages, players, training, clubs, staff, and entries from FMPedia to give you even more insight into the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a>, the global data firm that tracks videogame industry sales data and <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-of-worlds-gamers-drive-nearly-half-global-gaming-spend-north-america-europe-newzoo/">market trends</a> has published its <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/trend-reports/newzoo-global-games-market-report-2025">Global Games Market Report for 2025</a>, which includes plenty of interesting trends and predictions from Newzoo, and also reveals that it'll be videogame consoles, not mobile, that leads the growth in this year's videogame market, thanks to a boost from the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>One of the major headlines in the report is that the videogame industry will reach $188.8 billion in revenue in 2025, a 3.4% growth compared to 2024. For the mobile portion of the market, it'll generate $103 billion this year, a 2.9% growth from last year, with mobile games still representing the biggest chunk of the industry's revenue at 55%.</p>



<p>Another interesting layer Newzoo points out is that videogame players will make up 60% of the world's population, with 3 billion players on mobile, 936 million on PC, and 645 million on consoles, making for a total of 3.58 billion players across all gaming platforms worldwide.</p>



<p>A chunk of those will, of course, be playing on Nintendo Switch 2, but even with consoles driving revenue this year, mobile players are still the dominating force when it comes to the worldwide videogame playing population.</p>



<p>Newzoo also includes predictions for what the industry will look like in the next three years, saying that by 2028, the total market revenue will grow to $206.5 billion, with consoles predicted to have the biggest growth, not just from new hardware, but new major game releases like the coming Grand Theft Auto VI launch. Between consoles, PC, and mobile, Newzoo predicts consoles will have the most revenue growth at 4.7%.</p>



<p>Newzoo's player predictions for 2028 have console players growing to 688 million, and PC players passing the 1 billion mark for the first time in the industry's history. However, mobile players will still grow the by the largest amount, and at a faster rate than PC and console player growth.</p>



<p>"<em>2025 shows a market that's maturing - but no stagnating</em>," Newzoo writes in its concluding thoughts. "<em>Growth is there, it's just harder won. The winners will be the ones who lean into timing, retention, and ecosystem strength, not just the raw pursuit of new players</em>."</p>

            <p>
Look, we all know <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> is a weird little series. You can torture your Sims, meet fairies and werewolves and vampires, have half alien babies. So I feel like I shouldn't be all that surprised by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4's</a> next expansion pack, Adventure Awaits, seeing the return of imaginary friends. And yet here I am, taken aback and slightly horrified by the game's interpretation of imaginary friends in its first gameplay trailer.
</p>
<p>
I truly find them existentially uncomfortable. Imaginary friends come in the shape of four different dolls that can morph into humanoid creatures that will keep your Sim child company if no one else will. You can choose between four different personalities for them too, which includes Goofball, Creative, Competitive, and funniest of all, straight up Evil.

<p>
Worst of all, if your Sim child bonds with the imaginary friend enough, they can Pinocchio-style turn into a real human. A lot of ethical questions being raised here I'm not confident the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> game will answer, and quite honestly I don't know if I'd want them around my own kids (NB: I don't have any, but let's imagine I do for this joke to land).
</p><p>
That's not what the expansion pack is solely about, though, in fact it's mostly not about getting your children to create human life. Adventure Awaits also introduces three new neighbourhoods for your Sims to explore, with activities like fishing in mountain streams, sharing campfire stories, or just having a romantic retreat. This comes with a new feature, Scheduling Getaway, which allows your Sims to plan weekend trips or summer holidays. Alternatively, with the game's new Custom Venues and Getaway System, you can make your own getaway spots for your Sims to hang out in.
</p>
<p>
At least those retreats sound like a nice reprieve from the horrors presented by the imaginary friends. In any case, Adventure Awaits is out October 2nd, so you don't have to wait very long.

            <p>Have you brought batteries for your torch? Good. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s Deep of the Night update's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-evil-deep-of-night-mode-gets-a-release-date-but-some-people-are-already-playing-it">primed to arrive in the wee hours of tomorrow, September 11th</a>, and there's a pretty hefty balancing patch to dissect before it arrives.</p>
<p>I've cracked <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1022">the notes</a> open already and I'll be honest, I'm a bit surprised. Well, maybe concerned is the best way to put it. You see, the word increased is used an awful lot in relation to stuff you can do hurt an enemy. That seems fishy. Just what have you got planned to make lives miserable again once Deep of the Night drops at 2:30AM BST, FromSoft?</p>

<p>Let's start with version 1.02.2's batch of changes to each of the Nightfarer classes aside from Ironeye, who's presumably been left out because he must already be perfect. Wylder's gained more poise while casting claw shot, which now dishes out more stamina damage to blocking foes. The strength and dexterity gains Guardian earns on levelling up have been boosted, as has the range of their steel guard passive.</p><p>Duchess' dexterity gain on level up has also risen, some of her dagger attacks are more powerful, and her finale ultimate art has had its duration lengthened. The trade-off is a decrease in her two-handed dagger’s second heavy attack damage. Raider's greataxe and great hammer-induced stagger, Recluse's Magic Cocktail spells, and Executor's cursed sword attacks have all gotten more effective. Oh, and you can now walk straight through Revenant’s spirits, Helen and Frederick. I'm not sure whether that last one counts as a buff or nerf - let's call it a quirk.</p>
<p>On top of that, the stagger damage inflicted by dual-wielded jump attacks has been boosted across the board for small and medium arms, while it's been dialled down for larger weapons.</p>
<p>Flipping across to the everdark sovereigns, the famously tough Equilibrious Beast has gotten the most adjustments. "We have confirmed an issue where condemned Nightfarers summoned during this fight may not be rendered under specific conditions," Fromsoft also note in relation to that boss, promising to address that problem down the line. Aside from that, Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight look to have gotten slightly more powerful.</p>
<p>The Night’s Tide will also now dish out more damage after you beat the second night boss. A PC-specific tweak worth noting is that FromSoft reckon they've improved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a>'s stability "in some environments", so hopefully you'll find things run more smoothly in the Deep of the Night.</p>
<p>Right, there we go. Best of luck rolling in the deep. Assuming you've not jumped in early thanks to mods.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-75w-car-charger-with-dual-device-support-goes-for-peanuts-in-a-trending-amazon-deal-stock-moving-quickly-2000624524</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-75w-car-charger-with-dual-device-support-goes-for-peanuts-in-a-trending-amazon-deal-stock-moving-quickly.1293840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Forgive us for making a sweeping assumption, but we’re going to take a stab and say your car’s phone-charging situation could use a massive upgrade. Maybe your USB ports are located in that impossible to reach compartment behind the shifter, or your overly long cord is constantly getting in the way. Any shortcomings you might be dealing with are instantly fixable for a tiny price while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4021/">Amazon is running this limited-time $25 deal on the 75W Anker Nano Car Charger</a>.</p>
<p>The Anker Nano plugs into your car’s cigarette lighter and charges two devices independently, one via the 45W built-in retractable USB-C cable, and another via the open 30W USB-C port. The retractable cable extends to 29.5 inches, so anyone in the first 2 rows of your vehicle can access it. It’s also not just for smartphones — any USB-C device from your wireless earbuds to your laptop can get a rapid charge while you drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4021/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>NoMore Cable Drama</h2>
<p>Finding the perfect USB-C cable to reach from your car charger to your hands-free phone mount must be some kind of dark art, because they all seem to be either too short to reach or so long that they get in the way of your car’s touchscreen or other parts of the console. The retractable USB-C cable built into the Anker Nano Car Charger is, to put it mildly, an ingenious way to keep the car’s cockpit neat and organized, and it’s tested to endure over 10,000 retractions.</p>
<p>The second port in the Anker Nano Car Charger is tailor made for the front passenger, which beats having to split charging time on long drives. No matter how you share the two fast-charging ports of the Anker Nano Car Charger, there’s enough juice to take an iPhone 15 Pro from 0% to 50% in just 25 minutes, and a 2022 MacBook Air from 0% to 50% in 34 minutes. Android devices with USB-C charging ports are also compatible.</p>



<h2>Power Delivered Safely</h2>
<p>Anker bolsters the fast-charging power of the Nano Car Charger with the safety features they are famous for. Built-in ActiveShield 3.0 technology protects your devices from damage caused by overcurrent, overvoltage, and under-voltage, and also constantly monitors its own temperature and the temperature of your devices.</p>
<p>The hardest part of this whole deal isn’t the fast charging or the even the retractable cable. It’s the price — even without this Amazon deal, the Anker Nano Car Charger’s regular price is a modest $40. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4021/">But with this limited-time deal taking that down by 38%, it’s safe to say the Anker Nano is the best $25 charger you can find.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We’re coming up on the first anniversary of Nintendo’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-company-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-1851652124"><span>lawsuit against Pocketpair</span></a><span>, the developer of the edgy “</span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>with guns” survival game </span><i><span>Palworld</span></i><span>, on the grounds of patent infringement. Though many people called out </span><i><span>Palworld</span></i><span> for its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-palworld-ai-art-copyright-law-pocketpair-1851186580?_gl=1*21id2z*_ga*MTk4MjkyODk2OS4xNzExNTYxOTM0*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjcwMzk2My4xODguMS4xNzI2NzA0MDI1LjYwLjAuMA.."><span>suspiciously familiar character designs</span></a><span>, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company went after Pocketpair not for the appearance of its creatures but for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patents-lawsuit-pocketpair-1851692965"><span>in-game mechanics</span></a><span>, such as aiming and firing an “item” at a character in a field to trigger combat, capturing creatures in the wild, and riding on creatures you can swap between easily in an open world. These are extremely broad and non-specific, and if Nintendo felt like it, the company could easily go after plenty of other games beyond </span><i><span>Palworld </span></i><span>on those grounds. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company aren’t done patenting vague concepts in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>series, though, as the companies have just patented more mechanics in a development that could affect the entire monster-taming genre.</span></p> <p><a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/"><i><span>Games Fray</span></i></a><span>, a site dedicated to reporting on patent law and other legal issues in the video game industry, reports that Nintendo has received a U.S. patent for the mechanic of “summoning a character and letting it fight another.” The step-by-step breakdown of what this entails reads as follows:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>(1) A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored therein a game program, the game program causing a processor of an information processing apparatus to execute:</span></p> <p><span>(2) performing control of moving a player character on a field in a virtual space, based on a movement operation input;</span></p> <p><span>(3) performing control of causing a sub character to appear on the field, based on a first operation input, and</span></p> <p><span>(4) when an enemy character is placed at a location where the sub character is caused to appear, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a first mode in which the battle proceeds based on an operation input, and</span></p> <p><span>(5) when the enemy character is not placed at the location where the sub character is caused to appear, starting automatic control of automatically moving the sub character that has appeared; and</span></p> <p><span>(6) performing control of moving the sub character in a predetermined direction on the field, based on a second operation input, and, when the enemy character is placed at a location of a designation, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a second mode in which the battle automatically proceeds.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Again, this is a pretty general idea that is utilized in plenty of other games, from monster-taming rivals like </span><i><span>Digimon</span></i><span> to more general games like </span><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i><span> that include summonable creatures. It seems unlikely that Nintendo would suddenly start going after partners like Bandai Namco or Square Enix, who have released games on Nintendo platforms without issue, but on principle, Nintendo patenting vague mechanical ideas as a means of monopolizing a genre is a shitty look, and rubs against the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise’s image as something wholesome and joyful. Not that the facade hasn’t already fallen multiple times at this point. The Pokémon Company has so many problems with things like the quality of its games and with making decisions that enable scalpers to capitalize on its merchandise, problems it never really addresses because it’s too successful to fail. It sure has time to patent fairly standard video game mechanics to help it corner the market, though.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Palworld </span></i><span>lawsuit is ongoing, though Nintendo did </span><a href="https://screenrant.com/nintendo-palworld-lawsuit-update-pantents/"><span>make some changes to the phrasing of the suit</span></a><span> back in July.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pacific-drive-whispers-in-the-woods-expansion-promises-new-secrets-and-more-this-year.1293792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>developer Ironwood Studios and publisher Kepler Interactive have announced&nbsp;<em>Whispers in the Woods</em>, a brand new DLC expansion that will introduce new story elements, new anomalies, and much more.</p>

<p><em>Whispers in the Woods</em>, which is due out sometime this year, is distinct from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-endless-expeditions-update" rel="nofollow">previous</a> free <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-update-customization" rel="nofollow">updates</a> for the driving roguelike; it looks like it'll be a fully paid expansion that will bring a significant amount of new content to the game.</p>

<p>Per its Steam page,&nbsp;<em>Whispers in the Woods</em>&nbsp;will bring a new "8-12-hour story" to&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, and it'll be fully voiced as well, with new characters to get to know. Not only that, but you can jump into the expansion from either a new or an existing save, so even if you have a save file that's close to the game's conclusion, you can still play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pacific-drive-whispers-in-the-woods-mist.jpg?itok=E0dd8I5w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pacific-drive-whispers-in-the-woods-mist.jpg?itok=puW9ZR4G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pacific Drive</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Whispers in the Woods&nbsp;</em>expansion will get weird sometime this year.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also look forward to new maps and new junctions to explore, as well as unique resources to gather, and you'd better believe that new anomalies will be springing up across those maps to hinder (or perhaps help!) your progress.</p>

<p>Naturally, there will also be new cosmetic elements for you to add to your car, so if you didn't feel like your janky 70s wagon was already kitted out enough, then this DLC has you covered.</p>

<p><em>Whispers in the Woods&nbsp;</em>is also introducing a new system to&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>in the form of Artifacts, which Ironwood and Kepler say will "create mysterious changes and effects to you and the world around you".</p>

<p>You'll need to carry Artifacts in order to survive the expansion's new areas and dangers, but doing so also "increases the challenge you and your car will face", so you'll need to weigh up how much risk you want to take.</p>




<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Whispers in the Woods&nbsp;</em>expansion yet, but it'll presumably be available across all platforms on which the game can be found when it does arrive. In the meantime, you can remind yourself of what our very own Will thought of the base game by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pacific-drive" rel="nofollow">checking out their review here</a>.</p>

            <p>Historical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> will get new culture mechanics in its 2.0 update, developers Oxide Games and publishers Stardock have announced. As with culture features in certain Civilization games and - well, the only other specimen that comes to mind right now is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sins-solar-empire">Sins Of A Solar Empire</a>, this will allow you to claim territory without firing a shot, by dint of being way fancier and more refined than all those yokels across the border. Should the aforesaid yokels remain unmoved by your splendour, there's also a new Agitator unit that can be sent into foreign parts to foment rebellion.</p><!--more-->
<p>Agitators aside, the Revolutions update introduces a bunch of military units specific to each civ, such as Japanese Samurai and Mongol Horse Archers, and treats leader characters to a revamp with distinct traits and abilities.</p>
<p>They've introduced more "realistic natural resource clustering" for map generation together with revised rules for trade, and boldly claim to have made the AI smarter. But returning players may be most beguiled by the hot and spicy talk of cutting down on micromanagement. They've replaced the old production queues with "smarter stockpile and priority controls, freeing players to focus on high-level strategy". Filth!</p>
<p>All of which sounds like it might go some way towards addressing Sin's criticisms in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ara-history-untold-review">Ara: History Untold review</a>. "Empire-building re-envisaged as managing elaborate production chains, then re-re-envisaged as another 4X with repetitive micromanagement and weak, bland AI," was her brusque summary. It sounds like the bulk of the audience agreed, for the Revolutions update boasts of being heavily inspired by player feedback.</p><p>How does Culture work in Ara? It's a new quality of life category that generates Influence, this being a currency that can be spent on cultural traits and territory expansion, saving you the need for armed invasion. The Agitator unit is the basis for a second form of conquest that becomes available in the game's second act: ideological subversion.</p>
<p>According to Stardock CEO and Oxide co-founder Brad Wardell, these new methods of assimilation are partly designed to liven up the lategame, once the whole map has been exposed and the rival civs are fairly entrenched.</p>
<p>The update will make some technical improvements - "a sharper, scalable UI built for modern displays, with new accessibility and customization options" plus "major engine optimizations [that] deliver faster turns, smoother framerates, and reduced CPU usage". It's out 24th September, but there's a beta version available now - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2021880/view/507338294049112358?l=english">read more on Steam</a>, where Wardell has also posted some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2021880/view/507338927350218798?l=english">lengthy reflections</a> about the workings of strategy game AI.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! It’s cooling down where I live, which makes me so damn happy. Anyway, welcome to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we got a big update for a classic indie game, a way to get <em>Borderlands 4</em> for free, a hidden mode in <em>Silksong</em>, and Treyarch making more changes to what will and won’t transfer into next year’s <em>Call of Duty.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Treyarch Changes Its Plans With (Some) <em>Black Ops 6</em> Skins Again</h2> <p>The <em>Call of Duty</em> wacky cosmetics saga continues. Last month, following a large online<a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-call-of-duty-wacky-weird-skins-dev-explains-1851719188"> backlash against ugly crossover skins</a> and serious competition from<em> Battlefield 6</em>‘s popular and grounded beta, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-skins-black-ops-7-blops-6-carry-over-battlefield-6-2000620379">Activision and Treyarch announced that <em>BLOPS6′</em>s skins won’t carry over into </a><em>Black Ops 7.</em> The idea was to give the upcoming sequel a fresh start and not have people running around as Stan Smith from <em>American Dad</em> on day one. A lot of people liked this change, but not everyone was happy that the skins they’d worked hard for would not be moving forward. So uh, Treyarch is making some more changes.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">That's not all! The Guild Override camo is joining the Zombies Main Quest Reward &amp; "New Orders" Operator skins, and will be available at the launch of Black Ops 7 for those who digitally Pre-Order 🔥 <a href="https://t.co/Jz3GoZZyTq">pic.twitter.com/Jz3GoZZyTq</a></p> <p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1965567701574975757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1965567701574975757">On September 10, Treyarch announced on social media</a> that some zombie-related skins would now carry over into<em> Black Ops 7</em>. Specifically, the Operator Skin rewards earned by completing main quests and the New Orders Prestige Level 1000 cosmetic items. So no, it doesn’t seem like all the wacky crossover skins from last year will be showing up in <em>Black Ops 7</em>, but who knows? Treyarch and Activision are changing things up so fast right now that in a few weeks, this might all be out the window. It’s almost like Activision is a bit nervous about how much of a bite <em>Battlefield 6</em> might take out of it this holiday season.</p>

 <h2>Drink Enough Beers, And You Might Get A Free Copy Of <em>Borderlands 4</em></h2> <p>Do you like drinking beer? Do you like <em>Borderlands 4</em>? Do you like free video games? Are you tired of answering my questions? Well, I’ll stop and explain that Gearbox, 2K, and beer maker Voodoo Ranger have teamed up for a new promotion. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-beer-includes-a-copy-of-the-game-if-youre-lucky/1100-6534578/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">As spotted by <em>GameSpot</em></a>, a bunch of specifically branded Voodoo Ranger beers will contain various <em>Borderlands 4</em> rewards, including 1,000 free copies of <em>Borderlands 4.</em> So to have a decent shot, all you need to do is buy like 200 beers, and that probably isn’t very expensive, right? I don’t drink booze, so let me do a quick search online and…oh my god!</p> <h2>There’s A Hidden, Much Harder Mode In <em>Silksong</em></h2> <p>Since the moment it was released earlier this month, popular 2D action platformer <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> has been at the center of quite the discourse around video game difficulty. Some people say it’s too hard, others say it’s not too bad, and still others are just skipping all of this and modding the game to make it easier. Well, don’t worry, there’s a secret difficulty option hidden in the game behind the Konami cheat code. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1n8d1xc/cheat_code_discovery_not_joke/">But this newly discovered secret mode</a> actually makes <em>Silksong</em> much, much harder as you can only die once. Good luck with that!</p> <h2>The 14-Year-Old <em>Binding Of Issac</em> Just Got A Massive Update</h2> <p>Yeah, sure, the creator behind 2011’s roguelike classic<em> The Binding of Issac</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-years-after-it-was-announced-binding-of-isaac-creator-finally-shares-a-release-date-for-his-next-game-2000623148">recently announced </a>the release date for his long-awaited next game, but that doesn’t mean he can’t keep working on his OG hit. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/521976260528701584">On September 9, Edmund McMillen announced a big new update for </a><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/521976260528701584"><em>Isaac</em></a> that includes many, many changes and tweaks to the beloved indie game. I expect I’ll be in my 60s and still reading about new updates for this game.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465"><em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> looks even better on Switch 2 now</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-car-cloud-gaming-lg-kia-2000624462">Apparently, your car might be an Xbox.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-hard-mode-time-changes-2000624664</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/9-things-you-need-to-know-before-starting-elden-ring-nightreign%E2%80%98s-new-hard-mode.1293780/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s new hard mode, Deep of Night, is about to go live, and publisher Bandai Namco has released a new explainer on YouTube helping to onboard fans to the multiplayer roguelite’s most challenging content yet. Combined with reams of datamined clues over the past month, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect heading into it. FromSoftware will no doubt have a few surprise curveballs hiding up its sleeve, but the announced changes alone should be enough to make even veteran Nightfarers feel like naïve grist for the Soulslike mill all over again.</p> <h2>When does Deep of Night go live?</h2>  <p>In keeping with all past updates, <em>Nightreign</em>‘s new mode is set to be available in the game starting around 9:00 p.m. ET on September 10 across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.</p> <h2>Nightlords and shifting Earth events will be completely random</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624683" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624683"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624683">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>In Deep of Night, players wont get to pick which bosses they face ahead of time, or choose which Shifting Earth events are active. Relic choices and builds will all have to be adapted to on the fly. You’ll want to have multiple relic presets ready so you can choose after seeing what Nightlord you’re facing before the match loads.</p>

 <h2>Enemies hit way harder</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624682" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624682"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624682">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>A clip from the Deep of Night trailer shows trash mobs taking several more hits to fall at the start of a run. According to datamines, most enemies in the first depth will have around double their normal health and power, with stats only ramping up from there.</p> <h2>Items come with more buffs and debuffs</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624680" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624680"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624680">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>Players will have to be a lot more careful about what they pick up when they’re running around Limveld. While gear comes with extra buff slots, it also comes with a debuff that will make it easier to die. Examples shown include status ailment buildup upon getting hit and taking more damage from the Night’s Tide.</p>

 <h2>New red mutated enemies are extra tough but drop new rare gear</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624681"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624681">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>These variants will be even stronger, potentially stopping a run dead in its tracks. Hoping to swoop through a mine for a quick crafting stone? Thought you could demolish that Cathedral golem all by yourself? Not this time! But with the greater risk comes greater rewards. It seems like these red enemies will also drop red gear with new powers that will probably end up making or breaking runs.</p> <h2>Additional Deep Relic slots expand buildcrafting</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624678" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624678"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624678">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>Players will have access to three additional relic slots that can only be filled with relics earned from Deep of Night. That’s because these will each come with negative stats as well as positive ones. According to datamines, examples include ones that completely invert character’s usual stat progressions. Fighters can become spell casters, squishy glass cannons can become tanks. It looks like Deep of Night will completely turn the established build metas on their heads.</p>

 <h2>Sometimes the map will be completely empty</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624677" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624677"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624677">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>There are at least two randomly occurring events we currently know about in Deep of Night. The first will hide the Nightlord icon for the entire run so you have no idea who you’re facing at the end. The other will erase every icon from the map so you have no idea what camps are where. Players will just have to wing it or rely on their memorization of the probabilities from the hundreds of randomized seeds a run can pull from.</p> <h2>Completing runs earns rank points to unlock challenging depths</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624684"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624684">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>This scoring system will double as a skill-based matchmaking system for grouping you with other Deep of Night players. Once you progress out of Depth 1 you can never go back, but every Depth after that can see you pushed back to an earlier one if you keep failing.</p>

 <h2>Everdark Sovereign bosses can appear</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624675" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624675"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624675">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>That’s right, ED Libra and the gang could be what greets you at the end of an already harrowing run. Good thing you’ve spent months practicing each of those variants, right? Right??</p> <h2>The Bell Bearing Hunter just got scarier</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624679" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624679"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624679">FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>The game’s hardest field boss can also be one of its red variants. Have fun! I’m sure wasting five minutes trying to kill him will be totally worth it. If you want to find out more about what to expect out of Deep of Night before embarking on your own run, YouTuber Scavinjx <a href="https://youtu.be/Lj6hgSh2AxM">has a great breakdown</a> of many of the new relic effects, passives, and exact damage and health multipliers based on recent datamined info.</p>

<p>As recently as August, Nintendo reiterated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-is-still-scheduled-to-launch-within-the-next-150-days/1100-6533663/" data-ref-id="1100-6533663">a 2025 release window for Metroid Prime 4</a>, and there may be further word later this week during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-confirmed-for-september-12/1100-6534609/" data-ref-id="1100-6534609">the Nintendo Direct scheduled for September 12</a>. For now, we can only speculate about what that might entail.</p><p>Metroid Prime 4 has been in development since 2017, but the initial version of the game was scrapped. In 2019, Nintendo announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/">development for Metroid Prime 4 was restarting</a> under Retro Studios, the studio that developed the first three Metroid Prime games.</p><p>Nintendo showed off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-re-revealed-with-impressive-trailer-and-2025-release-date/1100-6524332/">the first look at Metroid Prime 4 in 2024</a>, followed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-gameplay-deep-dive-slick-new-suit/1100-6530408/" data-ref-id="1100-6530408">a longer preview last March</a> that demonstrated Samus' new suit and abilities. Metroid Prime 4 will be available on Switch and Switch 2, but only the latter will utilize <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/">the Joy-Con 2's mouse controls</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="September Direct" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9cf6e645c0d4e/september-direct.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's marketing for the Switch and Switch 2 is going absolutely <em>nuts</em> in 2025. We had a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Partner Showcase</a> in July, an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">a Kirby blowout</a> in August, and now we're getting a full-fat, juicy Direct in September. Crikey!</p>
<p>Naturally, questions linger regarding the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, but the nature of this Direct means that we could be getting a whole bunch of new surprises for the remainder of 2025 and the start of 2026. At least we won't be seeing any <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>, though, eh? Well, probably not.</p>
<p>Mario himself is also celebrating his 40th anniversary this week, with the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> having launched on 13th September 1985 in Japan. Surely Nintendo will want to acknowledge this in the Direct, but honestly, who knows?</p>
<p>We've got a lot to ponder here, so let's find out what Team NL is expecting in the upcoming showcase...</p>

<figure><a title="Hades" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1571b8bab15ab/hades.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Supergiant Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a>. I've asked for this a few times this year, and realistically, I think this is the place it will show up the most. It was in two earlier Directs, and with a Switch 2 Edition also coming, I think a big headliner showcase like this is the way forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades II</a>'s release date also seems like a good shout, but good lord, do <em>not</em> shadow drop, give us a little bit of a breather. I can't deal with two sequels to two of my favourite games back-to-back.</p>
<p>For Mario's anniversary... geez, it sure would be nice to get a special edition Switch 2 or something. But, realistically, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a> on Switch Online and <em>maybe</em> an update to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">3D All-Stars</a>. You know, that excellent sequel that's missing from the package</p>
<p>And, one final Wild Card for you Jim: <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Princ</a><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">e</a>. Give it to us! <em>Please</em>.</p>
<p>I will leave the Big Beyond to our big ol' Samus fan below.</p>
<h2>(Un)known (un)knowns - Gavin Lane, editor</h2>
<figure><a title="Hotel Barcelona" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/34b650949f582/hotel-barcelona.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Cult Games Limited</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Dates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII</a> are fairly safe bets; there are various other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-all-confirmed-games-and-release-dates#q4-2025">stragglers with vague '2025' dates</a>, too. There's still potential for more big news from Microsoft (Call of Duty is coming to Switch, remember?). And I'd love to see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/hotel_barcelona">Hotel Barcelona</a> announced for Switch 2.</p>
<p>What I'm hoping for is <em>new</em> info, though. Games and dates and details we didn't know about before. We've got "roughly 60 minutes" here, but every minute taken up with known knowns (hi, Pokémon) will be a hit on our collective Excit-o-meters. After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-switch-2-needed-a-partner-showcase-with-pep-this-wasnt-it">July's underwhelming Partner Showcase</a>, Nintendo needs to bring out the big guns.</p>
<p>The fact that we're not getting a Mario-specific Direct suggests that we're not going to see loads of Mario material. But, you can be sure there'll be a section devoted to the 40th anniversary, so I'll double down on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/what-we-expect-from-nintendo-for-super-mario-bros-40th-anniversary">my <strong>Mario Maker 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</strong> prediction</a>.</p>
<p>If they <em>really</em> want to make this Direct cook, however, Nintendo should finish with a tease for the next big Mario game. I'd argue they need that level of pep to supercharge things and signal their biggest games for 2026...but it's a coin toss. With Donkey Kong Bananza on the system, maybe they'd want to keep the platforming focus on that for the holidays? But I'd have said the same thing about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> and Mario Kart. Hey, it's 60 minutes - plenty of time that needs filling with games old and new.</p>
<p>Though please, Mr. Sakurai, let's not fill it with a 25-minute deep-dive explaining the alpha effects behind Kirby's star trail, hmm?</p>

<p>It's time to get some <strong>Resident Evil</strong> on the Switch 2, right? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rumour-resident-evil-requiem-could-be-heading-to-the-switch-2">Rumours have circulated</a> that not only is Capcom planning to launch <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Requiem</a> on Nintendo's new console, but also the entire RE Engine catalogue. I'd love to see all of them, of course, but if I had to pick just one, then it would be <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>. With the franchise's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/capcom-launches-resident-evil-30th-anniversary-website">30th anniversary</a> on the horizon, I suspect Capcom will want to take advantage of the Switch 2's early momentum.</p>
<p>We're definitely due a launch date for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and I'm still pretty convinced we'll see it at the start of December. I'm happy to be proven wrong, mind you! Otherwise, like Gavin, I'm very keen to see some brand-new games. Ports are great, but they'll only get you so far.</p>
<p>Is it too early for <strong>Pikmin 5</strong>? How about a new <strong>Animal Crossing</strong>? Lots of possibilities, and I'm honestly just excited to see what Nintendo has up its sleeve.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Embark Studios has revealed and launched Season 8 for The Finals, bringing new enhancements to the in-game destruction that helped make the game popular in the first place, two new weapons that players have been waiting for, and more.</p>



<p>Season 8, titled Game Time, adds what Embark Studios is calling "<em>Smooth Destruction</em>" to The Finals. Per a press release from Embark Studios, you'll now see elements in-game like "<em>cranes cutting through buildings and suspended structures reacting more realistically with massive impact</em>."</p>



<p>The two new weapons coming to The Finals in Season 8 are a P90 SMG for the Medium class and a BFR Revolver for the Heavy class. The P90 is especially significant for The Finals, since it's the first SMG being introduced to the Medium class, and will likely have a major impact on the game's meta.</p>



<p>Embark Studios also debuted a new trailer for Season 8 of The Finals, showing off the new destruction elements and the new weapons. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Other quality-of-life improvements in Season 8 include the addition of an instant replay that show what your opponent saw during an intense moment, the arrival of mouse and keyboard controls for players on consoles, and a new match recap landing page that is meant to give you more detailed and easy-to-read stats from your previous match.</p>



<p>And of course, there will also be a new battle pass for players to work through in Season 8 with a slew of cosmetics to grab, including a few new cosmetic areas that can help you stand out even more when jumping into the arena.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-27-inch-smart-monitor-with-free-live-tv-channels-is-nearly-50-off-a-practically-free-tv-replacement-2000624483</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung’s M5 Series FHD smart monitor is on sale over at Amazon. There are two different size models. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4020/">The 27-inch is normally $280, but after a 46% discount it comes to just $150.</a> The 32-inch has come down from $300 by 27% to just $220. Those prices are for the black option. You can also choose a sleek all-white version. The price and discount for that one are the same as the black for the 32-inch. However, the 27-inch white model is onl;y down to $230 which is notably $10 more than the 32-inch is going for. So unless space is that much of a concern, there’s really no good reason to choose the 27-inch white over the 32-inch white.</p>
<p>As a smart monitor, this display is equipped with a full Samsung TV interface which you can stream movies and shows to. You can even get live TV channels at no extra cost. Essentially it’s a small HD TV that you can also control with a mouse and keyboard. It does also come with a remote.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4020/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Samsung M5 smart monitor has embedded productivity apps including the full Microsoft 365 suite. You can bypass needing a PC by just accessing Word, PowerPoint, or Excel on the monitor directly.</p>
<p>The display is fully adjustable on a swivel and tilt stand so you can always have it position optimally depending on where you’re sitting and where you have it set up.</p>



<h2>Samsung Gaming Hub</h2>
<p>A real selling point is Gaming Hub. This is Samsung’s built-in interface to stream popular video game titles right to your TV, or rather in this case, right to your monitor. It doesn’t even require an Xbox consoles — just get yourself a controller and subscription to Xbox Game Pass and you’ll be ready to play. Nothing to download either. All the titles can be streamed from the cloud.</p>
<p>As a subscriber to Xbox Game Pass, you’ll gain access to hundreds of awesome games ranging from indie darlings like <em>Celeste</em>&nbsp;to giant AAA hits like the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>. Or pop on over into a new <em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>server with some friends. The long-awaited <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>is finally here and yes, it too is on Game Pass. New titles arrive to the service every month and you will gain access to even more games as it includes an EA Play membership.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4020/">Grab you Samsung M5 smart monitor for as low as $150 for a limited time over at Amazon.</a></p>

Many took this to mean Activision was reacting to the online discussion about Call of Duty's wacky and weird skins, but the company never said as much. </p><p>While most guns, skins, and operators from Black Ops 6 will not carry forward to Black Ops 7, double XP tokens and GobbleGums for Zombies will indeed carry forward. Also worth noting is that these changes only apply to Black Ops 7--your Black Ops 6 content will still carry forward to Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">everyone will be able to try the game during the multiplayer beta in early October.</a></p>
