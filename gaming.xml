		<p>The bird &amp; bear are back, with Banjo-Tooie, their second Nintendo 64 adventure, flapping onto <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> next week.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo 64™ – October 2024 Game Update – Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJgHERWE_eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/19/banjo-kazooie-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-onlines-n64-library-20-january/">almost three years after the first game was added</a>, Banjo-Tooie will be available in the N64 app for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers from 25th October. It’s the first time that this has been available through a Nintendo emulation system, which is pretty exciting for those who missed out on the original, or don’t have an Xbox for Rare Replay.</p>
<p>Originally released for N64 in 2000 (and in April 2001 in the EU), Banjo-Tooie was at the tail end of the N64 generation and was in many ways the culmination of Rare’s time with the 3D platformer genre – Conker’s Bad Fur Day was a lewd fever dream that came out the following year, and bizarrely a week before the EU release of Tooie.</p>
<p>Building on the original game’s riff on the Super Mario 64 formula, and filled with a collect-a-thon of Jigglies and musical notes, Banjo-Tooie takes things to the next level in a number of ways. Rare was able to bring back some cut content and ideas from the original, but pushing the N64 even harder by featuring direct connections between its worlds for a more contiguous adventure, where the original had you teleport into each level. That’s featured in some of the game’s puzzles, which span multiple worlds.</p>

<p>The game also features multiplayer for four players, adapting the competition mode from the single-player to give first-person shooting, football and other minigames. It’s not entirely clear that this is included in the Switch Online version, but will be interesting to see.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-due-to-hit-early-access-in-2025-co-op-play-confirmed.1013367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton and Unknown Worlds have revealed that long-awaited survival sequel&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>is officially due to land in Early Access next year, and that the game will incorporate an oft-requested co-op feature.</p>
<p>During yesterday's Xbox Partner Preview showcase, Krafton and Unknown Worlds showed off the first official&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>teaser, and while it didn't give much away about the game, the Steam page and various other listings were also updated to reveal more.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>, you'll play as "a pioneer traveling to a distant world", and you'll have to explore a brand new aquatic alien world brimming with resources to gather, biomes to discover, and unique creatures to...well, to swim away from screaming, if it's anything like the first game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-reveal-creature.jpg?itok=J-xELovL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-reveal-creature.jpg?itok=UI9eZEAt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>will bring...what the hell is that? It'll bring whatever the hell that is.</figcaption></figure><p>More Leviathans will be lying in wait to ambush you, of course, and you'll also discover "diverse ecosystems", although rather mysteriously, Unknown Worlds says "something isn't right" with this world, asking "what happened here? What happened to you? And more importantly, where are you?".</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-2024-live-service">previously revealed by Unknown Worlds</a>,&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>will feature optional co-op play for up to four players, but the developer is keen to emphasize that you can also play alone if you prefer.</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>below. It doesn't give away much about the game or what its story will be, but it does show off a couple of interesting-looking creatures, and it features a sound effect that will probably trigger some "fond" memories if you've played the first game.</p>

<p><em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>is shaping up to be the first "proper" sequel to 2018's&nbsp;<em>Subnautica</em>. That game was followed up by a sort of sequel-come-expansion pack,&nbsp;<em>Subnautica: Below Zero</em>, in 2021, but&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2 </em>looks to be&nbsp;more of a full-blooded followup.</p>
<p>Whether the new game will follow the more narrative-led approach of&nbsp;<em>Below Zero&nbsp;</em>or the open-ended exploration of the original&nbsp;<em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen.&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in Early Access in 2025.</p>

It has a metascore of 56 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic</a> and a 'mostly negative' user review rating on Steam. IGN’s own <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-single-player-campaign-review">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 single-player campaign review</a> returned a 4/10. We said: “Underbaked, rehashed, and cobbled together from multiplayer parts, Modern Warfare 3’s single-player campaign is everything a Call of Duty story mode shouldn’t be.” <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-campaign-review-vapid-and-hastily-assembled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> added: “Clearly rushed to market, Modern Warfare 3's campaign tapes together ill-conceived open areas, underwhelming linear missions, and a meaningless story.” In short, it was all a bit of a disaster.</p><p>A year later and Call of Duty fans are yet again faced with another campaign from the first-person shooter behemoth, this time the Raven Software-developed <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> campaign. IGN has just reported on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6-is-set-to-be-the-most-varied-call-of-duty-campaign-ever">how Black Ops 6 is set to offer the most varied Call of Duty campaign ever</a>, but did Raven tweak anything in response to the reaction to Modern Warfare 3, or perhaps learn any lessons from Modern Warfare 3’s campaign?</p><p>Not so, Jon Zuk, associate creative director at Raven Software, told IGN in an interview.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“The campaign… all game development is very fluid and we react to a lot of different things, but in the case of the previous game’s reception, we were already pretty locked in on the story we were telling and the missions we were creating,” Zuk said. “So we didn't react to how that was received.”</p><p>One key point of difference between the developments of Modern Warfare 3, led by Sledgehammer Games, and Black Ops 6, led by Treyarch, is time. Modern Warfare 3, originally conceived as an expansion pack for 2022’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-2022">Modern Warfare 2</a>, reportedly imposed crunch on its developers as they battled to create a fully-fledged sequel in just 16 months. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-report-reveals-that-modern-warfare-3-development-time-was-half-that-of-a-normal-call-of-duty">Sledgehammer studio head Aaron Halon has insisted Modern Warfare 3 was “years in the making.”</a></p><p>Black Ops 6, however, has enjoyed a longer development time than any other mainline Call of Duty game. Treyarch has worked on it for four years, ever since <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Black Ops Cold War</a> came out in 2020. And for the campaign, Raven too has benefited from this extra time.</p><p>“The extra development time certainly gives us time to do a little bit more prototyping and a little bit more trying something out, finding out if it's fun and if it works and throwing some things away,” Zuk explained.</p><p>“When you have the shorter development cycle, sometimes you're stuck with things just for the time crunch that maybe you aren't as happy with as you could be. So I do feel like we had good opportunities to keep crafting and recrafting the missions until we were happy with them.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even if you do try to do the speed run version of it, it is going to be longer than Cold War.</p></div><p>Players can also expect Black Ops 6’s campaign to be longer than Cold War’s, Zuk confirmed, although your mileage may vary depending on how much time you spend back at your safehouse hub.</p><p>“You can go back, you can talk to your team, you can upgrade your weapon and your equipment and things like that,” Zuk said. “And you can do a little bit of searching around the safehouse , but there's players who are going to do all of that, and there's players who are going to do none of that and are just, I want to get to the next mission as quickly as possible.</p><p>“So I think that the game length is going to be variable from player to player, but even if you do try to do the speed run version of it, it is going to be longer than Cold War.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-wave-2-october-2024-lineup-headlined-by-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6 is of course the first Call of Duty game to launch straight into Game Pass</a>, Microsoft’s subscription service. It comes after Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard for an eye-watering $69 billion, and has sparked a debate about whether the move will cannibalize sales of the game.</p><p>But will launching straight into Game Pass have a meaningful impact on the number of people who play Black Ops 6’s campaign? Unlike with previous Call of Duty games, Activision is not releasing an early access campaign for Black Ops 6, which means everyone jumps in at the same time from October 25.</p><p>Zuk said that from Raven’s perspective, it’s trusting owner and publisher Activision to do what’s best for the game. “I have no input in the business side of that at all,” Zuk replied. “The decision was made to not do early access this year, and I trust that Activision has thought out every bit of this and is very confident in the success of the title.”</p><p>We've also got confirmation of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-multiplayer-maps-modes-and-operators-confirmed"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's launch Multiplayer maps, modes, and Operators</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preload-and-global-launch-times-pc-system-requirements-and-102-gb-storage-requirement"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's preload and global launch times</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-cloud-gaming-launching-with-170-gam/1100-6482120/" data-ref-id="1100-6482120">launched Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> in 2020 with great fanfare, but the company's stated goal to push cloud gaming even further has run into some technological setbacks as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-apple-sparring-again-over-cloud-gaming-apps/1100-6526265/" data-ref-id="1100-6526265">ongoing conflicts with Google and Apple</a> over multiple issues. But now a new report indicates that Microsoft is making a renewed effort to extend the reach of Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p><p>A report released earlier this month stated that Microsoft will soon be testing its ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-will-soon-let-players-stream-all-their-games-not-just-those-on-game-pass-report/1100-6527140/" data-ref-id="1100-6527140">let Xbox owners stream any game in their library</a> even if it isn't on Game Pass. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272630/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-future-notepad" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, that's just the beginning of Microsoft's plans. The company is reportedly looking to add even more cloud-gaming features and introduce direct-to-cloud controllers.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEulk3Ar00I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NEulk3Ar00I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The report credits the developer of the Better xCloud app for discovering Xbox's direct-to-cloud controller support, which apparently isn't quite ready to be rolled out yet. For now, Microsoft's priority is said to be focused on improving the visual quality of its streams in a bid to make it possible to play Xbox games without a console that can perform at the same level as the Xbox Series X|S. There will supposedly be forward momentum for allowing higher bitrates on Xbox Cloud Gaming "soon." However, fixing and upgrading Xbox Cloud Gaming's ongoing latency issues will reportedly take more time and "require more powerful hardware."</p><p>If Microsoft can deliver on all of those changes and give console-free gamers a comparable or better experience to having an Xbox Series X|S, then it seems likely to further erode the sales of physical consoles. Microsoft and Sony have both released digital-only consoles this generation, but if Microsoft really can remove the need for a physical console altogether then that might shake up the industry even more--although it didn't work so well for Google's Stadia.</p>

<p><em>Banjo-Tooie&nbsp;</em>joins the original&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, which was added to Switch Online's N64 contingent <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/banjo-kazooie-arrives-on-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-today-with-the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask-up-next/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all the way back in 2022</a>. If you've been waiting all this time to play the sequel, then hey, now's your chance!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/banjo-tooie-nintendo-switch-online-ledge.jpg?itok=AphDlO0z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/banjo-tooie-nintendo-switch-online-ledge.jpg?itok=mcKW_EeB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Banjo-Tooie&nbsp;</em>is coming to Nintendo Switch Online next week.</figcaption></figure><p>The Switch Online version of&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Tooie&nbsp;</em>features widescreen support, but otherwise, it's pretty much the same classic Nintendo 64-era 3D platformer you know and love.</p>
<p>If you haven't played&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Tooie</em>, it's a sequel to Rare's 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, and it sees the titular bear and bird returning to once again do battle with the evil witch Gruntilda.</p>
<p><em>Banjo-Tooie</em>'s levels are much larger than those of&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, and there's a lot more to discover in them as well. Many of the levels are interconnected, so you may not be able to collect everything within one stage until you've visited another.</p>
<p>The game also features several new moves for Banjo and Kazooie to learn, as well as new gameplay styles, including&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>-esque first-person shooter segments and the ability to play as the shaman Mumbo Jumbo.</p>

<p>Nintendo's announcement comes just as the company gears up to begin playtesting a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-new-feature-playtest">mysterious new</a> Switch Online feature, the playtest for which begins the day before&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Tooie&nbsp;</em>is scheduled to land on the subscription service.</p>
<p>It also comes just a couple of days after the fresh reveal of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-2025">Analogue 3D</a>, a reimagined version of the Nintendo 64 that plays original cartridges with no emulation required.</p>
<p>If you're a 3D platformer fan, you can also look forward to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playtonicgames.com/news/announcing-yooka-replaylee/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Yooka-Replaylee</em></a>, a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Banjo&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee&nbsp;</em>that's set to debut sometime in the future.</p>

<p>A Call of Duty exploit has surfaced online, revealing that the RICOCHET anti-cheat has falsely banned thousands of players. </p>



<p>How the exploit works was uploaded by X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/zebleerpo/status/1847024778600689706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@zebleerpo</a>, which revealed how the RICOCHET anti-cheat was being abused by people who wanted to get others banned. The TL;DR is that the words “Trigger Bot” sent to users as messages or even as a part of an online ID in a Friend Request will activate RICHOCHET and ban innocent players.</p>



<p>Activision apparently learned of the exploit before it was uploaded to X and announced that it had “restored all accounts” to a “small number of legitimate player accounts.” It’s currently unclear how many accounts were legitimately affected. </p>



<p>One such account was that of popular streamer <a href="https://x.com/BobbyPoff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BobbyPoff</a>, who has now been unbanned and has been a punching bag of accusations and abuse for the past several weeks. </p>



<p>One issue that the original poster points out is that legitimate cheaters might also be unbanned depending on how RICOCHET is unbanning players. “Real cheaters who were caught by these signatures will get unbanned,” they said. </p>



<p>RICOCHET has said that it will have a new blog up later today on the Road to Launch ‘Progress Report’ of its anti-cheat system, so we’ll update readers later today.</p>

            <p>Sony has lost its fight to prevent third party add-ons being sold for PlayStation games.</p>
<p>The European Court of Justice has dismissed Sony's claim that the Action Replay cheat software sold by UK company Datel infringed its copyright.</p>
<p>PlayStation asserted that as Datel's boosts use its source code, the company was infringing its copyright under EU law. The case was first taken to court back in 2012.</p>

</div><figcaption>When it costs £700, who exactly is the PS5 Pro for?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb7vhF2ELZg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/10/17/eu-court-upholds-right-to-sell-playstation-add-ons-in-loss-for-sony-datel-game-mods">EuroNews</a>, judges said that Datel's cheats do "not change or reproduce either the object code, the source code, or the internal structure and organisation of Sony's software", but "merely changes the content of the variables temporarily transferred by Sony’s games to the console's RAM, which are used during the running of the game".</p>
<p>"The directive protects only the intellectual creation as it is reflected in the text of the computer program's source code and object code," the court said.</p>
<p>"The Court finds that the content of the variable data transferred by a computer program to the RAM of a computer and used by that program in its running does not fall within the protection specifically conferred by that directive, in so far as that content does not enable such a program to be reproduced or subsequently created."
</p>
<p>In a non-binding opinion prepared for the case earlier this year, Advocate General Maciej Szpunar insisted it was not illegal to use any copyrighted work in a way that may differ from the creator's intentions.</p>
<p>"The author of a detective novel cannot prevent the reader from skipping to the end of the novel to find out who the killer is, even if that would spoil the pleasure of reading and ruin the author's efforts to maintain suspense," Szpunar said.</p><p>Yesterday we reported that former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden - who served as CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America and chairman of Worldwide Studios before leaving the company in 2019 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-playstation-exec-says-console-makers-need-to-compete-on-content-instead-of-fighting-over-teraflops">was asked if the console industry's current business model was sustainable</a>, given the increasing development costs associated with the ongoing pursuit of incrementally more powerful hardware.</p>
<p>"We've done these things this way for 30 years," Layden replied, "every generation those costs went up and we realigned with it. We've reached the precipice now, where the centre can't hold, we cannot continue to do things that we have done before."</p></div>

            <p>Sony has released its new customisable Welcome Hub for PlayStation 5 in the UK.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-ps5-system-update-adds-customisable-welcome-hub">announced the software update back in September</a>, with a rollout "over the coming weeks" - now it's available here.</p>
<p>The Welcome Hub appears on the home screen and provides an at-a-glance look at various elements, all through customisable widgets.</p>

<p>For instance, you can now quickly see who from your friends list is online, how much battery is left in your controller, messages received, how much storage space is left, you current trophies, and more.</p>
<p>If that sounds familiar to US users, the Welcome Hub is essentially a reworked version of the Explore tab previously only available in that country.</p>

<p>Users can also select from a number of backgrounds for the tab, including animated options or screenshots, and widgets are easily enabled or disabled.</p>
<p>Sony's original announcement for the Welcome Hub was notable for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-removes-ps-vr2-charging-icon-from-welcome-hub-blog-post-as-wireless-speculation-grows">strange inclusion in an accompanying screenshot of what looked like a charging icon for PS VR</a> - a device that isn't battery operated.</p>
<p>The blog post was swiftly updated to switch the screenshot and no further comment was provided.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-might-finally-get-improved-bitrates-soon/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this month, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-to-let-you-stream-your-own-games-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Microsoft is finally allowing users to stream their own games through Xbox Cloud Gaming next month. Now, Warren has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272630/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-future-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> additional information on Microsoft's plans for Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>
<p>The cloud streaming service formerly known as Project XCloud has long lagged behind its competitors in terms of latency and quality. Whereas NVIDIA GeForce NOW started offering 4K resolution support <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-brings-4k-to-pc-and-mac-3-new-star-wars-games-120-fps-support-to-more-mobile-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">years ago</a> and Boosteroid has followed suit recently, Xbox Cloud Gaming is still limited to 1080p resolution with low bitrates, resulting in much worse visuals.</p>
<p>According to Warren, Microsoft is taking steps to improve the bitrates soon, which will certainly help with visual clarity. However, he did not mention an actual resolution improvement, so it's possible Xbox Cloud Gaming will remain stuck at 1080p for a while yet. Moreover, he noted that any latency improvement would have to be tied to an upgrade in the server hardware. It didn't sound like that would happen any time soon.</p>
<p>Warren also commented on two work-in-progress features that were sort of leaked by the creator of <a href="https://better-xcloud.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Better XCloud</a>, a free and open source application that improves the XCloud experience on various devices. The first feature is <a href="https://x.com/redphx/status/1838509481371799905" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Together</a>, a way to play games and hang out with friends while inside a browser. The second is a <a href="https://x.com/redphx/status/1821329541476053075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">direct-to-cloud controller</a> that could cut on the latency, just like the Google Stadia controller did. According to Warren, while both features were being tested internally, Xbox Together was really just a 'hackathon project' that is unlikely to ever be released to the public. The direct-to-cloud controller thing is still being worked on, though, and might be launched at some point.</p>
<p>Overall, Warren reckons Microsoft is once again working hard on Xbox Cloud Gaming. It was, after all, the key in their plan to reach a much bigger audience than what's otherwise possible just with consoles and PCs. To that end, earlier this week, they proudly <a href="https://wccftech.com/stream-three-call-of-duty-games-with-game-pass-from-25-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and Call of Duty: Warzone will all be available for cloud streaming for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p>

<p>Vikala will be released on October 25th. She joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-reveals-new-dlc-character-vanes-release-date-and">Vane</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-reveals-first-look-at-beatrix-and-vane-dlc-characters">Beatrix</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-reveals-2b-from-nier-automata-dlc-on-top-of-vane-and"><em>Nier: Automata</em>'s 2B</a> as downloadable fighters (although the latter is sadly not likely to be documented on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yoko-taro-fan-archive-cease-and-desist-square-enix">Yoko Taro fansite Accord's Library</a> anytime soon).</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;Vikala, she's one of&nbsp;<em>Granblue</em>'s Twelve Divine Generals, and she's constantly in a battle between two sides of her personality, one of which wants to bring joy to the world while the other wants to be left alone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-vikala-dlc-fight.jpg?itok=M2u7RWTF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-vikala-dlc-fight.jpg?itok=Fyy9qxn2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Vikala may look cute, but don't be fooled: she's deadly.</figcaption></figure><p>In&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em>, she fights with a mixture of cutesy items like pillows and mouse projectiles alongside deadly mousetraps and ornate-looking cannons.</p>
<p>As her introductory trailer closes, we see her performing before an adoring crowd, dancing atop a golden mousetrap with sharp jaws and demonstrating the two warring sides of her personality.</p>
<p>Picking up Vikala's DLC pack gets you not only the character, but also a new premium avatar for use within the game, as well as a badge and several Figure Studio poses and expressions.</p>
<p>You can check out Vikala's debut trailer, which gives a sense of how she's going to play when she lands in&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising&nbsp;</em>next week, right here.</p>

<p>Keywords Studios has acquired Certain Affinity.</p>



<p>The news comes courtesy of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/keywords-acquires-halo-co-developer-certain-affinity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>, which says that Keywords Studios acquired Certain Affinity for an undisclosed sum. The report reveals that the acquisition is subject to losing conditions and includes an upfront cash purchase and an earn-out component based on Certain Affinity’s performance.</p>



<p>Certain Affinity will be Keywords Studios’ acquisition this year after it also purchased Wushu Studios in August.</p>



<p>Certain Affinity was first founded in 2006 by former Bungie employees and has since seen the studio work on games, including Call of Duty, Halo, Hogwarts Legacy, and more. Just this week, a former <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-battle-royale-cancelled-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Certain Affinity developer claimed that the studio’s Halo Battle Royale</a> “could have been a game changer.”</p>



<p>Certain Affinity was once also developing a Transformers game, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-certain-affinitys-transformers-mmo-has-moved-to-splash-damage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved over to Splash Damage after a turbulent development</a>. </p>



<p>“At this most difficult time in the market, we’re thrilled to be able to provide stability and a supportive home for our team,” said Hoberman in a statement. “The respect for our talent and culture that Keywords has shown, along with a willingness to invest in our growth, is unparalleled.</p>



<p>“Paul and I look forward to partnering with them to chart a course for careful expansion of our core co-development activities, refinement of our lead development capabilities, as well as championing the growth of the Create division.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6-is-set-to-be-the-most-varied-call-of-duty-campaign-ever<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Call of Duty’s greatest campaigns have offered one thing over all else: variety. Whether it’s the original Modern Warfare’s memorable behind-enemy-lines sniping of All Ghillied Up or Cold War’s KGB infiltration and hallucinogenic episodes, it’s those missions that take you out of the standard first-person shooter cadence that foremost stick in the memory. While we’re yet to play it, it’s therefore encouraging that Black Ops 6 is aiming to pack its campaign full of these moments, so much so Jon Zuk, associate creative director at Raven Software, tells me it's treating each of the levels as “its own mini blockbuster”. </p><p>Indeed, Call of Duty is at its best when presented as playable cinema. Tense, tight corridor shootouts open up into large-scale explosive set pieces and one-off experiments – not dissimilar to how Mario platformers introduce ideas for individual levels but with AC-130 gunships instead of animal costumes. Set against the backdrop of the Gulf War in 1991, Black Ops 6 is playing in the shadowy political grey areas that lend themselves to spycraft and subterfuge. So while the campaign will undoubtedly have its louder moments, it's given Raven more scope to experiment with different styles of gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>“We wanted to make sure that each one was memorable and could stand alone,” says lead narrative producer Natalie Pohorski, talking about missions in Black Ops 6. “Each one has unique gameplay opportunities, unique objectives, and how you tackle those.” It’s a sentiment Jon Zuk agrees with, adding, “We didn't want to just create three or four levels that are fun to play, but all kind of feel the same. We wanted to make sure each mission had its thing, its own special, unique sauce to it, as it were. So variety was number one throughout the entire process for us.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Variety was number one throughout the entire process for us.</p></div><p>Variety has always been a priority for Raven when it comes to designing COD campaigns. There have always been interesting ideas hidden away, even in the games that are less fondly remembered. It’s something that Zuk, who has been at the studio since 1996, recalls as being a key aspect of their gameplay design:</p><p>“That's always been something that we've really been interested in doing. Federation Day back on Ghosts really had the variety. The ‘looking at your target from afar, then zip lining, then repelling on the side of the building and then doing some sneaking or combat and then full-on combat and then a big epic moment to end the level’.” </p><p>Zuk also cites a chapter near the end of the original Black Ops as one of his favourite Call of Duty missions. Rebirth tells its tale from two separate perspectives as the player takes control of Woods and Hudson at different points in time during the same event. “It really intrigued me because it's like telling a story from two different perspectives and kind of seeing that your version of the truth is not always the truth or that the truth is malleable.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The truth and deciphering just who to believe is at the crux of Black Ops 6’s story, but this isn’t the only aspect borrowed from this particular 14-year-old mission. High Rollers looks set to be one of 6’s tentpole levels - a high-risk heist with a casino vault as its target. Players take control of multiple members of the team as they switch perspectives over its course, creating distraction opportunities and executing security breaches in tandem. While not offering the malleable nature that something like GTA V did with its multiple-protagonist heists, it does open up the playbook for fun storytelling possibilities for Raven.</p><p>“Ahead of time they have the mission briefing where they're each like, okay, I'm going to do this, you’re going to do this, you’re going to do this,” explains Pohorski. “They're all undercover, and it's sort of like a passing of the baton is really how it plays out.” </p><p>“What we wanted to tell there was kind of the perfect heist mission where everybody's doing their part and so there's a very particular plan that's taking place and you've got all of the characters taking place or taking part in this and it's got to work in a certain clockwork type fashion for them to pull off this event”, Zuk confirms.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What we wanted to tell there was kind of the perfect heist mission where everybody's doing their part.</p></div><p>That briefing takes place in the expanded mansion hideout you’ll get to explore in Black Ops 6, an evolution of Cold War’s safehouse location that lets you talk to other characters, uncover secrets by exploring, and interact with the all-important evidence board.</p><p>Another distinctive element of Cold War was its willingness to let you holster your weapon for an extended amount of time – a virtually alien idea compared to the majority of what Call of Duty stands for. A prime example of this was the memorable mission Desperate Measures, which had you infiltrate a high-security KGB building, talking your way through checkpoints and wearing disguises as Raven fully embraced the espionage lifestyle. It was more Hitman than Call of Duty and we’re set for similar antics in Black Ops 6.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“Most Wanted, which you've seen in the trailers, that one we do have more of a pick your way of how you want to accomplish this part of the mission”, states Zuk about a mission taking place at a political gala. “There's two distinct parts of the mission where you can choose how you want to play it. And for the replayability factor, certainly more so in the first part, there are multiple ways to accomplish a goal. So we think that players are really going to do one and they're going to talk to their friend and say, ‘I talked to the senator's wife and did A, B and C’, and he's going to be like, ‘Oh, I didn't do that at all. I was trailing this shady character and ended up meeting, accomplishing my goal this other way’. And then that crosstalk gets people interested, well, what did I miss? I should go back and check that out and see what the other path is.”</p><p>“Some of the missions have those options of like, okay, these are the objectives, and then you can kind of get the lay of the land and choose which one you want to tackle first,” Pohorsky confirms. “If you want to go in hot or stealthy, there's options for that too. So it kind of depends on the mission, but I think that's where some of the replayability comes in with the political gala. This time you want to blackmail the senator, or this time you want to hack into a silent auction.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Where possible we try to allow you to play it how you want.</p></div><p>While variety is at the forefront of Black Ops 6’s campaign, so is flexibility and that desire to approach objectives the way you want to. The game may lead you in a certain direction or politely suggest a wise method, but that doesn’t mean you’ll need to listen. Crucially, apart from a couple of occasions, you won’t be punished for doing something ‘the wrong way’. Auto-fail stealth, for example, will be a highly rare occurrence, says Zuk.</p><p>“There are moments where we are very much wanting the player to play stealthily and be careful and quiet, but where possible we try to allow you to play it how you want,” he explains. “And I would say more times than not, you can go loud if that's the way you want to play it. And I can only think of a couple of instances where we sort of don't allow that because it didn't fit with the story. But yeah, I would say in the majority of cases where we have those stealth moments where we're kind of recommending guns down and being more of a spy, certainly we know that people like being action heroes too, so we let that happen.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“You're still getting all of those blockbuster combat moments for sure”, confirms Pohorski. “I mean that's the bread and butter, but in addition to that, we're layering in these other elements. So yeah, I think I love the more stealthy side. I like going in undercover, so it's been a lot of fun for me to play.”</p><p>That variety is promised across the board and while only a couple of examples have been name-checked here, the plan is that no one mission stands out as being Black Ops 6’s ace in the pack. Instead, Raven has endeavoured to keep the campaign’s chapters consistently engaging and surprising in their setup.</p><p>“We're not banking on any particular mission doing that [stealing the show]”, says Pohorski. “I think what's so great about the variety is that depending on what kind of player you are, there's different missions that you like. And I mean I have personal story elements that I like in certain missions, but then the way that I get to play in another one might be different.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Black Ops 6 is a linear story, so there is not a branching ending for this one.</p></div><p>The Black Ops series is known for its twisting stories, full of memorable characters and globetrotting locations. With an added emphasis on gameplay variety, Black Ops 6 is shaping up to be an exciting possibility. Throw in the different ways to approach these missions and the expectation is that you’ll want to replay certain parts too. </p><p>These gameplay options won’t necessarily have an impact on the story as a whole, though, as the plot itself is locked-in this time around with no multiple or hidden endings to go in search of. “Black Ops 6 is a linear story, so there is not a branching ending for this one”, Zuk states. He also promises a slightly longer campaign than Cold War’s, of which its short length was a main criticism held against it. We’ll find out just how much of Black Ops 6’s campaign lives up to the promise when it arrives on October 25th.</p><p><em>Simon Cardy is loves it when the words "blockbuster" and "spy" are put together.

            <p>Phantom Blade Zero's producer believes authentic cultural themes are important for games and shouldn't be diluted for a global audience.</p>
<p>Liang Qiwei (known as Soulframe), who's also the CEO of developer S-Game, discussed the topic with Japanese site <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/709/G070971/20241010065/">4Gamer</a> at this year's Tokyo Game Show (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/phantom-blade-zero-devs-say-cultural-differences-are-not-a-barrier-in-games-but-a-plus-which-is-why-they-dont-tone-down-themes-for-the-west/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>The forthcoming action game has a "kung-fu punk" aesthetic, described as "using kung-fu and martial arts as the core and clothing it in popular culture".</p>

<p>Further, Qiwei suggested that having an obscure theme is part of the appeal for a global audience, comparing the game with Game Science's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> that's achieved enormous success.</p>
<p>"If we look at recent titles, Black Myth: Wukong had a much higher hurdle to overcome than our game does in terms of culture as it's completely based on a classic Chinese work of literature," said Qiwei.</p>
<p>"So [Game Science] may encounter this problem of players not understanding the cultural background. But in my opinion, the quality and playing experience of a game are its core. If you can achieve high quality and an entertaining playing experience, I think that a difficult theme can actually be an advantage, not a disadvantage. If your game is entertaining, players will perceive unfamiliar themes as something fresh."</p><p>He continued: "The reason we Chinese players know about Western and Japanese culture is because we had very entertaining Western and Japanese games as an entry point. We gradually became accustomed to them. I doubt Chinese players knew much about Japanese samurai at first, and I don’t think they were especially interested in them. But because there were so many good games about them, they’re now basically recognized as a pop theme.</p>
<p>"So, to repeat, if the game itself is interesting, the sense of its themes being foreign can be an advantage, rather than a barrier. I think it’s a very strong plus that draws in more players."</p>
<p>It's certainly an interesting take, considering one criticism of Black Myth: Wukong was its disjointed storytelling that relied on knowledge of the novel it's based on. Equally, this could have driven renewed interest in the novel, particularly outside of China.</p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero has been likened to From Software's Dark Souls games, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-has-dark-souls-inspired-non-linear-map-but-developer-still-insists-its-not-a-soulslike">Qiwei insisted the game is not a soulslike</a> despite some influence.</p>
<p>I got to play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-is-speedy-stylish-and-absolutely-not-a-soulslike">Phantom Blade Zero at Gamescom</a> and adored its tense, parry-driven action.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Star Wars Outlaws will get a Steam release next month, having previously only been available on Ubisoft and Epic's PC storefronts.</p>
<p>Ubisoft shared the news last night, with a social media post saying the game was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2842040/Star_Wars_Outlaws/">available to wishlist now</a>, ahead of a 21st November launch on Valve's platform.</p>

<p>In addition, the company also revealed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> is available to play via Steam now. We knew <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-comes-to-steam-this-month-as-ubisoft-returns-to-valves-storefront">Mirage was poised for the PC storefront sometime this month</a>, however until recently Ubisoft had kept an exact date under wraps.</p>
<p>Last month, Ubisoft announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-new-ubisoft-games-to-release-day-one-on-steam-starting-next-february">new releases are set to launch day one on Steam</a>, starting with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on 14th February next year. This marks a change for the company, which has shunned Steam launch day releases for several years now. </p>
<p>Other Ubisoft games have steadily trickled onto the platform eventually, however.

<p>We awarded Star Wars Outlaws two out of five stars on its initial release in August.</p>
<p>"It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws review</a>. "It lacks the linear polish and charisma of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a>.

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro could be the best place to play multiplatform games with bad PC ports that suffer from a variety of issues, including bad image quality with certain upscalers and stuttering issues.</p>
<p>Speaking during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">latest episode</a> of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry commented on the soon-to-be-released mid-generation refresh hardware from Sony, highlighting how the system could be a sort of "nuclear option" to enjoy multiplatform games with bad PC ports thanks to the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler which will likely be used over AMD FSR&nbsp; in the vast majority of games, as performance concerns could be the only reason developers may continue to go for AMD's upscaler over the AI-powered one making its debut with the PlayStation 5 Pro in certain scenarios, such as for 120 Hz modes. Considering how games with PSO stutters on PC already tend to run smoother on consoles, playing multiplatform games whose PC ports suffer from this issue on the PlayStation 5 Pro could be the way to go, especially if performance holds up, as it seems more and more like PSSR will be able to deliver great image quality in the vast majority of games.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #184: Red Dead PC! Nintendo Mystery Tests, Alien Isolation 2, John vs PS5 Pro!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FenN5sOE1WM?start=2647&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler is setting out to be the real game-changer for the PlayStation 5 Pro. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which has a horrible image quality on the base system in Performance Mode, for example, looks great on the system thanks to PSSR, so much so that the usage of the upscaler feels like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-no-vrr-improvements-pssr-lifting-veil/">"lifting a veil of smear."</a></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches worldwide on November 7th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/create-cutesy-fire-hazards-in-socket-management-puzzler-plug-it-in<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            
<p>Deep beneath my desk lies a secret shame: impenetrable black thickets of power leads, sprouting forth across two overlapping extension units. Such a failure of cable management pierces my conscience like the beat of Poe's tell-tale heart, and yet I’m forever powerless – as in, I can’t be bothered – to do anything about it. Yet even I was soothed by the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a> demo for Plug It In, a chilled-out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game about clicking chunky plugs into the right outlets.</p>

<p>For the most part, it’s just a case of matching plug shapes to corresponding sockets, and rotating the former so that all of them can fit into the confines of the funkily-shaped outlet arrays. While some cosy tunes play in the background, naturally. The highlights are the puzzles where the plugs include outlets of their own, adding a touch of three-dimensional power stacking that’s satisfying to pull off even when your construction looks like it’s one spark away from incinerating an entire postcode.</p>
<p>It helps that the clean, simple visuals and absolutely <em>delicious</em> click sound when a plug hits home make the whole thing feel like playing with building blocks. Rather than, y'know, the dusty, back-creaking tedium of sorting an extension socket in real life. My only complaint is that it’s not always obvious why a plug will refuse to seat, when there’s seemingly a good match for the connection type and no other plugs blocking its way. This happened to me on a couple of puzzles, which I eventually beat with alternative layouts, but still. What was wrong with the first one?!</p>

<p>Don’t let that put you off too much, though – Plug It In is a lovely, relaxing little puzzler, for neat freaks and embarrassed cable neglecters alike. You can try the demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2757300/PLUG_IT_IN/">on Steam</a>, and there’s a browser version playable on <a href="https://unsame.itch.io/plug-it-in">Itch</a> as well – though the Steam edition looks a fair bit more fleshed-out and polished.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Happy Friday! Once again we’ve made it to the end of the week, and before we relax into the welcoming arms of the weekend, we’re going to have a think about what’s been keeping our controllers busy over the last seven days. I’ve mostly played Metaphor ReFantazio – it’s very good – as well as a spot of Fera: The Sundered Tribes and my usual Overwatch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Sky Oceans Wings for Hire for review, and we’ll find out what he thinks next week. Also he’s been playing Football Manager 24 where he’s had quite an interesting career. He tells us, I started at Man United, got sacked, hired by Nottingham Forest after they were relegated from the Premier League and got them back into the Prem in my first season, and then they performed poorly so I left before getting sacked. Now close to being at Valencia for 2 years. In my first year I got them into the Europa Conference league, 2 years ahead of the Board’s schedule, and this season I’m challenging for the Champions League. I have a 30-year-old Dominic Calvert Lewin to thank for that who is a goal machine, and I bet Tottenham regret letting me nab him for free!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile,<strong> Nic B</strong> played what he’s called IndiUncharted Wars: A New Franchise. By which I think he means Unknown 9: Awakening. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/unknown-9-awakening-review/">You can find out what he thinks right now</a>! <strong>Ade</strong> has been playing Neva for review, the new game from the makers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/12/13/gris-review/">Gris</a>, and a bit more Skull and Bones and Mario Odyssey – what a wild crossover!</p>
<p><strong>Nick P’s</strong> week has been dominated by the excellent Silent Hill 2 and a bit of Vision of Mana, while <strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing Diablo IV latest expansion and season, as well as Vendetta Forever for review, <em>and</em> Sonic x Shadow Generations. Also, he tried Two Point Academy last night because he’s wanted to play it for ages and it went onto PS+ on Tuesday. He says it’s good!</p>

<p>In real-world gaming he also made a level 5 Elf Blood Hunter who can turn into a hybrid werewolf for Halloween D&amp;D, telling us, “I’m quite excited about that!”</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> has hit the point of no return in Cyberpunk 2077 and, rather predictably, he’s used this as a signal to go and do a load of side quests instead of barrelling down the golden path. He’s also been playing New World: Aeternum, Amazon’s MMO relaunch which is out now on PC and consoles. He says, “Obviously, it’s changed a lot since I dipped my toes in the beta version several years ago with a ton of new and refined features. I’m currently playing as a Mystic (healers will forever be my go-to class in MMOs) and I’m enjoying my time in the starting area.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> finished up with the superb Silent Hill 2 (he will be going back for replays soon) and immediately followed it up with a batch of Halloween spooky demos in the Steam Next Fest. It’s not all scary stuff though, as he says, “To balance the frights and fears I’ve been playing the fun Nikoderiko – a very Crash Bandicoot-influenced platformer that first came to my attention through YouTube ads of all things. Finally I started the lovely Snufkin game on Switch and look forward to some cozy evenings spent with the Moomins and a warm mug of cocoa over the winter months”.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub’s</strong> week has consisted of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/arizona-sunshine-remake-review/">Arizona Sunshine Remake</a>, Destiny 2, and Diablo IV which he’s unfortunately finding rather boring. Oh well, back to Destiny 2 then?</p>
<p>He was joined in Arizona Sunshine Remake by <strong>Tef</strong>, who also visited the original game to see just how much has changed – spoilers: <a href="https://youtu.be/gM9UPrBeUkI">a hell of a lot</a>! He also wrapped up our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, and got to spend some time with a little indie [<em>sic</em>] game that you’ll hear about in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-1-02-performance-improvements/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Final Fantasy XVI PC update went live a few hours ago, introducing new graphics settings, enhanced performance and several other improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>The 1.02 update introduces, besides a cursor lock option and improved help text for Photo Mode, and improvements for Shadow Quality settings, which now include cloud quality at all three levels instead of leaving the cloud quality always at high. This should bring performance improvements when selecting medium or low. Graphical Fidelity settings have also been changed to improve overall performance.</p>
<p>The new Final Fantasy XVI update also introduces fixes for aspect ratios other than 16:9, graphics not displaying correctly in certain scenarios, crashing issues on select hardware configurations, and more. The full update notes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2515020/view/4545912721046242416?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review of last year's PS5 release.</a></p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XVI heralds in a new standard for Japanese role-playing games and while the RPG components themselves are limited by Square-Enix standards, it's the narrative and gameplay that exceed all expectations. What begins with kingdom-wide subterfuge and destruction ends with a world forever changed and the player, as Clive Rosfield and Ifrit together, are the driving force to see it all through until the end.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gone-home-studio-fullbright-are-now-making-games-about-horrible-toilet-spiders.1013274/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gone-home-studio-fullbright-are-now-making-games-about-horrible-toilet-spiders<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
You probably still know Fullbright as the studio behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a>, a delicately experimental first-person yarn about a girl exploring her family home after travelling overseas, and learning about the turmoil in her absence. Picture that game in your mind: the quietness of the hallways versus the crash of a thunderstorm outside, the sickly-sweet 90s décor, the fairy lights and screwed-up balls of paper, the gentle amber pressure of cloistered teenage memories. Now, imagine a faint scuttling behind the skirting boards. A rattling in the pipes. Was there a toilet in Gone Home's autumnal mansion? I can't recall, but you should probably steer clear.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3098700/Fullbright_Presents_TOILET_SPIDERS/">Steam</a>, Toilet Spiders is the first in a new anthology series of "short, strange, lo-fi games", gathered under the label Fullbright Presents. To crib unceremoniously from the Steam blurb, it's "a short, replayable lo-fi first-person survival horror game where you must learn to judge your odds and manage your resources to avoid or scare off the giant radioactive spiders laying in wait inside filthy toilets that contain the keys and items you need to complete your mission and escape with your life." 
</p>
<p>
The game takes place in some kind of Exclusion Zone, with you playing a nameless "volunteer" sent by an evidently tyrannous regime, and the map is broken into several floors. "Scavenged items like old light bulbs, surplus flash grenades, and lucky coins will aid you on your mission, but their numbers are precious few," the Steam page continues. "You must learn how best to weigh your odds and make your own luck if you want to live."</p>
<p>Personally, I think the game has missed a trick by not including some kind of pooping mechanic, because as every arachnophobe knows, the real terror of the hypothetical toilet spider is realising you forgot to check the bowl before plonking yourself down. Mind you, you can always increase the intensity by downloading on Steam Deck and playing it while riding the porcelain express.
</p><p>
Fullbright's games have always contained the suggestion of horror, of course. Gone Home plays with your expectations a bit, dangling the red herring of supernatural activity only to swap it for the, er, emerald pilchard of it all being a metaphor for closeted emotions. Fullbright's subsequent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tacoma">Tacoma</a> makes that more overt, being set aboard a space station haunted by holograms. Still, I'm impressed at the speed with which Fullbright have transited from "psychological motif" to "literal atomic arachnid gnawing my face off". Could the giant spiders be a metaphor for something as well? I wouldn't be surprised if the game's B-movie stylings were another red herring.
</p>
<p>
The less-fun context for all this is that Fullbright aren't the same Fullbright who made Gone Home or Tacoma. Back in 2021, co-founder Steve Gaynor was accused of mistreating staff and creating a toxic workplace by several former employees. Gaynor subsequently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gone-home-studio-co-founder-steps-down-following-allegations-of-toxic-workplace-culture">stepped back from his role</a> on the company's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/open-roads-review">"short but bittersweet"</a> fable Open Roads, and parted ways with the development team, who became a separate entity.</p>
<p>As of September 2023, Gaynor was Fullbright's sole remaining employee. I think Toilet Spiders is mostly his work. It is... dangerously easy to read Toilet Spiders as some kind of commentary on the events above, and on Gaynor's state of mind since. Don't let that stop you, though.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and Persona director Katsura Hashino has said he avoids reading fan feedback to protect his mental health.</p>
<p>Hashino discussed the topic of fan feedback with Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama in <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202410/20753">Famitsu</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metaphor-refantazio-and-persona-director-katsura-hashino-keeps-his-distance-from-user-feedback-to-spare-his-mental-health/">Automaton</a>), but the two creators had opposing views on the matter.</p>
<p>Hashino said he "tries not to be that conscious of" fan feedback and aims to keep some distance.</p>

<p>"Of course, I do check things out at certain times, such as right after launch," he said. "But it's not like I can adjust [the game] based on what I see. When I need to look something up, I do it quickly in one go, because constantly looking at reactions isn't good for your mental health."</p>
<p>He added that he doesn't look up his own name online, or use social media.</p>
<p>Toyama, who is busy developing the forthcoming Slitterhead, said his attitude towards user feedback is changing over time. Though he was dismissive in the past, he is now keen on actively listening to fans online and adopting opinions he finds useful - that's despite Slitterhead not being a live-service game that needs to be tuned in response to player demands.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio has certainly received praise from fans and critics alike. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-surpasses-1m-sales-on-launch-day-to-become-fastest-selling-atlus-game">sold 1m copies on launch day</a> to become the fastest-selling Atlus game.</p>
<p>Hashino has also spoken about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazios-lord-of-the-rings-influence-thrown-out-as-originality-defines-atlus-says-director">the influence of traditional fantasy on the game</a> and how this was thrown out in favour of focusing on the originality that "defines" Atlus' games.</p>
<p>Slitterhead, from Bokeh Studio, is set for release next month and lets players inhabit the bodies of various people - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterhead-really-wants-you-to-know-you-can-play-as-a-dog">even a dog</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fullbright, the studio behind the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a> and Tacoma, has released its next game in early access.</p>
<p>Fulbright is helmed by solo developer Steve Gaynor. In 2021, Gaynor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fullbright-co-founder-steps-down-amidst-studio-exodus">made headlines</a> after an exodus of 15 Fullbright staff was, in part, blamed on his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/emotional-abuse-at-indie-studios-undermines-the-importance-of-auteurs">behaviour toward fellow workers</a>. He <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gone-home-studio-fullbright-now-solo-outfit-as-controversial-co-founder-goes-it-alone">announced he was going solo in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>With very little, if any, fanfare, yesterday the developer surprise dropped Toilet Spiders on Steam. The game is said to feature a "lo-fi hell world of giant spiders jumping out of toilets onto your face".</p>

</div><figcaption>Nintendo has announced new hardware, but it's not Switch 2 - so what's the point of Alarmo?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNKD3U-4AY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3098700/old_view/4520017023190305114">Steam</a>, Gaynor said he had started an "ongoing series of small, strange, lo-fi games" which would be released in early access, as part of a 'Fullbright Presents' push. And, Toilet Spiders is one of these games.</p><p>"This isn't a super-rough alpha early access launch either, the game is actually a pretty polished version of itself," Gaynor wrote. "There's a little more in the way of features and content to add, balance to improve, and bugs you'll help me find that I'll need to fix, but really at its heart this is the game as it's intended to be played."</p>
<p>Gaynor's young daughter, Juniper, gave him the idea for Toilet Spiders. Apparently, one day she asked about a spider jumping out from the loo and scaring her grandma. "And of course my immediate response was, well I could make a video game out of that," Gaynor explained, and now we have Toilet Spiders (with credit to Juniper, of course).</p>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Fullbright</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"The idea for the game ended up aligning with a number of other conceptual items I'd been wanting to play with: a game set in an abandoned research facility, a straight-up horror game, a game about managing your resources and tilting the odds inspired by the brilliant <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835570/Buckshot_Roulette/?snr=1_2108_9__2107">Buckshot Roulette</a>. And so, for better or worse, TOILET SPIDERS was born."</p><p>Gaynor added a few amusing review quotes to his post, proclaiming that Toilet Spiders is "what Psycho did for showers..." and "Jaws did for the ocean". So, will you be able to look at your toilet the same way again?</p>
<p>If you are interested, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3098700/Fullbright_Presents_TOILET_SPIDERS/">Toilet Spiders is available on Steam</a>, for less than £5.
</p>
<p>As for Fullbright's previous games, we were quite taken with Gone Home, calling it a "triumphant exploration of a beautifully textured family space" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gone-home-console-review">Eurogamer's review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo Switch Online - Nintendo's subscription service - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-must-pay-to-play-nintendo-switch-online-from-next-week">launched back in 2018</a>. Though it marks the first time Nintendo has locked the ability to play multiplayer games online behind a paid service, Nintendo has thrown in a wealth of additional perks like cloud saves, game trials, and exclusive money-saving offers to sweeten the deal. Here are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-online-games-available-to-play-right-now">all Nintendo Switch Online games available to play right now</a>.</p>

		<p>Remedy Entertainment confirmed that<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/alan-wake-2"> Alan Wake 2’s</a> second expansion, The Lake House, will arrive for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC next week on 22nd October. This DLC will go even deeper into the scares of the horror universe, as made clear by the new gameplay trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2: The Lake House - Launch Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview October 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/591RFRnhNEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/07/alan-wake-2s-night-springs-dlc-looks-amazing/">the Night Springs DLC</a> earlier this year, The Lake House looks to bleed together the Remedy Connected Universe even further. There’s deeper ties back to the FBC as a newly playable character emerges in response to the new AWE event &nbsp;at the titular Lake House.</p>
<p>FBC Agent Estevez heads to the Lake House research station at Cauldron Lake, a standalone story that can happily exist alongside the spiralling tale of the main game. It runs parallel to the earlier part of Saga’s side of Alan Wake 2 as Estevez deals with an Overlap.</p>
<p>In particular, there’s a mysterious living painting that is spewing out fresh horrors to deal with. Thankfully, while she doesn’t have any paranatural abilities of her own, Estevez is equipped with both a standard issue firearm and an FBC-specific weapon specifically for taking on paranatural entities.</p>

<p>While Night Springs was a bunch of standalone ‘What If?’ episodes, The Lake House is a more contiguous world to explore and try to survive – it’s more survival horror.</p>
<p>Accessing the expansion, The Lake House will be playable from the main menu, but it’s also (much like with the Night Springs expansion) slotted in with the main campaign if you want to play through the whole lot. This will have you bouncing back and forth between the menagerie of characters and experiences.</p>
<p>Looking back on the original release, Alan Wake 2 was one of the best games of last year.</p>
<p>“Just as it gives equal screen time to its two protagonists, Alan Wake 2 is a fine blend of equal parts narrative and survival horror,” said Nick in our<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/26/alan-wake-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 10/10 review of Alan Wake 2.</a> “Both aspects are brought together in brilliant fashion to create a game that is going to mess with your head, scare the hell out of you and make you grin about it as you plunge forward once more, eager to see what’s next.”</p>
<p>This wasn’t the only Remedy news from the Xbox Partner Direct, with the studio also revealing their online co-op Control spin-off, now called <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/fbc-firebreak-brings-three-player-co-op-to-the-federal-bureau-of-control/">FBC: Firebreak</a>.</p>

<p>I’m not sure about you, but I’ll put up with even the most mediocre of shooters for the sake of FMV ghosts that excellently terrible. Also, shout out to the last-second Halloween costume housemaids that just walk right up to you with a fresh knuckle sandwich, despite you very much holding a shotgun.</p>
<p>“Journey into a mansion on the Island of Matinicus where you'll arrive to find the mansion full of hellacious demonic creatures,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1733170/Killing_Time_Resurrected/?curator_clanid=5644295">reads the Steam page</a>. “Solve deadly puzzles, uncover the secrets behind a famous mystery and discover an ancient artifact from the Pharaoh Ramses, if you can live long enough to find it.”</p>
<p>There are also some ‘key features’ further down the page. Well, I have to tell you about those. They’re key!</p>
<blockquote><p>• Immerse Yourself in 4K Resolution, 144 FPS, Anti-Aliasing and Upgraded/New 2D Screens and Menu art.</p>
<p>• Face off against enemies from both 3DO and PC for the first time, utilizing weapons that were once exclusive to each version.</p>
<p>• Experience and interact with otherworldly apparitions through a collection of over 50 live-action video sequences. These restored specters offer vital clues about the horrific events that once occurred in the cursed Conway mansion. Do you have what it takes to survive and uncover the mystery?</p>
<p>• Enjoy a full 360 view, allowing you to look up, down, and all around. The three-dimensional island features both indoor and outdoor areas, brimming with intricate details that capture the essence of the haunting and distinctive 1930s atmosphere.</p>
<p>• Explore over 45 killing zones with hundreds of enemies and rooms sprawling across the vast estate.</p>
<p>• Discover at your own risk unearthed cut content, including the pool house, shipwreck and a variety of ancient artifacts.</p>
<p>• A fright-fest for the true aficionado of first-person corridor mayhem, enjoy continuous gameplay with no load time between areas, and much more!</p></blockquote>
<p>I was curious about this one’s history, so I flew <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Time_(video_game)#Release">to Wikipedia</a> and found out two interesting facts. Firstly, the game originally shipped on a red disc, which featured a bug where “the screen (became) pixelated and obscure(d) the view” of an entire stage. The 3DO Company, who published the game, offered to replace any copies mailed to them, but very few people apparently took them up on it. As such, the black replacement discs are now very rare.</p>
<p>The second fact is that Killing Time was, hold on to your chairs, number two in GamesMaster’s 1996 list of best 3DO games. Here’s the full list:</p>

            <p>Bloober Team have announced their next horror game at last night's Xbox Partner Preview showcase. It's called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> and it's about - bear with me here - going to the past, harvesting souls, then going to the future so they can help you. It's all because you are, um, wanting to find a special rift in the <em>future</em>, so you can go back to a special version of the past. I think. Anyway yeah, it looks kinda fine to good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Cronos is set in a "grim world", based on Eastern European brutalism and mixed with some "retro-futurist technology". From the looks of the trailer, you play as the Commando from Risk Of Rain, who's seemingly joined the Collective, a time-hopping organisation that wants to plumb the future for ways to return to "1980s era Poland".</p>

<p>Now, parts of the game take place in the past, which is undergoing The Change: a cataclysmic event of some description. And when you pop into the future, you'll see its results, having created a world ravaged by horrible, skittering demons.</p><p>In the trailer, you see Commando play speed chess with an old lady, before the Commando goes Edward Scissorhands and, presumably, harvests her brain. This is because you'll need to bring people from the past into the future to help you discover these rifts and survive, although we don't know much more. Otherwise, most surviving and surveying looks to be done with your trusty sidearm, from a typically over-the-shoulder Resi perspective.</p>
<p>And that's your lot. I will say that off rip, Cronos gives me proper double A energy and I think that's a good thing. It has the sort of name that immediately conjures up a 7/10, where it'll be a bit janky but have some interesting ideas and a fun gimmick.</p>
<p>You can find the game over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/">Steam</a> and it's due out sometime next year. Also, it isn't affiliated with Chronos From The Ashes, a middling Soulslike I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/chronos-before-the-ashes-review">reviewed</a> not long after I joined RPS and has such a similar name that I keep getting them muddled in my noggin.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It hits Switch via the Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Switch Online collection of games. (Banjo-Kazooie hit Switch in 2022.)</p><p>Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>It's the bear-bird duo Banjo and Kazooie to the rescue! Magical minigames, perplexing puzzles, and freaky foes await them in the stages ahead — through ancient ruins, underwater realms, and even an amusement park of sorts.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In 2009, following Microsoft’s acquisition of Rare, Banjo-Tooie launched on Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade with a smoother frame-rate and HD graphics. Then, in 2015, Banjo-Tooie was re-released as part of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/rare-replay">Rare Replay</a> compilation. In 2019, Banjo-Tooie was enhanced to run at a native 4K resolution on Xbox One. </p><p>The last brand new Banjo-Kazooie game to come out, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/banjo-kazooie-nuts-bolts">Nuts &amp; Bolts</a>, launched on Xbox 360 in 2008. Fans have called for Microsoft to release a sequel ever since, but so far not a peep. Banjo and Kazooie are playable characters in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, though.</p><p>Banjo-Tooie joins a growing list of Rare-developed games on Switch, which includes the aforementioned Banjo-Kazooie, the seminal shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/goldeneye-007">GoldenEye</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/blast-corps">Blast Corps</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/jet-force-gemini">Jet Force Gemini</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
