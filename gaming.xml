    <p><span>Elena dances her way across the grasslands.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Capcom [2,580 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> has released the gameplay trailer for <em><a title="Games > Street Fighter 6 [43 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a></em> downloadable content character Elena, who is due out on June 5 alongside the launch of its <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/street-fighter-6-coming-to-switch-2-on-june-5-alongside-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Switch 2 version and Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</a>. <span id="more-961234"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>As a returning fan favorite of the series, players’ spirits will rise for Elena as she brings her unique moveset inspired by capoeira, a Brazilian martial art and dance form that blends martial arts, dance, music and acrobatics combined with the modern touches of <em>Street Fighter 6</em> mechanics. Elena also brings a brand new stage, Reniala Remains, which showcases the plains of Africa at night as wildlife roam in the background, all lit by the glowing <a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a> above. Players will need to keep up with Elena as she dances across all three game modes including World Tour, Fighting Ground, and Battle Hub.</p><p>The pure-spirited Elena showcases her kicker moves with two colorful Outfits. Outfit 1 is themed around her newest look, creating a fresh yet familiar style that emphasizes both her grace and physique, while Outfit 2 is an ode to her iconic look in <em>Street Fighter III: New Generation</em> and <em>Ultra Street Fighter IV</em>. Outfit 2 can be acquired by maxing out your bond with her in World Tour or via Fighter Coins.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_961245"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>As seen in the trailer, Elena’s moveset uses her long legs and unpredictable movements to keep her prey in check, including:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Rhino Horn</strong> – A series of quick, forward-moving kicks that send the opponent flying back</li><li><strong>Scratch Wheel</strong> – Known as Elena’s “dragon-punch,” this move is useful for anti-airs or for keeping opponents away</li><li><strong>Lynx Song</strong> – Where things get wild, Elena spins forward close to the ground while invincible to projectiles and can then use four different techniques out of it, such as Leopard Snap, Harvest Circle, Mallet Smash or Lynx Whirl.<ul><li><strong>Leopard Snap</strong> – A long-reaching attack useful for closing distances</li><li><strong>Harvest Circle</strong> -: A kick that launches opponents in the air and maintains invincibility to projectiles</li><li><strong>Mallet Smash</strong> – An overhead kick that can buffalow-profile</li><li><strong>Lynx Whirl</strong> – Elena performs an additional spin to extend Lynx Song. If the aforementioned Leopard Snap, Harvest Circle, or Mallet Smash are performed after Lynx Whirl, their properties are “boosted!”</li></ul></li><li><strong>Spinning Scythe</strong> – As seen in previous iterations, perform a series of spinning kicks that can be canceled and followed up with Leopard Snap, Harvest Circle, Mallet Smash, and Lynx Whirl, to keep up the pressure on her opponents</li><li><strong>Moon Glider</strong> – An evasive technique where Elena steps back before performing a vertical spinning kick that sends the opponent in the air</li><li><strong>Meteor Volley</strong> – Elena’s Level 1 Super Art that operates as an effective anti-air move and also allows for a follow-up attack.</li><li><strong>Revival Dance</strong> – Elena’s Level 2 Super Art where she launches forward with a flurry of kicks and is invincible to all attacks on start-up. If you hold the down button, rather than dealing extra damage, Elena will do her trademark healing!</li><li><strong>Song of the Grasslands</strong> – Elena’s Level 3 Super Art brings the power of nature to the fight as she delivers kicks with the power of the skies and plains!</li></ul><p>Finally, a major balance patch will come to <em>Street Fighter 6</em> when Elena launches, introducing changes for all of the previous 25 characters along with some broader system changes as well. Keep an eye out for the detailed patch notes as we head toward Elena’s launch!</p></blockquote><p><em>Street Fighter 6</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,343 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,104 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,938 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,995 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> vis <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364780/Street_Fighter_6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-gennojo-ally<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For those who haven't played it, a central component of <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> is the 'League', a loose cohort of friends and allies you pick up along your travels. They all hang out at your hideout, can be chatted with, have a handful of story missions each and can be called upon to unleash extremely cool special attacks in the middle of a battle.</p><p>Most of these are memorable characters, rogues and misfits all, and I'm glad I went to the trouble of recruiting them. There's Yaya, the reluctant, brawling monk, who can burst into the middle of a fight and knock your opponents on their ass. There's Katsuhime, the tough-as-nails, pragmatic sniper who I <em>absolutely </em>romanced as Naoe. And there's Oni-yuri, the two-faced orphan who you can never be sure is telling the truth, but can always be sure will help you out by blowing poison darts at some bad guys. I love most of them.</p><p>Then there's Gennojo. Who fucking sucks. I hate him so much.</p><figure><figcaption>Absolutely not, you creep</figcaption></figure><p>I encountered Gennojo--a thief--quite early on in the game, and his energy can best be described as "what if Lando Calrissian was broke and also a convicted sex offender". From your first conversation he's incredibly annoying, and making matters worse is that, playing as Naoe, he is <em>constantly </em>trying to romance you. Like, almost every single time you're given a dialogue option, one of them is for romance, leading to a series of conversations that (and I'm paraphrasing here) go something like this:</p><p>Naoe: Phew, we sure showed those bad guys</p><p>Gennojo: Yes. Now, let me kiss you</p><p>Naoe: No. Anyway, what's the plan? Are there more bad guys around?</p><p>Gennojo: Perhaps. Let us kiss, and think on it</p><p>Naoe: What the fuck is wrong with you</p><p>Gennojo: *makes kissing face*</p><p>It's <em>incessant</em>, and stands in wild contrast to the rest of the game's cast, where, like most <em>Assassin's Creed </em>games, everyone is somewhere on the character spectrum between "stoic" and "stoic, but also haunted by their past misdeeds". And it's not like he's comic relief, either; the guy just plain sucks, wavering constantly between pathetic sexual advances and melodramatic whining about his lot in life. If anything, he seems to exist solely as a test of Naoe's (and the player's by extension) graces.</p><p>Thankfully, membership in Naoe and Yasuke's League is by invitation only. At the conclusion of a small series of missions for each prospective member, the player is given a choice: they can either sign them up, or bid them farewell and never see them again.</p><p>I have never said "get the hell out of my face" quicker in a video game when given that option with Gennojo, and interestingly, doing so gives you one last choice. You can either stop him doing something incredibly stupid by punching him unconscious, or you can let him do this:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gennojo Killed Himself Assassin's Creed Shadows Cut Scene" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8lFt9JvYFAg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I need you to understand that, no matter how Naoe has been animated there at the end, if you choose the latter this is not a tragic moment. It is comedy. This guy, this schmuck, whose only motivations throughout the entire game have been to steal stuff and make unwanted sexual advances on the player character, has suddenly decided that he is going to blow himself up inside a storehouse full of rice, and that this is somehow going to...accomplish something?</p><p>It accomplishes jack shit! Naoe even says this to his face, quite plainly, and true to his character he doesn't listen. Even this guy's heroic martyrdom is a whiff. </p><p>I honestly cannot remember the last time a character in a video game who is supposedly on your side--an unlockable ally with gameplay benefits, no less!--had so few redeeming qualities. Like, this guy has <em>none</em>. He's just the worst, every line and deed an ordeal, and I cannot imagine the headspace of anyone who went into this game, endured his encounters and thought yes, I would like to invite this man into my secret and very cool league of assassins so I can spend <em>more </em>time with him. As for anyone who actually <em>romanced</em> him, well...I'd say "I'd love to hear why", but I don't think I actually do.</p><p>Whoever dreamed this guy up at Ubisoft, whether painting his broadest brushstrokes or writing each specific line of dialogue, if your intention was to make the Worst Guy Ever as a joke, as a bit, I would like you to know that you absolutely nailed the brief. Well done.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ice-water-games-tenderfoot-tactics-xbox-store-removed-bds"><h3>Indie Dev Who Pulled Game From Xbox In Solidarity With Palestinian-Led BDS Hopes Others Will Do The Same</h3></a><p>"It's important to be able to use that limited amount of power to put whatever pressure we can on things"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/google-ai-idioms"><h3>AI Has Come For The Horse In The Hospital</h3></a><p>Google's AI tries to define idioms users made up</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> announced that both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-motorfest">The Crew Motorfest</a> would be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-adding-offline-modes-to-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-after-getting-savaged-over-junking-the-crew">getting offline modes</a>, something quite likely driven (pun intended) by how upset people were by the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> being shut down completely. There's an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-the-crew-lawsuit-insists-we-do-not-own-the-games-we-buy">ongoing lawsuit</a> over the first game and all! Still, The Crew 2 and Motorfest getting an offline mode is something, and there's a playtest for the former coming next week, April 30th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Producer Gregory Corgie shared this in a quick update video (you can watch that below) that mostly focuses on The Crew 2, as that's the one that'll be getting an offline mode first. It's probably worth noting that not everyone is guaranteed access to the aforementioned playtest, it'll be based on their individual "configurations and previous involvement in the community." Don't worry about your save either, as it'll be a separate one made for the sole purpose of testing the offline mode.

<p>
As it stands, the developer is apparently planning to release a hybrid mode, meaning you can switch between on- and offline, by the end of this year. The reason you're not getting an outright offline mode right out the gate is pretty much just because the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing</a> game was designed to be an always online game, so Ubisoft need to actually make sure an offline mode works 100% of the time.
</p>
<p>
Corgie also made sure to make it clear that no, online multiplayer features won't be available in offline mode, though this won't apply to all aspects of the game. Not entirely sure if this point needed to be made, but he did also say a full list of what features will and won't work will be coming further down the line. I imagine that'll actually be a useful thing to hear other than the obvious difference between online and offline gameplay.
</p>
<p>
I do have to wonder if the existence of an offline mode for The Crew 2 and Motorfest will hinder Ubisoft at all in the ongoing lawsuit against them. They argue that those that purchased the game were "purchasing a license" to play it, not to own the actual game, which is obviously a stinking pile of "um, actually…", so it's a matter of waiting to see if that argument works out for them.

At least what’s playable in the alpha—two maps, four runners, and a couple of contracts.</p><p> As someone with a need to watch XP and faction rep meters fill up, I felt surprisingly un-obsessed with <em>Marathon </em>after playing a couple hours (the game has some of that stuff but it wasn’t enough to overcome my ennui). Still, the conundrum of what <em>Marathon</em> may or may not end up being is something my mind keeps coming back to.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Yeah. After a few hours of playing <em>Marathon’s </em>alpha—which as you mention is not the full game—I’m not really hungry to hop back in. And I’m also not sure who this game is actually for...</p><p>The alpha feels too watered-down to attract the extraction sickos who have 2000 hours in <em>Tarkov</em>. But it still feels like it’s going to be too punishing to attract casual <em>Destiny </em>players and battle royale fans.</p><p>I saw someone, can’t remember who, tweet that the game is like <em>Apex Legends: But Now You Lose Everything When You Die Edition</em> and that’s not completely fair, but not that far off either.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> The pitch for this game is something like, “What if the extraction mode from a free-to-play <em>Call of Duty</em> game played like<em> Destiny 2</em> and was priced somewhere in the middle?” And when you say it like that it’s hard to get excited, but moment-to-moment the gunplay is on point and the art direction and world itself have me very intrigued.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>On paper that pitch is really a hard sell. And trying to convince some friends to play this has been a struggle. </p><p>But yeah, the gunplay feels really, <em>really </em>good. At one point I was fighting some NPC bots in a trippy sci-fi warehouse with weird lights and it was awesome. Then I had to rummage through their loot for some items and got killed by a player seconds later and lost everything.</p><p>The problem was that I ended up just thinking, “Man, I wish this wasn’t an extraction shooter that forced me to play with randos to survive!” Which I doubt is what Bungie was going for with the alpha. </p><p><strong>EG:</strong> Tell me more about why losing loot is such a buzzkill for you. It’s definitely something I think will be polarizing for certain types of Bungie fans but it doesn’t bother me personally.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I think the problem is that, as you mentioned, there’s not enough (in the Alpha at least) other STUFF to work toward. </p><p>So if you drop in with a cool gun you successfully extracted with but you get insta-killed by some rando with a sniper, it feels bad. I made no progress on in-game challenges, because they aren’t a thing (and don’t seem to be a thing in the full game) and I didn’t complete any contracts. And that cool gun and everything else is gone. And if that happens a few too many times, it feels really punishing.</p><p>And like, in <em>Fortnite</em>, even bad matches don’t really punish me that much. I don’t lose anything and I’m always making progress on like 200 different challenges and my battle passes.</p><p>But with <em>Marathon </em>(and other extraction shooters) you can have a run of bad matches that just feels awful. And I’m not sure, without some big changes, that Bungie is going to get a <em>Destiny</em>-size community to support <em>Marathon</em>. </p><p><strong>EG:</strong> For a game about grabbing loot, that part was definitely the least exciting to me. I think that’s partly about the narrow scope of what’s available in the alpha but also partly an issue with how anti-climactic the flow and drama of matches feel.</p><p>Showdowns with other players were very few and far between, and usually ended before both sides could fully engage. The loot caches all sort of run together in my mind, and there was a surprising lack of interesting enemies. </p><p>Occasionally there’d be an invisible security unit or beefier elite but I experienced very little in the way of big moments like, “oh, we found great loot!” or “oh, we’re in a mini-boss fight!” or “now we’re in a shootout to get to the extraction point.” None of that really “popped” for me.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Matches tended to blend together for me. I don’t really have many “COOL STORY” moments to share. And yeah, combat with other players is pretty rare and tends to be the worst part of this game. </p><p>I feel like the time-to-kill is so short in this that I could drop people with anything and they, in turn, could do the same to me. So fights weren’t about who had found some cool gear or had a smart spot, but just “Who spotted who first and pulled the trigger?”</p><p>It led to a situation where I started to get annoyed and bored with NPC bot fights and would just get a few cool items/guns and extract. But then, I started to wonder why I was even looting guns if I was mostly avoiding or dreading combat with NPCS and rarely saw other players or felt like my guns mattered.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> I was, frankly, shocked how little we ran into human opponents while playing. The max map capacity is currently 18 teams of three players. I’m not sure if that’s a tech limitation or calibrated to limit chaos but something is off about the density of “things to do” on the map right now.</p><p>It feels like there needs to be a lot more AI enemies, or the matches need to be shorter and that threat needs to ramp up more quickly. I can imagine much more exciting scenarios where players are too busy trying to survive to really stab one another in the back at the end of a round, but as it stands the matches didn’t follow any memorable arcs.</p><p>That’s not to say they’re boring moment-to-moment, because you are constantly on the lookout for threats and optimal routes, high ground, good cover, loot, etc. But there’s a glaring hole at the center of what’s in the alpha right now.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong>  I do think, as I realized how safe I usually was in most areas, I did get a bit bored of it after a few hours.</p><p>But I wonder if the number of players is directly tied to the size of the maps, which aren’t massive. And yeah, I agree. I was shocked by how much of the game was me running around the map collecting random sci-fi gear while never seeing other players. </p><p>Speaking of the maps, neither of them are great! And I’m not talking about the rough-looking outdoor areas. (Which I assume will get a few more passes before September’s launch.)</p><p>Both maps in the alpha lack any memorable regions or interesting landmarks. It’s just a collection of a lot of the same-looking assets spread around an area in a maze-like fashion. Nothing remarkable.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> It’s ironic that you spend the game playing as synthetic “shells” that are printed anew each time you die because I can totally imagine a really fun, compelling PVP experience inside the “shell” of what <em>Marathon </em>appears to be at the moment. Based on what we’ve heard about the final game, though, I’m not sure there will be enough bold design swings or interesting ideas to make it feel alive. </p><p>I can’t tell you what Bungie should do but I can tell you a few things are missing right now. The recipe’s a bit bland, like a pizza cooked to perfection but the sauce is too thin and the crust tastes like water.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Do you think this game comes out in September as planned? Because based on the negative or middling reactions I’m seeing online, I’m wondering what the vibes are inside Bungie and if there is any possibility that this thing gets delayed until 2026 so they can make some bigger changes. So they can spice up the pizza and add more toppings. </p><p><strong>EG:</strong> I don’t think it comes out. And if it does, it will be because Sony doesn’t believe in it and is ready to move on. I think there will be a public beta around July or so and based on the level of participation and buzz coming out of that, a call will be made then.</p><p>But I hope I’m wrong and it comes together in the final product because I truly do love the lore and vibes. I very much want a reason to exist in that world and see where it goes in a way that I did not with <em>Concord</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="9f015dc7fe6206a9125290a9dd294009" data-recommend-id="image://9f015dc7fe6206a9125290a9dd294009" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9f015dc7fe6206a9125290a9dd294009" data-recommend-id="image://9f015dc7fe6206a9125290a9dd294009" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Same! I want this game to succeed. And like you said, there’s good stuff in here. I think Bungie, given a bit more time, could tinker with what is here and end up with something that blows up and becomes a big hit. And I want to see that happen. </p><p>But I’m not convinced, after playing the alpha, that <em>Marathon </em>is going to succeed. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/fvbEnWLRo1s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/fvbEnWLRo1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I hope I’m wrong, if only so we keep getting more awesome short movies like that last one.</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, I think they need to make a decision. Is this going to be a fairly punishing hardcore extraction shooter or something that is designed to appeal to more players from more genres? And perhaps this is a debate raging internally at the studio and was part of the reason the NDA was lifted. Maybe they want to see what the reaction is, and different sides can use the online conversations to plead their case.</p><p>For now, I’ll probably play more of the alpha. See if it clicks more with me. How about you?</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>I’ll definitely hop on a few more times and continue hunting for the magic. It’s by no means bad and it certainly feels better to play than some other extraction shooters. </p><p>There’s a lot that’s not in the alpha, so I don’t want to make up my mind too early based on just the roughest proof of concept. And because I’m a sicko I will definitely max out any ranks I can.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Same. The shooty-shooty bits are fun enough and the world is neat. I hope it all comes together in the end. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/655949/switch-2-in-person-preorder-gamestop<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Switch 2 preorders <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655361/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sold-out-walmart-gamestop-target">are sold out online everywhere</a>. But some people have managed to snag one using once conventional but now antiquated means: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/654944/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gamestop-mario-kart-world-bundle">going to GameStop</a> and preordering one in store. </p><p>In addition to offering online preorders for the Switch 2, its <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em> bundle, and the various Switch 2 accessories, GameStop also allowed customers to preorder the console in person when stores opened for business on April 24th. With the advent of ecommerce, preordering video games in a brick-and-mortar store has become a quaint practice that’s fallen out of fashion; something looked upon with nostalgia for the midnight releases of years gone by. But for many people, physically preordering a Switch 2 was the best and easiest way to secure one. I should know — it’s how I got mine.</p><p>I missed the midnight commencement of online Switch 2 preordering for retailers like Wal-Mart, Best Buy, and others. Knowing GameStop opened its online preorders at 11AM ET on April 24th, I thought I might give it a go there, but it was not to be. GameStop’s later preorder launch was just as chaotic, frustrating, and fruitless as it was for the other stores. But then I remembered <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lnkymmvwec2x">seeing a post on Bluesky from <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Jason Schreier</a>. “About 40 people waiting on line here at my local GameStop for 80 Switch 2s. Better odds than the website!” he wrote. </p><p>I saw that my local GameStop on Howe Road in Akron, Ohio, opened soon, and I was no more than a 15-minute ride away. So I packed my wallet and my dog Bu and went down there only to be greeted by a line full of people, some of whom had been waiting for days.</p><p>“It’s been unbelievably busy,” one GameStop employee told me. He said that people started lining up earlier in the week but he discouraged them from camping for multiple days overnight. “We had six waiting yesterday,” he said.</p><p>Other than that small number of campers, most people I spoke to who were waiting in line had only arrived a few hours before the store opened. Nearly everyone owned a regular Switch and was excited by the promise of an improved console. </p><p>“The Switch 1 is so awesome and we’ve been waiting for a Switch 2 for seven years now,” one woman at the front of the line told me. </p><p>“I have to upgrade, there’s no other way around it,” said another Switch 2 hopeful. Everyone I spoke to was enthusiastic about the console and when I brought up its price they still didn’t seem phased.</p><p>“That doesn’t bother me, I got more than enough money,” said one man. Others mentioned the state of the US economy and with inflation impacting consumer goods across the board, the price of the Switch 2 itself seemed reasonable. “The OLED Switch when it launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">was $350</a>,” said another man. “One hundred dollars more, almost 10 years later, not that bad.”</p><p>And while the price of the console doesn’t much bother this Akron crop of Switch 2 enthusiasts, the rising cost of games was another matter entirely. “The pricing for the games is a little steep for my tastes,” said the lady at the front of the line. I followed up by asking if that would impact her spending habits on games in the future. “No. The price is not going to affect that, it’s just going to make me upset.”</p><p>That was the sentiment of most everyone I spoke to. Nintendo’s pricing makes sense given everything going on with inflation and tariffs, and even if the higher prices do sting, it’s Nintendo. “I think it’s worth it,” a mother told me as she was waiting in line with her son and husband.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption>Me and Bu at the local Gamestop</figcaption> <cite>Photo: Ash Parrish / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p><em>Mario Kart World </em>was the first game out of everyone’s mouth when I asked what they were most excited to play at launch. Everyone in line was hoping to score the <em>Mario Kart World</em> Switch 2 bundle that essentially gets you the game at a $30 discount. Every so often, a GameStop employee would take a tally of the customers who wanted a bundle. He’d point to a person in line — who was well ahead of me — and say, “you’re the last.” </p><p>According to a sign on the door, that location had been allotted 44 bundles and 19 regular Switch 2 consoles. But throughout my time in line, I overheard them say to customers that they expect to have more units available to be purchased when the console launches on June 5th. Since everybody wanted a <em>Mario Kart</em> bundle, I resigned myself to only getting a regular Switch 2 — a far better prospect than the one I faced this morning of not getting any Switch at all. But as the line moved, the employees found more and more Switch 2 bundles. Finally, during one of the tallys, one employee pointed to me and said I would be the last one to get one.</p><p>And I did. </p><p>With Bu strapped ever so patiently to my back, I preordered a Switch 2 <em>Mario Kart World </em>bundle and threw an extra five bucks down on<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. I shouldn’t be all that surprised this worked out as well as it did, sometimes the old ways simply work best.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unknown Worlds has shared a first in-game look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, as part of a new developer video charting the highly anticipated underwater survival sequel's "road to early access".
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2 (actually the third game in the acclaimed series, following 2021's standalone <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> expansion Below Zero) was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-subnautica-game-is-in-early-development">confirmed to be in the works</a> all the way back in 2022. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-gets-first-trailer-and-its-launching-into-early-access-next-year">first trailer finally arrived last October</a>, but it was purely a scene-setting cinematic - tipping a nod to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-responds-to-publisher-claims-its-a-multiplayer-live-service-game">sequel's new co-op mode</a> - rather than offering any actual gameplay.
</p>
<p>
Skip ahead seven months, and we've now been given a first glimpse of how Subnautica 2 looks in-game. Unknown Worlds shared the early footage as part of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oqrucfXQo">Road to Early Access developer video</a>, in which Subnautica 2 design lead Anthony Gallegos offered a small taste of things to come across the update's brief runtime.

During his chatter, we got a tease of some new environments - including what appears to be the Subnautica 2 equivalent of the first game's Safe Shallows (the sequel is set on a brand-new world) and a bioluminescent underground area - plus a few new aquatic creatures. There's a second or two of a strange waddling thing with a fan-like tail, for instance, and a large fish headbutting rocks. We also got a peek at co-operative swimming and base building.
</p>
<p>
It's not a lot to go on, admittedly, and the studio still hasn't announced an early access release date. All we know right now is it's due to launch "later" this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC (via Steam and Epic), and it's coming to Game Pass too.
</p>
<p>
Previously, Unknown Worlds said it expected Subnautica 2 to launch into early access with its co-op multiplayer mode, "several biomes, some narrative, and a variety of creatures and craftables". There's plenty of time for things to evolve from there, too, given the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-launching-with-multiplayer-and-several-biomes-but-early-access-will-last-2-to-3-years">studio is anticipating</a> early access will last "about two to three years."

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/red-candle-games">Red Candle Games</a> are probably more frequently remembered as a horror developer, what with their first couple of games being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detention">Detention</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devotion-devs-are-selling-it-themselves-after-gog-chickened-out">slightly troubled</a> (but very good) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a>. Surprisingly, their follow-up to the latter wasn't another horror game, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nine-sols">Nine Sols</a>, a Sekiro-inspired 2D action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">Metroidvania</a> that just looks stunning in motion. It was a welcome surprise! Developers should never feel beholden to expectations, and Red Candle Games have once again offered up a lovely little surprise in the form of a Nine Sols prequel manga.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As it turns out, the reason for its existence is a pretty simple one: the devs just had too much story for one game (but mostly "time constraints and other factors"). So, as they explain in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1809540/announcements/detail/544481587857719320">Steam post</a>, last year they "established a partnership with Mojoin", a site for a whole bunch of webcomics, as well as hooked up with artist Yang Chi-Cheng. "As a result, what was once an extravagant idea for us gradually became a reality through the collective efforts of everyone involved, especially with the invaluable contributions of Mr. Yang," Red Candle Games explained.
</p>
<p>
The plot is set "long before" Nine Sols itself, though I'm not sure how long before, and focuses on two Solarians who "forever altered the course of Penglai’s history." The manga is also, quite conveniently available in English alongside Chinese and Japanese, and the first chapter is <a href="https://mojoin.com/comics/224#chapter">already available to read too</a>. Update will apparently be coming weekly on Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
I haven't actually had the good fortune of playing Nine Sols just yet, our own Nic liked it so much it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nine-sols-review">turned him around on the genre</a>, so I've only had a skim of the manga myself. Therefore, I can't really speak to the story all that much, but the artwork is great. Lots of confident linework that captures the style of the game very well. What a treat! Perhaps it's time for me to pick the game up…

The controller releases on June 5th, the same day as the Switch 2, but Nintendo will be making it available to order ahead of that date.</p><p>Initially, the controller will be available to buy from May 8th to May 12th to people who receive direct invitations from Nintendo to buy a Switch 2, according to a footnote on the controller’s listing. Starting May 13th, Nintendo will offer it to people who pay for a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Nintendo will limit purchases to one per Nintendo Account.</p><p>The controller looks very similar to the original GameCube one, but the Switch 2 version is wireless and has some additional buttons to match what’s on other Switch 2 controllers. It won’t work with all regular Switch 2 games, though; in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/556487/gamecube-controllers-functionality-switch-1">a statement to <em>Polygon</em></a>, Nintendo said that since the controller “doesn’t have all the buttons and features found in other controllers that can be used with the Nintendo Switch 2 system, there may be some issues when playing other games.”</p><p>For the Switch 2, Nintendo will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso">offer GameCube games</a> as part of a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. On the Switch 2’s launch date, the GameCube lineup will include <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, <em>F-Zero GX</em>, and <em>Soulcalibur II</em>. </p><p><em><strong>Update, April 24th</strong>: Added that Nintendo will limit to one controller per Nintendo Account.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>  <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> is Remedy Entertainment’s unexpected foray into the multiplayer shooter genre. Set in the occult office space world of<em> Control</em>, the co-op experience is unlike anything the <em>Alan Wake 2</em> maker has ever done before and it now has a release date. The Finnish studio revealed that <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> is out in June and shared details about the game’s battle pass that make it sound very similar to the one in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,196860,197541" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Announced during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a livestream with the developers on Thursday</a></span>, <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on June 17 at the price of $40. As previously confirmed, it’ll also be available via Game Pass on console and PC, as well as PlayStation Plus via the Extra and Premier tiers. Most importantly, Remedy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536600287259918382&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536600287259918382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained on Steam</a></span> how the game’s post-launch content will roll out and be monetized. </p><p>Similar to <em>Helldivers 2's </em>Warbonds, <em>Firebreak</em>’s battle passes are called Requisitions. There will be free and paid tiers, each unlocking new weapons, cosmetics, and other items. The “free” Requisitions are purchased with in-game currency while the premium ones are purchased with real money. All Requisitions will also remain permanently available in-game, following the trend kicked-off by <em>Halo: Infinite</em> and others. </p><p>Here’s how the grind works in more detail, per Remedy:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Earn Lost Assets by completing Jobs.</li><li>Spend them to unlock items in any Requisition you have acquired.</li><li>Unlocking items isn’t fully linear; rather, you can choose what you want to unlock.</li><li>You can progress multiple Requisitions at once.</li></ul></blockquote><p>So yes, for anyone who’s played <em>Helldivers 2</em> it should all sound pretty familiar. It makes sense for <em>Firebreak </em>to borrow from that system given both games following a similar session-based PVE gameplay loop. Remedy also confirmed plans for ongoing free post-launch updates in the form of two new missions coming after release, with additional content slated to arrive in 2026. </p><p>But it doesn’t sound like Remedy’s trying to drown players in an endless grind. Instead, <em>Firebreak</em> sounds like live service gaming-lite: it’s not a game you ever really “beat” but it also isn’t meant to feel like a second job, another balancing act <em>Helldivers 2</em> nailed. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s because of all the funny faces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">Oblivion Remastered</a>, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes are going down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</u></a>.

In a <a href="https://x.com/jg93/status/1915246673137221832" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Gardiner, now boss of Something Wicked Games, revealed that when testing the original Oblivion the developers at Bethesda would compete to see who could come up with the most absurd face. You can imagine some of the faces the team built, but, in Gardiner's opinion, there's one recently made in Oblivion Remastered that would have won all those years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The nightmarish face in question was created by YouTuber and NASCAR/ARCA driver Cody Dennison, aka CAMELOT331. In a tweet, CAMELOT331 described his creation as “my magnum opus,” and named him 'Sir Vancealot.'</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Towards the end of development when we were all playtesting Oblivion, we used to all compete to see who could make the most absurd face.

            <p>
Control fans eager to return to the depth of the Oldest House won't have long to wait. Remedy Entertainment has confirmed its three-player PvE Control spin-off, FBC: Firebreak, releases for PC and consoles on 17th June, with talk of plenty of post-launch support to come.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">unveiled last October</a>, promising a co-operative take on the Control universe in which players, cast as members of the Federal Bureau of Control's Firebreak response unit, must keep the Oldest House's numerous paranatural anomalies - from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreaks-latest-trailer-brings-extradimensional-furnaces-and-exploding-pink-goo">weird pink goo</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-asks-the-question-what-happens-when-the-offices-post-it-notes-fight-back">sentient Post-It notes</a> - in check. Each Job takes players to different corners of the ever-changing building - some familiar and some new - and features different mechanics, enemies, objectives, and even status-effect-style conditions.
</p>
<p>
Remedy offered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8">another look at FBC: Firebreak in its latest developer livestream</a> earlier today, sharing details about the game's battle-pass-style progression system, Requisitions. These come in two flavours: standard Requisitions, which are free to all players, and premium Classified Requisitions, which must be purchased with real money.

<p>
Standard Requisitions contain weapons, armour, and equipment that can be unlocked using in-game currency earned through play, while items in Classified Requisitions are cosmetic only with no gameplay benefits. Notably, there's no expiration date on Requisitions, meaning players can unlock items in their own time. In addition to Requisitions, Remedy has outlined its post-launch content plans, confirming it intends to release at least new Jobs in 2025, with more coming next year. These will be free to all players.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak launches for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fbc-firebreak-fc3830">Epic</a>) on 17th June. The standard edition costs £32.99/€39.99/$39.99 USD, and it'll also be available on day one via PC Game Pass, Game Pass Ultimate, and PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium.
</p>
<p>
Those looking for something a bit fancier can pick up FBC: Firebreak's Deluxe Edition which costs £39.99/€49.99/$49.99 USD and throws in a variety of premium cosmetics. These include the Firestarter and Pencil Pusher premium voice packs, the Golden Firebreak spray, the Firestarter armour set, the Scorched Remnant double-barrel shotgun skin, plus the premium Firestarter Classified Requisition, which features 36 unlockable cosmetics. Remedy notes standard edition owners can upgrade to the Deluxe version for £7/€10/$10.

		<p>Remedy Entertainment has announced that co-op <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a> spin-off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> is launching on 17th June, dropping onto PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam and Epic.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak will set you back $39.99 / €39.99 / £32.99, but will also be available day one via&nbsp;PC Game Pass, Game Pass Ultimate, and the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog (Extra and Premium). A Deluxe Edition will be $49.99 / €49.99 / £39.99, or an upgrade for the difference of $10 / €10 / £7.</p>


<p>The announcement came through the April Developer Update which also gave a longer look at a newly revealed mission, Hot Fix, as well as another look at &nbsp;Paper Chase, where sticky notes have been all spookified.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak Developer Update April 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0s2x2a35wP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Other Jobs revealed so far have also showed&nbsp;a Furnace that spread fire across the Maintenance Sector, needing players to turn on sprinklers and fans to douse the flames, or the pink Exogenic Mass, which explodes if you touch it.</p>

<p>Of course, you’ll have some buddies by your side to give you some morale-boosting pats on the back to get back to work. FBC: Firebreak is a three-player co-op shooter, loosely in the vein of Left 4 Dead. In addition to standard weapons like shotguns, there’s also a crank-fired fluid projector, an electric charge impactor, and the big wrench which can have a squeaky toy pig attached to it.</p>
<p>Playing the game will tap into a system of rewards called Requisitions, which are a free way to unlock cosmetics and gear like weapons, equipment, armor, sprays, and more using in-game currency earned through gameplay. There will be no limited-time windows or rotating stores, so no FOMO.</p>
<p>Classified Requisitions are the premium counterpart, which can be purchased with real money and will always be purely cosmetic. You can see these with the Deluxe Edition, which will include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">“The Firestarter” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">“The Pencil Pusher” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Firestarter Armor Set, Apex Revision (Helmet, Body Armor, Gloves)</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Scorched Remnant Double-Barrel Shotgun Skin</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Golden Firebreak Spray</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Classified Requisition: “Firestarter”: A collection of 36 unlockable cosmetic items including weapon skins, sprays, and armor sets</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Remedy also gave a look at the longer term picture for the game. Post-launch two more missions will be added to the game through 2025, with more updates planned for 2026. All playable content will be free to all players.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Not long now before we get to set foot back in the Oldest House to blow up small pieces of paper!</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/electronic-arts/">EA</a> has announced the release dates for both Madden NFL 26 and EA Sports College Football 26, and confirmed that there will be no Xbox One or PlayStation 4 versions of both games, leaving behind the last-gen versions five years after the launch of the current generation.</p>
<p>EA Sports College Football 26 will launch on&nbsp;<strong>July 10, 2025</strong> and will be available three days earlier for players who purchase early access through the Deluxe Edition, while Madden NFL 26 will arrive on <strong>August 14, 2025,</strong> and will also be available three days earlier for those who grab the Deluxe Edition.</p>
<p>If you were already planning on grabbing both games, EA has a<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/bundles/mvp-bundle/buy"> bundle</a> you can grab that'll get you both games when they release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Madden 26 &amp; College Football 26 Announce Trailer | The Call" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EIp9SMjNH1w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Deluxe Edition for Madden NFL 26 nabs you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three days early access</li>
<li>4600 Madden Points</li>
<li>Season 1 Elite Player Item</li>
<li>Cover Athlete Elite Player Item</li>
<li>Superstar Legendary XP Boost</li>
<li>Franchise Coach ability points</li>
<li>Player card exclusive item</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Deluxe Edition for EA Sports College Football 26 gets you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three days early access</li>
<li>4600 College Football Points</li>
<li>Top Prospect Ultimate Team Pack</li>
<li>All Hands Ultimate Team Pack</li>
<li>Dynasty Coach Points</li>
<li>Road to Glory Skill Points</li>
</ul>
<p>The MVP Bundle, which is what you'll want to get if you were getting both games anyway, gets you all of the above along with a few bundle exclusive items for either game. If you pre-order the bundle ahead of April 29, 2025, you'll always get the Travis Hunter 99 OVR player item in both Madden NFL 26 and College Football 26.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-july-2024-report-reveals-ea-sports-college-football-25-is-an-instant-hit/">EA Sports College Football 25</a> was a smash-success for EA last year, with the series returning after being on hiatus for a decade. It'll be interesting to see if that same success can be repeated, or even surpassed this year. Sports games are a consistent seller every year, and it's doubtful that the same fans who flooded to buy the first official college football video game in 10 years are satiated by just one new release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another board game developer is scaling back production in response to the volatile global trade environment. CMON, the developer behind works like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/massive-darkness-2-hellscape-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Massive Darkness</em></a>, will pause all board game development and crowdfunding projects.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.cmon.com/press/an-update-on-our-internal-teams-and-company-focus/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, CMON posted a brief three-paragraph statement. The statement explains that the company will be immediately pausing all board game development alongside any crowdfunding projects.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cmon-zombicide-board-game.jpg?itok=XkpUnsYH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cmon-zombicide-board-game.jpg?itok=EJ1oFyPk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As a result, CMON will be making reductions in creative teams. Though no numbers or specific departments are mentioned, the statement does remark that the employees laid off will be missed professionally and personally.</p>

<p>The reasons given for the tabletop company's major decision is the recent trade tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese imports.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The industry continues to rapidly evolve, and unpredictable situations like the recent tariffs, or COVID just a few years ago, present challenges for everyone in board games. With that said, it is our responsibility to take these difficult measures to ensure that we can keep current projects on track and deliver them in a timely manner. We will of course resume new development as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The vast majority of board game production happens overseas in China and is then imported back to the US. Due to the trade tariffs, production costs have jumped up exponentially. Since there is no infrastructure to bring the same level of production locally, studios have had to make difficult business decisions in response to this devastating complication to the industry.</p>

<p>CMON is the latest studio to scale down or suspend tabletop game development as a response to the uncertain chaotic trade environment caused by the Trump administration. An environment that has already lead to closures by developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a>, online retailer <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/boardlandia-shuts-down-due-to-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boardlandia</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stonemaier-games-suing-us-president-over-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a lawsuit</a> by Stonemaier Games.</p>

<p>CMON's tabletop game development history is packed with beloved entries. Their catalog includes the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/zombicide-dceased-brings-anti-life-to-table" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Zombicide</em></a> series, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/song-of-ice-fire-tactics-fully-funded-in-under-7-hours" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>A Song of Ice &amp; Fire: Tactics</em></a>, localizing several <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-partners-with-bouken-to-bring-japanese-ttrpgs-to-west" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Japanese TTRPGs</a>, and officially licensed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/metal-gear-solid-board-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Metal Gear Solid</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bloodborne-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Bloodborne</em> board games</a>.</p>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The summer of video game releases is starting to heat up. Remedy Entertainment, the studio behind <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Alan Wake</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">Control</a></em>, announced that its first multiplayer title <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/651425/a-rough-day-at-the-office">FBC: Firebreak</a></em> will launch on June 17th. It’ll be available on PC (both Steam and the Epic Game Store), the PS5, and Xbox. It’ll also be available on subscription platforms Game Pass and PlayStation Plus.</p><p>Set in the <em>Control</em> universe a few years after the original game, <em>Firebreak</em> is a three player co-op shooter where players take on missions inside of the headquarters of the FBC — Federal Bureau of Control — which has become overrun by supernatural forces. “The game features highly replayable missions known as Jobs, each uniquely designed with different challenges, objectives, and environments that require teamwork and adaptability,” Remedy explains.</p><p>The new game will be a paid release, priced at $39.99, and it sounds like it will be a nice change of pace from demanding live-service games. The studio says that, while there are updates planned for after launch, “all future playable content, including new Jobs, will be free. Players will have the option to purchase cosmetics, but none of these items will affect gameplay, and there will be no limited-time rotations or daily log-ins. ”</p><p>You can see some of the game in action here:</p><div><p><em>Firebreak</em> is part of <em>Remedy</em>’s plan to build <em>Control</em>’s supernatural universe into something much bigger. In addition to the multiplayer spinoff, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300511/control-2-action-rpg">a direct sequel is in development</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231469/control-sequel-movie-tv-remedy-annapurna">the studio has also partnered with Annapurna Pictures for future film and TV adaptations</a>.</p></div><div><p><em>Firebreak</em>’s release also comes during a very busy period for games, which will also include the launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642420/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-preview">the Nintendo Switch 2</a> (and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>), alongside games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349379/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-xbox-pc-ps5">Doom: The Dark Ages</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610946/death-stranding-2-trailer-ps5-state-of-play-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></em>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

On top of that, you'll also be able to take part in online co-op battles through the Red Light Raid mode, teaming you up with players around the world to shake down the seedy underworld of the game's infamous districts.</p><p>One thing to note about this release is that it's a Game-Key Card version. Essentially, this means that you'll still need to download Yakuza 0 onto your Switch 2 and the cartridge will act as an authentication device. Game-Key cards are not tied to your Nintendo account, so if you want to sell the game when you're done with it, it will work fine on a different Switch 2 console. An internet connection is only required when booting up a Game-Key Card for the first time, after which the game can be accessed in offline mode on the Switch 2.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you've never played Yakuza 0, then you've missed out on one of the best games that Sega has ever published. Set in 1988 Japan during its financial boom, the game is an origin story for longtime Yakuza characters Kiryu Kazuma and Goro Majima, revealing how they became the legends known as the Dragon of Dojima and the Mad Dog of Shimano, respectively. At its core, Yakuza 0 is a 3D beat-'em-up with a heavy emphasis on storytelling, with major beats in the game playing out like episodes of a gangland drama series.</p><p>The game is also packed with diversions, as there are side stories to explore between missions and numerous mini-games to take part in. Kiryu even gets to take part in a side-hustle invests in real estate in Kamurocho, while Goro runs a cabaret club in Sotenbori. Both modes are surprisingly deep, and either one could work well as a standalone game.</p><hr><p>Yakuza 0: Director's Cut is one of several Sega-published games that'll be released for the Switch 2.

In Japan, Nintendo is holding Switch 2 lotteries, where people submit their names for a chance to preorder the upcoming console. The idea is to cut down on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-units-are-already-dropping-on-ebay-some-arent-what-they-seem/1100-6531090/" data-ref-id="1100-6531090">scalpers hoarding systems and selling them at exorbitant prices</a>, and to avoid the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-a-switch-2-was-a-chaotic-stressful-mess/1100-6531084/">chaotic mess of online free-for-alls</a>, but it seems unscrupulous actors are taking advantage of the situation in other ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Some consumers received emails telling them it was their turn to purchase a Switch 2 and directing them to click on a link that would take them somewhere that was definitely not the Nintendo Store.</p><p dir="ltr">"We have confirmed phishing emails disguised as the results of the My Nintendo Store 'Nintendo Switch 2' lottery sale," Nintendo said in a statement on <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1915369995934326801" rel="nofollow ">X</a> (translated via Google). "The lottery results sent today will not include a URL for the purchase procedure due to a change in the processing period. If there is a URL for reservations or purchases, it was not sent by our company. Please be careful."</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo of America is hosting a similar, albeit more restrictive, sign-up process where people who meet specific requirements can register their Nintendo Accounts for a chance to preorder a Switch 2 on the Nintendo Store. Nintendo will send an invitation to purchase the system in May, though some may not receive invitations until after the June 5 launch. The phishing attempts tied to the Japanese Switch 2 lottery occasionally used hard-to-spot methods of covering their tracks, such as minor misspellings or URLs connected to other regions.

			<p>During a special livestream that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just aired</a>, Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment announced the final release date for its first multiplayer game, FBC: Firebreak. The cooperative first-person shooter game for up to three players will be launched for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fbc-firebreak-fc3830" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on June 17, priced at $39.99 / €39.99 / £32.99.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, it will also be available on day one via Microsoft's PC Game Pass/Game Pass Ultimate and Sony's PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers in a bid to maximize the player base from the get-go.</p>
<p>Remedy is also releasing a Deluxe Edition, priced at&nbsp;$49.99 / €49.99 / £39.99. This edition includes exclusive cosmetic items and voice packs that allow players to customize their audiovisual identity.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak Deluxe Edition includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The Firestarter” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li>“The Pencil Pusher” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li>Firestarter Armor Set, Apex Revision (Helmet, Body Armor, Gloves)</li>
<li>Scorched Remnant Double-Barrel Shotgun Skin</li>
<li>Golden Firebreak Spray</li>
<li>Classified Requisition: “Firestarter”: A collection of 36 unlockable cosmetic items, including weapon skins, sprays, and armor sets</li>
</ul>
<p>Owners of the base game can upgrade to the Deluxe Edition at any time for $10.00 / €10.00 / £7.00.</p>

<p>During today's live stream, Remedy also briefed fans on the post-launch support. Two new Jobs (missions) will be released later in 2025, while even more updates will be made available throughout 2026. As the studio previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-info-all-post-launch-content-will-be-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a>, all post-launch content will be free, and monetization will be limited to cosmetic-only items.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is powered by Remedy's proprietary Northlight engine, previously seen in Control and Alan Wake 2. However, being a multiplayer game first and foremost, the studio has <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-will-have-lower-pc-requirements-than-remedys-single-player-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken care to optimize it</a> to be more accessible to a wider range of PC configurations. Even so, high-end features like path tracing (already implemented in Alan Wake 2) and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation will be supported on PC.</p>

<p>Remedy revealed the news in a livestream this evening, although due to the time altering world event known as embargoed press releases, I'm writing this before the stream goes live on Remedy's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/RemedyGames">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/remedygames">Twitch</a> channels. Thus, I can only guess what the reveal looked like for the new job, Hot Fix. 'Jobs' are what they're calling the repeatable missions you'll play through in the titular Federal Bureau Of Control, one of gaming's finest mind-melting bureaucratic horror institutions. A Housing Benefit Form Desk Of Leaves, if you will.</p>
<p>Firebreak is Remedy's first foray into the Getting That Potentially Infinite Bag world of live service, which, inevitably, means cosmetics. There are two types, the first being 'Requisitions' ("weapons, equipment, armor, sprays, and more") that'll be sold for an in-game currency you'll earn by playing. No timers or rotating stores for these, either. The second, 'Classified requisitions' ("armor sets, custom voice packs, sprays, and weapon skins"), will cost you. "The items are purely cosmetic, have no gameplay impact, and will remain available permanently," Remedy say. This all sounds like it'll be funding post-launch support, with new jobs planned as early as this year.</p>
<p>Edwin had a chat with Remedy about their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/controls-office-junior-firebreak-cant-decide-if-its-a-job">approach to live service recently</a>, in which they basically say that their 'We did not make Firebreak just to get that potentially infinite bag' t-shirts are raising a lot of questions already answered by the shirts. Personally, I'm torn between being reflexively iffy about this stuff on principle while also believing Remedy deserve a fat payday, every day, and rubbing my hands together in glee over what sort of stupidly self-indulgent, brilliant art they can make with the funds. Oh! Oh! I'm coining 'Deep Bloc Galactic'. Because of brutalism, right? Little gift there for you. Nice little Thursday treat.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
