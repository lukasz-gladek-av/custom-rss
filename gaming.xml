<p>Nintendo's new mobile service for Hyrule</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Alongside the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> on the Switch 2, Nintendo added a special service to its mobile app called <strong>Zelda Notes</strong> – giving players multiple features to enhance their time in Hyrule.</p>
<p>This service includes navigation assistance, voice memories, autobuild sharing, item sharing, and much more. In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review here on Nintendo Life</a>, we couldn't help but feel a lot of these useful features should have been implemented in-game, but it's now got us wondering how everyone else is finding this optional extra a few weeks later.</p>
<p>Are you still using it? Have you used this service at all? Vote in our poll and let us know in the comments. It's worth noting this app is exclusive to the Switch 2 editions of these games and doesn't require a Nintendo Switch Online membership to use.</p>

<p>Here's what's included</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has also been doing a lot behind the scenes over the past few weeks to update many of its major first-party Switch titles for the Switch 2. This includes both free and paid upgrades for select titles, and alongside the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> update, Nintendo has also rolled out a patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>.</p>
<p>This bumps the latest version of the game up to Version 2.0.0 and follows on from an update released in November last year. This latest update contains a bunch of general updates resolving multiple bugs. Here's the full rundown according to Nintendo's support page:</p><p><figure data-videoid="XT_vmJEKdkw" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XT_vmJEKdkw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT_vmJEKdkw"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT_vmJEKdkw">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-nexus-mods-owners-scramble-to-assuage-community-concerns-following-sale-by-burnt-out-founder.1221447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nexus-mods-new-owners-chosen-monetization<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re a PC gamer who even sometimes considers installing user-made mods, you’ve almost certainly visited <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexus Mods</a>. There are other sites, sure, and Steam has incorporated mods directly into its client via the Steam Workshop, but Nexus Mods remains the place where the modding community congregates – where awe-inspiring ambition and somehow even more awe-inspiring horniness give rise to countless feats of ingenuity. Yesterday, Robin “Dark0ne” Scott, who founded the site 17 years ago, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that he’d sold his pride, joy, and source of near-constant stress. Little would change, he claimed, but provided few concrete details beyond that – not even the name of the company that purchased the site. So the community went digging, and they did not like what they unearthed.&nbsp;</p><p>Nexus Mods’ new owners, as it turns out, hail from a company called Chosen. If nothing else, it <a href="https://wearechosen.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bills itself</a> as a less-terrible alternative to venture capital and private equity, but it still very much speaks in terms of scale and monetization. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/nexus-mods-new-owners-promise-they-wont-monetise-the-site-to-death-as-users-panic-at-the-whiff-of-venture-capital-the-new-owners-are-here-not-sitting-in-a-distant-tower-remotely-directing-us-all-towards-some-nefarious-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to PC Gamer</a>, Nexus Mods users were also dismayed to discover that the LinkedIn page of one of Chosen’s founders, Victor Folmann, featured a “<a href="https://imgur.com/ztjS4K7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gaming Startup Monetization Cheat Sheet</a>” littered with red flags: blurbs on ads, pay-to-earn, pay-to-play, microtransactions, and NFTs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ensuing panic led to a response from one of the new owners, seemingly Folmann going by the handle Foledinho, on Scott’s original announcement post – the comments section of which has been disabled multiple times since the post went live yesterday. In it, Folmann shoots down a barrage of accusations, saying mods will remain free, creators will continue to own mods, free accounts won’t be restricted in any new ways, and that while ads are a “necessary trade-off to keep the site running,” he hopes to “reduce them over time, not increase them.”&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of overall monetization, Folmann said he believes Nexus Mods did it “right” back in the day with premium memberships, saying there are no plans to “change the core of how premium works.” But he added ominously that “hosting billions of mod files and running the infrastructure behind Nexus Mods isn’t cheap” and, in response to a question about additional monetization, did not shoot down the idea.</p><p>“Monetization is hard and Nexus Mods is a complex platform,” he wrote. “What matters most is continuing to support mod authors, delight users, and keep the lights on. We’re not changing the core model. No aggressive monetization. No paid mods. If anything, we’re aiming for fewer ads, not more. We’ll take a community-first, listening approach, and we won’t compromise on what’s made Nexus Mods special.”</p><p>Speaking to PC Gamer, a Nexus Mods spokesperson echoed the business-as-usual sentiment: "Our focus is on continuity, not disruption. We have a very experienced team here of 40 highly talented people, with tons of modding experience and a deep history with the community and this is not changing. The new owners are here, embedded in the team, working with us all directly, not sitting in a distant tower, remotely directing us all towards some nefarious goals."&nbsp;</p><p>This mirrors what Scott said in his original announcement post:</p><p>“Behind the scenes, I’ve already been stepping back bit by bit,” Scott wrote. “Over the past few years, the team has taken on more of the weight and the site’s been doing better than ever. What’s changing now is simply the formality of it, making sure the right people are in place to guide Nexus Mods into the next era. … In terms of new faces, you’ll also be seeing more of Foledinho (Victor), Rapsak (Marinus) and Taagen (Nikolai), who’ve come on board to lead this next chapter. They’ve got deep roots in gaming, tech, and most importantly, they give a damn; about the site, the community, and the future we’re trying to build here.”</p><p>So then why not even mention Chosen by name prior to community inquiries? The new owners say they wanted to give Scott – who will, confusingly, still sort of be around in what sounds like an advisory capacity – a proper sendoff.</p><p>“This post wasn’t about Chosen,” wrote Folmann. “It was about Robin and the legacy he built over 24 years. We’re the new owners and ultimate decision-makers at Nexus Mods. We’ll share more about ourselves when we’ve earned that right. For now, we’re focused on listening, learning, and making modding even easier, and yes, you’ll see us around in the community being active. Trust takes time. We're committed to putting control back in the hands of creators, players, and communities. We’ll get back to building now.”</p><p>The “putting control <em>back </em>in the hands of creators, players, and communities” line could be a general statement of intent, but it could also be referencing a whole other course in this can-of-worms feast: the Nexus Mods community’s years-spanning debate over diversity and inclusion, specifically in regard to its ban on mods that remove inclusive elements, like pronoun choices, "when the removal is clearly to be divisive or cause hostility within the community or marginalize specific group(s)."&nbsp;</p><p>Nexus Mods put its foot down on the issue back in 2022 following a mod that removed Pride flags from <em>Spider-Man Remastered</em>, with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/14733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scott writing at the time</a> that “We are for inclusivity, we are for diversity. If we think someone is uploading a mod on our site with the intent to deliberately be against inclusivity and/or diversity then we will take action against it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ever since then, the site has been under fire for supposed “censorship” from vocal (though not necessarily representative) members of the modding community, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5of-BMAnc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the usual suspects like Asmongold</a>. This despite a relatively middle-of-the-road stance from Scott, who, for example, recently pointed out that the removal of a Donald Trump <em>Marvel Rivals</em> mod corresponded with the same action being taken against a corresponding Joe Biden mod.&nbsp;</p><p>“We also removed the exact same mod with Joe Biden's head at the same time… to ensure there was no bias and because we don't want to handle all the nutjobs that come out the woodwork whenever these mods get posted. Funny how the outrage-bait YouTubers don't mention that, isn't it?” Scott wrote in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nexusmods/comments/1hv0moo/anyone_else_sick_and_tired_of_nexus_mods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a thread on the Nexus Mods subreddit in January</a>. “It's so dumb, and these people are so dumb, that I really cannot be fucked with it. I'm not expecting any of my staff to have to handle these whackjobs any more than showing them the door either. So we delete all the mods we see/that get reported to us on the topic, and all the people this upsets can trot-on because it's really not worth our time or effort to care about.”</p><p>The question now is, will Nexus Mods maintain these sorts of hardline stances without Scott at the helm? At the moment, it’s unclear. Aftermath reached out to two of the site’s new owners, as well as multiple official email addresses and one moderator, for more information about future plans on that front, but did not receive a response as of this publishing.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, the site’s moderators continue to open and close the comments section on Scott’s sale announcement thread each day in the name of “healthy debate.”</p><p>"We appreciate the thoughtful and (mostly) respectful discussion that took place here around this news announcement," a Nexus Mods moderator <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted today</a>. "It's always good to see people engaging with different perspectives, even on hot-button topics like moderation and censorship. Unfortunately, the thread has gradually crossed from spirited discourse into spirited chaos. Some comments have gone off the rails, some have gone off-topic, and a few tried to jump the rails entirely. While some of you have appreciated a lighter touch in this comment section, others have expressed dismay that a heavier hand has not been applied. Regardless of your view, thanks for the always interesting and often insightful views being shared. Rather than let this carry on through our night unattended, comments will be disabled temporarily, but the gates will open once again tomorrow."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-update-scylla-sirens-new-song"><h3>New Scylla Songs!</h3></a><p>"Now we've got you in our tentacles"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-congress-online"><h3>Young Democrats Are Running Very Online Campaigns In 2025</h3></a><p>Kat Abughazaleh's Congressional campaign wants to reach people both locally and online</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/relooted-game-africa-museum-visa-nyamakop-interview"><h3>How Relooted, A Game About Reclaiming African Artifacts From Western Museums, Ended Up Being Shown By A White Guy At Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>"Fucked up to be making a game about reclaiming African artifacts that are in Western countries, and Africans can't even visit those artifacts"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The patch for this Switch 2 exclusive is now live</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b8f150bd4881b/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're now well into the first month of the Switch 2 and Nintendo has today released a new software update for the system-exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>On face value, this patch includes multiple fixes tied to "issues" with items, game crashes, online play problems and more. Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h2>Mario Kart World - Ver. 1.1.1 (Released June 17, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where items were no longer able to be used.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes controls were inoperable when selecting a character and trying to start Free Roam from the “Free Roam” map.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes the game shut down when watching replay after a race.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes the game shut down after a race in “Online Play.”</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where rate fluctuations were sometimes displayed incorrectly in “Knockout Tour” and “Online Play.”</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where it was easy for a communication error to occur when trying to join Friends playing “VS Race” or “Battle” in “Online Play.”</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where you sometimes slipped through the wall before the finish line of “DK Spaceport.”</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where you sometimes couldn’t return to correct position after falling of the course between “Airship Fortress” and “Bowser’s Castle” while gliding.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>If you want to keep enjoying modes like Knockout Tour, you'll need to update your copy of Mario Kart World to this latest version before going online. You can manually install this update by pressing the plus or minus button on the software from the Switch 2 Home menu and selecting "software update". Alternatively, you can simply boot the game and you should be prompted to update.</p>
<p>This follows on from the release of Version 1.1.1 at launch, which enabled various features for the game and also made some other changes. You can find out more about this patch in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/mario-kart-world-update-is-out-now-here-are-the-patch-notes">our previous post</a> here on Nintendo Life.</p>

As a bonus, select plans also include an up to $50 Amazon gift card if you keep your subscription for at least 31 days. The deal only applies to NordVPN's 2-year plans, which require you to pay in full at sign-up, and the discount and Amazon gift card amount change depending on which plan you buy. Here's a look at the options:</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>NordVPN 2-Plan Deals</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Basic</strong> -- $81.36 for the first 24 months (normally $278.16 per 24 months)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Plus</strong> -- $105.36 for the first 24 months (normally $359.76 per 24 months) - Also includes $20 Amazon gift card</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Complete</strong> -- $129.36 for the first 24 months (normally $439 per 24 months) - Also includes $40 Amazon gift card</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Prime</strong> -- $177.36 for the first 24 months (normally $743.76 per 24 months) - Also includes $50 Amazon gift card</li></ul><p>While all four 2-year NordVPN plans are discounted, only the Plus, Complete, and Prime plans include Amazon gift cards. Each plan includes differing features, which we've outlined below.</p><p>Note that the discounted price only applies to the first 24-month purchase. After the promotional period, all subscriptions roll over to the full standard price unless you cancel ahead of time. NordVPN also offers a full 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you change your mind within the first month of service, you can cancel for a full refund. However, the Amazon gift card bonus is only delivered if you keep your 2-year Plus, Complete, or Prime plan for 31 days.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that NordVPN also offers annual and monthly subscription options, although these plans aren't as steeply discounted and do not include the Amazon gift card freebie.</p><h2>NordVPN plan features</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4516454-nordvpn.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516454" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4516454-nordvpn.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516454"></a><figcaption>NordVPN</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4516454-nordvpn.jpg"></figure><p>All four NordVPN plans include different features and benefits, starting with simple VPN and DNS services for the Basic plan, and up to 1TB of cloud storage and bonus cybersecurity protections for the more expensive plans.

</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0685f59b6039e/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's new game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> includes all sorts of toggles making it accessible to everyone. However, it seems this has also led to some confusion – with some players questioning why their karts are moving on their own during races.</p>
<p>It's actually resulted in Nintendo's Japanese customer support account on social media now issuing a notice about assist features like auto-acceleration and gyro being enabled. There are a few other features in the options that first-time players might also want to disable. Here's the translated message in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo Support:</strong> "We have received inquiries from customers who play Mario Kart World stating that their karts move on their own during races. This phenomenon may be caused by features such as Steering Assist, Auto Acceleration, and Gyro being enabled. Change the settings for each feature as necessary."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To change these controls, you'll need to enter a game mode (or the free roam mode from the main menu), pause the game, navigate to the "settings" with the 'X' button, and from there you can toggle various features on or off. This includes smart steering, auto-acceleration, tilt controls (which make use of the controller gyro feature) and there is even an "auto-use item" option, which you'll want to make sure is switched off.</p>
<p>While these are always welcome features and make the series a lot more accessible to newcomers and younger audiences, we're sure Mario Kart veterans will want full control of the new Switch 2 exclusive, so it's advisable to toggle everything off.</p>

Invites will be sent out in waves for players who are signed up as Skate Insiders before June 27. After that date, registration will be closed. The new update has dramatically improved lighting, shadows, and visuals for the city of San Vansterdam, as well as more environments, animations, sound effects, graffiti, traffic, and pedestrians.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4516389-skateupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516389" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4516389-skateupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516389"></a><figcaption>A side-by-side look at Skate's previous build and the newly upgraded visuals in the new update.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4516389-skateupdate.jpg"></figure><p>Full Circle has increased the maximum number of players per server to 150, and adjusted the in-game map to show the locations of other players. New missions and challenges are available in the new playtest, as is the Market Mile neighborhood, and progression has been overhauled.</p><p>Full Circle also revamped the tutorial to introduce the city much sooner than it did before. As players level up, their in-game reward boxes will offer better prizes. Players who want to customize their characters' appearances will see several new options for clothing, hair, gestures, and emotes.</p><p>The development team noted that it expects Skate to enter early access at the end of this summer.

            <p>
Just a day after its launch, the Gex Trilogy - which bundles together the cult-classic 90s platformer Gex and its two sequels - has officially been deemed a success. And publisher Limited Run Games is celebrating the occasion by reinstating a conspicuously absent audio feature that should please European series fans no end.
</p>
<p>
The Gex Trilogy, if you're unfamiliar, gathers together developer Crystal Dynamics' original 2D outing (which launched for PS1 back in 1995), plus its two fully polygonal sequels; that's 1998's Gex: Enter the Gecko and 1999's Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko. Limited Run's bundle isn't a remaster as such, but it <em>does</em> include a variety of modern-day niceties, including native widescreen support, save states, and the ability to rewind the action.
</p>
<p>
Throw in a whole bunch of artwork and archival material, and content-wise the Gex Trilogy is probably as close to a definitive release as fans of the ageing mascot platformer could hope for. With one notable exception: it only launched with Dana Gould's portrayal of suave lizard protagonist Gex, as heard in the US release, while the PAL version's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC_-wP92b2Y">very different vocal performances</a> were nowhere to be found. Until now that is.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for making the launch of Gex Trilogy a huge success!," Limited Run wrote in an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3lrr2bt5xyd27">announcement on social media</a>. "It's been in the works for a while and we're finally able to announce that the PAL versions of Gex 2 &amp; Gex 3, featuring the voices of Leslie Philips and Danny John-Jules, respectively, will be added in an update!... We're excited for European Gex fans to relive these games the way they remember and for others to hear them for the first time!"
</p>
<p>
As it happens, anyone that owns the Gex Trilogy on Steam can enjoy Philips and John-Jules' portrayal of Gex right now. Once the newly released update has been installed, players can select the PAL versions of Gex by changing the regional flag on the menu before starting the game. Limited Run notes these European versions are entirely separate builds, and save data is not transferable. Today's update also remaps the default keyboard controls for all three games following complaints at launch, but Limited Run is yet to address other customer concerns, including audio issues and a lack of upscaling or anti-aliasing.
</p>
<p>
As for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch, they'll be getting PAL voices just as soon as the patch "has completed certification".

The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512960174905888548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest, longest set of patch notes yet</a> unfurls to reveal hidden weapon aspects, a new variation of each major boss encounter, new character bond-deepening events, and a veritable waterfall of changes to boons, blessings, and Daedalus Hammer upgrades. But most importantly, there’s new music, "including a hot new single from a certain band.”</p><p><strong>Mild </strong><strong><em>Hades 2</em></strong><strong> spoilers ahead.</strong></p><p>In <em>Hades 2</em>’s second boss fight, you come up against Scylla, a legendary man-eating sea monster, and the Sirens, known in Greek myth for using their enchanting voices to lure sailors to their horrific demises. They are in a band together. The whole encounter is a Supergiant masterclass; Scylla, Jetty, and Roxy are on vocals, guitar, and drums respectively, and when you render one of them temporarily or permanently indisposed, their instrument disappears from the soundtrack. Basically, the fight is a concert where the performers are trying to kill you with the power of music. It rules.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, there were two full band Scylla songs: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7QSavYWEE0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coral Crown</a>,” a hard rock banger about drowning people, and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFEcBIf8z0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I Am Gonna Claw (Out Your Eyes then Drown You to Death)</a>,” a much more personal tune that Scylla begins playing sporadically as a passive-aggressive – or I guess just aggressive-aggressive – response to Melinoe’s repeated victories over her.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Hades II - The Unseen Update Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Gv0eQjJ-gY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Now we’ve got a third: “Rock and a Hard Place,” which serves as the backing track for the new patch’s trailer. It sounds sick and – I’m guessing – triggers when you activate the new “Vow of Rivals” variation of the Scylla fight. The trailer, however, explicitly mentions “new Scylla <em>songs</em>,” plural, so I am expecting/hoping for at least one more secret song, perhaps an anthem even more devastatingly personal than “I Am Gonna Claw (Out Your Eyes then Drown You to Death).”&nbsp;</p><p>In other hyper-specific <em>Hades 2</em> news that only a few of you will care about, but that I will nonetheless put under a microscope because it’s my website: Supergiant finally swapped Narcissus’ placeholder art out for a real portrait. I don’t know how to feel about this. Having a character who talks extensively about the terrible burden that is his own physical beauty enshrouded in a nondescript hood was a great bit, and I’ll miss it. But hey, I suppose this is yet another reason to <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-technical-test-early-access-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play <em>Hades 2</em> the way god(s) intended</a> – in early access – while you still have the chance. After all, nobody waited around for the 1.0 version of the Greek myths of old. The story, both now and then, is in the telling.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-congress-online"><h3>Young Democrats Are Running Very Online Campaigns In 2025</h3></a><p>Kat Abughazaleh's Congressional campaign wants to reach people both locally and online</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/relooted-game-africa-museum-visa-nyamakop-interview"><h3>How Relooted, A Game About Reclaiming African Artifacts From Western Museums, Ended Up Being Shown By A White Guy At Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>"Fucked up to be making a game about reclaiming African artifacts that are in Western countries, and Africans can't even visit those artifacts"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Supergiant Games have released the latest big patch for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> today, The Unseen Update, bringing in a number of changes so big I won't be able to tell you about them all here, but I'll pick out a few good ones. First of all, and perhaps most importantly, Narcissus finally has character art and, oh no, he's hot! I'm not going to embed any pictures of him here just in case you want to witness him in game for yourself, but here's a little <a href="https://x.com/belllmonts/status/1935026960461140303">tweet</a> for those that can't wait. Very much a "why does he have to be obsessed with himself and be attractive enough for that to be understandable" kind of vibe.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Anyway, you can put the spray bottle down, I'll tell you about some gameplay additions. All of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike's</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturnal">Nocturnal</a> Arms now have their own Hidden Aspects for you to unlock, though you'll have to find them yourself. Some new music has been added in too, including a "hot new single from a certain band…" Zero prize for guessing this is likely to be Scylla and the Sirens.
</p>
<p>
Several, optional new events have been added in for when you get close to a number of the game's characters, and there's even some new artwork for certain characters in the salt bath (and some "visual flourishes" have been added to the artwork in general). There's a new Vow of Rivals feature that makes each Guardian (i.e. boss) "more challenging in unique ways; the first Rank affects the first Guardian of both the Underworld and Surface routes; prevail against both to reveal the next Rank, and so on."
</p>
<p>
There's also just a ridiculously long list of additions and tweaks to boons, Daedalus Hammer upgrades, Hexes, enemies, and more, so you're probably going to want to read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512960174905888548">full patch notes</a> if you like to dig that deep.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/hades2-unseen-update/">blog post</a> on their website, Supergiant Games also offered up some development progress. While they didn't have a release date to share, after some follow-up patches to iron out some Unseen Update kinks, the big next steps will be adding in the game's anticipated true ending. There's also plans for achievements and other finishing touches, but the big thing here is that they are gearing up for the 1.0 release at the very least. For now, just uh, drool over Narcissus or something.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/688483/nintendo-switch-2-ban-error-code-mig-flash-cartridge-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner">Cameron Faulkner</a> <span>is an editor covering deals and commerce. He joined in 2018, and served as commerce editor at Polygon until May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Some Switch 2 owners have received the<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fau%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Ferror-codes-2124-4007-2124-4508%2F" rel="sponsored"> error code 2134-4508</a>, which results in their consoles being permanently banned from accessing any of its online services, as spotted by <a href="http://against/"><em>IGN</em></a>. It’s not a ban hammer from sucking at <em>Mario Kart World</em>, thankfully for me, but one that’s targeting consoles that have used a Mig – a microSD card-equipped Switch cartridge that can be filled with copies of games. </p><p>Running games on the Mig requires you to download them from others who have dumped files off of cartridges, or dump the games yourself with something like the <a href="https://www.migflashunited.shop/products/mig-switch-dumper">Mig Dumper</a>, then load them onto a microSD card. Whether you’ve used one to play pirated games, or to play copies of games that you own, Nintendo’s stance on the matter is broad: It considers both to be violations of its user agreements.</p><p>The makers of the Mig cartridge have taken reasonable efforts to distance itself from what a majority of buyers will likely do with it, which is play pirated games. The cartridge’s product page notes that it “serves as a backup and development device solely supporting gaming using personal game backups. [...] To maintain the Mig Flash warranty during online play, it’s essential to utilize self-dumped backups with authentic Certificate, UID, and Card Set ID.”</p><p>Nintendo isn’t bricking the consoles of offenders, at least, not immediately. YouTube creator Scattered Brain posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExgYTA18_vo">video</a> about their banned Switch 2 in which they tried to find a way around the ban. Attempting to visit the eShop wasn’t possible, nor was unlinking an account from the console, since both activities require the internet. They were able to unlink Virtual Game Cards from their Switch 2 from Nintendo’s account management site and load them onto a Switch OLED, suggesting that the ban is limited to the hardware and not the account. However, a factory reset essentially bricked their Switch 2, as it no longer allowed signing into any Nintendo Account. This is something that Nintendo reserves <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/665765/nintendo-privacy-policy-update-switch-2">the right to do</a> per its updated account services user agreement and privacy policy.</p><p>No one, but especially Mig users, should be surprised about this ban. Nintendo has a rich history of aggressively pursuing those who pirate its games, as well as those <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">who build emulators</a> that can run pirated copies of games originally made for its platforms. Considering that the Switch 2 is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">fastest-selling console of all time</a>, Nintendo’s clearly throwing everything it’s got at making sure gamers are playing by its rules. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The news comes via </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/VOCtRanwXrA?si=ppjf30BtefyUO220">an announcement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> today from Xbox president Sarah Bond that the company has entered into a "strategic, multi-year agreement" with hardware and chip manufacturer AMD to "co-engineer" a number of devices, including the "next generation" of Xbox consoles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Her description of those next-generation Xbox consoles heavily implies the company isn't restricting itself to a singular device that sits under the TV—and that future hardware won't restrict players to the Xbox store. "This is all about building you a gaming platform that's always with you, so you can play the games you want across devices anywhere you want, delivering you an Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device" she stated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Breaking away from making Xbox a singular device—and opening it up to other video game stores—would be a major diversion from the conventional product strategy for video game consoles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Earlier in the video, Bond specified that these future devices could be used "in your living room, and in your hands."

			<p>As first reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/">Variety</a>, Warner Bros. has restructured its WB Games branch into four divisions focused on four key franchises: Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and the DC Universe.</p>
<p>The restructuring has promoted three former studio heads to oversee games made for each of these major franchises. Former WB Games Montreal studio head Yves Lachance is now a senior vice president of development for Harry Potter and Game of Thrones projects, while NetherRealm studio head Shaun Himmerick is now a senior vice president of development for Mortal Kombat and DC Universe projects.</p>
<p>Last but not least, former WB Games New York studio head, Steven Flenory, is now the senior vice president of central technology and services, overseeing publishing technology, customer service, quality assurance, and user research.</p>
<p>Every studio under WB Games will now report to Lachance and Himmerick, in accordance with the games they're making and which franchises those games come from. So, the team at Avalanche Software working on a new Hogwarts Legacy game would report to Lachance, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-for-new-dc-video-games/">Rocksteady</a>, who is presumably working on a new game set in the DC Universe, would report to Himmerick.</p>
<p>Lachance, Himmerick, and Flenory will all report to WB's global streaming and games chief executive officer, JB Perrette.</p>
<p>According to Variety's report, this restructuring did not result in any layoffs or executive departures, which is good news on the layoff front.</p>
<p>"<em>Our company is home to some of the biggest franchises in the world, and we are optimizing our team structure to develop long-term franchise roadmaps to delight players and fans of Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat and DC games</em>," said JB Perrette per Variety's report.</p>
<p>"<em>We are very fortunate to have a strong stable of development and technology talent, and Yves, Shaun, and Steven are respected leaders with excellent track records in their areas of expertise. I'm looking forward to working closely with them nd the team as we work to make the best games possible for our key franchises</em>."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Warner Bros confirmed that its WB Games division reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-gaming-financial-reports-disappointing-2024-revenue-continues-to-fall/">"<em>disappointing</em>"</a> revenues, shortly after former WB Games chief executive officer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">David Haddad,</a> left the company following the failure of games like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and MultiVersus.</p>
<p>Warner Bros also shut down veteran studio Monolith Productions, MultiVersus developer Player First Games, and its San Diego Studio, which was meant to develop a mobile game but never had the chance to release anything.</p>
<p>This is also the latest example of the company doubling-down on <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wb-games-to-refocus-business-around-tentpole-franchises-and-top-tier-characters-">previous statements</a> that it would focus its games business on the four aforementioned franchises.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbc-firebreak-review-trouble-in-the-old-house.1221294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-trouble-in-old-house<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy is often known for creating artistic games that are loved across the industry. You don't have to look too hard to find out why many people love games like <em>Control </em>or <em>Alan Wake 2</em>. Funny enough, both games are within a shared universe that's ever-expanding. This time around, Remedy decided to try something entirely different with its newly released multiplayer shooter&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.</p>

<p>Instead of being a third-person game where players are controlling a washed-up writer or a director of a top-secret organization, they play a member of the FBC in first person while trying to survive the onslaught of Hiss that is coming their way. For better or worse, the game often forgets that it can get very dull very fast.</p>

<p>I had a lot of hope when I initially loaded into <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. After all, throughout the years, I've found myself getting more and more invested in the world that Remedy has been creating. To see more of the Old House, which is the main location where <em>Control </em>takes place, seemed like a no-brainer. <em>FBC </em>has a simple concept, too; in short, the Old House has been in lockdown for quite a while now because of the Hiss, and due to this, anyone who can take up arms has in hopes of driving them back.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-5251171-6_16_2025-11_12_23-am.jpg?itok=fx7CkKyZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-5251171-6_16_2025-11_12_23-am.jpg?itok=fFOC_laI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Old House needs some fixes.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, that's where a lot of the main story ends, too. But little tidbits of lore can be found throughout the game if you really look for them. One example can be seen in the game's loading menu, where notes are signed off by Alex, Jesse, and other characters from <em>Control</em>, offering a glimpse into what's happening. On top of that, every so often, the game's announcer will drop clues on what's going on overall.</p>

<p>But getting story beats like this seems like a major disservice to a studio that has prided itself on telling compelling stories. A lot of the core gameplay loops players into doing the same thing more and more until they've done it enough to progress further in the level.</p>

<p>For example, in one of the main stages, I was tasked with destroying a bunch of sticky notes because of how dangerous they were. At first, this task seems easy enough, but it quickly becomes dull when you find yourself shooting yellow pads for what feels like five to ten minutes. Even more so when you realize that's the only objective for one level, and you find yourself doing it all over again once you load into the next level.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-5251171-6_16_2025-11_55_16-am.jpg?itok=87pjv1Y- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-5251171-6_16_2025-11_55_16-am.jpg?itok=5YXNkywQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Getting paper has never been so deadly before.</figcaption></figure><p>The game does try to keep things fresh with the Clearance System, but it ultimately falls flat. The way it works is if it's your first time playing a level, you'll have a Clearance Level 1, it'll and the task will be simple. But the catch is that, oftentimes, the job you're assigned can drag, and once it's completed, you'll unlock Level 2 and 3. To get to the extended parts of the level, you'll need to essentially play through all of Clearance Level 1 and 2, which is always the same extract thing.</p>

<p>Getting to the end of a Clearance Level 3 can be a lot of fun because it's where the full level truly shines. In one of mine, when I got to the end, I found myself fighting a giant sticky note monster the size of a kaiju. Getting to that point can be such a drag, it's easy to drop said level and try a new one altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But it's not all doom and gloom. Because the Corruption System is sometimes enough to keep things interesting, even if you've played the same level three or four times. This effectively works as another difficulty modifier. The level you put it on will often change things drastically.</p>

<p>For example, when using it, it can sometimes buff enemies, make them fly, or even move around key locations, such as the showers and ammo stations, which can cause a bit of anxiety to arise during a fight. So if you're looking to challenge yourself, the Corruption System is definitely worth checking out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-review-trouble-in-the-old-house-google-docs-google-chrome-6_17_2025-11_50_35-am.jpg?itok=FtOnv82t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-review-trouble-in-the-old-house-google-docs-google-chrome-6_17_2025-11_50_35-am.jpg?itok=bOUGayrm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pick how werid you want things to get.</figcaption></figure><p>While playing, you'll have the chance to pick between three main Kits. By all accounts, these serve as classes for players to pick from. The three players can pick from Splash, Jump, and Fix. In short, Splash allows you to spray water at objects and allies via a water hose, which can be useful when you need to clean someone off. Fix gives players a wrench that lets them instantly fix any machine that is broken, and Jump lets them power up key locations on a moment's notice. The thing is, though, FBC: Firebreak does a poor job of explaining the significance of these, and oftentimes it can be easy to forget to use them.</p>



<p>It's a real bummer because a lot of the game follows the same formula. You unlock a level and are tasked with doing a remedial task over and over until you've unlocked a second stage in it. But by that time, it's extremely easy to feel burnt out in the game. It's clear<em> FBC: Firebreak </em>took a lot of inspiration from games like <em>Left 4 Dead</em> or <em>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</em>, but one of the main things that separates those games from <em>FBC </em>is the gunplay.</p>

<p>This is another part of where the game handicaps itself. I found myself bored whenever I was getting swarmed by hordes of enemies. It was because the guns felt dull. Oftentimes, you want them to feel powerful or have some kind of kick to them. However, that wasn't the case with <em>FBC</em>; in fact, many of them felt janky and run-down. Although that may have been by design, it doesn't translate into good gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-5251171-6_16_2025-12_22_19-pm.jpg?itok=BnKkntaH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-5251171-6_16_2025-12_22_19-pm.jpg?itok=9GPW9EFk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;Federal Bureau of Control better pay good.</figcaption></figure><p>To make matters worse, upgrading weapons and perks is a drag. The way the progressive system works is rather odd and feels more like a battle pass system than anything else. After each level, players are awarded in-game points, and they can sometimes gain more by picking up files as they run through levels. Once you've reached the end, you'll be able to spend these points on various things.</p>

<p>But there's a catch. To unlock more of the high-end gear, they'll have to unlock everything leading up to that. This means that if pages two through four have nothing but cosmetics, you'll have to purchase every single one of them before you can get to page five and unlock an upgraded weapon or something new to use in the game. So, it can often feel as if you're stuck with a pointless weapon or perks for quite a while, with no light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-5251171-6_17_2025-12_12_07-pm.jpg?itok=QRdeX2Oh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-5251171-6_17_2025-12_12_07-pm.jpg?itok=GhQgbfiD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>That's a lot of perks to pick from.</figcaption></figure><p>This is especially true when you realize that the same points you use to unlock weapons, upgrades, and gear are the same points that are needed to unlock better perks. I often found myself asking questions like "Do I need to heal faster, or do I need to upgrade my Spray Kit?" Even though this can be a fun way to challenge yourself for each run, it does make things unnecessarily complicated.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-5251171-6_16_2025-11_38_33-am.jpg?itok=6Nqc81Bm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-5251171-6_16_2025-11_38_33-am.jpg?itok=wRJg6vQW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They really are just leaving top secert files out in the open uh.</figcaption></figure><p><em>FBC: Firebreak</em> isn't all that bad, though. If Remedy is good at one thing, it's nailing down aesthetics. Walking through the Old House in first person does give the game a fresh coat of paint that I didn't know it needed until then. And the game isn't afraid to get weird with itself, either. There are still plenty of moments where you'll be confused about what you just shot at or did, and that's all part of the Remedy charm that a lot of folks have come to know and love.</p>

<h2><em>FBC: Firebreak</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>FBC: Firebreak</em> seems like a giant swing and a miss. It's straightforward. Remedy attempted to step out of its comfort zone, but it failed in the process of doing so. The progressive system is dull, the gunplay is boring, and the overall loop isn't enough to keep players coming back for more.</p>

It’s a message that comes with the promise that an update, as well as a new release date, will be delivered this fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear,” Bungie said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion. After much discussion within our Dev team, we’ve made the decision to delay the September 23 release.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Marathon delay follows criticism revolving around a Marathon alpha test held in April. The conversation around Bungie’s new take on the live-service, extraction shooter formula has been heated to say the least, so a delay isn’t too shocking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling — survival under pressure, mystery and lore around every corner, raid-like endgame challenges, and Bungie’s genre-defining FPS combat,” Bungie’s message adds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re using this time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like Marathon is built around. This means deepening the relationship between the developers and the game’s most important voices: our players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hermen Hulst went as far as to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026">address feedback</a> just last week, calling the response from fans “varied.” His comments also included the promise that the Marathon reboot would get a release date set by March 31, 2026, while assuring naysayers that the company had no intention of repeating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-wave-goodbye-to-playstation-flop-concord-as-it-goes-dark-maybe-forever"><u>the mistakes</u></a> seen with last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord"><u>Concord</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While no new Marathon release date has been revealed, it appears as though players can at least expect to get their hands on Bungie’s latest by March 2026. In the meantime, the studio has laid out three major points of feedback it plans to address that should leave a better taste in players’ mouths. These include “upping the survival game,” which means more challenging and engaging AI encounters, more tense and strategic combat, and a more rewarding experience overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie adds that players can expect increased visual fidelity across the Marathon experience along with more story to uncover and a darker tone that falls more in-line with the original Marathon universe. The delay also grants the studio the opportunity to add “more social experiences,” including improvements for solo and duo runs as well as proximity chat.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’ll hear from us again later this Fall when we can share the progress we’ve made, alongside the game’s new release date,” Bungie concluded. “Thank you again for your patience and — much more importantly — your passion.

            <p>
Bungie has announced an indefinite delay for its live-service extraction shooter Marathon, citing the community's "passionate" feedback following its reveal in April and a subsequent playtest.
</p>
<p>
Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">formally unveiled its Marathon reboot</a> in May 2023, but the response wasn't an immediately enthusiastic one, given the decision to ditch the classic Marathon series' single-player focus in favour of PvP - and the reboot has largely remained in the news for all the wrong reasons since then. It's faced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">leadership changes</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">substantial legal challenges</a>, it's seen ongoing reports of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">declining staff morale</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue">accusations of toxicity aimed at Bungie management</a>, it's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">embroiled in a plagiarism scandal</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
April's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">big reveal</a>, then, was a chance for Bungie to shift the narrative to something more positive. But reactions weren't especially kind - some went as far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-concord-developer-hits-back-at-criticism-of-bungies-marathon-reveal">draw comparisons with Sony's ill-fated Concord</a> - and it seems Marathon's alpha playtest last month also generated substantial negative criticism, judging by <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">Bungie's latest blog post</a>.

<p>
"Thank you not only for your passionate feedback around the Marathon reveal and Alpha playtest," the studio wrote, "but also for your patience while we took the time to listen closely and chart our next steps. Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear. We've taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion."
</p>
<p>
As a result, and "after much discussion", Marathon will no longer launch on 23rd September as originally announced, and has instead been indefinitely delayed. "The alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling," Bungie continued. "We're using this [extra] time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like Marathon is built around."
</p>
<p>
As it looks to get Marathon back on track, Bungie will hold more closed testing over the "next few months". These will bring new game updates and features, with the studio's "immediate focus" being on the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Upping the Survival Game</li>
<ul>
<li>More challenging and engaging AI encounters</li>
<li>More rewarding runs, with new types of loot and dynamic events</li>
<li>Making combat more tense and strategic</li>
</ul>
<li>Doubling down on the Marathon Universe</li>
<ul>
<li>Increased visual fidelity</li>
<li>More narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with</li>
<li>A darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy</li>
</ul>
<li>Adding more social experiences</li>
<ul>
<li>A better player experience for solo/duos</li>
<li>Prox chat, so social stories can come to life</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Bungie says it'll provide a progress update, alongside a revised release date, some time this autumn. "Thank you again for your patience and - much more importantly - your passion," it concluded. "Your continued feedback will help us make Marathon the incredible gaming experience we all know it can be."
</p>
<p>
Today's delay announcement follows a wave of live-service project cancellations at Sony, as it continues to reassess the viability of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's ambitious live-service strategy</a>. In 2023, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">pulled the plug on Naughty Dog's multiplayer The Last of Us game</a>, and it opted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">not to revive Concord after its disastrous launch last year</a>. The company has reportedly also cancelled a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">live-service adaptation of Twisted Metal</a> in development at Firesprite, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">live-service Spider-Man at Insomniac</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">live-service God of War at Bluepoint</a>, and an unknown live-service project at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> studio Sony Bend. Despite that, the company recently insisted it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-remains-committed-to-diverse-and-resilient-live-service-games-including-forthcoming-marathon-and-fairgames-despite-high-profile-failures">remains committed to "diverse and resilient" live-service portfolio</a>.

The event, Power Word Resist, will include a variety show and a silent auction. The proceeds of which will go to support two nonprofit organizations dedicated to protecting abuse victims and gender diverse citizens.</p>

<h2>The Power Word Resist Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Power Word Resist is a one-night-only event scheduled to take place at the Indianapolis Repertory Theater on July 30. The event is being held to support RAINN, one of the largest organizations dedicated to protecting victims of sexual violence in North America, and GenderNexus, a group dedicated to safeguarding genderfluid citizens and their loved ones.</p>

The silent auction part of the event is packed with over $1,750 of tabletop gear donated by several major studios.</p>

<p>The studios that contributed to this auction include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/coriolis-great-dark-fully-funded-in-7-minutes-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Coriolis</em></a> publisher Free League Publishing, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/eldritch-automata-cosmic-horror-mecha-ttrpg-blows-up-on-backerkit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Eldritch Automata</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>developers&nbsp;Gehenna Gaming, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modiphius-announces-star-trek-adventures-second-edition-starter-sets-now-available" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Trek Adventures</em></a> developer Modiphius, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gloomhaven-second-edition-delayed-due-to-production-issues" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Gloomhaven</em></a> publisher Cephalofair Games, and Renegade Game Studios.</p>

<p>As the press release states, Power Word Resist isn't just an event, it is a rallying point for the tabletop community, one of solidarity and creative generosity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This show and auction strive to uplift our community as an act of joyful resistance,” notes Sara Lang, one of the event organizers. “We chose these causes to support people both on the local and national level who are being targeted by the current administration.”</p>

<p>“We’re always ready to support critical causes in our community like these, and happy to work with and alongside such great groups to do so this year,” said Ian E. Muller, CEO of Gehenna Gaming, one of the event sponsors. “Charities like RAINN and GenderNexus serve a critical role in both the tabletop community and on local and national levels to help protect, educate, and empower some of our most vulnerable.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're in the Indiana area, or are willing to make a trip, tickets to Power Word Resist are on sale now. There are Premium seats for $45, General seats for $35, and Accessibility seats for $25.&nbsp;</p>

Welp! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> has been delayed. The writing was not only on the wall, but on the floors, the doors, the ceiling, cripes, how did it hit that one spot? A lukewarm (at best) reception mixed with a discovery that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bungie">Bungie</a> had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">wholesale lifted the work of another artist without permission</a> all led to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-a-rough-reception-and-evidence-of-art-theft-in-marathon-morale-is-reportedly-in-free-fall-at-bungie">reported free fall of morale at the studio</a>, so this is honestly the least surprising thing in the world. In any case, let's look at the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">post Bungie made</a> explaining their decision to delay the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear," Bungie wrote. "We've taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion. After much discussion within our Dev team, we’ve made the decision to delay the September 23rd release." Worth noting here that a replacement date hasn't been set, so this seems like quite a big one.
</p>
<p>
Bungie outlined some key areas that they plan to focus on with this delay too. For one, they plan on making it more challenging and making the AI encounters more engaging. They intended to make runs feel more rewarding with "new types of loot and dynamic events," and to make combat "more tense and stratetigc."
</p>
<p>
There are a few interesting lines too. They plan on "doubling down on the Marathon Universe" with "increased visual fidelity", "more narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with," and a "darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy." A lot of the complaints I've seen anecdotally have been about the presentation of the story, which has felt very unclear.
</p>
<p>
Bungie also quite vaguely wrote that they'll add in more social experiences, part of that being a better experience for solo and duos, and the addition of proximity chat, "so social stories can come to life." The solo and duos part will be welcome news to many, as being forced into trios was offputting to a lot of people. I hope that there's something akin to a hub area to hang out in too, Destiny is very much a hang out and vibe kind of game, and it's why people like the series.
</p>
<p>
The post ends with the studio saying that they'll have more to share in the fall/ autumn, including the game's new release date. It's quite clear that Bungie, and presumably Sony/ PlayStation, are afraid of a bomb, something all involved parties will be desperate to avoid. The ghost of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> can still be felt, after all.
</p>
<p>
I don't expect this to be a minor delay. While Bungie didn't go into a huge amount of specifics, they outlined a lot of big changes. I'm not confident that they can all be fixed in less than a year. We'll find out in due time.
