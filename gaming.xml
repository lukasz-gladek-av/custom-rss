<p><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a></em> launched in a <strong>rough state</strong> last year, with performance issues across the board that made it difficult for many to enjoy the latest entry in the series. Following multiple updates, however, <strong>the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-significant-performance-improvements/">game is in a much better state</a></strong>, especially on PC, and runs way more smoothly on a bigger number of system configurations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even so, <strong>the development team is not yet done improving the technical state of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong>, as tomorrow's update will introduce additional <strong>CPU and GPU optimizations</strong> to reduce load and improve the overall experience.</p>



<p>These new optimizations have been confirmed by the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">full update notes</strong> for update 1.041.00.00, which is scheduled to launch on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Wednesday, February 18, 2026, 2:30 a.m. UTC (Tuesday, February 17th, 2026, 6:30 p.m. PT)</strong>. These include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced CPU/GPU processing and made adjustments to lower the load on the game.</li>



<li>Added internal Levels of Detail (LOD) for 3D models, adjusting them to display optimal quality based on the situation to reduce GPU load.</li>



<li> Optimized monster and endemic life spawn-time processing to reduce CPU load.</li>



<li>Added effect caching to decrease CPU load when generating duplicate effects.</li>



<li>Optimized rendering processes to reduce CPU/GPU load.</li>



<li> Performed other minor adjustments to lower the overall load.</li>
</ul>



<p>Besides including these new CPU and GPU optimizations, <strong>the final major <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> update</strong> will introduce <strong>Arch-tempered Arkveld</strong> via a permanent Event Quest, and new <strong>10-star difficulty quests</strong> for Arch-tempered Rey Dau, Arch-tempered Uth Duna, Arch-tempered Nu Udra, and Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad. It will also introduce a <strong>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Special Collaboration side mission</strong>, along with plenty of other new features. You can find all the details on the game's <strong><a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-asia/Ver.1.041.00.00.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website.</a></strong></p>



<p>With the final major update launching this week, the Monster Hunter Wilds development team is likely shifting its full focus to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-large-scale-iceborne-sunbreak-sized-expansion-summer-2026-capcom/">Master Rank expansion confirmed last week</a></strong>. Hopefully, it will introduce interesting <strong>new mechanics</strong> on par with those of <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-ps4-review-experienced-hunters-only/"><strong>Iceborne</strong></a></em> and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/"><strong>Sunbreak</strong></a></em>, besides additional monsters and a higher difficulty tier to their base games.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon Pokopia Countdown: Exact Release Date & Start Times]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-countdown-exact-release-date-start-times/</link>
            <guid>1438006</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2026 is a huge year for the Pokémon franchise, and the first of what could be many new titles arriving in the year ahead is right around the corner with the launch of Pokopia.</p>



<p>First revealed last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> certainly captured our attention during a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/" id="176556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview with the game</a>, and thrusts players into a world where humans have mysteriously vanished, leaving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> to fend for themselves.</p>



<p>If you can’t wait for the release of Pokopia, Insider Gaming has all the details on the release date for Pokopia and exactly when you can get your hands on the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-pokemon-pokopia-release">When Does Pokémon Pokopia Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New faces. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon Pokopia</strong> <strong>has an official release date of March 5, 2026, and the countdown to the release of the Pokémon</strong> <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/life-simulation/" id="2994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-sim</a> game is rapidly ticking toward completion.</strong></p>



<p>Pokopia gives fans a new way to explore the world of Pokémon and interact with their favourite characters, in a style that is similar to the Animal Crossing franchise and the Xbox 360 classic Viva Piñata.</p>



<p>The March 5 release has been set in stone since November, and further details about the game are expected to be shared in a Pokémon Presents showcase on February 27. However, a showcase on Pokémon Day is yet to be officially confirmed.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-pokemon-pokopia-start-times">What Are The Pokémon Pokopia Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia’s official release time is at 12 AM local time, but due to time zone differences, you may be able to play significantly earlier than that release.</strong></p>



<p>Pokopia has a staggered release time, which theoretically means those in Oceania will be the first to play, but Nintendo Switch 2 settings can be tweaked to play when the doors open. However, it is a more complicated process than with Xbox Series X|S, for example.</p>



<p>The start times for Pokémon Pokopia are listed in the table below, along with the corresponding start time in Australia and its equivalents in major time zones worldwide. </p>



<p>If Pokopia isn’t accessible on the dot at these times, it shouldn’t be too much later, so keep an eye on social media for details.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Pokopia Start Time</th><th data-align="center">Australia Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">5 AM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">7 AM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwhich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">1 PM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

"Call of Duty: Mobile is available to download through Google Play and Apple’s App Store. Additionally, Call of Duty: Warzone is available on PC and console and is also free to play."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warzone Mobile launched in March 2024 on iOS and Android as a Warzone-specific Call of Duty mobile experience that offered battle royale for up to 120 players, with cross-progression to the PC and console versions of Warzone, Modern Warfare 2 and 3, and, later in the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6"><u>Black Ops 6</u></a>. It struggled right out of the gate, though, and failed to make a mark with "mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences," leading to Activision's decision to cull it just a little over a year later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-review"><u>Call of Duty Warzone Mobile review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile includes all the best elements of Warzone, while speeding up and streamlining matches and using cross-progression to make this a meaningful extension of the traditional experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

This month brings the addition of a manual jump option, alongside two other fan-requested changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the 1.1.8 update going live today, February 17, Ubisoft will add a manual jump option to the game (if you've toggled on your Advanced Parkour setting), which returns from previous titles in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two other small additions are also set to become available: a detailed stat page so you can analyze your build in granular detail, and some visual improvements to when you make a critical hit. All of these changes had been requested by fans, so are likely to be positively received. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, this is a pretty small set of additions that look like the game's only major update across the first three months of this year. Update 1.1.7 launched back in December, capping off a first nine months of post-release additions that had arrived pretty much every month. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's update to Assassin's Creed Shadows is the first notable addition to the game of 2026, and according to a Winter Roadmap released by Ubisoft looks to be the only one coming ahead of the game's March 20 anniversary, which the company will celebrate with a livestream and giveaways. Here's hoping we hear more of what's coming to the game in its second year then. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only other item of note before then is the Switch 2 launch of the game's Claws of Awaji expansion on March 10. The add-on caps off the game's main narrative and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">now looks to be the only major expansion the game will get</a>. It's hard not to compare the level of support for Shadows with that for the series' previous game Valhalla, which received three major expansions, an Odyssey crossover DLC, an epilogue DLC and several major new modes, and feel like Shadows has been underserved in comparison.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/17/assassins-creed-shadows-winter-2026-roadmap-900x-1771321968443.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Assassin's Creed Shadows' Winter Roadmap.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyper-scape">Hyper Scape</a> feels like something that happened ages ago, but Ubisoft's failed battle royale game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-beleaguered-battle-royale-game-hyper-scape-is-shutting-down-in-april">was shut down in April 2022</a> after halting its content updates a year before that. The game itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-scape-review-a-battle-royale-as-smart-as-it-is-generic">wasn't anything special</a>, yet no small amount of FPS veterans praised its core traversal and movement mechanics. This is why a passionate fan is attempting to bring it back from the live-service graveyard.</p>
<p>On 16th February, <a href="https://x.com/fiirce">Fiirce</a> on X/Twitter revealed Hyper Scape working offline (with bots that serve as target practice) perfectly fine. That alone is an achievement, as the game's core functionality was tied to Ubisoft's server infrastructure, which was shut down back in 2022. The user underlines this is a very early effort running on a private server, with largely limited alpha access that must be requested and primarily targets players with "reverse engineering experience" that want to help out with the project. You can see the game running below:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hyperscape Revival.<br>Game feels exactly as I left it (perfect).<br>Singleplayer works for now, will be awhile before anything multiplayer works (could be months or even years). Early alpha/private for now.<br>Reach out to me if you have reverse engineering experience and want to help. <a href="https://t.co/EnzhADUTfW">pic.twitter.com/EnzhADUTfW</a></p>— Fiirce (@fiirce) <a href="https://twitter.com/fiirce/status/2023452799439434111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Fiirce isn't promising a working release of Hyper Scape anytime soon, as figuring out how to make <em>at least </em>the basic online features work could take "months or even years." That said, it has been getting a lot of traction over at X/Twitter since the gameplay clip was posted, which could summon the required expertise quickly and get a proper reverse-engineering effort going soon.</p>
<p>In any case, there's also the question of whether Ubisoft will step in and shut down the project as many publishers do when fans take over dead IPs to work on non-profit new games or revivals. Nobody's expecting the powers that be to ever revisit Hyper Scape, so this shouldn't bother them, but you never know if another publisher could swoop in and pick up the rights to do <em>something</em>. Remember <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/paragon-the-overprime">Paragon: The Overprime</a>?</p><p>This fan-led revival project joins the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-can-run-on-private-servers-youtube-video-reveals">the experiments some people are doing on Anthem</a> shortly after its death. Live-service games are hard to maintain and make really sustainable, but when these endeavours become so common, you have to wonder if the failed IPs that litter the games industry should be made public instead of thrown into vaults.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>There are two things I love more than anything else in this world: football and video games. <a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit/">Sadly, I do not love football video games as much as I used to</a>, but that does not mean that I don't get to enjoy, and even occasionally get excited about, the two things coming together regardless.</p><p>See, my love of football (and of some overlapping stuff like fashion and design) has meant that over the years <a href="https://aftermath.site/japan-jfa-football-shirt-kit-fake-replica/">I've become a collector and just general appreciator of football shirts. For <em>my </em>teams, sure, but also just for any shirt that is cool, interesting or otherwise noteworthy</a>.</p><p>Which means that I've got a very soft spot for football shirts that also feature video games, and that usually means gaming companies appearing as as a sponsor on the front of the kit. A niche topic if ever there was one, but you'd be surprised how popular it is within many people's wheelhouses, coming up constantly in features and roundups on sports sites,<a href="https://www.classicfootballshirts.co.uk/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=CPC&amp;utm_campaign=Search&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD_pJXrISEEeVNVk8GLcxCP4RXcCs&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwzrzABhD8ARIsANlSWNO_tWNuQZLGqwgog1QGZh8xJgb5yE_aJt61v-P_82HKj6IJMqbGywcaAvXhEALw_wcB"> online stores</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jaytomlinsfc/video/7470502102163361046?ref=aftermath.site">social media</a> and, uh,<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-long-strange-history-of-video-games-sponsoring-foo-5825815?ref=aftermath.site"> major video game websites</a>. Turns out loads of people who are into football shirts are also into video games!</p><p>The thing is, all those lists--and I include my own earlier effort here--end up being superficial at best, usually just covering a handful of shirts most fans are already aware of. That's boring, so I felt like settling in and making a more comprehensive roundup, covering as many leagues, teams and decades as I could find.</p><p>I'm not saying this is every shirt <em>ever made</em> that features a video game sponsorship, but...it's a lot.</p><p><strong>UPDATE February 13, 2026</strong>: <em>This post has been updated with some 2026 shirts.</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://footballshirtcollective.com/blogs/collectors-club/how-to-spot-a-fake-1998-fiorentina-shirt?srsltid=AfmBOoreo0VC4T6xzUOI2n8dkmmZph8H9Wpw750c3wmmXUsTB8avVEDd&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><span>Football Shirt Collective</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="fiorentina"><strong>Fiorentina</strong></h3><p>If you asked a casual observer what their favourite video game sponsorship is, or even just the one they thought was the most famous, Fiorentina's mid-90s Nintendo deal is normally the response. It's iconic, not just because it's Nintendo, but because the sponsor matches the club's colour scheme, and the team at the time could boast legends like Gabriel Batistuta.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://www.memorabilia.expert/shop/a-diego-maradona-game-used-10-sevilla-fc-home-shirt-19921993-spanish-league/?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Memorabilia</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="sevilla"><strong>Sevilla</strong></h3><p>Again, it's Nintendo, and again, it matches the club's colours. Plus Diego Maradona wore it during his one-season spell at the Spanish side before his<a href="https://footballwhispers.com/blog/unforgettable-world-cup-moments-diego-maradonas-failed-drugs-test-in-1994/?ref=aftermath.site"> ill-fated 1994 World Cup campaign</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://www.oldfootballshirts.com/en/teams/a/anorthosis/old-anorthosis-football-shirt-s91787.html?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Old Football Kits</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="anorthosis"><strong>Anorthosis</strong></h3><p>Hello, what's this? Well, this is an even earlier Nintendo sponsorship. In 1992 the company sponsored Cypriot club Anorthosis,<a href="https://www.oldfootballshirts.com/en/teams/a/anorthosis/old-anorthosis-football-shirt-s91787.html?ref=aftermath.site"> who wore the above shirt in a two-legged tie against Juventus in the UEFA Cup</a>, which saw them lose 10-1 on aggregate. Ah well, at least the kit was great.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Kyoto Sanga FC</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="kyoto-sanga"><strong>Kyoto Sanga</strong></h3><p>I've written extensively about this club and its ties with Nintendo, which run so deep (and feature everything from <em>Mario Sunshine</em> to <em>Splatoon</em>) I can't possibly condense them into a single paragraph.<a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/the-story-of-kyoto-sanga-nintendos-favourite-football-team/?ref=aftermath.site"> So go read this instead</a>.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>UPDATE, February 2026</strong>: <em>Aww, Kyoto Sanga's 2026 shirt has added some Pikmin to the Nintendo logo on the back!</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=5835541976474021&amp;set=pcb.5835542096474009"><span>Classic Football Shirts</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="montpellier"><strong>Montpellier</strong></h3><p>We're going to see a few PlayStation shirts in this roundup, but this Montpellier kit, for the original console, remains one of the nicest. Another French league club, Monaco,<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2877566/Jose-Mourinho-claims-Sir-Bobby-Robson-came-inch-signing-Thierry-Henry.html?ref=aftermath.site"> also had a PlayStation 1 sponsorship around the same time</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://www.threads.net/@classicfootballshirts/post/DFQUBVsMkYC/media?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Classic Football Shirts</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="auxerre"><strong>Auxerre</strong></h3><p>There may have been others, but when it comes to French clubs and PlayStation sponsorship Auxerre is easily the most famous. The club's PlayStation contract spanned multiple consoles, from the PS1 through to the PS2, and this wetsuit-like away kit is probably my favourite.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://louloufootballshirt.com/produit/maillot-aj-auxerre-vintage/?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Lou Lou</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="auxerre-1"><strong>Auxerre</strong></h3><p>An epilogue! Auxerre and PlayStation went so hand-in-hand that in 2005-06 their Uhlsport kits went as far as moving the manufacturer's logo under the neck to accommodate a <em>second </em>PlayStation branding on the same shirt, this time for the PSP.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Seattle Sounders</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="seattle-sounders"><strong>Seattle Sounders</strong></h3><p>Few video game sponsorships have been as comprehensive as that between Microsoft and the Seattle Sounders, a club that wasn't just from the same city as the Xbox, but even shared the same volt green colour palette. Their deal, spanning several years, saw Sounders jerseys emblazoned with everything from Xbox to Game Pass to Xbox Live to individual games like <em>Halo </em>and <em>Gears of War</em>. More recently,<a href="https://www.versus.uk.com/articles/puma-and-xbox-link-up-to-kit-out-fresh-ego-fc-for-the-new-season?ref=aftermath.site"> Xbox also sponsored Fresh Ego FC</a>, a group that uses football "to raise awareness surrounding mental health and racism in football by bringing together top talent from sport and music".</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://thevault.co.uk/products/2000-02-arsenal-home-shirt-perfect-xl?ref=aftermath.site"><span>The Vault</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="arsenal"><strong>Arsenal</strong></h3><p>Another classic, and if you didn't rank Fiorentina as the most famous video game sponsorship, you're probably saying this turn-of-the-millennium masterpiece in its place. But Sega's console didn't just grace the front of Henry, Bergkamp and co's shirts; in the same timeframe they also sponsored St Etienne, Deportivo de la Coruña and Sampdoria,<a href="https://www.le7sorelle.it/gb/sampdoria/577-SAMPDORIA-AWAY-JERSEY-ASICS-2000-2001.html?ref=aftermath.site"> whose away shirt replaced Dreamcast with Dreamarena, the console's ill-fated online service</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://footballshirtcollective.com/products/2001-02-arsenal-vintage-nike-away-football-shirt-jersey-l-sega?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Football Shirt Collective</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="arsenal-1"><strong>Arsenal</strong></h3><p>As part of the same deal, not every shirt ended up bearing the Dreamcast logo; some (like this away kit) simply used Sega's branding instead. For a more recent example, in 2023 <a href="https://x.com/londonfalcons/status/1729085141514133779?ref=aftermath.site">Sega sponsored London Falcons FC, an amateur LGBTQ+-friendly side</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://x.com/tottenhamshirts/status/1614629338879561729/photo/1?ref=aftermath.site"><span>TottenhamShirts</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="tottenham-hotspur"><strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong></h3><p>What's this? Arsenal's arch-rivals Tottenham sharing a sponsor? Not quite: in the mid-90s Spurs were sponsored by Holsten, a beer company, so the club's juniors kits had to bear the logo of a company that was a bit more child-friendly. Also, this contract was up before Sega's appearance on Arsenal's kits. This same conundrum was repeated 20 years later, when Crystal Palace, at the time sponsored by an online casino,<a href="https://www.classicfootballshirts.com/2017-18-crystal-palace-home-shirt-910-lboys-cplh17242jr.html?ref=aftermath.site"> got an EA Sports sponsorship for their junior sides</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://www.topvintagefootballshirts.com/product/33126248/1993-94-chelsea-maglia-amiga-umbro-l-top-?lang=en_US&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><span>Top Vintage</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="chelsea"><strong>Chelsea</strong></h3><p>In early 90s Chelsea were sponsored by Commodore, and would wear the logos of both the parent company as well as its Amiga computer. I've chosen Amiga for the photo here because other clubs wore the Commodore branding first, and better....</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://footballshirtcollective.com/products/1984-89-bayern-munich-vintage-adidas-home-ls-football-shirt-m-commodore?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Football Shirt Collective</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="bayern-munich"><strong>Bayern Munich</strong></h3><p>...and one of those clubs was German powerhouses Bayern Munich, whose white Commodore sponsors in the mid-80s looked incredible on those all-red shirts. Bayern also wore an Amiga shirt, <a href="https://www.trikotinsel.de/en/Adidas-FC-Bayern-Munich--jersey-1988-89-Kiss-me-Amiga-home-men-s-S-M-L-XL-XXL-4792-4851.html?ref=aftermath.site">but only for a single match, in 1988 against VfB Stuttgart</a>.</p><p>It should be noted that PSG also had Commodore sponsorship for a while,<a href="https://en.psg.fr/teams/club/content/paris-saint-germain-dip-into-their-short-yet-rich-history-to-relaunch-a-selection-of-their-most-emblematic-shirts-2021-2022?ref=aftermath.site"> resulting in some fantastic colour-matching on the shirts</a>, as did<a href="https://www.oldfootballshirts.com/en/teams/a/auxerre/old-auxerre-football-shirt-s87649.html?ref=aftermath.site"> the already-mentioned Auxerre in the early 90s</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://footballandvintageamsterdam.com/product/manchester-city-home-shirt-1999-2001-in-small/?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Football &amp; Vintage</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="manchester-city"><strong>Manchester City</strong></h3><p>In the late-90s Manchester City struck a deal with British publisher Eidos, the company behind <em>Tomb Raider</em>, the original <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Thief</em>.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>UPDATE, February 2026</strong>: City's fourth shirt for the 2025-26 season doesn't appear to have any video game branding, but it's there, buried in the club badge, which has an NFC tag in the middle of it:</p><blockquote>The NFC chip allows fans to tap their smartphones on the crest to unlock a bespoke digital experience, where supporters can access exclusive content in EA SPORTS FC™ 26 and additional surprises from Manchester City, PUMA and EA SPORTS FC, transforming the shirt into an interactive gateway.</blockquote><p>I pasted that from the press release so I wouldn't have to paraphrase it in my own words, which would have caused me emotional harm. </p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Classic Football Shirts</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="fc-martigues"><strong>FC Martigues</strong></h3><p>FC Martigues, a team in France's second division, were once sponsored not by Ocean, the once-mighty British publisher, but one of Ocean's games in particular: the PC version of <em>Jurassic Park</em>, not to be confused with the SNES version, <em>or </em>the Mega Drive version, as all three were different games. What makes this even more interesting is that for the white away shirt they just...made the <em>Jurassic Park</em> logo bigger and replaced the club's crest with Ocean's logo, something that would be gross even by today's standards.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/camisas_vieira/?ref=aftermath.site" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>camisas_vieira</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="cerezo-osaka"><strong>Cerezo Osaka</strong></h3><p>Japanese side Cerezo Osaka have had a long relationship with hometown heroes Capcom, which in recent years has seen the publisher's logo appear everywhere from training shirts to shorts. Their 90s kits, though, with Capcom on the front and back of the shirt, are obviously the most famous.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://www.oldfootballshirts.com/en/teams/t/tokyo-verdy/old-tokyo-verdy-football-shirt-s73862.html?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Old Football Shirts</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="tokyo-verdy"><strong>Tokyo Verdy</strong></h3><p>Another Japanese club with a famous video game collaboration was Tokyo Verdy in the 90s, who had Konami sponsorships on the sleeves, the front of the kit and sometimes, like above, both at the same time.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Lazio</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="lazio"><strong>Lazio</strong></h3><p>I hate this sponsorship so much. It's so <em>lazy</em>--looking like someone just dragged the game's logo.png onto a shirt and hit "print", without any thought to scale or colours--but also it's Lazio,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1bz5ni9/where_does_lazios_reputation_as_a_club_filled/?ref=aftermath.site"> and fuck Lazio</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Konami</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="corinthians"><strong>Corinthians</strong></h3><p>A decade later than Lazio's deal, Brazilian side Corinthians also did a sponsorship with Konami for <em>PES2019</em>, which included a licensing deal for the game itself (see above). Note that the <em>PES </em>logo is for some reason at the bottom of the shirt, making it only visible if a player's jersey was untucked. Fellow Brazilian side Sao Paolo had a similar <em>PES </em>sponsorship that year, too.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://x.com/JLeagueShirts/status/1677507401799565312/photo/1?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Japan Football Shirts</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="jef-united"><strong>JEF United</strong></h3><p>Back to Japan! JEF United have had a few shirts with Sega sponsorship, some with just the logo, others also featuring Sonic. Not for any game in particular, just because he's Sonic.

It's just so boring. It's a pointless service, and even the sponsorship application itself is cheap, looking more like an iron-on transfer. In case you were wondering if things have improved since, Stevenage are currently sponsored by another video game company...<a href="https://xsolla.prezly.com/stevenage-fc-announces-landmark-partnership-with-xsolla-as-gaming--kit-sponsor?ref=aftermath.site">Xsolla, a games-focused payments and commerce platform</a>.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/paranormasight-the-mermaids-curse</link>
            <guid>1437982</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/paranormasight_the_seven_mysteries_of_honjo">Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo</a> was one of the most delightful surprises for the Switch; a visual novel that broke the fourth wall in unique ways while telling a compelling story laced with horror. The sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/paranormasight_the_mermaids_curse">Paranormasight: The Mermaid’s Curse</a>, is more of the same, and that’s a good thing. If Square Enix wants to keep putting out new Paranormasight cases for the foreseeable future, that’s A-okay with me.</p>
<p>Unlike the first title, The Mermaid’s Curse spends a little more time setting up the story and providing more background behind the mysteries at play. As such, you might find the first couple of hours quite slow by comparison, though the result is a narrative that eventually feels more fleshed out and complete. That said, there’s no denying that you’ll need to persevere through the opening segments to get to the good stuff, and that’s something that simply wasn’t a thing with the original.</p>
<p>Progression is mostly a case of chatting with your companions while observing your surroundings and completing the odd minigame. One of the earlier scenes has you diving to the sea bed in an effort to recover valuable material, and the more you succeed, the more you can increase your ability to swim, extract items, breathe, etc. It’s shallow stuff (pun totally intended), but it’s a nice little detour from the lengthy dialogue sequences.</p>
<p>Otherwise, yes, The Mermaid’s Curse is loaded with text that you’ll need to work your way through fairly slowly if you want to take it all in over the roughly 10-hour runtime. Specifically, the in-game files and character profiles contain hundreds of words' worth of backstory and lore. This isn’t a game to rush through.</p>
<p>In fact, it can be a <em>little</em> frustrating at times, since you’re essentially unable to progress onto the next scene until you’ve exhausted all possible lines of dialogue. This means pursuing the same topics multiple times until every character has had their say. The game does indicate which ones you’ve completed with a handy little tick next to each subject, but it can definitely feel quite drawn out.</p>
<p>If you’re also a fan of the oppressive, grim nature of the original game, The Mermaid’s Curse might also give you a bit of whiplash. Lots of scenes take place in broad daylight, with seemingly no sign of anything weird or supernatural. As I mentioned earlier, a lot of the story involves exploring past events, historical context, and interrogating various characters. You’re certainly not going to be using curses every five minutes to kill an NPC, and overall, it never feels particularly unsettling or scary.</p>
<p>It’s still well worth your time, though, even if it doesn’t match up to the original. As for performance, everything runs perfectly fine on the Switch, with some lovely DS-inspired static images throughout along with excellent, mysterious music. Similarly, I experienced no hitches on the Switch 2, so if that’s your platform of choice, you’ll be fine there.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/paranormasight-the-mermaids-curse]]></content:encoded>

			<div data-nosnippet="">
		
		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>

			<p>While an official confirmation has yet to be made, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em></strong> is very likely going to receive <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-insiders-are-corroborating-new-the-witcher-3-dlc-as-fans-believe-dlc-for-old-games-should-happen-more/"><strong>a new DLC expansion</strong></a> later this year. <span>Reportedly intended to bridge the gap between the third and upcoming fourth entries in the&nbsp;series, this new expansion is said to feature a&nbsp;new region,&nbsp;speculated to be&nbsp;<strong>Zerrikania</strong>.</span></p>



<p>According to a <strong>known Polish insider</strong>, however, people are <em>"looking too far away,"</em> suggesting the new explorable region will be <strong>closer to the regions</strong> we already have in the game, namely <strong>Velen</strong> and the <strong>Northern Kingdoms</strong>.</p>



<p>Commenting on old map design approaches in video games in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/vQ4mx6fpDeE?si=4o6J6Smtw-CK65aB&amp;t=3335"><strong>a livestream</strong></a> earlier this month, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UVograch"><strong>UV o grach</strong></a>, a former Gry-Online journalist with solid connections with the <strong>Polish gaming industry</strong>, made some comments about <strong>reusing assets</strong> and filling in the blanks on a map.</p>



<p>These statements sparked a wave of comments from <span>livestream watchers who started asking for updates on the yet-to-be-announced&nbsp;<em><strong>The Witcher 3</strong></em>&nbsp;</span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">DLC</strong>. While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">UV o grach</strong> did not confirm or deny anything outright, he suggested that people are <strong>looking at the horizon while the answer is right under their nose</strong>, essentially doubling down on an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">earlier tidbit</strong> the former journalist dropped in early December about the new region being an extension of<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> the Velen region</strong>, rather than a brand new one like the rumored <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Zerrikania</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-zerrikanian-dream-truly-dead">Is The Zerrikanian Dream Truly Dead?</h2>



<p>Is this the <em>"You mistake the stars reflected in a pond for the night sky"</em> moment for the <em>The Witcher 3</em> community, like <strong>Vilgefortz</strong> accused <strong>Geralt</strong> in the novels? <strong>Hard to say without an official announcement.</strong> </p>



<p>However, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">creating a new region from scratch</strong> would probably be too much effort for a smaller team working on an expansion launching this long after the base game mostly meant to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">bridge the gap</strong> with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher 4's</em></strong> story, which, as far as we know, will be mainly set in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">Kovir and Poviss</a></strong>. These two <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Northern Kingdoms</strong> on the Continent are even more far removed from <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Zerrikania</strong> than the general areas where the first three entries in the series are set. </p>



<p>As such, it's more sensible both for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">lore</strong> and for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">actual game development</strong> to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">expand what is already included</strong> in the game, rather than coming up with a brand new region which may never be visited again, no matter how unique or exotic it would be.</p>



<p>As this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">new</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher 3</em></strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">DLC</strong> is reportedly <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">launching in May</strong></a>, it will likely not be much longer before we hear more about it, if it is indeed real. Hopefully, it will be an expansion worthy of one of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">best open-world role-playing games</strong> ever made.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is a tough proposition, no matter how experienced you are. Today’s February 17, 2026, Quordle is the #1485 edition, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to have you be four for four.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

            <p>Mewgenics, the cat breeding indie hit from the creators of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> and The End is Nigh, has broken a rather impressive Steam record.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Mewgenics - which sees players using "tactical" breeding to raise a cat army before sending their feline Frankenstein-like creations into the fray - welcomed 115,428 concurrent players on Steam.</p>
<p>This number probably doesn't mean that much to you on its own, though it is of course an impressive figure. However, Mewgenics' latest concurrent player peak actually means it now has the highest concurrent player count of any roguelike on Steam <em>of all time</em>.</p>
<p>The Steam game with the highest concurrent player count before Mewgenics took the crown was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, Supergiant's sequel to the incredibly successful Hades and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">2025 Game of the Year nominee</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see via the image below, Hades 2 has a concurrent player peak of 112,947, which was reached five months ago. This means Mewgenics has welcomed 2,481 more concurrent players than Steam's previous roguelike record holder (look at me doing maths early in the morning).</p><p>So, yes, Mewgenics is really rather popular, something that has taken co-creators Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel by surprise. On its release, it sold 150k copies in six hours, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-a-breakout-hit-on-steam-it-sold-150000-copies-in-six-hours-and-its-already-made-its-development-costs">swiftly making back its development costs</a>. That figure has since increased, and developer Glaiel later revealed Mewgenics had sold half a million units in 36 hours (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tylerglaiel.com/post/3men362utkk2f">in the words of Glaiel</a>, "wtf").</p>

<p>The team has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-dlc-is-coming-but-dont-expect-it-any-time-soon">already confirmed that Mewgenics DLC is planned</a>, though for when we don't yet know. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-console-release-for-steams-cat-breeding-roguelike-hit-mewgenics-is-currently-in-the-works">console version is also on the cards</a>, but again, we don't know when exactly it may materialise.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Styx: Blades of Greed Review]]></title>

            <guid>1437961</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>When it comes to stealth games, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx">Styx</a> has a winning formula. You play as a goblin, a perfect character for sneaking around. Short in stature, he can slink through vents and under tables, he’s got lockpicks, arrows and mines to help out, and then he can vomit poison, create clones and has magic powers on top of that!&nbsp; Then there’s the enemies, ranging from humans and elves through to roaches, all of them a threat to little Styx if he’s caught out. It is a great foundation for a stealth game, and yet the games can’t quite nail the landing, resulting in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> feeling less than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p><iframe title="Styx: Blades of Greed - Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OwliU5XsytQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It picks up after the rather abrupt ending of the previous game, and Styx is now looking for Quartz, a glowing blue crystal that he can absorb to gain more powers. Naturally, he wants to get more of it and, after meeting up with some returning characters from the previous game and stealing a zeppelin, they set off to get some.</p>
<p>The entire opening feels almost like a different game to everything that follows it. It has regular cutscenes whilst you’re still getting everyone together, and by the feels like the set up for a story-led game set across various locations. However, shortly escaping the blockade and getting you that you’re given access to three locations, including the one you just left, and told to find Quartz in each of them. The next actual cutscene is eight whole quartz pieces away, which is hours of gameplay, and that’s just for one mission before it dumps you back to another Quartz hunt across the same maps.</p>


<p>It’s a real shame, because as far as thieving games go, Styx: Blades of Greed is still one my favourites for quite a while. To start with, the locations are huge and many levelled – seriously, the verticality, to use a late 2000s term, is off the scale. More important than all that map, however, is that there are tonnes of holes in walls to find, climbable pathways, rafters to skulk over, just an embarrassment of riches when it comes to infiltrating places really. They’re packed full of enemies, sure, but there’s plenty of routes around them, boxes to hide in, and cracks in their patrols to slip through.</p>
<p>You won’t be earning money to upgrade your tools, or have a shop to replenish your resources. Instead you’ll steal blueprints to upgrade your equipment, level up from completing objectives and looting resources, and after absorbing a certain number of Quartz crystals you’ll get a point to unlock a power. You start with cloning abilities and invisibility, which can be very helpful on their own, but you’ll be able to unlock the ability to possess enemies, or move ultra fast, for example. They’re very useful, but limited by Amber, which they cost to use and must be refilled using potions that can be crafted, found, or pickpocketed. In addition to these are a few standard open world/metroidvania additions including a grappling hook, a glider and claws for climbing certain walls, but by far the coolest is the ability to dash through grids. It doesn’t sound big, but it is exceptionally useful.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a lot of the voice acting isn’t very convincing. Many of the lines don’t match the intensity of the situation they’re in, like there was minimal direction, or the context of the line changed through development but it wasn’t re-recorded. One voice actor in particular doesn’t give a <em>bad</em> performance exactly, but simply doesn’t match the character – an orc with a higher pitched voice that just never sounds right . Styx fares the best, but everyone else is a bit off. The cutscenes have issues as well, specifically that every single time there is a cut all the background and textures stream in, really marring what can be some pretty nicely “shot” cutscenes otherwise. “Can” is the operative word, as there are a couple that don’t really make sense, especially in regards to stealing a zeppelin.</p>
<p>Speaking of not making sense, you steal that zeppelin and are immediately free to return to where you stole it from. It will just float there unmolested by authorities as if it wasn’t a big deal, even though it should have been. There are a few things like this throughout the story that make things feel inconsistent, and one supposed twist that was so obvious enough to me that I will be truly shocked if anyone doesn’t see it coming. The story, despite a pretty promising start, didn’t manage to keep me invested as it doesn’t really explain or show things very well. I know that Styx is supposed to be getting negative effects from the quartz because it tells me, but it barely ever shows outside of some blue colouring his palms. If it’s bad for him why isn’t any of his crew trying to stop him, why is Styx so blase about it? Why not just steal it instead of absorbing it?</p>

<p>Much like with the previous games, I get the feeling that Styx was originally envisaged as a goblin thief, but without a solid story or character arc to wrap around that. Styx has a few characteristics, but they’re shallow; he’s a smart arse, he’s sneaky, he laughs when he pushes people off ledges, and he wants power. That’s it, and I can count them on the fingers of one hand. All of the characters are like that, but with even fewer fingers required. The result is that a functional story that can lead you between things, but doesn’t leave much of an impression. It’s a shame, not just because there’s plenty of potential here, but because the opening gives a different impression and some of the cutscenes could capture your imagination, if the delivery were better. It carries through the quest design as well. So much of it is not just to go find a key, but to basically go find multiple keys. The game wants you to steal things but can’t think of a compelling reason, so here’s five seeds to find and steal that will open this door. It just feels like busywork and padding instead of a thrilling heist.</p>
<p>Then there are the technical issues and bugs. I’ve only experienced frame drops on PS5 after moving quickly on the glider, and this only on a couple of occasions, but there are other issues. There’s some minor platforming awkwardness with ledges that can’t be grabbed or can be, but not how you would expect. Styx also isn’t built for combat, which is good because it’s a bit unresponsive and feels ropey whilst you’re doing it. Again, there are a few crafting resources that could do with being a bit more accessible, as you can go for extended periods without being able to use your toys because you’re just mission one particular, and supposedly common resource (usually iron). There are also areas that are so dark you literally can’t see anything at all, making it practically impossible to find your way through.</p>

			<p><strong>Xbox Game Pass</strong> just <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-high-on-life-2-and-kingdom-come-deliverance-headline-new-xbox-game-pass-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> a few days ago, and now a "rumor" suggests its sequel, <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong>, might join the library shortly. We said "rumor" because the tease <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/2023442179625259508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes from an official source</a>, the X account of Microsoft's subscription service, which brushed up the emails of "<strong>Melissa McGamepass</strong>" for the occasion.</p>



<p>For unfamiliar readers, Melissa McGamepass is <strong>a fictional person created by Xbox marketing</strong> for the specific purpose of <strong>teasing upcoming releases on the subscription service</strong>. The latest email of the "Chief Executive Director Chair of Senior Operations &amp; Grand Liaison of Video Game Communications" says:</p>



<p><em>We've got quite the release slate lined up for Xbox Game Pass so far, this is going to be a huge year! Oh, and speaking of upcoming releases… well, I shouldn't say too much, but if you're getting quite hungry for a fun adventure, all I can say is that something big is about to be <strong>deliverance'd </strong>to Xbox Game Pass…. That's all for now! And as always, please keep this email 100% private! Like super-duper secret. Thank you.</em></p>



<p>Now, it wouldn't make much sense to tease the first game, since that's already been released on the service. Moreover, the Xbox team is teasing "something big", and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <strong>would definitely qualify</strong>.</p>



<p>The game, released around a year ago, won critical and commercial acclaim from critics and fans alike. On Wccftech, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earned a perfect score</a> from reviewer Chris Wray and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successfully won the <strong>Best RPG of 2025 award</strong> from staff and community</a>, beating even <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> in the category. Commercially, the Embracer Group just <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <strong>has already sold more than five million units</strong> across all platforms in its first year on the market. For comparison, the first game had only managed to sell two million units by that point.</p>



<p>This makes it a perfect fit for Xbox Game Pass: most users who wanted to get the game early already paid full price for it, but this way, <strong>it will open up the game to many others who wouldn't have otherwise played it</strong>, and maybe it will get some of them to purchase the available DLCs.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Activision Blizzard has announced that Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, a spin off from the hugely popular battle royale, will be shutting down on 17th April.</p>
<p>This comes following previous changes to the ongoing support for the game, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-pulls-call-of-duty-warzone-from-ios-and-google-play-stores">which included its removal from app stores in May 2025</a>. With no new content added to the game since then, it seems the final death knell for the ill-fated shooter is almost here.</p>
<p>A statement posted <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes">on the Activision Support website reads</a>: "Since then, we have made the final decision to take Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile offline. While we're proud of the accomplishment in bringing Call of Duty: Warzone to mobile in an authentic way, it unfortunately did not meet our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences."</p>
<p>Guest accounts used to play Call of Duty Warzone Mobile will no longer be able to play the game when it shuts down. However, if you used an Activision account, you'll obviously still be able to use that to play Call of Duty Mobile or Call of Duty on PC and consoles. If you've got any unspent CoD points lying around on Call of Duty Warzone Mobile, the FAQ section suggests spending them before the 17th as they'll be unavailable to use after the servers shut down. Some unlockable content in Warzone mobile can be used in other versions of Warzone.</p><p>This game publicly launched shakily when compared to Call of Duty Mobile. According to Pocket Gamer, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-generates-14m-in-first-four-days/">Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile generated $1.4m in its first four days</a>. Call of Duty Mobile made $4.2m in the same amount of time. Add that on top of recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">falling play numbers for Call of Duty in general</a> and you can glimpse at why the servers are being turned off.</p>

<p>The biggest news for us Switch fans is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, which has put up a strong performance in its debut week and finds itself in second — just one place behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a>, which retains its crown.</p>
<p>A couple of third-party releases have also served some decent numbers in week one, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> punching up in sixth (only 10% of sales coming on Switch 2, mind), and the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a> creeping out of the shadows in fourth.</p><div><figure data-videoid="R703wKSF5X4" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytR703wKSF5X4" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed8b0932vwulpm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Elsewhere, it's pretty much business as usual — though <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> has <em>finally</em> dropped from the top 10 — so let's take a look at the full rundown. Here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <p>As feared, the recent uptick in Steam Decks being noted as out of stock is down to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">ongoing memory crisis</a>. RAM prices have been driven through the roof by AI companies gobbling up memory sticks en-masse, with the other downside of that being the tech's very scarce at the moment. Cue companies like Valve stuggling to keep on securing as much as they need to make and sell hardware without interruption.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Steam Deck OLED may be out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages," reads a <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/2023581352977985671">fresh note</a> Valve have added to their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">Deck salespage</a>, right alongside the established mention of the 256GB Steam Deck LCD no longer being in production.</p>
<p>So, you might still be able to grab an OLED on any given day, but don't be surprised for the foreseeable if you're greeted by a notification telling you that none are available where you live right now. I say for the foreseeable because there's no obvious end in sight for the RAM shortage as of writing.</p>
<p>That's the RAM shortage which has recently led Valve to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scratch-that-the-steam-machine-is-delayed-after-all-and-valve-confirm-ram-shortages-will-affect-pricing">delay the Steam Machine</a>, Steam Controller, and Steam Frame's releases from "early 2026" to the more nebulous "in the first half of the year", offering more time to secure components which keep being shovelled into AI infrastructure. AI infrastructure which has a chance of either vastly improving the world in ways us mere mortals can't concieve, or more likely falling on its arse and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2025/11/07/why-sam-altman-wont-be-on-the-hook-for-openais-massive-spending-spree/">blowing a hole in the world economy</a> so big it could mirror 2008's infamously catastropic bubble-bursting.</p><p>In the meantime, questions as to whether you'll be able to get ahold of a Deck when you go to buy one or how much you'll pay for the Machine whenever it arrives remain up in the air. PC-specific hardware's not alone in that uncertainty, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis">Bloomberg</a> reporting the other day that console makers Sony and Nintendo are considering pushing back the PS6 and raising the Switch 2's price respectively, both as a result of RAMnarok.</p>
<p>What wonderful times, eh?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Season 2 Delay Should Remain an Isolated Case, According to Devs]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-delay-should-remain-isolated-case/</link>
            <guid>1437916</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Later today, <strong>Battlefield 6 Season 2</strong> will kick off in earnest on all platforms. The second season of the military first-person shooter's live service was famously <strong>delayed for about a month</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">causing outrage in the game's community</a>.</p>



<p>Now, in an interview <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/battlefield-6-seasons-shouldnt-face-any-more-delays-like-season-2-1675733/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Gamereactor</a>, producer <strong>Phil Girette</strong> has explained why that happened, while also suggesting it won't happen again following changes made internally across the various departments at <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> (which comprises DICE, Ripple Effect Studios, Criterion Games, and Motive Studio).</p>



<p><em>We came out of the launch from Battlefield 6, and we don't have the best of track records for launches, but it went pretty smooth this time around, so we're happy for that one. But that launch also takes a lot of work and time. We saw the content we had planned for Battlefield 6 Season 2 and we wanted just to give that a little bit more time in the oven to polish things and make sure we hit the expectations that players have.</em></p>



<p><em>Obviously, once you plan out seasons, there's a lot of things that come with that like the marketing work behind it, making sure the timings affect not only the game itself but many, many other things. Future seasons as well. Absolutely, we need to make sure those hit as expected and we have taken quite a lot of different steps in different departments to make sure that the players get the seasons immediately once the season is planned to end.</em></p>



<p>That's certainly music for the ears of active players, although they may be more concerned with Battlefield 6 Season 2 itself. Our David <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-hands-on-preview-is-an-emphasis-on-ltms-enough-to-reinvigorate-eas-2025-hit-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played a couple of hours of the new content in advance</a></strong> during a press preview event, and <strong>he wasn't exactly thrilled with what he saw</strong>:</p>



<p><em>The reality is that Season 1 was always going to be a tough act to follow for Season 2. Besides the fact that it seems like we're getting one map fewer than we did before, it's not like Battlefield Studios was going to have something as big as REDSEC ready to try and hit the same highs as Season 1. And even if it did, that only passes the buck to Season 3 as the one that is set up to be more disappointing than the last.</em></p>



<p><em>When I look at the Season 2 roadmap, I can't help but feel it's counterproductive to have your biggest attractions also be LTMs, like you're trying to grab players' attention through FOMO. I can understand not wanting to commit to something that players might not love in the long run by automatically making them permanent, but it also doesn't present a strong pitch for why I should care about what's coming in Battlefield 6 Season 2 right now.</em></p>



<p>If you're looking for the <strong>full overview</strong> of what's going to be in this season, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reveals-season-2-of-battlefield-6-packed-with-new-maps-weapons-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jump to this article</a></strong>.</p>

            <p>Do you remember the .hack series? Are you even old enough to know what it is? Don't worry if your answer is negative, as even RPG veterans admit it wasn't particularly big in the West. Still, it remains one of the most fascinating series out there, albeit a hard one to follow due to its complicated titling and transmedia characteristics.</p>
<p>Now, just in time for studio CyberConnect2's 30th anniversary, a new project has been announced out of nowhere: .hack//Z.E.R.O. marks the return of the franchise, which had been dormant on the games front since 2017's .hack//G.U. Last Recode remaster. You can watch the first trailer below:</p> <figure>

<p>"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco Entertainment</a> has given CyberConnect2 permission to manage the entirety of the project from planning and development to release. It will be a title that is fully self-published by CyberConnect2," <a href="https://www.cc2.co.jp/hackzero/en/">the official website</a> reveals. Yes, <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/19641-cyberconnect2s-30th-anniversary-game-revealed-as-hackzero-action-rpg-for-consoles">it appears Bandai Namco isn't letting go of the IP rights</a> and doesn't want to put money into the project, but thankfully, the entertainment giant has allowed it to happen with the original developers.</p>
<p>Shortly after the reveal, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66142">Famitsu</a> has published an interview with CyberConnect2's CEO Hiroshi "Piros" Matsuyama, who's serving as executive producer on Z.E.R.O. It's unclear right now if the game will follow an episodic format or happen over several entries in the style of the original series and the G.U. trilogy. However, more details were uncovered.</p><p>First, Matsuyama has said Z.E.R.O. isn't connected to previous entries in the franchise, which should help newcomers jump in without previous knowledge of the universe. The World, the online game inside which the bulk of the stories was set, will also return, but they're pushing 10 years into the future with the setting in order to double down on social media as a central part of our lives. Moreover, there will be a special focus on real drama between humans and "multiple layers of society as the main enemies," including an evil corporation (of course).</p>
<p>You'll have to wait for more details and the first in-game footage, but CyberConnect2 has also stated <a href="https://nichegamer.com/hack-z-e-r-o-announced/">they've been trying to get this game done for nearly a decade</a>, so chances are this is being treated as a big new beginning for the franchise rather than a one-and-done spinoff.</p>

			<p>Cyanide's <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx</em> series may not be a household name for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">stealth games</strong>, but it still managed to carve out a niche for itself thanks to its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">solid gameplay</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">personable protagonist</strong>, a rogue goblin called Styx who's never afraid to voice his mind. No one would probably call <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Master of Shadows</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-shards-darkness-review-crafty/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Shards of Darkness</strong></a></em> the most accomplished of games, but, at the same time, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">no one would deny how both games have plenty of heart.</strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">For nine years</strong>, Styx and his begrudging companions, including the former goblin hunter Helledryn and the dark elf Djarak, have been <strong>away</strong> from our screens, and for their return, Cyanide planned <strong>something big</strong>. Since the launch of <em>Shards of Darkness</em>, <strong>video games have changed a lot</strong>, and <strong>a linear stealth experience wouldn't have cut it</strong>. </p>



<p>As such, <em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em> overhauls the series' formula with a more&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/">complex world design</a></strong>,&nbsp;sandbox features, and a more open-ended structure that make the experience feel quite modern. Though still a <strong>little rough around the edges</strong>, the game delivers an <strong>engaging stealth experience</strong> without sacrificing the heart that has always characterized the series.</p>

<p>Following the end of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Shards of Darkness</em>, Styx returns in a new adventure where he is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">hunting for Quartz</strong>, a magical resource that is as powerful as it is dangerous for any who can absorb it. This time around, Styx doesn't have to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">rely solely on his wit and caustic humor</strong>. Alongside Helledryn and Djarak, the rogue goblin <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">assembles a crew</strong> to help him secure the Quartz while staying one step ahead of the Inquisition. Their journey provides a front-row seat to the onset of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Great War</strong> and the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">eventual formation of the Black Hand</strong>, the legendary mercenary group first seen in <em>Of Orcs and Men</em>.</p>



<p>Although <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Styx: Blades of Greed</em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">does not attempt to do anything revolutionary</strong> with its characters and fantasy settings, there's no denying that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Styx remains a compelling protagonist</strong> and the most interesting member of the cast. His trademark <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">caustic humor</strong> is intact, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">his remarks</strong> on anything that happens around him make the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">adventure memorable</strong>. On the other hand, the game provides <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">a slightly deeper look</strong> at the goblin: every time he absorbs a fragment of Quartz, Styx is confronted by a mysterious entity called the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Flux</strong>, which not only plays an important role in the story, but also offers the<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> chance to delve deper into the goblin's personality and motivations</strong>, painting a slightly more rounded picture of the character.</p>

<p>While the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">supporting cast lacks Styx’s magnetic cynicism</strong>, they are fleshed out enough to feel like functional parts of the machine rather than mere set dressing. Generally, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">there really isn't anything so memorable aside from Styx</strong> that would get anyone to delve deeper into this fantasy world's lore, but <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">what is there is interesting enough</strong> to provide a decent enough motivation to push towards the next Quartz.</p>



<h2 id="h-just-a-goblin-in-an-open-world">Just a Goblin in an Open World</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-Gameplay-01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Styx: Blades of Greed's sandbox experience is one of the game's best features</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As mentioned earlier, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">developer Cyanide couldn't go with the same linear sort of stealth experience</strong> featured in the previous entry in the series for the new game. <strong>The stealth genre has greatly evolved</strong> since the days of <em>Shards of Darkness</em>, with an emphasis on open-level design and sandbox mechanics that simply couldn't be ignored in <em>Styx: Blades of Greed.</em></p>



<p>In this regard,<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"> the new entry in the series delivers</strong>, for sure. <strong>Locations</strong> such as The Wall, the lush orc village of Turquoise Dawn, and the Ruins of Akenash, the elven capital, are <strong>much more open than anything the series has featured to date</strong>, with an open-world sandbox flair that gives the adventure a very personable feel.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Even in the Prologue, this feeling is unmistakable. </strong>Reaching The Wall with their zeppelin, Styx and his gang find themselves stranded in a location filled with all sorts of dangers, ranging from gangs of thieves and marauders and the powerful Inquisition, and it will only be with the help of some new allies that they will be able to take it up to the skies again in search of Quartz. Although in this early segment of the game Styx will have to recruit a new dwarven pilot and save a specific individual from the Inquisition <strong>in a set order</strong>, the <strong>openness</strong> of the experience is evident.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-Gameplay-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The pronounced vertical design elevates stealth gameplay considerably</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">These early objectives may be set, but the options are not</strong>: to infiltrate the tavern where the dwarf pilot resides, for example, players can scale the tavern itself to enter the dwarf's room from a window, or infiltrate it from the main entrances, creating all sorts of distractions for the enemies inside, and so on.</span> Right from the onset, the locations' <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">vertical design is remarkable</strong>, providing so many opportunities for stealth and concealament that make the experience <strong>very engaging from the get-go</strong>, even with the limited tools Styx has at his disposal in the first few hours, which will be later <strong>expanded</strong> via the game's progression system with new gadgets and special powers, including the ability to create clones, improved perception to spot enemies hidden by environmental elements and so on.</p>



<p>Once the first Quartz is absorbed and the crew takes to the skies again, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">the training wheels come off</strong>, and it's here that the experience turns into <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a full sandbox stealth game</strong>. With a compass in tow, Styx will have to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">search for multiple Quartz fragments scattered all over locations in any order the player wishes</strong>, with a challenge that can be greater or lower depending on the unlocked upgrades, with only the occasional forced story quest acting as a progression threshold every now and then. These Quartz-hunting missions are also <strong>quite varied</strong> and are never as straightforward as simply reaching a location. Something unexpected always happens, forcing players to always be on their toes and never grow complacent.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-Gameplay-03-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Varied mission design is another of Styx: Blades of Greed's best features</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides featuring a solid vertical design, the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Blades of Greed</em> maps have a marked <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Metroidvania feel</strong> centered on two of Styx's new tools: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the Grappling Hook and the Glider</strong>. Unlocked a few hours into the adventure, both tools can be used to<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">access previously unaccesible locations</strong>, making not only the entire experience deeper with new stealth options, but also make <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">progression more meaningful</strong> in a very tangible way, especially in light how many of core's upgrades to Styx's toolset are maybe unlocked a tad too slowly, often <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">requiring multiple Quartz shards</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Blueprints</strong> to unlock via the game's skill trees.</p>



<p><span>Still, these unlocks are rather<strong>&nbsp;rewarding</strong>, especially the Quartz powers that give Styx some very powerful tools, such as <strong>Mind Control</strong>, moving at <strong>Super Speed</strong>, and unleashing a </span><strong><span>F</span>lux Blast</strong> to get rid of enemies. These, in combination with the <strong>passive abilities</strong> granted by Runes, give a sort of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">build flexibility</strong> in a game that has no loot whatsoever.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-am-what-my-enemies-make-of-me">I Am What My Enemies Make of Me</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-enemies-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Enemy AI is not the best in Styx: Blades of Greed</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Another <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">core element</strong> that is required for a proper stealth experience is a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">solid enemy AI</strong>, but it's here that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Blades of Greed</em> starts to show <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">some cracks</strong>. Although <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enemy variety is overall decent</strong>, with multiple human and non-human enemies, including stronger enemies that cannot be disposed of with a single stealth kill attempt and require more guile to eliminate, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">their AI leaves something to be desired at times.</strong> Their keen hearing forces players to proceed carefully to avoid tripping over chairs and other environmental elements, making noise, and their reasonable, decent sight, especially at long distances, forces a careful approach. However, there are times when the enemy doesn't see Styx even if he is located nearby and not exactly in concealment.</p>



<p>Thankfully, at the very least, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">enemies are relentless when alerted</strong> and will hunt Styx until he manages to get away, so the experience <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remains challenging</strong>, even if the AI sometimes falters. Unfortunately, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">it's </strong>during these frantic escapes that the<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> roughness of the experience</strong> is felt the most: the basic control scheme is a little <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">complicated</strong>, and doesn't feel very natural at the beginning, leading to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">wrong action at the wrong time</strong>; <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">melee combat is terribly basic</strong>, limited to a dodge and dagger attack, and requires locking onto an enemy first, which is an unnatural setup for most third-person action games. In addition, there are too many times when Styx is <strong>stuck mid-jump in geometry elements</strong>, which can lead to some undeserved defeats in certain situations.</p>

<p>Luckily, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">any defeat is not the end of the world</strong>, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Styx: Blades of Greed</em> allows players to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">make quick saves at almost any time</strong>, even with a controller. This is a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">great quality-of-life inclusion</strong> that was essentially required, as the game does often rely on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">trial-and-error</strong>, especially at the beginning, and the experience would have been <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">way too frustrating</strong> without it. Hardcore fans of the series can ignore this feature and even disable it altogether by playing the game at the <strong>highest difficulty level</strong>.</p>



<p>Weighing what the game does well, and what doesn't in gameplay terms, it's clear how <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Blades of Greed</em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">sits comfortably in the same space</strong> as its predecessors. It doesn't revolutionize stealth gameplay in any way, it's a little rough around the edges, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">lacking</strong> some quality-of-life features such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">a detailed map</strong> that would be essential for a sanbox experience like this (a few times too many I had to look around the map to find a fast travel point that would bring me to the airship), has <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">imperfect enemy AI</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">cumbersome controls</strong>, and maybe <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">too much trial-and-error</strong>, but it compensates this with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">great level design</strong>, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a lot of heart</strong>, which is evident in its around <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">20 hours long experience</strong>. The total playtime can vary a lot depending on your stealth skills and how much you explore locations for optional items, and if you engage with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">character-focused side objectives</strong> that provide some light development to Styx's crew.</p>

<p>The convoluted controls, the main character sometimes getting stuck in environmental geometry, and the wider assortment of bugs (including being able to take down enemies by grabbing them through walls), unfortunately, are only the <strong>tip of the proverbial iceberg</strong> regarding <em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em>'s <strong>technical state</strong>. <strong>Given the level of visuals</strong> the game pushes, which are acceptable but far from groundbreaking, <strong>one would expect solid performance</strong>. Unfortunately, <strong>that is not the case.</strong></p>



<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, on PC, the game suffers from the widely known <strong>traversal stuttering issues</strong>, for which nothing the <strong>shader pre-compilation step</strong> can do. They are not terribly frequent, but they happen often enough that it is impossible not to notice them.</p>

<p><strong>General performance does not fare well</strong>, either. On my high-end system (<strong>i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM</strong>)<span>, the game averaged&nbsp;<strong>55 FPS, 27 1% low</strong>, in a benchmark session conducted on The Wall map at&nbsp;<strong>4K resolution with DLSS in Balanced mode, high settings,</strong></span><strong> and no Frame Generation</strong>. Needless to say, the game would be essentially unplayable <strong>without upscaling</strong> on anything but the absolute top-end systems. </p>



<p>Thankfully, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">hitting close to 60 FPS without any frame generation tech</strong> made the gameplay relatively smooth with either DLSS or FRS Frame Generation. As it isn't an intense action title that requires split-second reactions, this is generally more than enough to enjoy it, no matter how technically disappointing this level of performance is. However, since most players don't have a beefy system like mine, I'd suggest you wait for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">more tests on lower-end hardware before committing to a purchase on PC if you</strong> <strong>don't have a top-end machine</strong></p>

						<section>
				<p>Styx: Blades of Greed is the definition of a solid 'AA' game. It struggles under the weight of its own ambition and some Unreal Engine 5 optimization woes, but its charming main character and quality of its sandbox level design make it a game that those looking for an almost pure stealth experience will love.</p>

												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Compelling main character
</li><li>Solid level design with great verticality
</li><li>Meaningful progression systems that give the game a Metroidvania feel
</li><li>Easily accessible Quick Save option</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Clunky controls
</li><li>Inconsistent enemy AI

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legend of Zelda</a> series celebrates its 40th anniversary this year, and it appears First 4 Figures will be joining in on the fun.</p>
<p>In a new announcement this week, the statue maker has given its followers on social media and YouTube a "sneak peek" of a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> - Link statue. If it looks familiar, it's because the standard edition is already available at "GameStop and other major retailers".</p>
<p>This particular statue, which is limited to the First 4 Figures website, is an "exclusive edition" - so expect it to be a little fancier than the rest and possibly have additional features such as LED functionality. The full reveal of the 9" painted PVC statue will take place "soon", and pre-orders are set to open online on <strong>26th February 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>If you sign up to the First 4 Figures newsletter, you'll also get <strong>$10 off</strong> the full price when pre-orders go live. Pricing and other details will be revealed on launch day, so when we hear more, we'll let you know.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Steam Deck Is Still Out Of Stock And Valve Says Get Used To It]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-steam-deck-is-still-out-of-stock-and-valve-says-get-used-to-it-2000669487</link>
            <guid>1437868</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>People started noticing last week that the Steam Deck was <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-becoming-impossible-to-buy-a-steam-deck-sold-out-valve-prices-ram-shortage-2000667790">becoming impossible to buy</a>. Valve declined to comment on the situation at the time but has now updated the PC gaming handheld’s store page to note that, yes, the Steam Deck is currently out of stock and will remain that way from time to time for the foreseeable future due to the AI-fueled memory crisis currently threatening every piece of the economy that relies on computers to run.</p> <p><b>“Note:</b> Steam Deck OLED may be out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages,” reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">new disclaimer</a>. “Steam Deck LCD 256GB is no longer in production, and once sold out will no longer be available.”</p>

 <p>Valve still hasn’t offered any clearer sense of when the $550 Steam Deck OLED will be back in stock or if the price will be going up. The company put the original $400 Steam Deck LCD model on sale last fall until inventory sold out at which point it was discontinued. Arguably the best bang-for-your-buck PC gaming handheld is now just completely unavailable in some regions just two years after the latest version of it launched.</p> <p>It’s the latest victim of the AI arms race in which “hyperscale” companies are investing hundreds of billions in building out data centers in order to supply compute for running models like ChatGPT and Claude Code to churn out everything from meme slop to finished app projects. No one quite knows where it’s all headed outside of promises that one lucky AI company will either create God or pop a 2008-style financial bubble in the process.</p>

 <p>In the meantime, markets that rely on affordable memory, like consumer electronics generally and <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-price-japan-pc-handheld-2000669424">gaming in particular</a>, are getting completely hammered. Sony is reportedly considering delaying the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-delay-memory-price-ai-switch-2-2000669410">PS6 until 2029</a>, the Nintendo is probably going to have to raise the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">price of the Switch 2</a> just a year after it launched, and developers behind new blockbusters are already scrambling to optimize their games for PC so players won’t need to spend an extra $200 upgrading to <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-recommended-pc-specs-ram-prices-2000668982">32GB of RAM</a> in order to play them when they come out.</p>

 <p>And of course all of Valve’s own hardware is currently in purgatory. With a new Steam Deck still a long ways off, the <em>Half-Life</em> company’s focus for 2026 was a new compact gaming PC aimed squarely at living room gamers. Valve was supposed to reveal the price and release date by now but had to push <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">the pre-orders back</a> as it figures out how to source a rapidly dwindling supply of affordable PC components. I’m assured it’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-viral-ai-slop-post-was-made-by-same-guy-from-the-viral-ai-slop-game-2000668276">all for a good cause</a>.</p>
