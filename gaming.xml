But after playing a few hours of the sci-fi FPS on PS5, I’m sold on <em>Concord’s </em>mix of hero-shooter action and tight <em>Call of Duty</em>-like gameplay. The only question is: Will people be willing to spend $40 for a multiplayer-only shooter in the year 2024? </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,196909" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Over the weekend, a bunch of people got to play <em>Concord</em>—PlayStation’s upcoming 5v5 hero shooter—for the first time via a new beta. Usually, multiplayer betas are fun marketing demos to get people even more excited for your big new game a few weeks or months before launch. But for <em>Concord</em>, which arrives in August on PS5 and PC, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-dev-respond-reveal-trailer-backlash-playstation-1851564299&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-dev-respond-reveal-trailer-backlash-playstation-1851564299">the situation feels very different</a></span>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-playstation-5-pc-state-of-play-reaction-reddit-1851516496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-playstation-5-pc-state-of-play-reaction-reddit-1851516496">When Concord was first unveiled in May</a></span>, its trailer was negatively compared to <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>while the confirmation that it was a PVP-only game did little to get people excited. So, the stakes were higher than normal for this first online beta. This is <em>Concord’s </em>first real ( and maybe only) chance to win people over and change the conversation around the FPS before launch. And while I’m not sure everyone will be convinced that <em>Concord </em>is good, I’m happy to say that, yes, it’s a damn fine shooter.<br></p><p><em>Overwatch</em> + <em>Destiny </em>with a sprinkle of <em>Call of Duty</em> is the easiest and laziest way to describe <em>Concord </em>to other people who play games. But it’s accurate. <em>Concord</em>—which is set in a brand-new sci-fi universe filled with aliens, mercenaries, and 5v5 arenas—features a large roster of colorful and distinct characters who all play differently ala <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-reddit-review-competitive-rank-1850896550&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-reddit-review-competitive-rank-1850896550"><em>Overwatch</em></a></span>. It also has slightly floaty (in a good way) movement and lots of wild abilities and powers, just like <em>Destiny</em>. And finally, sprinting, shooting, and map design feel very <em>Call of Duty</em> (also in a good way).</p><h2 id="h12185"><a id=""></a>So many heroes to choose from...</h2><p>In the beta I mostly played two game modes: Team Deathmatch and a mode which was basically <em>Call of Duty</em>’s “Kill Confirmed” where you kill people, pick up their tags, and try not to die or the enemy will grab your tags.</p><p>The first thing that struck me about <em>Concord </em>as I played these two modes was just how nice it felt to move around and shoot other players. <em>Concord’s </em>action is extremely snappy and smooth, so I always felt in control no matter who I was playing or what I was doing. It made hopping over obstacles to get a better angle or enemies or running away to fight another day a lot of fun.</p><p>The next thing I fell in love with about <em>Concord </em>was how all of its various characters or Freegunners felt different. I don’t really remember their names—during combat, I’d shout out nicknames like “Monkey Man” and “Spy Robot” to my brother—but they all provided a unique experience. If I wanted to be a slow, big, hard-to-kill tank I could choose the giant yellow robot with a vacuum canon that sucks up bullets. If I wanted to be a fast and nimble damage dealer I could pick the alien-elf lady with her SMG and zip around the map like a maniac. </p><p>Sure, plenty of hero shooters offer their own stable of characters with unique skills and roles, but here it feels like <em>Concord</em> wants its Freegunners be more distinct to the point that I assume some people will call the game unbalanced or unfair. (“Why can that character mantle and run around but I can’t?”) The thing is, this ended up making the game a lot more fun as it forced teammates to work together and Concord’s smartly designed UI and gameplay meant that I was constantly doing cool shit with randos—like trapping enemy players behind a magic wall while someone wiped them out with a grenade.<br></p><p> My personal favorite was Daw, a medic with an assault rifle, unlimited healing pads, and a powerful bubble shield. During matches, I’d often cover an area with health pads—which stick around when you die—turning a spot in the map into “Heal City.” However, Daw can be countered, like all the characters in <em>Concord</em>, by shooting the healing pads and prioritizing the medic gunner in fights. </p><p>One thing that did feel off in <em>Concord </em>was some of the maps. They were a bit too big or empty for the 5v5 fights that make up the sci-fi shooter’s foundation. I’m not sure if this can be fixed before launch or if players will get better at traversing the maps over time and make them feel less sparse, but for now, it feels like each map I played could have lost a few of its hallways and rooms and been better off for it. </p><p>Now, with all those positive words out of the way (and one complaint about maps) it’s time to talk about the elephant in the spaceship: <em>Concord</em>’s $40 price tag. </p><h2 id="h12186"><a id=""></a><em>Concord</em> is a hard sell in 2024</h2><p>As good as <em>Concord </em>is, I’m not sure this kind of game can work in 2024. There are so many good free-to-play PVP games out there right now that aren’t exclusive to PS5 and PC. Why would someone spend $40 to play a new one? I’m not sure. </p><p>Even worse, <em>Concord </em>doesn’t include—at least not at launch—any kind of PvE horde mode or co-op campaign. It’s unlikely to ship with a map maker or <em>Fortnite</em>-like creative mode, either. It just offers a 5V5 PVP shooter experience and...that’s it. I’m just not sure how many people are going to pay a premium for that when they can get similar experiences in other games for free.</p><p>Sure, those other games contain <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-8-orisa-mythic-skin-1851055727&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-8-orisa-mythic-skin-1851055727">tons of microtransactions</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-battle-pass-shop-skins-rewards-coins-1849673687&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-battle-pass-shop-skins-rewards-coins-1849673687">often lock new</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-prereview-roundup-free-hero-shooter-grind-1849601813&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-prereview-roundup-free-hero-shooter-grind-1849601813">characters behind grinds</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/concords-monetised-content-will-be-exclusively-cosmetic-firewalk-says/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/concords-monetised-content-will-be-exclusively-cosmetic-firewalk-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">something <em>Concord’s </em>devs promise won’t be the case</a></span> in the upcoming sci-fi shooter. All new maps, game modes, and characters will be included for free in future updates. That’s great! But I worry <em>Concord</em> won’t get many future updates if it doesn’t develop a large playerbase. </p><p>And while I get that Sony is trying to pull off another<em> Helldivers 2</em> with Concord—charging a premium and not cramming in annoying in-app purchases—I’m not convinced it will work as well this time around. Hopefully, I’m wrong. Because if I am, then <em>Concord </em>will live on for many years and I’ll get to keep playing it and having a great time. If not well, at least we had some fun in the beta. </p><p><em>Concord </em>launches on PS5 and PC on August 23. Players can check out its second beta weekend, which is open to all, and starts on July 19 and ends on July 22. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
As Fallout 4's massive Fallout: London mod nears its release, distributor GOG has moved to clear up some compatibility questions. The company has confirmed Fallout: London will work with versions of Fallout 4 bought on GOG and Steam, but not those purchased on the Epic Games Store, as the latter doesn't currently support a key feature needed to get it running.
</p>
<p>
If you're not up to date on its progress, Fallout: London - which, as its name suggests, enables players to quest around a post-apocalyptic open-world version of the UK's capital - has hit a few snags on the road to its release. Specifically, developer Team Folon has run into issues getting it to work with Fallout 4's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-free-next-gen-update-finally-arrives-this-month">recently released next-gen update</a>.
</p>
<p>
Team Folon made the decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-delays-the-release-of-dlc-sized-fan-mod-fallout-london">delay Fallout: London</a> back in April, anticipating the mod might run into "complications" when Bethesda's next-gen update arrived - and the decision proved wise. Last week, after some testing, the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-need-to-downgrade-fallout-4s-next-gen-version-to-play-that-massive-fallout-london-mod">confirmed</a> Fallout 4's next-gen update simply "isn't stable enough" to run Fallout: London right now, and that the mod would be shipping with a downgrader to revert Fallout 4 to an older version.

<p>
We already knew Fallout: London's downgrader would work with the GOG version of Fallout 4, given GOG is distributing the mod (its massive size meant it was too large to host on Nexus Mods), but questions remained about versions of the game purchased on other PC stores - which GOG has now addressed.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-gog-confirms-no-epic-store-at-launch">statement provided to VG247</a>, a spokesperson reiterated Fallout: London will work with the GOG version of Fallout 4 and also confirmed it'll be compatible with the Steam release - via a manual downgrade or using a downgrading tool that's current "in progress". However, Epic-distributed copies of Fallout 4 won't work with Fallout: London, given the Epic Store doesn't support the crucial ability to rollback to earlier versions of games.
</p>
<p>
There is, however, some hope Epic owners will be able to get involved eventually. Team Folon has already confirmed it's planning to update Fallout: London to work with Fallout 4's next-gen patch just as soon as Bethesda has got it in a more stable shape.
</p>
<p>
As for when Steam and GOG players can play Fallout: London, that's still TBC. Team Folon recently said "the end is in sight", but that the mod would first need to pass GOG's quality-assurance checks. "Once they've completed the process of double-checking that Fallout: London and its installer work on all supported machines," it wrote, "we should be good to go."

That includes classics like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dear-esther-the-kotaku-review-5884520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dear-esther-the-kotaku-review-5884520"><em>Dear Esther</em></a></span>, and even this year’s stunning <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>1000xRESIST</em></a></span>. And don’t worry, if your wallet is still hurting from the summer sale; you can still peruse the myriad demos on offer during IGF Celebration Days. </p><p>To help you make sense of all the games you can get on discount, here are nine titles we think you shouldn’t miss.</p></div></div><div><p>This narrative cooking game has a runtime of under two hours, but it packs an emotional punch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Venba</em></a></span> focuses on the story of an immigrant family from India trying to make a life for themselves in Toronto. That includes a father who works a boring office job he hates, a young boy born in Toronto who is ashamed of his culture, and a mother who can’t quite figure out how to fit in and holds on to her past through cooking.</p><p>The mother is the titular <em>Venba</em>, and you spend the game playing a series of cooking minigames that produce delicious-looking traditional Tamil cuisine. It all made my mouth water. Through these interactive sections and dialogue-heavy cutscenes, <em>Venba</em> paints a deeply emotional story about the struggle of an immigrant family, and how food acts as a representation of culture that we can hold on to and pass on to the next generation. Be warned, you’ll probably want to buy some Indian take-out after playing this.</p></div><div><p>I’ll be honest, this is just an excuse to tell you to buy my favorite game of this year so far. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>1000xRESIST</em></a></span> is only slightly discounted, but still worth a buy. </p><p><em>1000xRESIST </em>is a sci-fi narrative adventure with shades of <em>NieR </em>and <em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</em>. More than anything, it’s a story about the Asian diaspora and generational trauma. As a member of the last society on earth, you have the power to dig through your god’s memories—experiences that reveal a complex young girl forced into the role of messiah and god. <em>1000xRESIST</em> feels so confident and stylish in its aesthetic and narrative presentation, creating something unique that you should experience for yourself. I promise it is worth it.</p></div><div><p>One part deck builder and one part visual novel, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340480/The_Cosmic_Wheel_Sisterhood/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340480/The_Cosmic_Wheel_Sisterhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood</em></a></span><em> </em>was one of 2023’s standout indie titles. Its fascinating world is populated with unique characters, like protagonist Fortuna, a fortune-telling witch serving out a thousand-year sentence for predicting the collapse of her own coven. Fortuna summons a demon to help her out of her situation and gains the ability to create her own tarot deck. </p><p>Building cards takes the form of an MS paint-like interface that makes each player’s deck uniquely their own. As former friends and foes visit Fortuna, she reads each person their fortune—something you have some sway over, which adds weight to every decision.</p></div><div><p>If you enjoy a walking sim, then you probably want to give <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/520720/Dear_Esther_Landmark_Edition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/520720/Dear_Esther_Landmark_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dear Esther</em></a></span> a look, considering it’s in many ways responsible for the modern genre. Released in 2012, the game drops you onto a gorgeous but seemingly abandoned island with little in the way of a goal. As you walk around, you uncover bits of information about a small cast of characters you’ll never actually meet. </p><p>The game is a somber and meditative experience, one that ties together its threads into a fuzzy story about the unhappinesses we experience in life. What works so well about <em>Dear Esther</em> is how its narrative becomes less clear the deeper you go, forcing you to make your own conclusions about what is going on. And while the game’s overall vibes might make you worry it could tip over into horror, this really is just a walk… even if you see something mysterious in the distance.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="k3aacllnqzcttcds7p4r" data-recommend-id="image://k3aacllnqzcttcds7p4r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player grabs a turquoise-haired woman's boobs and text reads &quot;THE SWIMMER: Pay more attention to them, please.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player grabs a turquoise-haired woman's boobs and text reads &quot;THE SWIMMER: Pay more attention to them, please.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Love Conquers All Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="k3aacllnqzcttcds7p4r" data-recommend-id="image://k3aacllnqzcttcds7p4r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player grabs a turquoise-haired woman's boobs and text reads &quot;THE SWIMMER: Pay more attention to them, please.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The best part about the erotic visual novel <em>Ladykiller in a Bind</em> is how unabashedly queer and unconventional it is. The protagonist of <em>Ladykiller in a Bind</em> is a woman crossdressing as her twin brother, who then proceeds to seduce the men and women around her into some steamy BDSM scenes.<br></p><p>What makes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/560000/Ladykiller_in_a_Bind/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/560000/Ladykiller_in_a_Bind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ladykiller in a Bind</em></a></span>’s premise work so well is its writing. The game delivers its sexyness, its humor, and its seriousness with a deft hand, resulting in fascinating characters that make the seductions so much more involving. While the game bills itself as an erotic comedy, it’s also a caring and celebratory showcase of unconventional sex and gender, with a high respect for consent. </p></div></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677770/The_Case_of_the_Golden_Idol/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677770/The_Case_of_the_Golden_Idol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em></a></span> is a game all about solving a series of progressively complex murders and other crimes. It starts with what appears to be as simple as a single death, but with tendrils that spread out into a grand conspiracy over decades. Each case is presented in the form of a snapshot of a scene, where you can see all the people at the exact moment of a crime and must, through tough detective work, put together what actually happened. </p><p>This is done through a Mad-Libs-esque book that has you plugging in answers that explain the scene. For example, if you are able to discover the name of a suspicious character by reading a contract they signed, then you could plug that name into a sentence accusing them of being the killer. The experience takes a lot of logical reasoning and deductive work and a notebook is a necessity. You might struggle at times, but finally cracking a case is a feeling that never gets old.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2103680/Mediterranea_Inferno/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2103680/Mediterranea_Inferno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Mediterranea Inferno</em></a></span> is a visual novel with a lot going on. It has a psychedelic art style that is mesmerizing to look at, telling a story about the Covid pandemic, queerness, and figuring out identity. Following three friends who are reuniting for the first time since lockdown started, the game takes place during a dreamlike summer vacation that quickly blurs the lines between memory, imagination, and reality. </p><p><em>Mediterranea Inferno</em> is one of the best pieces of media about how an entire generation of youth lost years of their lives to a global pandemic, and the unique trauma that leaves behind. So often the game’s characters just laze about as if nothing will ever happen, and who can blame them? For so long, their lives have been stuck in limbo.</p></div><div><p>As the name suggests, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677770/The_Case_of_the_Golden_Idol/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677770/The_Case_of_the_Golden_Idol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>A Short Hike</em></a></span>’s objective is to complete a journey to the top of a mountain. Along the way you’ll encounter loveable locals, all with their own little tasks they need help with and stories for you to fall into. Rendered in a low-fi take on Animal Crossing’s cute aesthetic, <em>A Short Hike</em> wraps a touching story about growing up and the realities of life and death into a short, sweet package.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1223500/Umurangi_Generation/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1223500/Umurangi_Generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Umurangi Generation</em></a></span> works as a great companion piece to <em>Mediterranea Inferno</em>, both of which are games about dealing with the Covid pandemic and feelings of being lost. For the cast of <em>Umurangi Generation</em>, the world is quite literally about to end, and every action towards living feels like a last radical form of protest. The game is also about documenting the lead-up to the end of the world, a photography game that tasks you with exploring its pre-apocalyptic world and sneaking into areas to take pictures of every last detail. </p><p>There’s a dissonance to the photography you’re tasked with, as you wonder who you are even documenting things for, but still you’re able to find pockets of joy and love. As well as being a commentary on the mishandling of a global pandemic, <em>Umurangi Generation</em> also seeks to be a piece of decolonialist art. The game takes place in New Zealand, and heavily features Māori culture and language as part of its themes of protest against the remnants of colonial powers that exist today. All of these many pieces of <em>Umurangi Generation</em> are pulled together by stunning art, making the end of the world an eerie delight to get lost in.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week, The Finals received a significant update with patch 3.4. The update was available immediately for those on PlayStation 5 and PC. However, those playing on Xbox were left in the cold as the new patch for The Finals isn’t available to them.</p>



<p>Days later, developer Embark is apologizing for the issues while not having an answer as to when Xbox players will get update 3.4 of The Finals.</p>



<p>“We’re currently working together with Microsoft on the situation that’s blocking the 3.4 release on Xbox,” Oscar from Embark said in the game’s official Discord. </p>



<p>“I currently don’t have an ETA for when we will be able to release, but as soon as I learn anything I will share it will all of you. We’re super sorry for this lenghty delay, and can only ask that you’re patient with us as we work through it.”</p>



<p>Update 3.4 of The Finals <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">includes a number of balancing changes</a> to the game as well as party chat while in the main menu and shorter wait times to get into games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-trailer-reveals-dlc-fighter-takeda-takahashi/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mortal-kombat-1-patch-adds-60fps-option-on-pc-but-not-for-online-matches/">Mortal Kombat 1</a> has been released, and in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqZwGZBx-t8">this trailer</a>, we get our first glimpse at the DLC fighter, Takeda Takahashi. Luckily, players won't have long to wait until the release of this new character.</p>
<p>Those with the Kombat Pack can try out the new DLC fighter from July 23. However, for those who don't own the Kombat Pack, you will have to wait until July 30 for their full availability. Alongside the release of Takeda Takahashi, a brand new Kameo fighter is also available. Ferra is the latest Kameo fighter to join Mortal Kombat 1 and has plenty of supportive combos that can aid you in battle against your foes.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with Takeda Takahashi, he made his first debut in Mortal Kombat X, where you find out that this character was raised as a Yakuza. His cousin Kenshi was also raised in this lifestyle but didn't enjoy it as much as Takeda did. Takeda was chosen to help combat Kenshin and end his torment against his masters.</p>
<p>Takeda Takahashi joins Mortal Kombat 1 as the final character to be released in the Kombat Pack. Additionally, this brand new character alongside Ferra will be available to try out and play during the Evolution Championship Series (EVO), where event attendees can try out these new characters for the first time before they are officially available to all players.</p>
<p>If you have yet to get your hands on the Kombat Pack with the other DLC fighters, such as Ermac, <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-guide-fatalities-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homelander</a>, and Quan Chi, you can still purchase it at any time. This will allow you to get early access to Takeda Takahashi should you purchase it before his full release on July 30.</p>
<p>In the trailer, we see Takeda Takahashi utilize some of his most commonly used weapons in the previous iterations of Mortal Kombat. Additionally, he appears in the Mortal Kombat comics, where he uses other weapons that aren't used in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1 – Official Takeda Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dqZwGZBx-t8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Takeda is seen utilizing a bladed Lasher, leading to brutal attacks against his opponents. He has some great combos out of the gate and can even use an ability where he grapples to the ceiling to then attack his opponent. In addition to the lasher, he has projectiles that he can throw at the opponent, staggering them. When he isn't using his lasher as a weapon, he fights against his opponent with his fists.</p>
<p>Ferra has fantastic frost abilities that help seal the deal in a fight. For example, they are seen putting up a temporary ice wall in the trailer, leaving the opponent cornered and stuck against it.</p>
<p>Are you looking forward to this new Mortal Kombat 1 DLC fighter?</p>

Though he refrains from giving away exactly how the two will differ, Takeuchi does claim that the show is partly an original story, though it does appear as if it’ll mostly adapt the larger points of the established narrative. For those wondering about the authenticity of it all, he states, “The game developers at Sega told me the show is faithful to the games and that my performance was faithful to Kiryu, so that’s enough for me!”</p><p>Speaking of, Takeuchi seems to be taking some liberties with the character of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fathers-day-video-game-dads-daddies-joel-kratos-bowser-1851541054/slides/6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fathers-day-video-game-dads-daddies-joel-kratos-bowser-1851541054/slides/6">Kazuma Kiryu</a></span>. Kiryu has, over the many years, become a beloved and storied character. His life is one of the most vividly realized spans of a character’s being in all of video games. That’s an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/total-recall-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-yakuza-1851289847&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/total-recall-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-yakuza-1851289847">imposing legacy</a></span> to live up to, and while Takeuchi definitely wants to honor it as best he can, he also wants to take this opportunity to steer Kiryu—whom he describes as a”strong, well-built, heroic character” that is “starved for love”—with a different vision.</p><p>“I have great respect for the feelings of the fans, but when I play a character, I have to express them in my own way, so I can’t pay attention to the preconceptions of others…There’s no point in trying to surpass the original game; rather I wanted to show respect to the games while making something new as an artist.”</p><p>Despite that, Takeuchi is fully embodying Kiryu, and that includes doing his own fight scenes, as well as developing his fighting style. Takeuchi seemingly found inspiration from the games and began by honing Kiryu’s approach to combat after his time in prison, where he’s sent for ten years in the first <em>Like a Dragon </em>game. From there, he appears to have worked backwards to make something that’ll presumably look and feel sloppier and less disciplined. He claims, “When the story starts in 1995, Kiryu’s fighting style is still rough and not very effective, because he has not formally learned martial arts and he is just using his instincts.”</p><p>From that point on, he will grow as a fighter, which will be evident when the show jumps forward to 2005. The first <em>Like a Dragon </em>game follows Kiryu during two distinct periods of his life, first in the 90s and then after his release from a decade-long stint in prison in 2005, so it’s only natural that he should come across as a different combatant and person depending on the era. To that extent, Takeuchi will also look and sound different depending on the time certain scenes take place. In the 90s, he mentions playing Kiryu with the “kind of energy you only get on the verge of your twenties,” before then “subtract[ing]” those youthful emotions when we touch base with him in 2005.</p><p>The most tantalizing aspect of the show, though, is how it will portray Kamurocho, the fictional district that the games take place in, which takes influence from Kabukicho, an actual red-light district in Japan. Kamurocho is a deeply realized setting, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-ishin-majima-kiryu-localization-1850263200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-ishin-majima-kiryu-localization-1850263200">filled with both oddballs</a></span> as well as recurring figures in Kiryu’s life that have followed him through the decades. Kamurocho also changes extensively throughout the course of the series, which comes as no surprise considering the games span <em>just about </em>50 years.</p><p>According to Takeuchi, the show, which filmed on sets rather than on-location, a lot of attention seems to have been paid to the place and its people. “Kamurocho in 1995 is a lively, warm, sparkling place filled with energy,” whereas 2005’s version of the district is much moodier and “the atmosphere is colder” to reflect the passing of laws criminalizing Kiryu’s way of life, shifts in attitude and culture, and how he feels “out of step with the people around him.”</p><p>Throughout these changes, <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em>’s director Masaharu Take seems to have captured “the flavor of Kamurocho” by being as detailed as Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios, the developers of the games. Takeuchi says that one of those details was the casting of background actors that really brought the setting to life. “The set was so detailed,” he said, “from each passerby to every corner of its streets, that I felt like I had traveled back in time. It didn’t feel like a set at all. Yes, there is some CG enhancement, but I think it was the people who really brought it to life. You can’t fake that.”</p><p>It seems to me that the people involved in this show <em>get</em> what has made the <em>Like a Dragon </em>series so deeply beloved over the years. It’s always had cinematic qualities that’ll likely translate wonderfully to a TV adaptation, but the games’ deep sense of place, and your ability to reach out and feel it all as Kiryu, has also played a tremendous part in the franchise’s ascent. Moreover, Kiryu is a complicated character in an evolving world, and a show feels like an apt way to adapt that story. Everything that Takeuchi has said leads me to believe that this team knows what it’s doing with this property, and I’m now positively buzzing for this series.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The development of the new James Bond game, Project 007, has IO Interactive in a great place from a work and creativity standpoint.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/after-years-working-on-hitman-project-007-lead-says-working-on-a-james-bond-game-feels-organic-its-so-close-to-our-dna-that-it-just-feels-seamless/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, IO Interactive chief development officer Veronique Lallier said that working on the new James Bond Game feels “organic” from a development standpoint because of the past work on the Hitman franchise.</p>



<p>“It’s going to be a very cool, very awesome project. I’m super excited about it,” Lallier said. </p>



<p>“And I mean, if you look at what we’ve done in the past with Hitman, 007 just feels organic for us because we’ve done, you know, stories about agents doing things.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She continued: “It’s so close to our DNA story that it just feels seamless, seamless integration, you know, and everybody, I mean, everybody’s so excited.”</p>



<p>She couldn’t go into more on what to expect from Project 007. However, she made sure to mention that she’s “really looking forward” to talk more about the game in the future.</p>



<p>Project 007 is a working title of the new game from IO Interactive. The game will feature a “wholly original Bond story” that has players “step into the shoes of the world’s favorite Secret Agent to earn their 00 status in the very first James Bond origin story.”</p>



<p>There is currently no release date or platform information for the game. It was first revealed in 2021 with a short teaser.</p>

                <p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom might be most notable for allowing you to play as Zelda herself, but series mainstay Link will also be playable, according to the game's <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39983/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ESRB listing</a>. Just how prominent of a role he plays, however, remains to be seen.</p><p>The listing reads, "As Link, players use a sword and arrows to defeat enemies; Zelda can use a magic wand to summon creatures (e.g., wind-up knights, pig soldiers, slime) for battle." What exactly the split between Link and Zelda will entail is still unknown. Zelda's ability set will likely be entirely different from Link's. She can also summon household items like tables and chairs and more unusual objects like water blocks.</p>

      </div>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1e3459t/comment/ld5c07h/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Some users on Reddit</a> have speculated, based on the trailer, that you will play as Link in an intro section and then take over as Zelda once he is captured. Other users speculated that you will be able to play as Link in a new game plus mode, a la similar modes in Castlevania.</p><p>The opening moments of the trailer--where Link battles and defeats Ganon before getting trapped in a portal--look like edited-together gameplay. Playing as another character in the opening section is a regular video game trick, used in games like Star Fox Adventures and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Nevertheless, proving this theory correct or finding out if Link does have a more extensive role will have to wait until the game's full release.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preorder-nintendo-switch/1100-6524359/" data-ref-id="1100-6524359">Preorders for Echoes of Wisdom</a> are live. The game releases on September 26, 2024.</p>

My presentation was called “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/dial-up-the-diegetics-musical-sound-effects/898557">Dial Up the Diegetics: Musical Sound Effects</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.” Every year, after I give my lecture at GDC, I include most of the lecture content in an article series (for the benefit of those who couldn’t attend the conference). So with this article, I’m kicking off a six-part series based on my 2024 GDC presentation! In these articles you’ll find all of the discussion from my GDC lecture, supported by many of the videos and illustrations that I used to support the ideas explored in my talk.&nbsp; So let’s get started!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This discussion is going to focus on sound assets, and we tend to split these into two distinct groups. On one side we’ve got composer assets – acoustic instruments, bands and ensembles, orchestras, vocals, tonal and rhythmic samples, synthetic musical sounds, etc. On the other side, we’ve got sound designer assets – environmental ambience from weather and wildlife, incidental sound effects from tools and technology, and all those sounds we make as human beings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s understood that the music isn’t actually there. It’s non-diegetic – it’s detached – outside the world of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But having said that, let’s now ask ourselves – what if we could tie our music more closely to the rest of the game’s soundscape? Yes, our music doesn’t actually exist in the game world, but what if our music incorporated sound design that seemed to come from that environment? Would that offer players more narrative immersion? More emotional connection? Would the music seem more intrinsically attached to the game?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sound design for composers">Sound design for composers</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s now explore what happens when we game composers use the tools of sound design in our music. By integrating sound effects into our tracks, we can give our music a character and flavor that is strongly associated with the diegetics of the game. It helps our music contribute better to overall immersion. Plus, it’s a lot of fun for us as game composers!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the course of these six articles, I’m going to be drawing examples from the music I composed for thirteen of my previous game projects.&nbsp; These include titles from some famous and popular franchises.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ll be considering ways in which different categories of sound design can function best from within the structure of a musical composition:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ll also be considering how each of these categories can make our music feel more evocative. So let’s start with the first item on our list:</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Environmental diegetics">Environmental diegetics</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is the ground floor of sound design – the audio of our surroundings in the game – and these audio assets can be sorted into three varieties.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first two focus on short, discrete sounds such as the spontaneous noises that are generated by an indoor or outdoor location, and the brief sounds that would be triggered by a person or creature while moving through that unique space. The third category covers the general ambience of the area, which typically includes more lengthy audio sources.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sound designers are naturally thinking about all three of these categories, but we game composers can use them too. So let’s start by looking at all those little noises that come from our surroundings – and here’s a good example that will show how useful they can be.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sounds of an underwater world">Sounds of an underwater world</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developed by Sumo Digital, Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a whimsical platformer that lets gamers jump, swing, and fly through the colorful and zany realms of Craftworld. As a member of the music composition team, I was hired to compose the music for Sackboy’s underwater adventures in the Kingdom of Crablantis. My whole job centered on musically evoking the wonder and beauty of subaquatic exploration – which is the reason why I decided to use water sounds in my music. So first I had to consider – what do we hear when we’re underwater? Something like this?</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXBHlvds4_g?si=Lcb-OkYHJ9S63Qsu" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, that didn’t seem right – too busy and chaotic to be a good musical tool. So, what other kinds of water sounds might be useful?</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IYtqb3ffkcU?si=k66ba9ygCzNLtX0Q" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, that’s better. I took a long recording of water dripping, loaded it into Pro Tools and edited all the individual drips into separate WAV files. Then I created a virtual instrument, applied some reverb and delay, and spread the sounds across my keyboard so that I could play them musically, like this:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gL2Ge39_KsI?si=Mcpie38GlvR7bMn3" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That seemed to be working.

<p>CD Projekt Red, a revered development studio in the gaming industry, has captivated fans with its back-to-back RPG blockbusters. Their ability to craft compelling RPGs, whether set in a dystopian future or a medieval past, is unparalleled. </p>



<p>However, since 2020, the studio has been quiet on the game release front, leaving fans eagerly anticipating their next move. The projects currently in development at CD Projekt Red, including the next Cyberpunk game and the Witcher 4, have been the subject of much speculation. The recent discussion about the latter has only heightened the excitement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with The Flow podcast, the CD Projekt Red’s associate game director, Pawel Sasko, spoke about their upcoming project. Sasko clarified to the fans that all the games currently being developed are in the “early stages,” so we shouldn’t expect to hear about them anytime soon. The one that is the “most advanced” out of all the CD Projekt Red games would be Witcher 4. This is not a surprise, as most developers in the studio are currently involved in the upcoming Witcher game.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The next installment in the Witcher series, codenamed Polaris, is set to start active production in 2024. This ambitious project, the first in a brand-new trilogy, promises to introduce many new elements while staying true to the core experience that fans love. </p>



<p>One of the most significant changes is CD Projekt Red<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-polaris-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> confirming that Geralt of Rivia will not be the protagonist of the next game</a>, hinting at a fresh direction for the series is sure to pique fans’ interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the topic of Witcher, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-3-character-creator-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create-your-own</a> Witcher 3 character mod surfaced online recently. Also, the live-action Witcher series has been renewed for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-final-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fifth and final season</a>, with Liam Hemsworth replacing Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ducky-zero-6108-review-versatile-but-not-innovative.927591/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ducky-zero-6108-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The Ducky Zero 6108 is a no-frills mechanical keyboard that’ll get the job done whether you’re playing an intense first-person shooter or typing up a review for the Ducky Zero 6108 mechanical keyboard. It’s a relatively unassuming piece of equipment that’s well-built but offers almost nothing in the way of serious innovation.</p>



<p>I’ve been playing around with the keyboard for a few days now – here’s my full Ducky Zero 6108 review.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-expected-more">I Expected More</h2>



<p>Recently, I picked up a Ducky x Fallout keyboard with silent Cherry MX switches and was blown away by the quality of the device. From the on-point colourisation and theme of the keyboard to the super-soft touch of the switches under the resilient, textured keys, everything about it won me over. The RGB popped, it had a nice weight to it, and the keys were well-spaced to accommodate my giant hands.</p>



<p>However, when I secured this latest keyboard for a Ducky Zero 6108 review, I was left disappointed. It’s a little narrower than the Fallout keyboard, which means that the keys are cramped together with almost no spacing that you’d expect from a full-sized keyboard. It also has less attractive RGB functions, while the Fallout keyboard lights up brightly enough to make an impression.</p>



<p>The layout is mostly the same, with the Ducky Zero 6108 opting for traditional keys as media control inputs rather than sliders or knobs, which is always a negative for me. The only noticeable difference is the relocation of the lock indicators – they’re now above the arrow keys, whereas on the Fallout keyboard, they were above the numpad. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Dragons, I guess</figcaption></figure>







<p>The Ducky Zero 6108 I ordered came in black with a swappable spacebar featuring an image of a dragon – for some reason. It also has a small text flash imprinted on the top of the keyboard that represents the brand. Aside from that, it’s as plain a keyboard as you could ever hope to receive. It’s not particularly heavy, but it still has that issue I’ve found with Ducky keyboards where the legs collapse too quickly under pressure.</p>



<h2 id="h-facts-and-figures">Facts and Figures</h2>



<p>At the heart of this Ducky Zero 6108 review sits the cold, hard facts.</p>



<p>My keyboard came with Cherry MX2A Red switches, and they’re nice – but I do prefer the Silent switches. Even with the Q-bounce pad designed to dampen sound, it’s still not quiet enough for me. Thanks to the hot-swap technology in the board, you’re free to do what you want with the switches, replacing them with 3-pin or 5-pin switches without expending too much effort. </p>



<p>Regardless of the switches you opt for, you’ll be getting the same keycaps – double-shot PBT caps that are synonymous with the Ducky brand. The shining gem in the feature line-up of the Ducky Zero 6108 is the fact that it now has tri-mode connectivity. If you want to use it as a wired keyboard, then go right ahead – but you can also make use of Bluetooth connectivity or a 2.4 GHz, dongle-backed connection.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Those relying on a wireless connection shouldn’t worry too much about the battery failing, as it’s a 2500 mAh unit, which is substantial for many hours of gaming – or work. </p>



<p>In the United Kingdom, the Ducky Zero 6108 retails for around £100, which seems a bit steep, in my opinion. To be honest, there are better options out there for that price point, but if you like the assurable quality that you’ll find in every Ducky keyboard, perhaps it’s worth your money. </p>

<!-- cache hit 15:single/related:00745f29fe880a42986a9b2b2e9888fc --><!-- empty -->
<p>One month after PC emulator UTM was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/apple-rejects-pc-emulators-on-the-ios-app-store/">rejected from the iOS App Store</a>, the developers have <a href="https://x.com/UTMapp/status/1812238024220238180">announced</a> that a new "UTM SE" version is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/utm-se-retro-pc-emulator/id1564628856">now available for free on the App Store</a>. But the app's performance is severely hampered by Apple's restrictions on so-called "just-in-time" (JIT) compilation, limiting the app's suitability for effectively emulating many PC games.
</p><p>Built on <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">the generic command-line emulation layer QEMU</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/UTM">open-source UTM</a> boasts support for "30+ processors," from x86 and PowerPC to RISC-V and ARM64. The App Store listing promises you can "run classic software and old-school games" through both a VGA graphics mode and text-based terminal.</p>
<p>Don't expect a seamless, RetroArch-style path to playing <em>Space Cadet Pinball</em> on your iPhone, though. The UTM developers <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/">link to pre-configured settings downloads</a> for versions of Windows going back to XP, alongside guides for getting those OSes up and running on iOS. But users will need to bring their own legitimate Windows installation ISO and go through the cumbersome process of installing the OS as well as <a href="https://www.spice-space.org/">a version of SPICE tools</a> to help coordinate access through iOS (downloading pre-built, UTM-compatible Linux builds seems more straightforward).</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Slow by design</h2>
<p>Even after that, don't expect high-level performance from this new emulator. That's because UTM SE must abide by App Store restrictions prohibiting&nbsp;apps that "install executable code." As such, the App Store version <a href="https://x.com/UTMapp/status/1812241740172263663">is a "JIT-less" build</a> that uses a Tiny-Code Threaded Interpreter (TCTI) to interpret each original line of code being run rather than fully recompiling it at runtime for smoother performance.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aM_jIDCSMcc?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>A video shows how the lack of JIT recompilation slows down GameCube emulation on DolphiniOS.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The lack of that JIT recompilation means the "SE [in UTM SE] stands for Slow Edition," as moderator CZ <a href="https://discord.com/channels/674683213217792078/674683213653737474/1262230627630055524">pithily put it in the UTM Discord</a>. "This is us telling you gaming on UTM SE is not happening." At least one user who tested running Linux via UTM SE <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2024/07/utm-se-qemu-pc-emulator-apple-app-store">confirmed</a> it is "dog slow" and "a gloopy experience." Those who want full performance out of UTM can still install the regular, non-SE version of the app via sideloading or an alt store.</p>
<p>You may remember that the developers of GameCube/Wii emulator DolphiniOS cited the lack of JIT recompilation as the reason their app <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-a-gamecube-wii-emulator-may-not-be-possible-on-the-ios-app-store/">can't run at a functional frame rate through the iOS App Store</a>. However, similar restrictions haven't stopped <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/a-touchscreen-of-nostalgia-delta-brings-classic-nintendo-consoles-to-ios/">emulators like Delta</a> from running classic gaming consoles up through the Nintendo DS at a playable frame rate, suggesting that UTM SE might be sufficient for older MS-DOS or Windows 95-era titles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/15/takeda-joins-the-mortal-kombat-1-roster-next-week-first-gameplay-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Mortal Kombat 1’s final Year 1 DLC fighter arrives next week, and it’s Takeda Takahashi. The young Shirai Ryu warrior makes only his second appearance in a Mortal Kombat game and looks every bit as capable as his older clanmates, Scorpion and Smoke.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although Takeda was Kenshi’s son in his debut appearance, Mortal Kombat X, the remixed timeline of Mortal Kombt 1 has changed him to Kenshi’s cousin. Like Kenshi, Takeda grew up a Yakuza but was more faithful to the clan than his cousin. As such, the Yakuza tasked Takeda with killing Kenshi, and the two battled, with the latter coming emerging victorious. Takeda was mortally wounded in the battle and rushed to the aid of the Shirai Ryu, where Kenshi protected him from being killed by the Yakuza for failing his mission. This causes Takeda to have a change of heart and join the Shirai Ryu to wage war against Earthrrealm’s criminal underground and, eventually, the evil forces of Outworld.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Takeda still utilizes the Shirai Ryu fighting style, including his signature pair of bladed whips. He also sports shurikens, a barrage of teleporting flame attacks, and an aerial grapple best described as mid-air corkscrew piledriver. Check Takeda out below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dqZwGZBx-t8" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Takeda will be available on July 23, both as a standalone purchase and as a free download for Kombat Pack owners. The same day also sees previously revealed Kameo fighter Ferra become available to buy. Both Takeda and Ferra will be playable for the first time during Evo 2025 this weekend.&nbsp;</p>
