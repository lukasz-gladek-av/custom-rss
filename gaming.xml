<p>Retro game collections are all the rage nowadays and following in the footsteps of classic mascots like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/gex_trilogy">Gex</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Bubsy</a> are now Joe and Mac.</p>
<p>This new package, officially titled <strong>Joe &amp; Mac Retro Collection</strong>, is slightly different as it's a Kickstarter project scheduled to go live on <strong>10th June</strong> (aka next week) and is expected to release later this year digitally on multiple platforms including the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Play as three cavemen fighting dinosaurs in this retro collection of three SNES/Super Famicom titles, coming to Steam/PS5/Xbox/Switch!"</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEHFv10kUS0"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEHFv10kUS0">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>

<p>It will contain the following three 16-bit Super Nintendo releases from Data East:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/joe_and_mac">Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</em> (<em>ジョーとマック 戦え原始人</em>) is a Run &amp; Gun platformer that follows the titular Joe &amp; Mac as they fight through 12 hellish levels using prehistoric (but not just) tools and weapons. While the game was censored when it came out in the West, the Retro Collection also includes the original Japanese version!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/congos_caper">Congo's Caper</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Congo's Caper</em> (<em>戦え原始人2 ルーキーの冒険</em>) is a side-scrolling Action platformer centered around Congo, a half-human, half-monkey boy looking to rescue his girlfriend from a demon through 35 varied levels."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/joe_and_mac_2_lost_in_the_tropics">Joe &amp; Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Joe &amp; Mac: Lost in the Tropics</em> (<em>ジョーアンドマック戦え原始人3主役はやっぱり</em>) adds a light roleplaying aspect to the series. While the goal is still to defeat cavemen and dinosaurs, players can court and wed their Stone Age girlfriend, and even have a child with her!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, this collection is comprised of games released here in the West in the early 90s (1991 - 1995) as well as the "uncensored" Japanese versions.</p>
<p>There'll also be "multiple new features" including quality-of-life improvements like the ability to rewind gameplay, save states, customisable aspect ratios, a CRT filter, local co-op for Joe &amp; Mac 1 and 2, and "cool new visuals and merchandise" to go with this Kickstarter.</p>
<p>This campaign is led by G-Mode, Red Art Games and their "award-winning internal studio" Red Art Studios. If you're curious to revisit this prehistoric franchise there are also multiple options on the Switch, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/snes/joe_and_mac">Nintendo's Switch Online Classics</a> game library.</p>

                <p>The Xbox brand is having an interesting year so far, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-hits-3-million-players-right-away-and-the-majority-of-them-are-on-game-pass-apparently/1100-6531702/" data-ref-id="1100-6531702">hot launch of Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and several Microsoft-published games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-sales-charts-thanks-to-ps5/2900-6605/" data-ref-id="2900-6605">finding success on PlayStation</a>. The future of Xbox is uncertain, but the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/" data-ref-id="1100-6530713">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, scheduled for Sunday, June 8, should give us an idea of what's coming soon from Microsoft's first-party studios and its partners.</p><p>The showcase, which streams a couple days after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-conference-schedule-2025/1100-6531627/" data-ref-id="1100-6531627">this year's Summer Game Fest</a>, will have a Direct presentation devoted to Obsidian Entertainment's upcoming RPG The Outer Worlds 2 immediately following it. Previous Xbox summer showcases in 2023 and 2024 have featured extended looks at Starfield and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, respectively, as closers.</p><h2>How to watch the Xbox Games Showcase and The Outer Worlds 2 Direct</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExsVDr2CU40" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ExsVDr2CU40" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><span>You can stream the Xbox Games Showcase and the following Direct for The Outer Worlds 2 on GameSpot's YouTube, as well as the official Xbox </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox/hub" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/xbox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a><span> pages. Bethesda is also hosting the presentation on its </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/Bethesda" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a><span> and </span><a href="http://twitch.tv/Bethesda" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a><span> channels, as is Obsidian Entertainment on </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/ObsidianEnt" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a><span>.

The Outer Worlds 2 Direct starts immediately after the showcase concludes. Microsoft has not specified the duration of the presentation, but previous Xbox showcases have typically lasted around an hour, followed by a 30- to 45-minute Direct for a featured game.</p><ul><li>10 AM PT</li><li>1 PM ET</li><li>6 PM BST</li><li>3 AM AET (June 9)</li></ul><h2>What to expect</h2><p>Besides The Outer Worlds 2, the Xbox team hasn't explicitly mentioned any other titles that will appear in the showcase. However, the studios under the Microsoft Gaming umbrella have several anticipated titles in development that we are aware of, which we could see this year.</p><p>Previous showcases have given us peeks at Gears of War: E-Day and a Perfect Dark reboot, and this showcase would be a perfect opportunity to reveal launch dates for both. And while the new Fable game from Playground Games was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026/1100-6529698/" data-ref-id="1100-6529698">pushed back to 2026</a>, the showcase could still provide us with some new gameplay footage.</p><p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-hellblade-2-coming-to-ps5-soon/1100-6531706/" data-ref-id="1100-6531706">getting a free update this summer</a>, so it's also possible that studio Ninja Theory will detail when it drops and what's included. The highly acclaimed Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is also getting story DLC this year, titled The Order of Giants, so it would be unsurprising to see a trailer and release date for it at this showcase.</p><p>On the Activision Blizzard side, there still hasn't been an official announcement on what this year's Call of Duty game will be, though it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">rumored to be a new Black Ops game</a> set in the future--a reveal could come at the showcase.</p>

"So, when brainstorming what we could do to make that really fun and exciting, we knew it would be great to go to some of the Sega IP worlds, but we also wanted to go to other IP worlds and really surprise people with that second lap. As we got to thinking about what worlds be fun to explore, we really thought Minecraft and its characters could be very fun."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has a very interesting three-lap formula thats starts with a pretty standard first lap. However, the racer in first place will then get to pick a new world everyone will race through via Travel Rings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The three Lap formula is really good for racers," Iizuka said. "It's really easy to understand, and we wanted to make things new and fresh so you're not just racing around the same place over and over again. And that was where the idea of the Travel Ring formed, which is to bring you somewhere new and unknown in that second lap. That's not all, as we wanted to keep the surprise and the racing really fresh and fun, so we added in some surprises for the third lap too."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We then shifted our conversation to items, and Iizuka shared that he loved that Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is paying homage to Sonic Racing games with the addition of the Rocket Punch item and Team Sonic Racing with Wisp items, but he did admit that his favorite item in this new game is the Monster Truck power-up that "lets you turn your vehicle into a monster truck and just run over everyone in front of you."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a lot more to look forward to in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds when it is released on September 25, 2025, including the return of Sonic Riders' hoverboards, the ability for any character to ride in any vehicle, racing up to 12 players online, and even the most-welcome of features in cross-play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of different platforms, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be released on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. And yes, even though it may arrive a bit after, Switch 2 players will also soon be able to hit the road with the over 23 racers featured in this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-the-first-preview">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds preview</a> and everything else you need to know about <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN Live.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

</blockquote>
<p>YouTube asks Switch 2 users to "stay tuned" for updates, so for now, you're going to have to go without this popular video app on your Switch 2. There are various other video players and apps that also don't work on the Switch 2 right now, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-updates-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-list">as revealed in a recent update</a>. This includes Niconico, ABEMA, Hulu, Crunchyroll and InkyPen.</p>
<p>YouTube originally made its debut on the Switch eShop as a free app in 2018 and was also previously available for the Wii U, 3DS and Wii.</p>

<figure><a title="Princess Peach: Showtime!" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f4e42c306f2f9/princess-peach-showtime.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> in 2023 marked a new era for the character, with the legendary voice actor Charles Martinet officially replaced by Kevin Afghani as Mario. It led to questions at the time about what other voices might be swapped out in the future.</p>
<p>While Peach's voice actor Samatha Kelly returned in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/princess_peach_showtime">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> the following year, it seems she's now been replaced after 18 years. This also includes her role as Toad. According to a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKj0BYwxhgj/">post on her Instagram</a> account, the voice actor found out yesterday after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> had been released.</p><p><figure data-videoid="MZ5pbSbsoJA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZ5pbSbsoJA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MZ5pbSbsoJA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZ5pbSbsoJA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed41ed20mnqyxl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ5pbSbsoJA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Samantha Kelly:</strong> "Thank you for so many years of friendship and joy. I’m sad that it’s over, I truly would have wanted to voice Peach and Toad forever. Nintendo let me know yesterday that they decided to recast these roles. I’m grateful that I got to do these voices for so many years. Peach and Toad are such strong and beautiful characters that I pray they live forever no matter who voices them. So much love #princesspeach #toad"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Kelly was in the role for nearly two decades (and voiced various other Mario characters during this time) her departure has obviously been far less public than Charles Martinet, who was given an official send-off by Nintendo and crowed the title of "Mario Ambassador" – going on to promote the character at events.</p>
<p>In some other news, it appears Takashi Nagasako is also reportedly no longer voicing Donkey Kong after 20 years. You can see the latest Mario voice actor update in <a href="https://youtu.be/KCdOTw6qbhs">Mario Kart World's credits</a>.</p>

<p>"Mario Kart World is going to move a lot of Switch 2"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has the most graphical horsepower we've ever seen in the history of the Mario Kart series, and if you're eager to know the exact details about how this game is performing on the Switch 2, Digital Foundry has now delivered its tech review.</p>
<p>In the Switch 2's portable and tabletop mode, racers can expect a resolution of 1080p in handheld and 1440p in docked play:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"TV image quality is generally fine...holding up well on a 4K television set from a typical viewing distance. Docked mode also gets a touch of post-process image treatment to adjust the 1440p resolution...handheld mode fairs a bit better though, despite its lower pixel count. There's no anti-aliasing of any kind here, so the 1080p pixel count maps perfectly onto the 1080p Switch 2 display."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> was 1080p docked and 720p in portable mode. This results in World looking a "lot cleaner" even if it is still imperfect.</p>
<p>As for the game's performance, Digital Foundry found its experience to be "faultless" - with the frame rate locked at 60fps in the content tested, although photo mode drops the experience to 30fps. On the portable front, it's believed to run at the same frame rate as its docked counterpart.</p>
<p>The team also tested out the split screen as well as the GameChat functionality and found there weren't any performance concerns to the player experience. Regarding load times, these were also "fairly speedy" on the system's internal storage and comparable to a lot of current-generation titles.</p>
<p>HDR is also a nice addition and while it looks decent on TVs, don't expect much from the LCD panel in portable mode. All up, though, Digital Foundry sums up this next-generation entry as a "tremendous accomplishment" and is seriously impressed by the scope of what's been achieved here in terms of the massive open-world scale with very few compromises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Visually speaking, World offers some beautiful sights with key rendering advances over prior Mario Kart games, though a lot of rendering power has gone into making the open world work. It's really the incredible quality of Nintendo's artistry that stands out the most here...plus it packs good resolution and frame rate metrics in portable and docked play without the low internal resolutions that typify a lot of early Switch 2 software."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

It’s putting the power of building into the hands of players.” He said that a general thought for the approach to MindsEye included “pushing it towards people who want to make games.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked how they will curate these builds for other players to best find them, he explained “At launch, we will curate and pick the cream of the crop on a featured menu.” However, he added, “Eventually, we want players to choose what they want. We don’t want to dictate eventually how you earn money in the game or how you decide to play the game.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The building tool that will be used by players was also used by those making the game, with Benzies saying “A lot of what you see now was built within the tool. A lot of the ambience… Anything we could build using the tool we would.” He also noted, “Our next game, we’ll use it more.” At the same time, he promised “Every tool we use to build the game we’ll give to players so they can use.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Benzies indicated they had grand plans for MindsEye follow ups, stating “The MindsEye story, it’s a small part of a very big story that we intend to tell over however many years it takes.” He compared the larger world they were formulating to something like Star Wars, in that “We have many stories that take place over different time periods in the same universe.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game director also noted that “multiplayer will come at the end of this year and then we have a huge multiplayer world add on that will come next year.”  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Circling back to the user generated content, Benzies said he was excited to see what becomes of it because he thinks when you give the tools to the public, they’ll often find “More interesting ways to use the tools and almost hack the tools."</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/herdling-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em><a href="https://herdling.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Herdling</a></em>, an upcoming game by <em>FAR</em> developer Okomotive, released a Steam demo during today's Future Games Show. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3047750/Herdling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> features the opening of the game, where you find some big fuzzy creatures and herd them out of the city toward the wilderness. </p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Herdling - Future Games Show &amp; Demo Trailer | PS5 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/inu5LAIyR0M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The game calls them "Calicorns," which feels like a pretty good name: they are sort of calico-patterned, and they have big curly horns. They'll run from you or ignore you at first, but once you tame them, you can give them a name and add them to your herd. To steer them, you have to stand behind them and encourage them in the direction you want them to go. I found it a little clunky to get my head around--by continuously holding your controller trigger you can guide them toward a waypoint, but you have to move to the right to move them left, and vice versa. It works, though; the movement really feels like <em>herding</em>, as opposed to just having some companions who follow you around. You have to be aware of where you want the herd to go, not just where <em>you</em> want to go, and make sure you're not guiding them into rocks or dead ends. (I felt terrible when I did this.)</p><p>You can make your herd stop, walk slowly, or run, and they can also help you push things to progress and solve the demo's light puzzles. But mostly, you just encourage your furry guys along as the dismal city gives way to beautiful countryside and a mountain looms enticingly in the distance. You follow railroad tracks and cross streams, and your Calicorns make huffing sounds and wag their goat tails, and you can feed them fruit and pet them as all of you amble along. Even with the ability to run short distances, the demo feels slow in a lovely way; there's no real rushing your herd, and taking corners or moving them precisely requires you to scurry around them like a little human sheepdog so you can all keep heading toward those mountains.</p><p>I could imagine the pace grating a bit in the full game, but there were glimpses of a narrative, and mysterious objects I found, that make me suspect there'll be more to do than wander. The demo trailer shows your herd getting into some trouble with a giant bird; I will positively die if anything bad happens to my precious pettable children, even after spending only a half an hour with them. <em>Herdling</em> has a release date of this summer. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoff-keighleys-yellow-sneakers"><h3>You Can Always Count On Sneakers</h3></a><p>The one thing you can count on Summer Game Fest for</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sony-fight-stick-project-defiant-announced"><h3>I Need To Know If Sony’s Fight Stick Is Good Or Not</h3></a><p>Along with a new game from Arc System Works, Sony's announced their first fight stick code-named Project Defiant.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/survival-horror-holstin-gets-new-trailer-and-2-hour-long-demo-revealed-during-future-games-show/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer Sonka's psychological survival horror game Holstin just got a brand new trailer during the Future Games Show, along with the news that a new, 2-hour-long demo is available for players to try, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2235430/Holstin/">right now</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous demos that have been available on Steam, which focused on specific mechanics in Holstin, this new demo is just the first two hours of the game for players to try, and get the full opening experience.</p>
<p>Holstin is a Resident Evil, Silent Hill-inspired horror game that uses 2XD rendering, allowing the team to "<em>seamlessly shift between multiple perspectives in real-time, lit, fully 3D pixel environments,</em>" according to a press release. Set in 1990s Poland, in a lakeside town called Jeziorne-Kolonia, you&nbsp;play as Tomasz, one of the last remaining locals who hasn't yet turned into an ooze-riddled creature.</p>
<p><iframe title="Holstin: Jeziorne-Kolonia Demo Shadow Drop | Summer Game Fest Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0O3ofy7-iFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Holstin is currently planned to be released on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, and PC, with a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sonkagames/holstin">Kickstarter campaign</a> planned to launch later in 2025 to help the development team get the game over the finish line.</p>
<p>We've seen a lot of indie horror games break through into the main gaming conversation in the last few years, with games like Signalis, Crow Country, and Mouthwashing becoming indie-darlings for horror fans, all of them leaning into pixel art and a slightly more retro-look-and-feel to enhance the scares they have waiting for players.</p>
<p>Holstin looks like it could be the next game on that list, if the horror is able to deliver when it launches in the hopefully near future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gearbox-says-take-two-does-not-use-spyware-in-its-games-as-borderlands-review-bombing-continues<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox Software has published a statement regarding the controversy surrounding changes to parent company Take-Two’s Terms of Service and fears that many Borderlands games now contain “spyware.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Published <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/49520/discussions/0/598528766295202095/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>directly on Steam</u></a>, where outcry has materialized in the form of review-bombing campaigns for all major Borderlands titles, the statement’s aim is to address concerns while “maintaining transparency and confidence with the community.” That means tackling two key talking points that have taken over the Borderlands fanbase for months, including fears of spyware and modding crackdowns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox makes its stance clear from the get-go: “Take-Two does not use spyware in its games.” While there are instances data will be collected, Gearbox doesn’t want players to fear that their private information is always up for grabs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Take-Two identifies these practices in its Privacy Policy to provide transparency to players and comply with its legal obligations,” Gearbox’s Steam statement says. “Take-Two collects this information to deliver its services to players, including to protect the game environment and player experience. You can read more about this in the Privacy Policy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement continues: “For example, player and device identifiers are collected in part to ensure the game is compatible with each player’s media, platform or website browser type. It allows us to better understand how players play games, and to personalize the user experience (like having usernames show up!). Account credentials are collected from users who choose to create accounts with Take-Two and its labels.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear if Gearbox’s explanation of Take-Two’s Terms of Service will be enough to calm those who took up arms after the agreement was altered back in February. Meanwhile, the studio’s explanation for its stance on the modding scene is fairly straightforward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Take-Two’s Terms of Service prohibit mods that allow users to gain an unfair advantage, negatively impact the ability of other users to enjoy the game as intended, or allow users to gain access to content that the user is not entitled to,” the statement clarifies. “We do this to protect the integrity of the game experience for all users.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a direct response to fears that the modding community could face repercussions for any kind of modding activity, as Gearbox says Take-Two’s primary concern lies with cheaters who could dampen the experience for other players. The statement goes as far as to say Gearbox’s parent company “generally does not seek to take action against mods that are single-player only, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of its labels and third parties.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Uproar began around May of this year when fans caught wind that Take-Two had updated its terms of service, affecting many of its existing titles. Rumor that the company was preying on user data quickly caught fire, resulting in a movement that saw the Recent Reviews sections for Borderlands 1, Borderlands 2, and Borderlands 3 tank into the “Mostly Negative” and “Overwhelmingly Negative” zones. While concerns subsided for the back half of May, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-2-goes-free-to-keep-on-steam-where-recent-eula-changes-have-sparked-a-mostly-negative-user-review-rating-across-the-entire-franchise"><u>fears kicked up once again when Borderlands 2 was made free to keep</u></a> (for a limited time) on June 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, the Borderlands series’ Recent Reviews on Steam remain firmly in the red. Meanwhile, Gearbox is working to deliver <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4"><u>Borderlands 4</u></a> this September.

It then takes viewers behind the scenes of motion capture performances, including how that emotional opening scene between Gustave and Sophie came to life and another fun moment between Monoco and Verso.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the documentary is still a work in progress and the full video may change, we were able to chat with Jennifer English (Maelle), Ben Starr (Verso), Shala Nyx (Sciel), Kirsty Rider (Lune), Rich Keeble (Monoco), and Maxence Cazorla (Esquie) about their work on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were all really excited," English said of the time before the game launched. "We weren’t as stressed as the developers were, but I was dead nervous about it because we put all our love and heart into it and hope it pays off - and thankfully it did."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You can do whatever you do in the studio, but then it stops being yours," Starr added. "You don’t know what it’s going to become. There are so many circumstances that go into the release of a game, and I felt, personally, there was a huge amount of pressure. It’s a game I wanted to be good for the team because they had put so much work into it, and because we didn’t just come into it, we were an additional part of it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">English then went on to discuss what it was like recording for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and video games in general, and it was a fascinating glimpse behind the curtain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I get so lonely in the booth," English joked. "You have to pretend. It’s very rare in video games that you get a playmate. I think it’s happened once or twice that I’ve had another actor in the room, so it’s a real honor when people think you were together recording. Video game acting is the Olympics of acting. If you can do good acting in video games - there is some bad acting, but not in this game – you can do anything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nyx then shared how many people have reached out to her about how her character, Sciel, has helped them with struggles in their own lives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s so cinematic," Nyx said. "It’s just so wonderful to be the voice and body of a character that is so rich and has so much emotional depth. I’ve had so many people reach out to me about how my character has helped them with their depression and helped them with their mental health. It’s so ephemeral and every moment is so rich and that’s a testament to the writing."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, Starr spoke on the emotional impact of the game and why we care so much about these pixels that became characters that mean a lot to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason you cry is because there is so much joy to be lost," Starr said. "You can’t have something that’s just morose all the time. If these people who are so vibrantly brought to life by these actors, if we lose them, then you lose everything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sells-33-million-in-33-days-not-bad-for-a-game-some-thought-was-going-to-get-crushed-by-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">how the game sold 3.3 million copies in just 33 days.</a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

Get hands-on with the core gameplay, from engaging in intense combat and solving environmental puzzles to scavenging for survival, exploring <a title="Companies > ooze [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ooze">ooze</a>-infested streets and interiors, and interacting with the not-so-mentally-stable locals who still haven’t fully Turned. The demo also highlights <em>Holstin</em>‘s unique camera and lighting system, which seamlessly shifts between multiple perspectives in real-time lit, fully 3D pixel environments.</p></blockquote><p><em>Holstin</em> will be available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2235430/Holstin/" target="_blank">Steam</a>) platforms.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination/" data-ref-id="5000-600315">Hitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition</a> sees Agent 47 and his penchant for disguises and creative murders arrive on Nintendo's newest console. The Switch 2's Signature Edition is a comprehensive package, featuring the full campaigns for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman/" data-ref-id="5000-281972">Hitman</a> (2016), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman-2/" data-ref-id="5000-483226">Hitman 2</a> (2018), and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman-3/" data-ref-id="5000-513791">Hitman 3</a> (2021), along with Contracts mode, Escalation, Elusive Target arcades, the relatively new (and excellent) Freelancer mode, Sniper Assassin mode, featured live content, and everything from both the Hitman 2 Expansion Pack and Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack. That includes cosmetics, locations like Haven Island and The Bank, and side missions such as the Seven Deadly Sins and Special Assignments campaigns.</p><p dir="ltr">The only content not included are three specific Elusive Target arcade contracts--Replication, The Base, and The Oroborous--and the Sarajevo Six bonus contracts. You can purchase all of this content on the Nintendo eShop for $5 each, but it's disconcerting that these missions are gated behind paid DLC in the first place. The Sarajevo Six is the latest piece of significant DLC for the game, but it still came out two years ago after previously being exclusive to the PlayStation 4 version of Hitman 2, so you'd expect it to be included in a package that already costs $60. The Elusive Target contracts are even more egregious because they were previously released as free updates many years ago. These packs include cosmetics, which is probably the justification for selling them, but I think people would be a lot happier if the actual gameplay content was separated and included in the initial purchase. Having said that, you're still getting dozens upon dozens of hours of Hitman to sink your teeth into. It's an exhaustive package, even with parts missing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4508527-hitmanworldofassassinationsignatureedition_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508527" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4508527-hitmanworldofassassinationsignatureedition_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508527"></a><figcaption>Ultimately, this is still a solid collection--it just plays better everywhere else.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4508527-hitmanworldofassassinationsignatureedition_01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Of course, the big question regarding this port is: How's the performance? Unlike the Switch version of Hitman 3, which required cloud streaming to run at all, the Signature Edition runs natively on the Switch 2 but falls short of other versions of the game in several areas. It's not terrible, but there are clearly better places to play if you're interested in killing people with a bald, barcoded assassin.</p><p dir="ltr">Visually, it looks good both docked and in handheld mode, whether you're throwing axes at faces at a Paris fashion show, tampering with open-wheel race cars in Miami, or solving a whodunit at an opulent estate in Dartmoor. It appears to be 1080p when docked and 720p in handheld mode, so you lose some of the detail available on other platforms, and there is some occasional shimmering on certain objects. The Switch 2's HDR implementation also doesn't function properly when playing handheld, resulting in an overly bright image that makes certain aspects of the game, like the map, unreadable. Fortunately, you can at least turn this off in the system settings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4508524-screenshot2025-06-07145142.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508524" data-ratio="0.5625814863103" data-width="1534" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4508524-screenshot2025-06-07145142.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508524"></a><figcaption>The framerate fluctuates wildly whenever you're not in a small room.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4508524-screenshot2025-06-07145142.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Performance in the Signature Edition is uneven, utilizing an uncapped 60fps that varies from moment to moment depending on what's happening on screen. If you're in a small room by yourself, you can see the frame rate reach its upper limits, but it fluctuates wildly everywhere else. I never noticed any substantial drops, even when dealing with large crowds of NPCs, but playing in handheld mode fares best, as the Switch 2's built-in Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) does a decent job of making the fickle frame rate feel smoother than it does when docked, where VRR is unavailable. Playing on a TV just feels unpleasant, even if the game's methodical pacing somewhat mitigates this. There aren't any graphics settings to tinker with either. This isn't out of the ordinary for a console game, but the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Hitman did let you cap the frame rate at 30fps for a more stable experience.</p><p dir="ltr">While playing in handheld mode is the way to go for more consistent performance, that doesn't mean it's great for taking Hitman on the go. The death knell for this port is the Signature Edition's always-online requirement. This restriction has been part of the game since 2016, so it's hardly surprising, but it's disappointing that IO Interactive hasn't found an alternative solution that allows you to reap the full benefits of the Switch 2's portability. You can still play the game offline, but it's a badly diluted experience, lacking progression, rewards, challenges, and level mastery; essentially, everything that adds replayability and a sense of accomplishment is absent unless you're connected to the Hitman servers. If you're playing through the campaigns for the first time, it's mostly fine, but anything beyond this is significantly stripped back due to a rigid requirement.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4508528-hitman-world-of-assassination-deluxe-pack-pc-game-steam-wallpaper-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508528" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4508528-hitman-world-of-assassination-deluxe-pack-pc-game-steam-wallpaper-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508528"></a><figcaption>Hitman 3 is one of our favorite games--it was picked for GameSpot's Best of 2023.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4508528-hitman-world-of-assassination-deluxe-pack-pc-game-steam-wallpaper-4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Due to these issues and the game's performance problems, it's tough to recommend Hitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition. Not only are other versions of the game regularly cheaper--and sometimes free--but they also run and look better, both on TVs/monitors and handheld devices like the Steam Deck and ASUS ROG Ally. The Switch 2 port is certainly playable (albeit compromised), and the World of Assassination trilogy remains fantastic, but even amidst the excitement of a shiny new console, Agent 47's latest Nintendo outing is a letdown.</p>

            <p>
I've been excited about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roman-sands-rebuild">Roman Sands RE:Build</a> since the moment I laid my eyes on it, particularly because it's from the same studio behind the ever-haunting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paratopic">Paratopic</a>. Roman Sands just has a ridiculously strong art direction to it, very much one that could easily be dubbed Y2K, but I think more accurately should be seen as an evolution of the aesthetic/ era. Almost as if this is the direction it could have gone in. 
</p>

<p>
Just great stuff, not even counting the oddball gameplay, and as revealed in a new trailer, it's got a release date now too: September 12th. That's close enough for me to count down the days, but far away enough for me to think "I'd like to be playing this right now actually, ta very much." The trailer offered a new look at its strange, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzley</a> hotel and all of its guests, as well as a tease for the things you'll be getting up to (all of which seem quite ominous.

<p>
The gameplay itself sees you attending to the demands of said guests as outlandish as they all are, but the clock is working against you. Specifically, a clock that'll see the sun swallowing up the world. Terrifying! And a great hook. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231460/Roman_Sands_REBuild/">There's a demo you can check out on Steam too</a>, or you can just wishlist it if you want to wait for the full thing.
</p>
<p>
Excitingly, the release date trailer also had a mysterious tease for Paratopic: Overdub, seemingly an anniversary edition of the game. Over on its <a href="https://lynn.gamer-network.net/content/rockpapershotgun/content-article/edit/news/2346939?tab=compose">Steam page</a> it's described as a remaster/ remix/ sequel, and look, it could be none of those things and I'd still be in. Paratopic is a peak example of the modern trend of PS1-inspired games, using the aesthetic to really hone in on its subtle horrors. Whatever this new thing contains, I'll take it. It's coming September 12th too, so I'm sure like me you'll be plenty busy that day!

            <p>
Now, I'm not naming any names here, but there's a certain hand-drawn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> that everyone's a bit sick of waiting for by this point, and could really do with a release date. OK, fine, yes it's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and if those recent Steam backend updates mean anything, I expect it'll get some kind of update sometime in the next few days. In the meantime, here's <a href="https://rockpapershotgun.com/games/constance">Constance</a>, also a hand-drawn metroidvania, that actually does have a release date.
</p>

<p>
In Constance, you play as a purple-haired painter who is "striving to escape from a colorful but decaying inner-world, created by her declining mental health." Mental health themes are nothing new in the world of indie games, but that's not what really sells me on Constance. That'd be the tight-looking platforming and snappy, paint-brush oriented combat.

<p>
You literally fight and hop dart around with a massive paintbrush, using it to do pretty much everything, from glooping up the side of a wall, to doing quick brush strokes that let you dodge. Occasionally you'll even have to do some actual painting, if you can believe it! The thing looks lovely too, I'm a sucker for hand-drawn games, as they always feel like labours of love. Aesthetically that certainly seems to be the case here, so I'm hoping the full release lives up to its look. There's a demo to available too, so you and I could always give that a go to find out!
</p>
<p>
Oh, right, release date! That'll be November 24th, a few months away still, but I'm sure you can wait. As I said, I really wouldn't be surprised if Silksong does get dated this weekend, but definitely consider keeping Constance on your radar too, I'm sure more than enough people are going to pick up the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> sequel.

<figure><a title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156587/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to put your Switch 2 through its paces, there’s no shortage of options in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-all-day-one-releases">its generous launch lineup</a>. Whether it’s the candy-colored charm of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or the neon-drenched cityscape of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, you’re spoiled for choice when it comes to visual powerhouses.</p>
<p>With such major titles on offer, it would be easy to overlook <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>. Released on other platforms in July 2024, it’s a game that, at first glance, might seem like just another Japanese action game, complete with unwieldy title and familiar feudal-era setting. Jumping into the adventure of the goddess Yoshiro and her faithful protector Soh, I was surprised to find that Capcom’s Shinto-inspired epic is a truly compelling blend of action and tower defence.</p>
<p>The land has been overrun by a demonic force known as the Seethe. Villages surrounding the sacred Mount Kafuku have fallen to corruption. Yoshiro, a divine being, must perform a ritual dance to cleanse each area. Cleansing leaves her vulnerable to attack, which is where her bodyguard Soh comes in. He is tasked with defending the goddess as they move through each settlement, dancing away the evil. Thankfully, Soh won't be alone in this task.</p>
<figure><a title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156586/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In each area, you cleanse corrupted villagers and assign them combat roles, allowing them to join your fight. You’ll place these villagers in strategic positions around Yoshiro. As night falls, your group must hold their ground against waves of Seethe. The day-night cycle creates a natural ebb and flow of action. During the day, you free villagers, collect crystals, and purge corrupted fauna while a timer counts down to nightfall. Roles are assigned to your fighters using crystals, but this currency is primarily used to carve a path for the ritual. As Soh waves his harai gushi to guide Yoshiro, her progress will determine how many cycles it will take to clear the area. Some will take a single day, most take multiple.</p>
<p>Half ARPG, half tower defence, Kunitsu-Gami is a fascinating and addictive mashup. You control Soh directly, and there’s a beautiful fluidity to his combat. His “blade dance” has a slight delay between input and impact, giving the sensation of gliding through swathes of enemies and cutting them to ribbons. He can attach multiple talismans and tsuba to his gear, which add devastating new abilities or boosts to villagers.</p>
<p>After a settlement is cleared, it becomes a base that you can revisit between rituals. Upgrading these bases provides rewards for both Soh and his growing band of fighters.</p>

<p>Between villages, powerful bosses await, and defeating them earns you a mask that unlocks a new role type to assign to villagers. Boss fights themselves play like a gritty, horror-tinged version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikmin_1">Pikmin</a>, as you command fighters to swarm an enemy or defend Yoshiro from adds.</p>
<p>Each villager role has unique utility, from the humble woodcutter to the formidable sorcerer. Selecting the right roles for the right type of enemy or environment is key to Yoshiro’s survival.</p>
<p>The settlements of Mount Kafuku are visually stunning, vibrant dioramas that shift from fleshy hellscape to lush paradise as Yoshiro does their thing. The game runs incredibly well too; Soh slices shafts of bright colour through large groups of enemies without any noticeable frame drops. Performance remains impressive undocked, with the Switch 2’s larger display complementing the top-down environments perfectly. There’s also a healthy selection of visual options (being able to disable motion blur and depth of field is appreciated, Capcom) and accessibility tweaks.</p>
<figure><a title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156595/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Completing the audio-visual feast is an intoxicating soundscape, which is only slightly marred by a woeful English voice track. Luckily the option to swap to Japanese is available.</p>
<p>Mouse control will be a bit divisive for some. Arguably, this kind of title is well suited to the mouse, as a large chunk of gameplay has you assigning units in the command menu. It took some getting used to, but once I found a comfortable hand position, I enjoyed playing this way. Ultimately, though, I found myself retreating to traditional controls during difficult sections like boss fights. Manoeuvring Soh around enemies while shifting the camera with mouse movement just didn't quite work for me.</p>
<p>Still, even without the extra ways to play that Switch 2 offers, this is a great representation of multiple genres in its own right. It’s a generous title, with plenty of reasons to go back to levels, revealing secrets and unlocking more abilities for Soh and his army.</p>
<figure><a title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156594/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While each villager role introduces a new strategy and each corrupted settlement adds fresh mechanics, the formula does start to feel slightly repetitive after the midpoint. That said, the core loop of upgrade-plan-defend is addictive and makes Kunitsu-Gami one of the most unique launch titles on Switch 2.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Kunitsu-Gami was a real surprise. A solid blend of strategy and action that incorporates aspects of Shinto and Japanese folklore to create a visually stunning experience. It's a great showcase for Switch 2, even if mouse controls might not quite work for everyone.</p></section>

This early inspiration was both a playful nod to the Chinese saying “ 脑子进水” ('brain soaked with water') and a philosophical reflection seen in some of our favorite films," Joker Studios told us. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When it came time to build the actual framework, we drew on a wide range of influences—from JRPGs and CRPGs to open-world titles and even niche indie games that share a spirit of boundless exploration. At every step, we focused on how to let players experience these feelings themselves, not just watch them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you dive into Sea of Remnants you'll be focused on exploring the pirate city Orbtopia, talking to the rich cast of NPCs and - you're a sailor after all -  taking to the briny waves to find islands, treasures, and hidden ruins. You can raid the ships you meet on the sea or take on huge monsters, all while a dynamic weather system rages overhead. When you're not doing that you'll be focused on upgrading your vessel, learning new skills, or even kicking back with some fishing, cooking, and mahjong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You’ll challenge sea monsters, explore local cultures, and sense the deeper mystery of how memory and forgetting begin to intertwine between the ocean and Orbtopia, the pirate haven. Alongside your companions, you’ll begin a journey that’s equal parts unrestrained and romantic, charting a course as unique as each sailor who steps aboard," says Joker Studio. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Joker Studio previously released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/identity-v"><u>Identity V</u></a>, a survival horror game created in partnership with Dead by Daylight's Behavior Interactive. Since its release in 2018, Identity V has collaborated with Edward Scissorhands, Sherlock Holmes, Personae and Deathnote. Just like Sea of Remnants it has a distinctive visual style - think Coraline but creepier. The game made a bigger impact in Asia than the US, but it still has a dedicated fandom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At their core, the two games exist in entirely separate worlds and storylines. That said, as a nod to fans and our shared studio DNA, you might find a few subtle Easter eggs or world-building hints here and there. But rest assured, any connections are handled with great care and won’t overshadow the unique stories of each game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Live 2025 is packed with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-2025-partners-announced">exclusive reveals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-2025-to-give-away-more-than-20000-prizes-and-freebies">thousands of giveaways</a>, 170 gaming stations, and tons of fun, the event is shaping up to be a huge celebration of everything fans of games, TV, movies, comics, and collectibles love, and here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect">how to watch</a> the event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.

Released during today's Future Games Show: Summer Showcase 2025, this trailer gave us another look at this narrative-focused horror experience's first-person gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>"In the last known city on Earth, people are disappearing in their sleep," the game's description reads. "Those who remain exist in a crisis of reckless experiments to keep awake. Katja must navigate depraved death cults, otherworldly forces, and the ever-present horror of The Hush, to save herself and those who rely upon her."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Sleep Awake gameplay trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6txum7vHznA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6txum7vHznA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Notably, Blumhouse Games, the video game arm of horror movie production company Blumhouse, is publishing the game.

The studio previously known for CRPGs like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/video/2018/10/01/the-old-school-vibe-of-pathfinder-kingmaker">Pathfinder: Kingmaker</a> and Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is clearly amping up the scope of its ambitions. The Expanse: Osiris Reborn looks stellar in this initial showing, exhibiting vibes that recall the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/mass-effect-legendary-edition/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review-a-great-way-to-honor">Mass Effect</a> series, albeit in the hard sci-fi fictional backdrop of the celebrated <em>The Expanse</em> TV show.&nbsp;</p><p>The cinematic trailer looks beautiful, but it also teases some of the likely futuristic weaponry and other tools players will likely play with in the game. Right from the end of that cinematic sequence, fans of this fiction will be happy to know that the story clearly deals with the protomolecule featured prominently in <em>The Expanse</em> show.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out in The Expanse: Osiris Reborn reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p url="https://youtu.be/pIQifuOTTe8" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pIQifuOTTe8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>While the subsequent third-person action gameplay (apparently powered by Unreal Engine 5) was relatively brief, it’s here that the game is likely to draw the most solid comparisons to Mass Effect. We see armored characters moving through futuristic hallways and rooms, triggering tactical abilities, hiding behind cover, and shooting guns over the shoulder. And in the key art from the trailer’s conclusion, it’s hard not to guess that we’re looking at an eclectic mix of party members you might be able to talk with and romance (conjecture on that final point, of course).&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Expanse</em> is one of the best recent sci-fi shows based on one of the best recent sci-fi novel series. If Owlcat Games manages to capture the unique vibe of that fiction and marry it to the fun of Mass Effect-style gameplay, this one could be one to watch very closely.&nbsp;</p><p>We have no release date announcement, but The Expanse: Oriris Reborn is announced for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
