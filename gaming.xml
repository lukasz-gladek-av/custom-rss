		<p>Microsoft has announced a partnership with LG to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to LG’s new Smart TVs, and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members will be able to use it. Those who have this membership will be able to access Xbox Game Pass games through the Xbox app on LG TVs, and will not need an Xbox console. It is all part of Microsoft’s This Is an Xbox plan, which is the company’s push to show how many devices Xbox games can be played on.</p>

<p>As part of the partnership, Game Pass Ultimate players will also be able to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/xbox-cloud-gaming-now-lets-you-stream-some-of-your-own-games/">stream their own games</a> that they own, as long as they are part of the initial 50 launch titles for the service. This service is already available on other devices. In its announcement post, Microsoft said, <em>“Today, we’re excited to announce our collaboration with LG Electronics to bring the Xbox app to their new LG Smart TVs later this year. This means Game Pass Ultimate members will be able to play their games directly from the Xbox app on supported LG Smart TVs via Xbox Cloud Gaming. This gives players even more choice in how they enjoy their favorite games. Soon, players with LG Smart TVs will be able to explore the Gaming Portal for direct access to hundreds of games in the Game Pass Ultimate catalog, including popular titles such as&nbsp;Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and upcoming releases like&nbsp;Avowed&nbsp;(launching February 18, 2025).”</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo Switch users are reporting that some recently purchased Switch games have arrived with the game cartridge missing from inside the box. Even odder, the cartridges appear to have been swapped out for… googly eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">Over the holidays, posts about the bizarre phenomenon began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1hnl1c4/didnt_see_this_coming/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">popping up on social media</a>. Multiple players have shared photos of freshly unwrapped Switch game cases holding a lone googly eye in the spot where the game itself should be.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Grinch got us this year," reads one Reddit post featuring a photo of a Super Mario Party Jamboree case with a lone googly eye in the space meant for the game cartridge.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not clear how widespread the issue is, nor is it clear who the culprit is. Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1hllexj/comment/m3n7lga/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">players suspect that warehouse workers</a> somewhere along the supply chain are snatching the cartridges (likely with the intent to resell them) and replacing them with a googly eye so the weight of the missing cartridge goes unnoticed, or for the purpose of making sure the box sounds like it still has a game inside it when shaken.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the exact source of the missing game cartridges remains unknown, multiple comments and posts mention purchasing a Switch game from Walmart and finding nothing but a googly eye inside, suggesting one of the retail giant's warehouses may be the source of the problem.</p><p dir="ltr">One Reddit user says they've fallen victim to the googly eye switcheroo multiple times.</p><p dir="ltr">"Bought Tears of the Kingdom at a Walmart in Arizona, and this happened to me," they wrote. "Walmart refused to refund/replace, blaming Nintendo. Had to twist their arms a bit, but Nintendo eventually gave me a digital copy of the game. Recently, I went to Walmart to buy Pokémon Violet. I asked if the clerk would watch me open it because I told them about what happened with TotK. Bro was beside himself when I cracked it open to reveal yet another googly eye. They swapped out the game for another (which we also checked)."</p><p dir="ltr">Neither Walmart nor Nintendo have commented on the issue. For now, an issue at Walmart warehouses or distribution centers seems to be the likeliest culprit. But it's also possible that Santa simply ran out of coal this year.</p>

Shields dominated the Tank meta early in <em>Overwatch</em>, mostly due to their immense health pool. However, in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, the strongest shield has less than half the hit points of <em>Overwatch</em>’s original Reinhardt shield (2,000 compared to 800). These Tanks focus more on diving in and disrupting the enemy. Across <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ vast roster of heroes, these are the two Vanguard characters who stand out the most.</p><h2 id="h1743769"><a id="venom"></a>Venom is an easy-to-learn menace</h2><figure id="" data-id="f6bc745f60b4ca835c873382fdaf7de1" data-recommend-id="image://f6bc745f60b4ca835c873382fdaf7de1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Venom leans back with his tongue hanging out." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Venom leans back with his tongue hanging out." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f6bc745f60b4ca835c873382fdaf7de1" data-recommend-id="image://f6bc745f60b4ca835c873382fdaf7de1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Venom leans back with his tongue hanging out." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ tanks focus much more on diving and disrupting than just soaking damage in the front line.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-adds-train-to-map-pool/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For the third straight Major in a row, the most illustrious Counter-Strike 2 Major will feature a different active duty map pool. Valve announced today that the remade Train will replace Vertigo in time for the BLAST.tv Austin Major in April 2025.</p>



<p>With the next CS2 Major using this map pool, many are now expecting the in-game Premier pool and other official tournaments to swap in Train in place of Vertigo.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-the-line-for-vertigo">End of The Line for Vertigo</h2>



<p>Train officially returned to Counter-Strike, debuting for the first time in CS2, back in November 2024. The reworked map has been subjected to a complete visual overhaul (including a gorgeous rain effect when outdoors) and several major gameplay changes. Notably, both bombsites are now more open with less train car clutter, the Heaven area looking down on the A site is gone, and the “Popdog” ladder has been expanded to a long spiral staircase. The CS2 community as a whole has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/">eager</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">l</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/">y been waiting</a> for Train to come to CS2 for some time.</p>



<p>While Train’s arrival to the Active Duty map pool was inevitable, Valve has finally confirmed which map it will replace: Vertigo. At the professional level, outside of a couple of top North American teams, Vertigo has been one of the least played maps. According to statistics <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/maps?startDate=2024-01-01&amp;endDate=2024-12-31&amp;matchType=BigEvents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from HLTV</a>, it is the least played map at big events in 2024 other than Overpass, which was removed from the map pool during the year.</p>



<p>The only thing that remains unclear is when Train will officially be implemented in the in-game and other tournament map pools. The 2025 calendar for CS2 is set to officially begin just as week from now with BLAST Spring Bounty 2025. With the changes to the CS2 ecosystem, all big events will affect the global standings that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-confirms-cs2-major-expansion-and-rankings-based-invitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">determine who is invited to the Major or its closed qualifiers</a>.</p>



<p>Is replacing Vertigo with Train the right move? Join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>AMD’s next generation of graphics cards are here as the company has officially unveiled its first RDNA 4 graphics cards, the Radeon RX 9000 series. The announcement came during the company’s press event at CES 2025.</p>



<p>The two new cards announced on Monday were the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070. </p>



<p>While the cards have been unveiled along with various partners, not much in terms of specs, specific release date, or pricing were revealed. AMD said that more information on RDNA 4 and the new cards will be announced later this quarter. </p>



<p>What was mentioned was that they would be available at some point during Q1 and feature the next-gen FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4). AMD says that the the cards feature a 4nm process, 2nd generation AI accelerators, and 3rd generation ray tracing accelerators. FSR 4 was also developed specifically for RDNA 4 cards, suggesting that older cards won’t have access to the feature.  That wasn’t confirmed, however.</p>



<p>The new cards, when released, will be available from AMD along with a number of partners such as Asrock, Gigabyte, Sapphire, ASUS, and more. In addition to the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070, AMD will be releasing RX 9060 series graphics cards as well. Information on those cards will also be coming at a later date.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft's push to deliver Xbox gaming without requiring users to purchase Xbox hardware is set to continue in 2025, with Xbox Cloud Gaming support officially coming to LG TVs.
</p>
<p>
Starting "later this year", LG TV owners can download the Xbox app and play "hundreds" of titles from the Game Pass Ultimate catalogue via cloud streaming, including Obsidian Entertainment's upcoming Avowed (which launches in February) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">Eurogamer's Game of the Year 2024</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft notes the Xbox app on LG TVs will also support the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-can-now-stream-select-games-from-their-own-library-via-cloud-gaming">recently introduced</a> ability for users to stream "select" Xbox games they already own - from the current list of "over 50" titles - even if they're not presently available as part of Game Pass.

<p>
In all cases, an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription is required (starting at £14.99 a month), as is a "supported" LG Smart TV. Microsoft's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/06/xbox-lg-smart-tv-cloud-gaming/">initial announcement</a> doesn't detail which TVs will be compatible with the service, but it says more details will be shared in the "coming months".
</p><p>
Xbox Cloud Gaming's arrival on LG TVs follows its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-partnering-with-amazon-to-deliver-xbox-cloud-gaming-via-fire-tv-devices">launch on Amazon Fire TV devices</a> last year and on Samsung TVs in 2022. Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> previously confirmed the Xbox app was Microsoft's new approach to bringing cloud gaming to the masses after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-decides-to-pivot-away-from-xbox-game-pass-streaming-box-for-now">pulled the plug</a> on its own Xbox cloud gaming device, codenamed Keystone, back in 2022.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-app-to-come-to-select-lg-smart-tvs-ultimate-game-pass-subscribers-to-benefit/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft has been on a mission to peddle its products with the slogan of "Xbox Anywhere." This includes being able to stream or play Xbox titles on their PCs, TVs, and even phones. Today, it's been announced by Xbox that there is a partnership with LG Electronics to bring the Xbox App to specific LG Smart TVs.</p>
<p>This means that those who have an LG Smart TV will gain access to the Xbox Gaming portal, where people will then get access to the Game Pass Ultimate catalog, allowing those interested to have access to top games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and the highly anticipated title, Avowed. To play the games, people will need to have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription and a compatible Bluetooth wireless controller to play games through the Xbox App. Additionally, those who are Xbox Game Pass members will also have the opportunity to play their own games. At the moment, there are only 50 games this applies to, with the list of games available on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/20/stream-your-own-game-xbox-cloud-gaming-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Wire page</a>, where you can find out all of the info regarding streaming your games.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to announce the partnership with Xbox, which aims to enrich the gaming experience on LG Smart TVs with a broader selection of popular games. The Gaming Portal will provide users with a seamless, convenient, and exciting way to enhance the gaming experience on LG Smart TVs," says Chris Jo, the Senior Vice President of Platform Business at LG.</p>
<p>At the moment, the specific TVs haven't been specified by Xbox or LG, with the post created on Xbox Wire simply stating that the collaboration will go to their new LG Smart TVs "later this year."</p>
<p>This is all a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/06/xbox-lg-smart-tv-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively new venture for Xbox</a>, as the ability to stream your own game on select platforms is also a trial that they are exploring and is an attempt to bring the Xbox Cloud Gaming Experience to the forefront, as they are slowly stepping away from focusing on console releases, and are trying to look at the bigger picture. However,<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-hardware-diminishing-returns/"> it has been confirmed by Phil Spencer</a> that they are continuing to explore new hardware and consoles that will be made in the future despite the difficulties in profit and cost.</p>
<p>Despite the troublesome time that Xbox has seemingly experienced as of late, <a href="https://wccftech.com/analyst-reckons-xbox-has-a-bright-future-according-to-sales-data/">according to Mat Piscatella</a>, Xbox is going to turn it around and will get to experience a bright future. A lot of this could boil down to the fact that they are no longer doing Xbox Exclusives, as they want to push the game onto as many platforms as possible.</p>
<p>Now it's just a waiting game to see how smooth the Xbox Cloud Gaming experience is on an LG Smart TV.</p>

The 27-inch and 32-inch 4K UltraSharp Thunderbolt displays announced at CES have been updated with new IPS panels that provide 120Hz refresh rates alongside features designed to enhance visual comfort.</p><p>The UltraSharp line is a popular choice for working professionals who need a no-frills 4K monitor that supports Windows, macOS, and multi-monitor setups — the 27-inch model in particular tops <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-4k-monitors/">a lot</a> <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-4k-monitors">of</a> <a href="https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/best/by-resolution/4k-ultra-hd-uhd">lists</a> for best 4K monitor. 120Hz refresh rates are usually targeted toward gamers who can benefit from higher frame rates and smoother, more responsive gameplay, which now makes the 27-inch UltraSharp 4K in particular a decent solution for people who want a single display that’s suitable for both work <em>and</em> play.</p><p>The improvements come at a cost though: the 27-inch UltraSharp 4K is increasing to $699.99 (<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u2723qe/apd/210-bdpf/monitors-monitor-accessories">up from $639.99 for the 60Hz model</a>), and the larger 32-inch UltraSharp 4K now costs $949.99 (<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u3223qe/apd/210-bdph/monitors-monitor-accessories">up from $919.99</a>). Both will be available to buy globally starting February 25th, according to Dell.</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a look at what the new 32-inch Dell UltraSharp 4K monitor looks like from the front.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Dell</cite></p></div><p>Dell introduced several <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/3/23944722/dell-ultrasharp-u2424h-u2424he-u2724d-u2724de-120hz-price-release-date-specs-features">120Hz monitors to the UltraSharp lineup in 2023</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24024951/dell-ultrasharp-curved-thunderbolt-monitor-u4025qw-u3425we-price-release-date-specs-features">2024</a>, but this is the first time that the popular 27-inch 4K model has seen a similar refresh rate boost. Other improvements for the new UltraSharp 4K models include up to 140W power delivery via USB-C (up from 90W), and a 3,000:1 contrast ratio, thanks to its use of “enhanced IPS Black technology” that provides 47 percent deeper blacks compared to conventional IPS panels, according to Dell. The prior version of IPS Black offered a 2,000:1 contrast ratio. A comparison showing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPXQdLfKMRs">improvements in contrast ratio can be seen in this YouTube video</a>.</p><div><figcaption><em>Besides some changes to the port selection and a new ventilation grill, the new UltraSharp 4K monitors look visually similar to the previous models.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Dell</cite></p></div><p>Dell says the monitors include an ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts brightness and color temperature to help reduce eye fatigue. Otherwise, the 27-inch and 32-inch 4K UltraSharp share near-identical designs with their predecessors. The new models include VESA DisplayHDR 600 and ports for USB-A, USB-C, Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, and DisplayPort, with ventilation grills now surrounding the ports located on the back of the monitors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070 will both be available in Q1 from a variety of video card manufacturers, but AMD isn’t detailing specifications, pricing, or exact release dates just yet.</p><p>The announcement is light on concrete information. AMD says it has built this architecture from the ground up and that the GPUs built on RDNA 4 will include “a significant boost in AI.” AMD has optimized the compute units in RNDA 4, improved its ray-tracing engine and performance, and upgraded its media encoding quality. Built on a 4nm process, the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 cards will include AMD’s second-generation AI accelerators, third-generation ray-tracing accelerators, and second-generation radiance display engine.</p><div><figcaption><em>AMD is only providing small details about its RDNA 4 architecture.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: AMD</cite></p></div><p>This RDNA 4 architecture will also enable AMD to launch FSR 4 with these 9000-series GPUs. FSR 4 is a machine learning-powered update to AMD’s <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/technologies/fidelityfx/super-resolution.html">upscaling and frame-generation technology</a> that’s been developed specifically for RDNA 4 and its dedicated AI accelerator hardware. That means you’ll only be able to get FSR 4 with a Radeon RX 9070-series graphics card right now, and it will be supported in games with FSR 3.1 already integrated.</p><p>Matt Booty, president of game content and studios at Microsoft, appeared on stage at AMD’s CES keynote earlier today to confirm FSR 4 will be available in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>later this year.</p><p>AMD hasn’t hinted at how FSR 4 will compare to Nvidia’s DLSS technology or what type of performance uplift or image quality improvement we should expect to see with this next generation of FSR.</p><p>It’s also not clear exactly what performance the RX 9070 series of GPUs will deliver against the competition, but in a branding slide for RDNA 4, AMD appears to suggest the 9070 series will offer similar performance to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4070 Super. Nvidia is expected to announce its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336321/nvidia-rtx-5090-32gb-vram-gddr7-memory-ces-leak-rumor">RTX 50-series GPUs</a> later today.</p><div><figcaption><em>FSR 4 will use dedicated AI accelerators on next-gen GPUs to upscale games.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: AMD</cite></p></div><p>AMD is also adding new AI-powered features to its Adrenalin software. These include the ability to generate images with AI models, summarize local documents, and ask an AMD chatbot questions about graphics settings and more.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re wondering why AMD has jumped from the Radeon 7000 series straight to 9000-series GPUs, the company says it will use the 8000-series branding for RDNA 3.5 mobile GPUs. AMD is only previewing FSR 4 at CES and promises to provide more details on the upscaling technology and its latest RDNA 4 GPUs ahead of the Q1 launch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the new design is still intended to make it an Xbox Series X/S controller for people who want the ergonomics of a  DualSense gamepad, this time around it looks far more like a DualSense, featuring a separated d-pad, a mic mute button, and more PS5-like triggers and colors. </p><p>Here’s a slick-looking trailer for the upcoming PlayStation-styled Xbox controller via <em>IGN</em>: </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335156/hyperkins-new-xbox-controller-looks-like-a-ps5-dualsense&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335156/hyperkins-new-xbox-controller-looks-like-a-ps5-dualsense" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Hyperkin via <em>The Verge</em></a></span>, this new controller will be wired only and will include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/gaming/hall-effect-technology-explained-the-gold-standard-for-your-controllers-thumbsticks-and-triggers&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/hall-effect-technology-explained-the-gold-standard-for-your-controllers-thumbsticks-and-triggers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hall Effect thumb sticks,</a></span> which should mean you won’t experience the dreaded stick drift effect just a few months after buying it.

The controller company says its PS5-like Xbox gamepad will be available later this year. </p><p>Being able to use The Competitor on PC is nice, as a lot of games still don’t include PS button icons when you’re using a PlayStation controller. This should, in theory, act like an Xbox controller when plugged into Steam, but it will feel like a PlayStation controller when using it. Just don’t get confused about which X button to hit when a QTE prompt appears! </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-minor-1-bracket-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision has unveiled the bracket for the Call of Duty League’s first ‘Minor’, one of the new tournaments set up to make the CDL 2025 season feel much more dense. The Minor tournaments offer a stopgap between Majors, and while they have a much smaller prize pool, they’ll feature just as much excitement and skill from the players.</p>



<p>Minor tournaments are hosted online and feature a one-shot $20,000 prize for the ultimate victor.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-minor-win-major-effort">Minor Win, Major Effort</h2>



<p>The first CDL Minor will occur between January 10 and 12, and all twelve teams in the CDL are invited to participate. It’s a single-elimination tournament, which means every loss will knock one team out of the running for the $20,000 prize.</p>



<p>Here are the opening matches for the first CDL Minor tournament:</p>



<p><strong>Friday, Jan 10</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Los Angeles Guerillas M8 vs. Minnesota Rokkr</li>



<li>Atlanta FaZe vs. Miami Heretics</li>



<li>Vegas Falcons vs. OpTic Texas</li>



<li>Cloud9 New York vs. Vancouver Surge</li>
</ul>



<p>From there, Boston, Carolina Royal Ravens, Toronto Ultra, and LAT will all wait to see who their opponent will be, having earned a bye earlier in the qualifying rounds.</p>



<p>The action will wrap up on January 12 and the winner of the first-ever CDL Minor will be crowned after becoming $20,000 richer. </p>



<p>On Friday, January 17, the qualification matches for Major I recommence after the festive break. On January 30, the first European Major in CDL history will take place in Madrid, running until February 2. The pattern will continue until COD Champs, which is yet to be officially revealed but should take place in June or July this year.</p>



<p>It’s widely believed that this year’s Call of Duty League Championship will take place in Canada.</p>



<p>It’s an exciting time to be a Call of Duty esports fan. What are you most looking forward to from this season?</p>

"A small example is we had an internal hypothesis that far more people would put their console into rest mode than fully shut it down each time between their play sessions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As it turned out, it was actually about 50/50 between the two options for all our players. So, what that meant was for about 50% of our users, when they booted up, if they were in the US, they were landing on our Explore page. Those outside the U.S. would land on the page for the last game that they have played."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Welcome Hub was therefore developed long after the PS5's release for these players who do not use rest mode, something Sony didn't believe necessary until it looked into these stats. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/big-ps5-update-adds-welcome-hub-party-share-and-more-new-features">It arrived in September and essentially lets players customize their homescreen</a> with different widgets and bits of useful information.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pokemon-center-declares-2025-is-the-year-of-eevee<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Forget Year of Luigi. 2025 is the Year of Eevee. At least, according to The Pokémon Center, the official merch arm of The Pokémon Company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/2025-is-the-year-of-eevee-at-the-pokemon-center" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced today</a> via the official Pokémon website, which christened the year by announcing an array of Eevee-themed merchandise such as plush toys and Eeveelution statuettes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, the "Year of Eevee" thus far appears only to impact The Pokémon Center, the official merchandise store for Pokémon. So it's entirely possible this is purely a marketing thing to sell more Eevee plush, and won't impact anything else.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/06/pokemon-center-169-1736187150484.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2025 is the Year of Eevee according to The Pokémon Center. Image credit: The Pokémon Company.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's <em>also</em> possible this celebration ends up extending to other parts of Pokémon. For instance, we know for a fact that a new Pokémon game is planned for later this year: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. We don't have a ton of information about the game so far, apart from its setting (Lumiose City) and its placement in the "Pokémon Legends" series alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>. A Year of Eevee could portend exciting things for Z-A... dare I predict, a new Eeveelution? There hasn't been one of those since Sylveon was added in Pokémon X and Y (where Lumiose City was introduced) over a decade ago. We're long overdue for a new variation. Unfortunately, we probably can't expect an entirely Eevee-focused game. We've already basically had one of those in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/12/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-and-eevee-review">Pokémon Let's Go! Pikachu and Eevee</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it's worth noting that the Eevee theming has already invaded the Pokémon TCG via the recent Prismatic Evolution expansion. The <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/prismatic-evolutions-set-guide-full-card-list-secret-rares-cut-cards-products-and-more" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new expansion</a>, which releases next week, centers around Terastal Pokémon like in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, but notably includes some absolutely gorgeous Eeveelution cards and even features a Terastal on the cover. Every Eeveelution is included in the set in multiple forms, including an Umbreon that <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/whats-the-ceiling-on-pokemons-new-tera-type-moonbreon/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some are predicting</a> will be very, very coveted by collectors.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/06/umbreon-ex-sir-1736186128191.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A new Umbreon ex card is already being <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/602681/pokemon-japan-sv8a-terastal-fest-ex-umbreon-ex-217187">listed online</a> for absurd amounts of money for a single card.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, I'm really hoping this means we'll see some exciting Eevee-themed updates to other games. Pokémon's been juggling quite a few ongoing games lately, including Pokémon Sleep, Pokémon  Unite, Pokémon Masters EX, and of course Pokémon Go. Between all of those, surely there will be room for some interesting Eevee-themed updates over the next year to tie into the merch plays. We'll have to see how far The Pokémon Company chooses to take things while we eagerly away for more news about Pokémon Legends Z-A. Don't forget, Pokémon Day is on February 27!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.

                <p>Between massive open-world games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-death-of-the-wild/1900-6417832/" data-ref-id="1900-6417832">Elden Ring</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, or live-service titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-season-1-start-date-new-heroes-new-map-and-everything-else-to-know/2900-6101/" data-ref-id="2900-6101">Marvel Rivals</a>, there are no shortage of games that can eat up players' free time. And that's why the industry may have reached a tipping point with its seemingly endless games, according to Bethesda veteran Will Shen.</p><p>Shen--who was previously the lead quest designer on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/" data-ref-id="1900-6418110">Starfield</a>--recently shared his thoughts about players being put off from jumping into large games during his appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCYpt9Zg7cM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kiwi Talkz</a>. He accepted that some of his previous Bethesda titles, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-review/1900-6344622/" data-ref-id="1900-6344622">Skyrim</a>, which "you can play pretty much forever, " may have contributed to player fatigue. However, Shen contends that the oversaturation of giant games leaves players without enough time to fully invest in new titles.</p><p>"We're reaching a point where people are fatigued, or a large section, a growing section of the audience, is becoming fatigued at investing 30-plus, 100-plus hours into a game," explained Shen. "Because they already have that. They already have the games that they will continually come back to, and adding another one to that list is a tall order. It's always a tall order."</p><p>Shen pointed to the success of shorter games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/" data-ref-id="1900-6418277">Astro Bot</a> and Mouthwashing as titles that can be easily enjoyed by players without having to invest massive of amounts of time. He also suggested that the short length of those games allows more players to create a community around them because they've all been able "to engage fully with the entirety of the product."</p><p>The long AAA titles go hand-in-hand with the escalating budgets for video games. Naughty Dog co-founder Andy Gavin recently revealed that one of the reasons <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-founder-reveals-budgets-of-original-games-and-why-they-sold-to-sony/1100-6528634/" data-ref-id="1100-6528634">he agreed to sell his company to Sony</a> was to prevent the massive development costs from sinking everything he and his team had built prior to 2001. Those rising expenses also contributed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">to the devastating job losses</a> in the video game industry last year.</p>

                <p>What happens when you install nearly every <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> Classic add-on all at once? A cacophony of nonsensical sounds, the most cluttered interface imaginable, and, ultimately, the game ceasing to function entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">User-made add-ons are a big part of WoW, enabling players to customize their UI and tailor their experience how they like. WoW Classic, in particular, benefits greatly from add-ons, adding quality-of-life features that make playing the old-school version of Blizzard's MMORPG more manageable.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRbVTm-VDdc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cRbVTm-VDdc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There are over 3,800 WoW Classic add-ons available for download on Curseforge, a website and app many WoW players use to manage their add-ons. Recently, one user by the name <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BALTOBOULBOBBI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baltoboulbobbi</a> <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/what-happens-if-you-install-every-wow-classic-addon-358339" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">(via Wowhead)</a> took it on themselves to see what exactly would happen if they tried to play the game with every add-on installed all at the same time. The brave soul installed 3,703 WoW Classic add-ons all at once and documented their experience in a seven minute video that is equal parts hilarious and existential nightmare. Some add-ons had to be immediately disabled due to them pushing Baltoboulbobbi over their 16GB RAM limit, while others had to be turned off as they prevented the game from running entirely. That left them with 3,683 add-ons running at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr">Things instantly get out of hand. Immediately upon logging in, they first attempt to click out of as many windows obstructing their view as possible, only to discover over 100 add-ons in the middle of the screen that can't be removed. Much of the screen is occupied by various menus, health bars, and charts. Nearly every action they take is accompanied by random sounds, ranging from farts, quotes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Shobek" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WoW Classic streamer Shobek</a>, or cries of "Finish Him!" ripped Mortal Kombat. Leveling up is even more outrageous. Overall, Baltoboulbobbi is able to level up a few times and complete a few quests before the game crashes, putting an end to the ambitious experiment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4423239-wowclassicalladdonsinstalled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423239" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4423239-wowclassicalladdonsinstalled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423239"></a><figcaption>A glimpse at Baltoboulbobbi's user interface upon booting up WoW Classic with 3,683 add-ons running.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4423239-wowclassicalladdonsinstalled.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the comments, Baltoboulbobbi pledged to attempt to do a 1-60 leveling challenge on WoW Classic's Hardcore permadeath server with all add-ons installed if their video eclipsed more than 20,000 views. The video has now been viewed more than 100,000 times, and Baltoboulbobbi has made good on their promise, having done several live streamed sessions of them attempting the feat so far.</p><p dir="ltr">What's even scarier is that while Baltoboulbobbi nearly installed every WoW Classic add-on available, there are far, far more add-ons available for download for the modern version of WoW. According to CurseForge, there are over 10,000 add-ons for WoW's current The War Within expansion, and one shutters at the thought of what would happen were someone to try and run them all at once.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-is-finally-getting-fresh-servers-as-cataclysm-players-move-to-pandaria/1100-6527720/" data-ref-id="1100-6527720">WoW Classic recently received fresh servers in celebration of the game's 20th anniversary</a>. Blizzard also announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">player housing will finally be coming to WoW alongside the game's Midnight expansion</a>, though the expansion sadly doesn't yet have a release date.</p>

Yes, it’s an excellent platformer in its own right, but it’s also tugging on the heartstrings of everyone who’s ever owned a PlayStation console. While you run, jump, climb, and skate through <em>Astro Bot</em>’s many planets, you find robotic versions of characters from throughout PlayStation’s history. This collectathon is at the core of every platforming challenge you navigate, and you likely have memories associated with at least a handful of the bots you rescue if you’ve ever played a PlayStation-exclusive game. </p><p>Nothing quite beats finding your favorites scattered across the galaxy. Rescuing Sly Cooper from a jail cell, where he’s presumably been placed for his kleptomaniac crimes; playing as a robotic version of <em>God of War</em>’s Kratos; and seeing Joel from <em>The Last of Us </em>labeled as a “Dependable Smuggler” who “tells the occasional white lie” are the kind of referential bits that makes <em>Astro Bot </em>delightful. </p></div></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-review-1851496575&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-review-1851496575"><em>Hades 2</em></a></span> keeps its predecessor’s stylish reimagining of Greek mythology going with a boss fight against Scylla and the Sirens. Portrayed as a rock band who fight with their music, the Scylla and the Sirens boss fight is a challenging battle and an impressive display of sound design. The music correlates with the attacks the Sirens use, and if you take one out, their instrument will disappear from the backing track. Each foe you take down strips the song of its violent texture until all that’s left is deafening silence. <em>Hades 2 </em>is still in Early Access, and if the rest of the game is on the level of the Scylla fight, Supergiant has another hit on its hands.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s</a></span> best moments are hidden and completely optional. That includes a conversation with Mythal, an elven god who has become an important figure in the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe ever since the series dove into elven history in 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. The opportunity to reach Mythal in <em>The Veilguard </em>is buried under a collectathon, multiple sidequests, and a few group therapy sessions as your party unpacks some massive lore bombs. By the time you actually reach her, it’s made very clear that you’re unraveling the very fabric of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, and you’d best tread lightly.</p><p>Mythal can either be a willing ally or a begrudging asset by the end of your conversation with her. You can gain her favor in multiple different ways depending on your character’s background and what they’ve accomplished in their journey thus far. I’ve yet to talk to two people who recruited her in the same way, and it’s one of the few examples in <em>The Veilguard </em>that’s evocative of <em>Origins</em>’ persuasion checks. <em>The Veilguard </em>is full of memorable choices, quests, and characters, but in its dash to a more streamlined, <em>Mass Effect</em>-style RPG, it lacks the complex dialogue trees of the series’ roots. So when you get a conversation as impactful as the one with Mythal, it stays with you. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="09a4dcf26c04481f992bb57b55c251d9" data-recommend-id="image://09a4dcf26c04481f992bb57b55c251d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="868" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones is shown holding a brush." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones is shown holding a brush." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="09a4dcf26c04481f992bb57b55c251d9" data-recommend-id="image://09a4dcf26c04481f992bb57b55c251d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="868" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones is shown holding a brush." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Hitting a Nazi in any context is a good moment worth spotlighting, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a></span><em> </em>lets you do it multiple times with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">myriad of items at your disposal</a></span>.

A few dozen hours before you reach the end of the game, you learn that the protagonist you’ve been playing is essentially a character the prince envisioned and made corporeal. He is a projection of the hero the prince wants to see fight for a better world made real. Many hours later, you learn that More, the enigmatic guide who has helped you throughout your journey, is the physical manifestation of the king’s own hope, but turned to nihilism, escaping into a fictional paradise that sure does look like a modern-day Tokyo.</p><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>gradually works its way to this moment. The game uses its fantasy world as a mirror to ours to illustrate that escaping into a fictional world where things are better is a defeatist mindset. People use escapism to survive, but it means they will leave the world outside their window behind. The Tokyo reveal is the end stage of escapism. Someone who once had the power to steer the world in the right direction decided to instead bury himself in a world where the work was already done and he never had to fight for anything. <em>Metaphor</em>’s story of collective action can’t end until our hero has stared into the fictional utopia he’s been aspiring to create and still decided to go back to reality and fight for a better future. It is a poignant, haunting moment masquerading as the sight of a mundane, modern-day metropolis. More’s imagined world is possible, but only if we make the effort to reach it. And defying his easy answer is when <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>truly gets to the meat of what it’s trying to say.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="112a0c9d231e34ea4254e21280ba8891" data-recommend-id="image://112a0c9d231e34ea4254e21280ba8891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1284" data-height="717" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Pokemon TCGP shows a Pikachu card, Wigglytuff card, and three Misty cards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Pokemon TCGP shows a Pikachu card, Wigglytuff card, and three Misty cards." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="112a0c9d231e34ea4254e21280ba8891" data-recommend-id="image://112a0c9d231e34ea4254e21280ba8891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1284" data-height="717" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Pokemon TCGP shows a Pikachu card, Wigglytuff card, and three Misty cards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</em> can be a deflating drag if you’re not paying money for it. Every day I was opening packs and usually feeling like I was getting junk pulls compared to the cards all my friends were scoring. Then, I got my first “God Pack.” These are booster packs that include nothing but rare cards. Admittedly, my first one was a bit disappointing because it had a threepeat of the same rare Misty card, but it also came with a full-art Pikachu card I had been looking for since launch. If I were weaker-willed this would have activated something in me and made me a sicko for cracking daily packs in hopes of finding another pack of this nature. But it had the opposite effect. It gave me the card I was looking for. So I comfortably closed the app and haven’t looked at it in weeks. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-recommend-id="image://117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Curly is shown looking at the screen with an emergency warning in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Curly is shown looking at the screen with an emergency warning in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wrong Organ</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-recommend-id="image://117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Curly is shown looking at the screen with an emergency warning in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For a game that is light on the whole gameplay thing, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><em>Mouthwashing</em></a></span> makes the most of its simplicity with some memorable moments. Giving painkillers to Curly, the captain of your crashed spaceship who was burnt beyond recognition when the freighter went down, is one such moment in Wrong Organ’s horror game. <em>Mouthwashing </em>has you painstakingly open his bandaged mouth as his one eye stares at you, then push the pills down his throat with all the awful sounds that come with it. The first time you do it, it’s incredibly unnerving, and with each subsequent time you do it, you start to become desensitized to it. It’s just a routine thing to do as you explore the ship and unwrap the mysteries of what happened here. But when those mysteries are exposed like the burns underneath Curly’s bandages, force-feeding him those pills takes on new meaning. There’s a lot of horrifying shit that happens in <em>Mouthwashing</em>, and the sounds Curly makes as you force him to swallow some pills aren’t even close to the worst of it, but they sure set the tone for how hard the rest of the game is to stomach.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you first boot up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-review-ps5-1851349573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-review-ps5-1851349573"><em>Dragon’s Dogma II</em></a></span>, you might think you accidentally turned on the wrong game.

As you reach the final chapters of Sunset Visitor’s adventure game, you’ve learned some harrowing truths about the science fiction world inhabited by clones, but those truths are weapons wielded by those in power. In most stories, if your player character were to die, presumably any truths they’d uncovered would die with them. But in <em>1000xRESIST</em>, memories and information are not tied to one person, as everyone can live through each other’s past via VR communions. <em>1000xRESIST</em> puts its protagonist, the Watcher, through hell as she fights to free her sisters from the forces that have kept them subservient for their entire lives. She gives her life to be a revolutionary spark of inspiration for someone else to follow. Sometimes that’s all any of us get to be. We’re a catalyst for someone else’s growth that pushes them to fight. Even if someone is gone, their impact and, in the case of <em>1000xRESIST</em>, their memories, persist, even as someone else takes the reins. “There is a you...That remains and remains.”</p></div><div><p>In the age of TikTok and Twitter, everyone is hoping to get a viral clip of them and their friends doing some wild shit. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/content-warning-impressions-1851407637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/content-warning-impressions-1851407637"><em>Content Warning</em></a></span><em> </em>is that feeling turned into video game form.

You have to enter a code to get the ball rolling, pressing your d-pad in a specific sequence you’d never pull off by accident. It’s a small detail that adds to the weight of what you’re doing as you set this bomb up to annihilate enemy forces. After you’ve punched in the code, you’ve gotta run out of the blast zone, and every second between activation and explosion feels like a full minute. Then, the bomb goes off and you level an entire area.

But one of the best  is when the gun-toting raccoon Rocket and his sentient tree best friend Groot are on the same team. The dynamic duo team up with Rocket riding on Groot’s shoulder, which looks cool and nets them a passive damage reduction perk.

You then play as a young Aerith pleading with uncaring adults in Midgar as she tries to find help, only to see her break down again as she realizes she’s powerless to change things. <em>Final Fantasy </em>grounds so much of its fantasy in raw human emotion, and <em>Rebirth</em> loses all sense of that in a convoluted multiverse play. But as you reach the end, it’s nice to look back at one of the most memorable scenes in the game and remember that when <em>Final Fantasy </em>stays grounded in those feelings, it fucking hits. </p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Balatro</em></a></span>, the poker-based roguelike that took everybody by surprise in 2024, is known for being habit-forming, and there’s nothing that forms habits in video games quite like numbers going up. But what if when your numbers went up you also saw the UI catch on fire? That’s the itch <em>Balatro </em>scratches when you have a hand good enough to overcome a challenge, even as it’s still calculating your cards’ value. Seeing the fire ignite on the screen means you can already start celebrating, and it’s an instant hit of dopamine. </p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indika-steam-pc-nun-narrative-adventure-1851669861&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indika-steam-pc-nun-narrative-adventure-1851669861" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>Indika</em></a></span>, an adventure game following a nun’s integration into the church while she also has some kind of connection to the Devil himself, often deploys mundanity to great effect. One of the game’s most memorable moments has very little to do with the church or God. There’s a segment when Indika is asked to fetch pails of water. This means walking back and forth through cold slush as you slowly lower a bucket down a well, dragging it to a barrel, and doing it all over again until it’s full.</p><p>Once you do that, another nun in the monastery just walks outside and dumps the barrel onto the ground. The entire process can take around 10 minutes, and all your hard work gets tossed aside in a matter of seconds. Plenty of games waste your time through poor design decisions or intentionally obtuse grinding, but <em>Indika</em> makes you do something incredibly monotonous, then spits in your face as a reminder of your place in its world. It is maddening and mean-spirited, and when all is said and done, all you can do is laugh. Or cry.</p><hr><p>Those are just a handful of memorable moments we loved in games in 2024.

<p>AMD has officially unveiled its new Ryzen 9000 CPUs during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJoaV5NnPtw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">its press event</a> at CES 2025 in Las Vegas.</p>



<p>AMD started with the reveal of the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D processors. Starting with the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, the high-end CPU features 16 cores with 32 threads. It also features up to 144MB in total cache thanks to 3D V-cache boosted CCDs (Core Chiplet Dies). Breaking the cache down, it’s 64MB Zen 5 CCDs and 64GB from X3D. There’s also 16mb L2 cache for the 144MB total. For everything it includes, the CPU carries a TDP of 170W.</p>



<p>The 9900X3D CPU comes in with a little less power, but not by much. The processor comes with 12 cores and 24 threads with 140MB of total cache and a 5.5GHz max clock speed. It has a TDP of 140W. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Ryzen 9 9950X3D</th><th>Ryzen 9 9900X3D</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cores</td><td>16</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Threads</td><td>32</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Max Boost</td><td>5.7GHz</td><td>5.5GHz</td></tr><tr><td>Total Cache</td><td>144MB</td><td>140MB</td></tr><tr><td>TDP</td><td>170W</td><td>140W</td></tr><tr><td>Release Date</td><td>Q1 2025</td><td>Q1 2025</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>TBA</td><td>TBA</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As far as performance is concerned, AMD says the new cards are up to 8% faster — on average — than the Ryzen 9 7950X3D. Some games like Black Myth Wukong only saw a  1% performance increase. Games like Counter-Strike 2, however, saw a 58% jump.</p>



<p>When comparing to Intel’s latest Core Ultra 285K CPU, AMD says the Ryzen 9950X3D sees an average performance increase of 20% at 1080p on high settings. Games like Final Fantasy 14, FarCry 6, and Watch Dogs: Legion were over 40% faster per AMD. Black Myth Wukong saw performance around the same while Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora performed slightly better.</p>



<p>Both of the new CPUs are scheduled to launch in March. An exact release date along with final pricing will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Intel isn’t leaving the discrete graphics card market anytime soon. During the company’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwYUiSXDZ5A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CES 2025 keynote</a> on Monday, Intel’s new co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus said that the company remains “committed” to the market moving forward.</p>



<p>“I get this question a lot,” Holthaus said. “We are very committed to the discrete graphics market, and we will continue to make strategic investments in this direction.”</p>



<p>Intel launched its latest Arc Battlemage graphics card, the B580, last month for $249. The entry-level card features 20 Xe2 cores, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM, and a 192-bit memory bus. The next Battlemage card, the B570, is scheduled to launch on January 16. That card will cost $219 and feature 10GB of GDDR6 VRAM and 18 Xe2 cores. </p>



<p>In addition to the new Battlemage cards, Intel is working on the next-gen Celestial and Druid cards. Those, however, are still years away. Intel has made it clear their goal isn’t to contend with cards like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 and 5090. Instead, they want to give budget conscious PC users more options.</p>



<p>What do you think of Intel continuing on with graphics cards? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/tech.9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
