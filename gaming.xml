            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Usually Ubisoft is delaying <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674">its upcoming games</a>. Sometimes it delays <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/assassins-creed-valhallas-first-expansion-is-delayed-by-a-couple-of-weeks/">big updates to ones that are already out</a>. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen it delay its official quarterly earnings report and certainly not minutes after it was already due to be released. Did someone accidentally delete a spreadsheet or is the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> publisher getting ready to break some major news?</p> <p>Like every other publicly traded video game company, Ubisoft regularly releases quarterly updates on its financials and takes questions from investors and analysts on an earnings call. The latest round was supposed to go live today around 12:00 p.m. ET only it didn’t. Instead, minutes passed with no update as people prepared to join the conference call that’s traditionally helmed by CEO and cofounder Yves Guillemot.</p>

 <p>Then Ubisoft released its weirdest emergency press release ever. “Ubisoft announces the postponement of the release of its results for the first half of fiscal year 2025-26,” <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2A1sQVfdyeqe6FVBzu564u/1210887eef5e1047803696e934f993f0/Ubisoft_press_release_13_11_2025_EN_vF.pdf">it read</a>. “Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares (FR0000054470) and its bonds (FR001400DV38, FR001400MA32, and FR0014000O87) from the market opening on November 14, 2025, until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days. Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.”</p>

 <p>That’s a big last-minute change with no clear details on when things will be back to normal.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, this could imply an acquisition of sorts. Could also imply some accounting / financial issue. </p> <p>Just remember to freak the fuck out for the next few days and speculate as much as possible until they announce something.</p> <p>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1989023907932717437?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Unclear why at this point but could indicate a major announcement related to the company,” wrote Niko Partners research director Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1989019828938764642">on X</a>. He noted that this could be a prelude to some big acquisition announcement, or it could signal a financial or accounting issue that requires extra time to address before accurate data can be supplied to the public.</p>

 <p>It might be easier to assume the latter if not for what a weird time this is in general for Ubisoft. The long-time publisher recently entered into <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796">a $1.25 billion bailout</a> with Chinese conglomerate Tencent. It used that money to spin off a new entity run by the CEO’s son. After a slew of recent delays, there are no major new blockbuster releases for the company on the immediate horizon. The stock price is at its lowest point in over a decade.</p>

 <p>It certainly wouldn’t be shocking if Tencent, another big game company, or a “consortium” of various other investors used this opportunity to swoop in and try to buy the struggling publisher, or at least some big chunks of it. With its most lucrative franchises—<em>Assassin’s Creed</em>,<em> Far Cry</em>, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>—all snugly nestled within a new subsidiary called Vantage Studios, Ubisoft is trying to find a way to offload other big chunks to outside groups. Anybody interested in <em>Splinter Cell</em> or <em>Prince of Persia</em>?</p> <p>The company recently announced voluntary layoffs across its Swedish studios, which include Massive, the lead studio on <em>The Division</em> franchise. With Activision Blizzard gobbled up by Microsoft and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">EA sold to Saudi Arabia</a>, who can say what will happen next? I just hope <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744"><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em></a> somehow survives.</p>

    <article>
      <p>In late October, Krafton–publisher of games like <em>PUBG</em>, <em>inZOI</em>,<em> </em>and the <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/subnautica-2/"><u>embattled</u></a> <em>Subnautica 2–</em>announced it would be going “<a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>AI first</u></a>,” an increasingly common buzzword for companies looking to get in on the AI boom before it goes bust. You’ll never believe this, but that move involves people losing their jobs.</p><p>Krafton said its pivot to AI would involve a “complete reorganization of the company's operational development system, placing AI at the center of problem solving,” according to a machine translation of its Korean announcement. The move also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-to-undergo-complete-reorganization-as-it-positions-itself-as-an-ai-first-company?ref=aftermath.site"><u>included</u></a> a $69.7 million investment in a GPU cluster, and an additional $20.8 million to support employees in “directly utilizing and applying various AI tools to their work.”&nbsp;</p><p>In early November, Krafton <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-04/gaming-pioneer-krafton-freezes-hiring-during-major-ai-push?ref=aftermath.site"><u>instituted a hiring freeze</u></a>, though this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation?ref=aftermath.site"><u>excluded</u></a> departments working on original IP or AI. Krafton CEO Bae Dong-geu <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-krafton-offers-voluntary-resignations-following-ai-first-investment/1100-6536185/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>said</u></a> at the time that “rather than reducing costs through AI First, individual productivity must increase at the company-wide level.” Well yeah, that makes sense; your company invests in the hot new tech that its creators keep promising will revolutionize your work, so <em>of course</em> you need to work harder to help it get there.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, <a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Business Korea</u></a> (as spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>) reported that the company has “begun offering resignation support to all employees.” Business Korea writes that the resignations would be voluntary, with severance based on years of employment.&nbsp;</p><p>A Krafton rep told Business Korea:</p><blockquote>The core purpose [of the reduction] is to support members in proactively designing their growth direction and embarking on new challenges both inside and outside the company amid the era of AI transformation… [T]he company plans to support members in autonomously deciding whether to continue the direction of change internally or expand externally.</blockquote><p>This is some spectacular business bullshit language. Framing those unwilling to turn their current jobs into whatever bastardized version of them would exist at an “AI first” company, or who cannot or will not bow to these increased productivity demands, as “embarking” or “expanding” on new “external” challenges is a great way to put the rug-pulling onus on employees rather than the company. And while I can appreciate buyouts as an alternative to <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-ai?ref=aftermath.site"><u>layoffs</u></a>, this “if you don’t like it, there’s the door” inherently acknowledges that Krafton is making a move it knows will be unpopular with its employees–you know, the people who did the work that <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-records-quarterly-revenue-of-krw-870-6-billion-in-q3-2025/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>gave Krafton</u></a> “record-high cumulative performance in the third quarter” of this year.</p><p>But all of this is simply how <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney/"><u>AI is manifesting in the real working world</u></a>, from <a href="https://aftermath.site/duolingo-ai/"><u>Duolingo</u></a> to <a href="https://x.com/BenMullin/status/1943049108064993285?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>The Washington Post</u></a> to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/youtube-offers-voluntary-buyouts-as-company-reorganizes-around-ai.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>YouTube</u></a> and beyond. If AI doesn’t outright replace your job–or, more accurately, if your boss doesn’t decide to try to replace you with AI whether or not AI can actually do your job–then its <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-is-the-ultimate-forced-meme/"><u>inclusion</u></a> turns your job into something unrecognizable. At which point, maybe seeing yourself out is a better option, though in this current age of tech layoffs probably doesn’t feel nearly as sunny as “embarking on external challenges” makes it sound.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, we’re all still waiting on that <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/the-gentle-singularity?ref=aftermath.site"><u>AI-powered utopia</u></a> Sam Altman and his ilk are promising while their software is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/us/openai-chatgpt-suicide-lawsuit-invs-vis?ref=aftermath.site"><u>convincing people</u></a> to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-suffering-chatgpt/"><u>kill themselves</u></a>. Everything is going great!&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The survival game Solarpunk has been delayed to 2026, developer Cyberwave has announced. The team has decided to the delay Solarpunk as more development time is needed to address improvements and stability for the multiplayer side of the game. Other improvements revolve around Solarpunk’s inventory system, the piloting of airships, and improved performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Solarpunk - Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qy41Qv7Ut14?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Cyberwave detailed the improvements it is working on for Solapunk and those are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Inventory management:</b>&nbsp;Players really want “craft from storage,” sorting options, and bigger stack sizes.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Airship controls:&nbsp;</b>Some found flying a bit too sensitive and wished for an autopilot option for long trips.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Early-game pacing:</b>&nbsp;Cotton grows too slowly and tools break too fast, making the early hours grindy.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Late-game goals:&nbsp;</b>Players want more content, quests, and reasons to keep exploring.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Performance:</b>&nbsp;Thunderstorms caused FPS drops and lightning bugs that sometimes hit players unfairly.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Animal systems:&nbsp;</b>Some pathfinding issues caused animals to get stuck and stop producing.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Controller support:</b>&nbsp;Needs more polish to fully support controller and Steam Deck play.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Tutorials:</b>&nbsp;Players asked for clearer explanations for systems like electricity and crop sheltering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ahead of Solarpunk’s release, there will be a multiplayer playtest in which players can work together co-operatively. Cyberwave will be gradually increasing the number of co-op players allowed into the playtest once it goes live, and a date is yet to be given for the multiplayer playtest. Following that playtest, Cyberwave will go and address other bugs and issues that get raised by players so Solarpunk can be properly polished ahead of its release. A release window is not yet confirmed.</p>

			<p><strong>Update 13/11/2025:</strong> A report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cfo-internal-memo/">Insider-Gaming</a> includes an internal email from the chief financial officer at Ubisoft, Frederick Duguet, who claims that the stoppage of trading was done "<em>to limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay</em>."</p>



<p>Here's the full email, per Insider-Gaming: </p>



<p>"<em>Hello everyone</em>,</p>



<p><em>I wanted to let you know that we are taking extra time to finalize the closing of the semester, and as a result we will publish our first-half earnings results in the coming days instead of tonight.</em></p>



<p><em>Due to legal regulations, we cannot share more information with you at this time. To limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay, we have asked Euronext to suspend the trading of our stock until the results are announced. We know this is likely to raise questions and drive media coverage. I encourage you all to listen to the conference call – which will be available via the Investor section of our site — just after the results are released so that you have a more detailed view of our earnings.</em></p>



<div><p><em>Thanks for your understanding.</em></p><p><em>Fred</em>"</p></div>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Suddenly, and just 15 minutes before the financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year were meant to go live, Ubisoft not only <a href="https://live.euronext.com/en/product/equities/FR0000054470-XPAR#CompanyPressRelease-12847243">delayed the release of its results but also halted the trading of its shares and bonds</a> ahead of the market opening tomorrow on November 14, 2025.</p>



<p>There's been no comment from Ubisoft explaining the delay or why it stopped trading its shares and bonds, but such a sudden stoppage and delay don't exactly indicate that everything is smooth sailing at the company. What it does indicate is that there's likely something major going on within the company right now, potentially something as major as an acquisition.</p>



<p><em>Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares (FR0000054470) and its bonds (FR001400DV38, FR001400MA32, and FR0014000O87) from the market opening on November 14, 2025, until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days</em>," the company said in a statement. "<em>Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.</em>"</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ubisoft just postponed its earnings report and halted the trading of its shares. Unclear why at this point but could indicate a major announcement related to the company. <a href="https://t.co/MRhTNYykIZ">pic.twitter.com/MRhTNYykIZ</a></p>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1989019828938764642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's no secret that Ubisoft has had a turbulent few years. Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">several instances</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">layoffs at the company</a>, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-producer-leaves-ubisoft-and-game-industry-after-xdefiant-servers-shut-down/">had a few </a>of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-sequel-recently-canceled-rumor-ubisoft/">big titles in recent years</a> result in <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-5-million-players-ubisoft-lower-performance/">big commercial misses</a>, with its one saving grace <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-europes-best-selling-new-game-2025/">being the success of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. </p>



<p>The new subsidiary that it opened alongside Tencent, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">officially called Vantage Studios,</a> is seemingly a result of its commercial woes, since it included a major investment from Tencent, and, specifically for the company's chief executive officer, Yves Guillemot, allowed the Guillemot family to retain control of the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disgruntled-ubisoft-investor-calls-on-assassins-creed-maker-to-go-private-as-shares-slump">and held off calls for the company to go private</a>.</p>



<p>But those calls might not have been held off for long, since this sudden delay could very well be due to Ubisoft getting set to announce that it has been acquired, either by Tencent or by another large entity. We know that there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">discussions about a Ubisoft buyout</a> following the struggles it has had recently, and now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">EA has begun that process with the Saudi Arabia PIF and the Consortium</a> of private equity investors, it could have been that Ubisoft shareholders used EA's purchase as fuel to campaign for Ubisoft to be acquired.</p>



<p>For now, this is all just speculation, but the sudden nature of the results release being delayed and the stoppage of trading, on top of everything else that has been going on with Ubisoft in the last few years, point to a major shift in the company due to be announced within the coming days. Or it could be nothing, we'll see.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/over-200-rockstar-employees-demand-reinstatement-of-fired-staffers.1353019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More than 200 Rockstar employees have signed a letter demanding that a number of colleagues recently fired for "misconduct" be reinstated, alleging union-busting.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, the letter requests the reinstatement of over 30 Rockstar employees who were let go from the company recently. All of the employees were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6" rel="nofollow">involved in union activity</a>, leading Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) organizer Fred Carter to call the dismissals an "act of union-busting unprecedented in the games industry".</p>

<p>An anonymous employee, who was one of those recently fired, told Eurogamer that the firings constitute "a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting", and that it's "heartwarming" to see colleagues supporting them and "holding management to account".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-employee-letter.jpg?itok=1sM_rcRP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-employee-letter.jpg?itok=ux2hypHU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hundreds of Rockstar employees have demanded the reinstatement of several recently-fired colleagues.</figcaption></figure><p>Rockstar and parent company Take-Two's side of things is that the employees were fired for "misconduct"; the two studios suggest that the employees in question were involved in leaking key information about the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-november-2026" rel="nofollow">recently-delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, a claim that the IWGB disputes enough to hit Rockstar <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-issues-legal-claims-against-rockstar-over-unfair-dismissal-of-staff/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">with a legal complaint</a>.</p>

<p>The news comes after the aforementioned delay to&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>, which is the second time the game has been pushed back; it was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">slated for a May release</a>, but was delayed in order to give Rockstar more time to work on it.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>does eventually launch, it's likely to break sales records across the industry; Take-Two says the game will constitute an "unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience", and some investors are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-will-clear-7-6-billion-in-first-60-days-investment-firm-predicts/1100-6533204/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">predicting</a> revenues upwards of $7 billion within the first two months of release.</p>

<p>Whether that figure is accurate or not, it's likely that&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>will surpass its predecessor in sales and revenue terms, and since&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-will-clear-7-6-billion-in-first-60-days-investment-firm-predicts/1100-6533204/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earned</a> $800 million in its first day,&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>is going to be massive.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see what comes of these Rockstar employees' demands. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Many Nintendo Switch 2 owners who use third-party docks were in for a rude surprise after updating their consoles earlier this week to the latest firmware. It seems the Switch 2 is no longer compatible with these devices, leaving many players frustrated and fearful of the future.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-system-update-2100-available-here-are-the-patch-notes">On November 11, Nintendo released Switch 2 update 21.0.0</a>, which added some nice quality-of-life features, including the ability to turn off autoplaying videos in the eShop and some helpful tweaks to GameChat and new icons that indicate if a game is digital or physical. All good stuff. However, not long after the patch, players began reporting that many third-party docks were no longer working with the updated Switch 2.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1ouoalk/some_third_party_switch_2_docks_stopped_working/">On Reddit,</a> <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/507478-nintendo-switch-2/81068963">GameFAQs</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/160110789401691/posts/1089183309827763/">other places online</a>, you can find many, <em>many&nbsp;</em>Switch 2 owners complaining that after the new update, their third-party docks no longer transmit video to their TVs or are now far more finicky and require restarts to function again. “Can confirm my 2nd (3rd party) dock in our living room just stopped working as well right after today’s update. A full power cycle did not fix it for me,” posted one Reddit user. “I finally got around to ordering a dock cable for travel, it arrived today. Plugged it in, happy it worked right out of the box. Launched a game, update alert, update, cable’s borked,” said another Reddit poster. “I’m using the GuileKeys folding dock, and the new update broke compatibility with it. I am not sure if this dock can be updated. I have messaged the seller,” claimed another Redditor.</p>

 <p>YouTuber AustinJohnPlays <a href="https://youtu.be/QrBCQTmb9SU">tested out two different Switch 2 dock dongles</a> and found that once he updated Nintendo’s console, both stopped working.</p>  <p>So it seems clear that this new Switch 2 update did <em>something</em>, and now a ton of third-party docks that worked before are no longer compatible. We’ve known since the Switch 2 launched earlier this year that Nintendo was going to be more restrictive with the Switch 2’s USB-C connection, with <a href="https://nsaneforums.com/news/technology-news/how-nintendo-locked-down-the-switch-2%E2%80%99s-usb-c-port-and-broke-third-party-docking-r30020/">testing showing that it isn’t quite as open and universal as you’d expect</a> from a USB connection. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption">This caused headaches for third-party manufacturers</a>, but they did eventually figure out how to get their docks working with Switch 2’s odd USB-C restrictions. But it now seems like Nintendo has, intentionally or by accident, changed something and, in the process, broken many of these devices.</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Nintendo about the Switch 2 update.</p> <p>Regardless of intent, for many Switch 2 users who relied on a third-party dock for various reasons or who liked having one set up on a second TV, this situation has made them nervous to buy another dock. It also means that if your Switch 2 dock breaks, you have to rely on Nintendo for a new one. Sure, your existing third-party dock might work for a bit, but there’s no telling how long it will be before another Nintendo update bricks it. And in the end, it works out for Nintendo as it means people are forced to buy their dock. That’s not a huge problem in 2025. But in 10 years or so, it could become a hassle.</p>

                <p>Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene, best known for creating the landmark battle royale game PUBG, outlined an ambitious plan for his development studio to produce three ambitious titles, including one that aims to support 100v100-player multiplayer matches.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-creator-brendan-playerunknown-greene-is-planning-a-new-multiplayer-fps" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Greene detailed the roughly 10-year plan for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creators-new-game-sort-of-revealed-at-the-gam/1100-6472202/" data-ref-id="1100-6472202">his studio, which was established in 2019</a> and is simply called PlayerUnknown Productions. The first game from the development team is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creators-three-game-plan-starts-with-a-survival-game-with-millions-of-maps/1100-6528255/" data-ref-id="1100-6528255">Prologue: Go Wayback, a single-player survival roguelike</a> that tasks you with navigating worlds generated through machine-learning technology. It'll be available in early access starting November 20. Greene has stated in the past that he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-thinks-players-will-initially-hate-his-next-game/1100-6529642/" data-ref-id="1100-6529642">expects players to hate the game at first</a>.</p><p>The second planned game from the studio "aims to test limited multiplayer, maybe up to 100 versus 100 players," Greene told Eurogamer. Describing the untitled project as "more of an FPS/RTS mix," the game would test terrain generation, NPC interactions, and network protocols on large scales.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuQvsF_qovw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zuQvsF_qovw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Then, the studio's third game would be a more creative title, taking concepts from the first two games and allowing players to "create their own planets" for various uses, like a player-created FPS game, for example.</p><p>At this time, the second game exists as "general high-level plans," but it will use PlayerUnknown Productions' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_CkGSUzBOE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proprietary engine Melba</a>, which uses machine-learning tools (otherwise known as AI) to create Earth-like planets in real time.</p><p>According to Greene, the studio has "a general idea of how long it will take to get to Game Two" with the expectation of working on it for "another two, three, four years, maybe longer." Greene described the larger three-game project as a 10-year plan.</p><p>Greene has been far removed from PUBG: Battlegrounds for some time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-brendan-greene-leaves-krafton-to-form-new-studio/1100-6495802/" data-ref-id="1100-6495802">leaving PUBG developer Krafton in 2021</a> to focus on his new projects.</p><p>Large-scale multiplayer projects like Greene's proposed title are a rarity these days; battle royales generally have 60 to 120 players on the same map, while modern shooters like Battlefield 6 only support up to 64 players max in a match. Old-school PlayStation 3 players might remember MAG, which supported 128v128 matches, but PlayerUnknown Productions' game certainly has different technical ambitions with its world generation.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft is currently holding a call with its investors, and 15 minutes before the call began, the French company issued a rare delay to the release of its quarterly earnings release and halted trading on its shares, a fairly alarming move that has got some people online wondering what's going on at the publisher.</p>
<p>According to an unexpected November 13 press release, the company has decided to postpone sharing its earnings "until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results." Ubisoft requests that Euronext (a European exchange market) to halt trading until further notice.</p>
<p>The publisher's statement reads:</p>
<blockquote>Ubisoft announces the postponement of the release of its results for the first half of fiscal year 2025-26. Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares (FR0000054470) and its bonds (FR001400DV38, FR001400MA32, and FR0014000O87) from the market opening on November 14, 2025, until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days. Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart. Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.</blockquote>
<p>The suspension will remain in place until the company publishes the delayed results "in the coming days", Ubisoft announced in said in a statement shared with both <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/ubisoft-delays-half-year-results-requests-trading-suspension-2025-11-13/">Reuters</a> and posted online to various social media channels.</p>
<p>The motives for why the company has made this move are currently unclear. Well-known analyst for Nico Partners and online personality, Daniel Ahmad, notes that "this could imply an acquisition of sorts", or "could [...] imply some accounting / financial issue." </p><p>If you're wondering if Ubisoft is doing this because of broader market conditions, it's worth noting that whilst markets are in a downward trend today, it's only by about 1% in tech/financials markets (at time of writing, 6pm on 13th October). The most simple answer? Today’s earnings report is going to be spicy, and is liable to cause a big swing in the price of Ubisoft shares. In the current call, it's possible investors will discover additional info that will have an impact on business decsions they'll want to make.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on this story, and update you when more information reveals itself.</p>

GOTY season is almost upon us, and while Mr. Keighley's big event is staying quiet on its nominees for the time being, other shows are already gearing up to crown a winner.</p>
<p>One such event is the <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/">Indie Game Awards</a>, a developer-focused awards show centred on — you guessed it — indie games, which has today revealed its final award nominees across 18 different categories.</p>
<p>The categories cover everything from 'Achievement in Accessibility', to 'Bite-Sized Game', 'Community Management', to 'Emotional Impact'. The granddaddy of them all, as you might expect, is 'Game of the Year', and this year's nominee list is practically bursting with wonderful entries that you can try on Switch right now.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pjzhsv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

The news broke when prolific video game news hound <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m5jkjanx6k2r">Wario64 found listings</a> for the game on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/red-dead-redemption-netflix/id6743944297">iOS</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.netflix.NGP.Kamo%26pli%3D1" rel="sponsored">Android</a> store.</p><p>And it seems like Netflix isn’t the only one that’ll let you ride horses with John Marsten.

<p>This DLC was announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/euro-truck-simulator-2-is-pining-for-the-fjords-with-a-nordic-expansion">back in January 2024</a>, and as it shuffles out of SCS Software's ever-busy DLC pipeline, it'll leave some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-years-after-teasing-buses-were-coming-to-euro-truck-simulator-2-they-finally-arrive">coaches</a> and a recently revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/euro-truck-simulator-2-is-motoring-off-to-ireland-with-an-expansion-being-worked-on-alongside-a-uk-revamp">trip to Ireland</a> waiting in the traffic queue.

<p>"We can't wait for you to put your truck to work in the breathtaking lands of northern Scandinavia! Dozens of beautifully recreated cities and towns across Norway, Sweden, and Finland are ready to welcome you, with hundreds of depots prepared to receive your deliveries and load your trailer - setting you off on your next unforgettable journey," SCS wrote in their <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/11/nordic-horizons-release-date-video.html">release date announcement blog</a>.</p><p>There are a couple of existing preview videos they've put out if you want a driver's seat view of what to expect from Nordic Horizons' trips. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gILr7wP-2gg">One</a> trucks from a lay-by near the Norwegian city of Tromsø through to the Swedish town of Karesuando, while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qatq90rjQM">the other</a> heads across Norway from Andenes right at the northern tip to Svolvær in the west.</p>
<p>So, there you go. Huge news for fans of the northern lights and big lorries that love chugging along scenic routes on brisk wintery mornings. If you've not already, you can wishlist the DLC on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2780810/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2__Nordic_Horizons/#game_area_purchase">Steam</a> to drop in as soon as it drops. I'll certainly be adding it to my list of things to give a go when I've got some open road.</p>

            <p>Lies Of P publishers Neowiz – gosh, perilously close to writing Lies Of Publishers, there! - have revealed that they have seven PC games in development, including their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/of-course-lies-of-p-is-getting-a-sequel-after-selling-a-million-copies">already announced Lies of P sequel</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>As shared in <a href="https://cdn.neowiz.com/neowiz-site/assets/ir-library/3Q25_NWZ-IR-PPT_EN-itjp3znq.pdf">their latest investor presentation</a>, Neowiz have several PC and console projects listed on a slide intimidatingly labelled “global expansion”. These include a new life sim, a “survival action adventure”, a new soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Kay Lee, creative director of free-to-play MMORPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vindictus">Vindictus</a>, and a narrative-based RPG from Seungho Jin, director for audition show mystery Buried Stars.
</p>
<p>That’s in addition to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfeyes-new-first-person-rpg-is-an-evolution-of-prey-and-dishonored-featuring-mechs-magnets-and-a-continuous-world">the new immersive sim from Weird West developers Wolfeye</a>, and a “noir west CRPG” from Warsaw-based Zakazane Studios. All this plus Lies Of P 2, or whatever they eventually call it. I feel it would have worked out more elegantly if they’d called the first one Lie of P? 
</p>
<p>If you’ve had it up to here with lying peas, and you’re not wowed by any of the strictly hush-hush endeavours above, you might prefer to read about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-game-from-the-lies-of-p-studio-sounds-like-it-might-just-fill-a-dead-space-shaped-hole-in-my-heart">Round 8’s new sci-fi survival horror game</a>. We know nuffink about it, but the thought of the crew behind Git Gud Pinocchio doing a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> seems appetising.

<p>Ubisoft’s Chief Financial Officer, Frederick Duguet, has told staff in an internal email that Ubisoft’s stock has been paused to “limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility” during the short delay of reporting its first-half earnings.</p>



<p>The internal email provided to Insider Gaming reads,</p>







<div><p>“Hello everyone,</p><p>I wanted to let you know that we are taking extra time to finalize the closing of the semester, and as a result we will publish our first-half earnings results in the coming days instead of tonight.</p></div>



<p>Due to legal regulations, we cannot share more information with you at this time. To limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay, we have asked Euronext to suspend the trading of our stock until the results are announced. We know this is likely to raise questions and drive media coverage. I encourage you all to listen to the conference call – which will be available via the Investor section of our site — just after the results are released so that you have a more detailed view of our earnings.</p>



<div><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p><p>Fred”</p></div>



<p><strong>“Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares and its bonds from the market opening on November 14, 2025, until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days,”</strong>&nbsp;the company&nbsp;<a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2A1sQVfdyeqe6FVBzu564u/1210887eef5e1047803696e934f993f0/Ubisoft_press_release_13_11_2025_EN_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in a statement</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for more clarification on the delay and trade halting. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

From Nov. 13, 4 pm PT / 7 pm ET, Walmart will open the floodgates for three Pokémon TCG Special Collection boxes for Walmart+ members.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of preordering new sets, it's next to impossible to find Pokémon TCG products like these at market value, never mind MSRP, so this deal isn't to be missed and is well worth getting a Walmart+ membership for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Selling for $24.99, at MSRP, each box contains eight booster packs and features three foil promo cards that differ depending on the set you pick up: Snorlax ex + Blissey ex, Greninja ex + Kinggra ex, or Incineroar ex + Torterra ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not already a member, it’s admittedly a slight drag that you’ll essentially have to add the membership cost onto the price to pick this up and avoid the eye-waterlingly high resale prices, but needs must. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's $12.95 per month, or you can opt for an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-black-friday-streaming-deal-so-far-is-a-walmart-plus-subscription">annual membership which is half off right now</a>, and down to $49, previously $98.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We are exploring all possible options to protect our intellectual property and future plans."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">VR developer VRWOOD is "exploring all possible options" to protect its IP after claiming that HoYoverse's upcoming Animal Crossing-like game, Petit Planet, bears "striking similarities" to its own game, Little Planet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Little Planet launched on Meta Quest just last week, after releasing in early access back in November of 2023. The game is an Animal Crossing-like VR life sim sandbox where players can craft customizable decorations and customize...well, a little planet, make friends with talking animal neighbors, dress up, play games, fish, and interact online with other players via a multiplayer planet known as the StarNexus.. While developer VRWOOD has acknowledged the game's similarities to Animal Crossing, he's <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/little-planet-free-to-play-vr-life-sim-quest/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said the real inspiration for it</a> was the 1943 French story The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is sort of interesting, VRWOOD pointed out to us, because The Little Prince was exactly what we thought of when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/petit-planet-is-like-animal-crossing-meets-the-little-prince">we previewed Petit Planet last week</a>, having never heard of Little Planet prior. Like Little Planet, Petit Planet is also a life sim sandbox game that takes place on a small planet, features Animal Crossing-like gameplay, animal residents, crafting and customization, and even online features letting you craft and play alongside friends, similarly taking place on a separate multiplayer planet known as the Galactic Bazaar. The biggest difference seems to be a higher budget and Little Planet being a VR game, but VRWOOD told us that it has plans for PC, console, and even mobile releases down the line. Petit Planet is currently announced for PC and mobile. Both games are free-to-play</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most critical, though, is Little Planet's claim that it got here first. Little Planet entered early access in November of 2023 and officially launched just last week, while Petit Planet's trademark was registered in October of 2024, the game itself wasn't announced until this past September, and it isn't yet out. What's more, even though it's out in beta form, it sounds like it may still need some development time, given the reports that the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/petit-planet-beta-impressions-cozy-gaming/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beta still includes AI-generated text</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are disheartened to find that, only days after the release of Little Planet, a major publisher and developer has announced a game with striking similarities ranging from the name, setting, and features to even the stated inspiration," said Frank Zhaung, CEO of VRWOOD and Little Planet creative director. "Little Planet has been available in early access since November 15, 2023, nearly a full year prior to HoYoverse filing a trademark application on October 31, 2024. We are exploring all possible options to protect our intellectual property and future plans, which include releases on mobile devices, as well as PC and console."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to HoYoverse for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

They breathe life into the wind, guide the tides, and spark the fires that sustain the world. Humanity discovered how to enslave them, harnessing their power to fuel modern technology and industry. But forced servitude drove them mad. Corrupted and broken, they turned against the natural order, and the balance of the world began to collapse. Storms now rage unchecked, forests rot, and the planet itself rebels.</p><p>You are one of the rare few chosen by the Ancient Elementals to help restore what has been lost. Bond with these living powers, wield their abilities, and lead the fight to heal a planet on the brink of destruction.</p><p><strong>Bond With Living Powers</strong></p><p>Elementals are not tools.

Each Ancient Elemental you befriend grants a new ability to wield in battle, from searing bolts of flame to barriers of living stone. Lesser spirits, known as Sprites, can then be woven into those abilities, twisting and amplifying their effects. Create an experience that feels entirely your own by finding the perfect pairing between Sprites and Ancients.</p><p>Every fusion changes how you fight. The right pairing might turn a fire blast into a homing inferno or cause a simple strike to erupt in a storm of lightning and ash. With billions of potential combinations, the line between chaos and mastery blurs and the most chaotic combinations often become the most brilliant.</p><p><strong>Fight Alone or Together</strong></p><p>Play solo or with up to three others.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Yesterday’s announcement of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">new living room</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/valve-rejoins-the-vr-hardware-wars-with-standalone-steam-frame/">VR hardware</a> from Valve obviously has many gamers clamoring for any news of a more powerful version of the nearly 4-year-old Steam Deck. In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-says-it-has-a-pretty-good-idea-of-what-steam-deck-2-is-going-to-be-explains-why-its-holding-off-for-now">a new interview with IGN</a>, though, Valve Software Engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais says that portable gaming silicon still hasn’t advanced enough to justify brand-new benchmark hardware.</p>
<p>“The thing we’re making sure of is that it’s a worthwhile enough performance upgrade [for a Steam Deck 2] to make sense as a standalone product,” Griffais told IGN. “We’re not interested in getting to a point where it’s 20 or 30 or even 50 percent more performance at the same battery life. We want something a little bit more demarcated than that.”</p>
<p>“So we’ve been working back from silicon advancements and architectural improvements, and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be, but right now there’s no offerings in that landscape, in the SoC [System on a Chip] landscape, that we think would truly be a next-gen performance Steam Deck,” Griffais continued.</p>
<h2>More power, but at what cost?</h2>
<p>At first glance, Griffais’ comments might seem to run counter to the advancements we’ve seen in portable PC gaming handhelds in recent years. The eight-core Zen 5-based AMD chip in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/rog-xbox-ally-x-the-ars-technica-review/">the recently launched ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, for instance, is significantly more powerful than the four-core Zen 2 chip in the Steam Deck. The newer handheld can push out decent-quality 1080p graphics at reasonable frame rates for many recent games that the old Steam Deck struggles to run at all.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, though, that Griffais said Valve is focused on getting those kinds of performance improvements “at the same battery life.” The ROG Xbox Ally X has a 50 percent larger battery than the original Steam Deck, and it still fully drains that battery in around two hours when running the most taxing games in “Turbo” mode.</p>

            <p>The on-going situation between Rockstar and 31 dismissed employees is such a big deal, it's finally made its way to a session in the House of Commons. The issue was brought to Parliament by Christine Jardine, Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Edinburgh West.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cajardinemp.bsky.social/post/3m5jgfa3dis2m">In a social post</a>, Jardine noted: "Video game giant Rockstar has sacked more than 30 workers across the UK, including my constituents working at their Edinburgh office. I urged Ministers to support workers who have lost their jobs, and stop this from happening again."</p>
<p>You can see her comments to the assembly of politicans below:</p>

</span></p><p>"I declare an interest because I have an employee who works for the company I'm about to mention, though they are not affected by the actions taken," Jardine said in the session. "That company is video game company Rockstar, who's fired at least 30 employees across its UK studios, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a> in Edinburgh. Several of my consituents have been affected, and some came to see me last week to express concerns. They claim they have been sacked because they were trying to unionise, and were discussing working conditions in private. But Rockstar has accused them of distributing confidnetial information, and sacked them for gross misconduct. I have written to Rockstar and asked for information on the issue, but I wondered if I can have a meeting with the relevant minister to discuss what steps can be taken to support [the affected employees]."
</p>
<p>The issue is being raised with ministers, and Jardine appears to be awaiting a meeting with those in charge to see what actions - if any - can be taken by government representatives in the coming days.</p>
<p>Rockstar claimed it fired the staffers for "gross misconduct", a statement which was later clarified to accuse the workers of sharing confidential info outside of the company. UK union the IWGB, of which the fired staff were members, have accused Rockstar of union busting and filed legal claims against the company. 
</p><p>This is just the most recent update in the on-going saga surrounding Rockstar and the 31 workers fired recently by the company. Earlier today, we heard about over 200 staff at Rockstar North who have signed a letter to management <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">calling for the "immediate reinstatement" the affected workers</a>.</p>
<p>"It's heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account – during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss’s door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down," said an anonymous member of the fired Rockstar staff in the union's press release. "It's clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out."</p>
<p>Rockstar has been in the news a lot lately. Aside from the on-goiong situation with the 31 affected members of staff, it also announced a delay to the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, moving the game from May of next year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">into November</a>. Publisher Take-Two said the most recent GTA 6 delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve". It added "Rockstar has our full support of course", and that the Take-Two team is "confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience".</p>
