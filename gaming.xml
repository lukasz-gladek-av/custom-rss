            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In most extraction shooters, as well as a number of online survival games, players are all-too-familiar with the necessary evil known as a global wipe, in which everyone’s inventory and stats get reset to start all players off again on the same footing. It can sting a bit, but it helps balance out the game for newcomers, as folks who’ve been playing for years could otherwise build up a virtually limitless stockpile of goodies to maintain supremacy. Upcoming PvPvE extraction shooter <i>Arc Raiders</i>, however, has some different ideas on how to implement this in a way that won’t cost everyone their precious, hard-won loot.</p> <p>In particular, the developers are trying to solve one of the biggest problems with mandatory wipes: It’s really unfair to those who only have limited windows of opportunity to play the game. It sucks when you log a few hours in one week, get tied up with life stuff for the remainder of a month, then come back to find out even the meager earnings you scored during that first week are now gone due to the wipe. <i>Arc Raiders </i>developer Embark is aiming to solve that.</p>

 <p>In a blog post titled “<a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/">Expedition Project</a>,” <i>Arc Raiders’</i> design director Virgil said that the studio “absolutely [sees] the benefits a global wipe provides [but] one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall.”</p>

 <p>Enter “Projects,” a feature that unlocks after level 20 with a scheduled eight-week window to complete, after which you’ll unlock the ability to reset your character. Should you fail to finish your project within the eight-week window, you can hold on to all of the progress you made, including your gear. You can then continue your progress during the next eight-week period that opens up.</p>

Hopefully <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Projects will solve that dilemma.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Up until now, every character confirmed to appear in Invincible Vs--the 3v3 tag fighter starring characters from Skybound's Invincible series--has been a souped-up superhero. Today, at New York Comic Con, Skybound and developer Quarter Up changed that, as Global Defense Agency head Cecil Stedman has officially been added to the playable roster.</p><p dir="ltr">Designing a human character to fight against superhuman opponents on the level of Omni-Man and Invincible requires a change of approach. GameSpot sat down with Robert Kirkman, creator of Invincible, and multiple members of the dev team at Quarter Up to speak about the process of bringing Cecil and his unique abilities to the game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Invincible VS. - Cecil Stedman Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">"Only" human</h2><p dir="ltr">As a "normal" human among superheroes, Cecil relies less on superior strength and speed, and more on the vast resources of his government agency to provide extra firepower. This idea was key to Cecil's appearance in Invincible Vs, as it's those resources that make him a very formidable foe.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm not saying he has endless funds, but he's using a lot of taxpayer money to get around," executive producer Mike Willette said. "He can jump around and teleport because, while he's just a regular guy and doesn't have the mobility of double jumps and flight like other characters, with government funds, he can get around just fine."</p><p dir="ltr">That movement allows Cecil to manipulate the arena to his advantage, which Willette says plays into the character's role as a master manipulator. "He has projectiles with ranged arcs, he has a sonic mine that will hover before it detonates, he has a lot of ranged utility," Willette said. "He can fill the screen, almost like a bullet hell, and as soon as he confirms a hit, he flows right back into our combo system."</p><p dir="ltr">It's not just the moveset that proves challenging when adding a human like Cecil to a roster of superhumans; he has to <em>look</em> like he can hold his own against the rest of the roster. Skybound art director Dan Eder explained how the team found different ways to truly bring out Cecil's power.</p><p dir="ltr">"We asked ourselves, how do we still make him someone imposing without all the muscle mass of a huge bulky dude like Omni-Man?" Eder said. "We do lean more towards the show, but we go through so many iterations with every new character that I think the artistic process here is very challenging but also extremely satisfying. Ultimately, I think it feels very authentic to the character, and he's going to feel cohesive within the rest of the roster, even though they are visually pretty different."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582740-screenshot1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4582740" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582740-screenshot1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4582740"></a><figcaption>Cecil Stedman</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582740-screenshot1.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582741-screenshot2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582742-screenshot3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582743-screenshot4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582744-screenshot5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582746-screenshot6.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582747-screenshot7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582748-screenshot8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582749-screenshot9.png" data-ref-id="1300-4582741,1300-4582742,1300-4582743,1300-4582744,1300-4582746,1300-4582747,1300-4582748,1300-4582749" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582741-screenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582742-screenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582743-screenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582744-screenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582746-screenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582747-screenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582748-screenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582749-screenshot9.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582741-screenshot2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582742-screenshot3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582743-screenshot4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582744-screenshot5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582746-screenshot6.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582747-screenshot7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582748-screenshot8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582749-screenshot9.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Fitting into the canon</h2><p dir="ltr">The addition of Cecil also came with the news of an original story arc that will be told within Invincible VS. Though the team didn't give specifics on where exactly the game fits into the overall timeline, Robert Kirkman said that the teams at Skybound and Quarter Up closely collaborated to make sure this story felt natural to the series as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Narrative director] Mike [Rogers] has been working really closely with Helen Leigh, who's one of the key writers on the Invincible series, and co-wrote the Atom Eve game with me," Kirkman confirmed. "There's logic to where the story mode for this game would fit in the narrative of the Invincible show, and while we're not talking specifics here today, fans of The Invincible television show are going to get a very cool experience that's tailored to fit within that narrative."</p><p dir="ltr">Rogers himself likens the Invincible Vs story as a "standalone special" to the overarching Invincible storyline. "It's been a real treat going to work with Helen and Robert," Rogers said, "and really make this feel authentic to the Invincible universe."</p><p dir="ltr">Where Atom Eve was a narrative adventure game focused on Atom Eve, the Invincible Vs story gave the narrative team a lot more to play with in terms of available characters. For Kirkman, the ability to use these characters in new ways is a big part of what makes a project like this so enticing.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think it's cool because it's a bigger playground for them to play in," Kirkman said. "The interaction of these characters is, at times, somewhat unique to the universe.

Israel got his start on the Halo franchise at Bungie before joining 343 Industries--now known as Halo Studios--as art director.</p><p>Israel said in his post that there is "little more I can say for the moment" about the nature of his exit from the Halo development team. He added, "I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year."</p><p>He also shared a message for others in the games industry, a business that's facing "dire" times of late. "No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics, or values--and no one can force you to," he said. "Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDgR1FRJnF8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details on this situation and Israel's exit from Halo Studios.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-secret-behind-the-fastest-xp-jp-grind-in-final-fantasy-tactics-frogs.1321276/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a> lets you train a group of newb Squires into an ultra-efficient death squad of hybrid specialists. There are so <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-jobs-ranking-best-ivalice-chronicles-2000630679">many neat Jobs</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-best-abilities-guide-ivalice-chronicles-2000631130">abilities to unlock</a> in this strategy RPG that, in no time at all, you’ll be wondering what the fastest way is to obtain all of them. While there are many time-honored traditions when it comes to min-maxing the grind in Square Enix’s classic, some are more effective than others. And frogs are one of the best (technically they’re toads, but frogs is funnier to say and write).</p> <p>Every action you take in combat that accomplishes something nets your character XP (experience points) and JP (job points). The first raises your regular level and the second raises your Job level and are spent to unlock abilities. You get more XP for performing actions on characters that are a higher level, and more JP the higher your overall Job level is, with bonuses for having the Double JP abilities equipped (<a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228">more on that here</a>).</p>

 <p>There are roughly three tiers of grinding in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. The first is going to a place like the Mandalia Plains, killing everything but the enemy Chocobo, and then cornering it so that it keeps healing itself as your characters keep attacking it. The second is unlocking Focus from the Squire Job on every character, keeping one enemy alive in a battle, and then just spending the rest of the time having everyone keep using this ability over and over again. It’s boring and tedious, but it gets results and is easy to implement. The third is having everyone learn a dance or Bard song have them perform it on repeat. It’s similar to the Focus version but requires fewer button presses and neutralizes enemies without killing them.</p>

   <p>None of these, however, is as elegant and foolproof as the “Berserker Frog” method.&nbsp; In this version you bring someone along who can cast both the Black Mage’s Toad spell and the Mystic’s Fervor (Berserk) and Induration (Petrify) spells. You then have them turn a single remaining enemy and the rest of your party into frogs so they deal as little damage as possible. They then cast Fervor to give all of the frogs Berserk so they just keep attacking the nearest enemy. They then cast Induration on themselves to turn themselves into stone so you don’t have to keep controlling them. Your party will proceed to auto-grind for a good long while.</p>

 <p>Why not just use the actual auto-battle AI controls in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>? Well, they aren’t always reliable in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster. Set characters with Focus to run away from battle and they just won’t use any abilities. Set someone to just heal allies and they’ll eventually still go and start killing stuff. AI control is fine for breezing through an encounter while you go make a sandwich but it won’t be nearly as effective over the same period of time as the Frog method. If you want to go above and beyond, you can keep multiple enemies alive and bring someone with the Arts of War ability to reduce the enemy’s power and speed before turning them into a frog so there’s no chance of anyone dying.</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/1o0tcgm/comment/nieywz6/">Some fans</a> still maintain that the Focus method is simpler and faster. You send everyone to a corner of the map, set their AI to run away, and then hope they use Focus a bunch of times before killing the one enemy that’s left. But I find with the streamlined AI in the remaster, that’s just not as reliable anymore. Frogs are the way.</p>

              <p>Talented creators say the darndest things. The latest one to put his foot in his mouth is George Miller, director of the very good, fantastic, wonderful girl-power post-apocalyptic action film <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>, as well as many other great movies. Speaking at an Australian AI film festival (they generated a festival?), homeboy opened his mouth to proudly declare that “AI is here to stay.”</p> <p>It seems the room did not erupt into chants of “What do we want? Free labor! Plagiarism! Ecological collapse! When do we want it? Now!” to the sounds of Shinra-esque data centers sucking the planet dry. But in his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/09/ai-film-making-omni-festival-mad-max-director-george-miller-interview">interview with <i>The Guardian</i></a> (h/t <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/movies/mad-max-fury-road-director-george-miller-disappoints-everyone-by-taking-part-in-an-ai-film-festival-ai-is-here-to-stay/">real person Megan Garside at <i>GamesRadar</i></a>), the famed filmmaker said: “AI is arguably the most dynamically evolving tool in making moving image. As a filmmaker, I’ve always been <a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089">driven by the tools</a>.”</p>

 <p>But okay, let’s hold off on the pitchforks and torches for a second and hear the writer and producer of <i>Babe</i> out:</p> <blockquote><p>It’s the balance between human creativity and machine capability, that’s what the debate and the anxiety is about […] It strikes me how this debate echoes earlier moments in art history.</p></blockquote> <p>Miller went on to loosely deliver some pseudo-historical background, comparing AI’s rise to that of oil painting in the Renaissance and photography in the mid-19th century. “It will make screen storytelling available to anyone who has a calling to it,” Miller said, echoing the common pro-AI argument that it’s some kind of democratizing force. “[Kids not yet in their teens are] making films–or at least putting footage together. It’s way more egalitarian.”</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089">Open AI Is Already Backtracking After Flood Of Video Game Slop Including Sam Altman Eating Pikachu</a></p> <p>There is a degree of truth to some of these statements, but it’s about time we’ve started to have a more honest conversation about the history of human technological development and the intentions of those who own these means of production. These same tools that, yes, may make it easier to mush together some ideas to produce a concept of a movie or piece of art, are not only doing so at extreme cost to the planet (<a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-data-centers-electricity-bills">and people’s energy bills</a>). They’re also making it harder for aspiring creatives to make a living doing this work, as those deploying AI are largely doing so to replace functioning, compensated labor in creative endeavors (and other forms of work). Throwing a sentence at a machine to have it spit out a neat-looking idea might lower the barrier to entry, but I’m not sure how denying people the ability to make a living with their art by replacing their ability to make money by producing that art is more egalitarian.</p>

 <p>And as to kids “not yet in their teens” making films? Steven Spielberg made his first “movie” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg#Early_life_and_background">when he was but a pre-teen himself</a>, a boy scout earning a badge for an 8mm film, and that was after a youth spent filming model trains to recreate a scene from <i>The Greatest Show on Earth</i>. And he certainly wasn’t <a href="https://youtu.be/gaRN0jwoyiM?si=gSnWV7QNsOy8m51i">the only filmmaker doing such things</a> at a young age.</p> <p>So remind me again what AI is going to offer aspiring filmmakers that history has shown will already act on their passions? And if AI eats away at job opportunities for young filmmakers in a world where everyone’s just typing prompts into slop machines, how is this more egalitarian?</p>

Set in the ancient past, during the founding of Hyrule, this hack-and-slash action game will pit the Princess and her allies against massive armies in their war against the Demon King Ganondorf. After several trailers, multiple runs of their hands-on demo at Tokyo Game Show, and <em>probably</em> too much time going over footage frame-by-frame, I’ve come away with seven key changes from Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity that you should know before starting in Age of Imprisonment. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1) This is a True Prequel</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity had a fun story: reliving the war between The Champions and Calamity Ganon. Set 100 years before The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, it was an opportunity to spend extended time with fan favorite characters like Urbosa and Daruk, and take control of the Divine Beasts in the war. The only problem? It split off into a separate side story, making it non-canon to BoTW. That’s just fine for folks who love a good filler episode, but for those of us invested in the complex and often contradictory overarching Zelda story, that was a bit of a bummer. Fortunately for us lore Hounds, Age of Imprisonment is confirmed to be canon to the Tears of the Kingdom story. That means our adventure with Zelda, Rauru, Queen Sonia will tell us exactly how this ancient war with Ganondorf played out. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment - September 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">2) Combat is Evolving</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The hack-and-slash combat at the center of Hyrule Warriors is alive and well, and it’s evolving further thanks to all new Unique Skills. These special moves are tailored towards specific situations and let you execute an aerial attack, targeted toward leaping of flying enemies, and a straightforward thrust attack to use against charging enemies. As the name implies, these are unique to each character. Zelda, for example, can unleash a barrage of Light Arrows from her Bow of Light to bring down flyers, or use Piercing Light on charging enemies, blasting them with a beam of light fired from the tip of her sword. These are strong options that will reward making the correct decisions quickly in the heat of battle, and if used correctly will do immediate damage to the Weak-Point gauges of tougher enemies, setting you up for devastating Weak Point attacks. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Zelda and company will have a massive array of moves to fight back against Ganondorf and his army.&nbsp;</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">3) Sync Strikes are your Ace in the Hole</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelda won’t be fighting alone, and the way her allies factor into battles is evolving thanks to the new team-up attacks. This goes beyond the simple souped-up special attacks from musou games of old, as now the pairs of warriors employ unique tactics when paired together – to devastating effects. Two examples I saw in my hands-on demo were Zelda paired with Raru firing a powerful, aimable beam of pure light that tears through enemies, and Zelda with Mineru summoning Mineru’s hulking construct to use as an enemy-smashing battlemech. Whether it’s every pairing on just select compatible duos, it’s clear Zelda and company will have a massive array of moves to fight back against Ganondorf and his army. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">4) New Hardware Means New Tricks</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Age of Imprisonment is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2, which means it takes full advantage of the more powerful hardware. While I haven’t done a full stress test just yet to see how far I can push the action before the framerate breaks down, I was impressed in my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-has-evolved-into-an-even-better-legend-of-zelda-complement"><u>hands-on demo</u></a> with how well it looked and ran. Also, fighting thousands of bokoblins is more fun with a friend, and Age of Imprisonment makes that easier thanks to GameShare. The idea is pretty simple: if one player has a Switch 2 and a copy of Age of Imprisonment, then another player can be their co-op body by joining the session from their own Switch or Switch 2. Just keep in mind that the session belongs to the player doing the sharing, so once they stop playing the session ends for both players. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5) Zonai Devices</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So much of what made Tears of the Kingdom special was the way you could find and use Zonai devices – ancient machine parts – to aid your adventure. You can do that here too, as demonstrated when I tried out a Flame Emitter. This let me fry my enemies with an aimable stream of fire when I held it. It could also be activated and dropped on the ground to burn everything around it. I’ve thrown time bombs into the mouth of a Frox, and watched in trailers as Zelda combined the wind from a sideways fan with a Shock Emitter to create a massive electric cyclone. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">6) The World Above and Below</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Our entire demo took place in the Depths, in the area just beyond Mineru’s Lab. I didn’t get to see a map, but I do know that Age of Calamity covered the entire overworld, and the Depths spans an area just as large. That potentially doubles where levels could take place, and that’s before factoring in the Sky Islands, places we know from prior trailers where we will be fighting. Taken together, there is a lot of potential variety for where levels will take place, and it’s fair to wonder just how big Zelda’s fight in the ancient past will be. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7) Zelda and Link</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelda, despite her title role in the series, has almost always been relegated to, at best, a secondary character, and at worst an off-screen motivation for Link on his adventures. While she was the star of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, her largely non-combat role in a retro-style adventure stands in stark contrast to her place in Age of Imprisonment, wielding a sword as the lead character as the vanguard in battle. Link, meanwhile, is in the “present” many centuries after the Imprisoning War takes place. While we have seen a construct with a strikingly Link-like visage show up in trailers and character art, we know this will be rare, and for Hyrule Warriors first, a case of Zelda taking the lead while Link steps out of the spotlight. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even these seven items barely scratch the surface when it comes to what’s new in The Legend of Zelda: Age of Imprisonment, like a Korok warrior joining the fray, or an all new cast of Champions to defend Hyrule alongside Zelda. Fortunately you won’t need to wait much longer to uncover all the secrets from the great war near the founding of Hyrule. The Legend of Zelda: Age of Imprisonment launches on November 6, exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-7-key-changes-from-the-first-game]]></content:encoded>

<p>There’s currently no word on casting, but the first film starred Jack Black (as the series' protagonist Steve), Jason Momoa, Emma Meyers, Danielle Brooks, Sebastian Hansen, and Jennifer Coolidge.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-y%C5%8Dtei-has-sold-over-1-6-million-units-to-date-only-slightly-slower-than-tsushima.1321252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-has-strong-debut-in-the-united-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debut week's physical sales data from the United Kingdom</a>, we now have more estimates suggesting that Ghost of Yōtei was very successful for developer Sucker Punch Productions and publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>



<p>Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/ghost-of-yotei-is-a-success-as-battlefield?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has shared</a> that the game has already surpassed 1.6 million units sold to customers to date (over two million units if we consider copies already sold to retailers). This is just slightly slower than its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-becomes-the-fastest-selling-new-sony-ip-during-ps4-gen-with-2-4-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 2.4 million units in the first three days and became the fastest-selling Sony-published new intellectual property released for the PlayStation 4</a>.</p>



<p>As previously noted, though, Ghost of Tsushima launched on July 17, 2020, when most of the world still had stay-at-home restrictions that effectively turned into a considerable incentive to play games. During that time, the gaming industry reached new revenue heights due to the abnormally high amount of time people were able to dedicate to games.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the game debuted at the very end of the PS4's lifecycle, when the console had sold 110 million units globally, whereas the PS5 has just reached 80 million units sold as of this August. In this perspective, Ghost of Yōtei is performing admirably, even more so when you consider other factors, such as the fact that the budget was reportedly the same as the previous installment (around $60 million) and that it is currently outperforming all major PS5 releases, including Assassin's Creed Shadows, since Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unsurprisingly, over 93% of those who played Ghost of Tsushima returned for the new game. They certainly didn't go wrong, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as I explained in my review</a>:</p>



<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em></p>



<p>The latest Alinea Analytics newsletter also reveals that Battlefield 6 is poised to launch to great numbers tomorrow, with 1.8 million pre-orders on Steam alone and 3.5 million wishlists on Valve's platform. While you wait to play the game yourself, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go read Wccftech's review written by David Carcasole</a>.</p>

<p>A sequel to A Minecraft Movie is officially in the works, complete with a June 2027 release.</p>



<p>The worldwide sensation Minecraft has kept players occupied with its world-building fun since 2011. Millions of fans have purchased the game, and it has become a household name since. This year, Warner Bros. released a movie adaptation of the game, called A Minecraft Movie. Needless to say, it is currently the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-301-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-highest-grossing film of 2025</a>. Now, after months of speculation, it seems we’ll be returning to the mines real soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-sequel-releasing-on-june-27th-2027-director-returning">A Minecraft Movie Sequel Releasing on June 27th, 2027, Director Returning</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/AMinecraftMovie/status/1976341544266498142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> post, it was announced that A Minecraft Movie sequel is officially in the works. It’s unknown what the sequel will be named. Furthermore, the original director, Jared Hess, will return to do the second one. With a poster showing two shiny pickaxes, we also have a release date: June 27th, 2027. The date does place it with to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-simpsons-movie-coming-after-almost-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons Movie 2</a>, so it’s sure to be a big day for the box office.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it’s unknown if any of the original cast will return for the sequel. Even more so, we don’t know about the plot, as it’s being kept under wraps for now. Despite that, the movie is sure to be just as popular, especially since it knows what worked. Countless memes like “Chicken Jockey” and “I am Steve” flooded the internet even before its release and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even caused uproars</a> in theaters. Warner Bros. is aware of it and honed in on it for marketing, which likely caused its box-office soar. It’ll be interesting to see how it fares out and if it’ll keep the charm many fans enjoyed.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/rubiks-cube-reimagined-as-a-multi-game-multi-screened-gadget-for-299/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rubik%E2%80%99s-cube-gets-a-299-update-complete-with-ips-screens-and-its-own-apps.1321243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>The Rubik’s Cube has been reinvented with more games and many more screens for much more money.</p>
<p>What has long been cherished as a simple toy yet complex puzzle requiring nothing but a healthy amount of twisting, turning, and patience has been rebooted for the 21st century. Naturally, that calls for a few dashes of technology.</p>
<p>Differing from the original Rubik’s Cube, which has six faces that each contain a 3×3 grid, the Rubik’s WOWCube, made available for preorder today, as spotted by<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/797601/spin-master-rubiks-cube-wowcube-puzzle-app-store-mobile-games"> The Verge</a>, has six faces with 2×2 grids.</p>


<p>Rather than a solid-colored sticker, each of the toy's 24 squares is a 240×240 IPS display. The cube itself is composed of eight "cubicle modules," as Cubios, the company behind the toy, calls them. Each module includes three of those IPS screens and a dedicated SoC. As a Cubios <a href="https://wowcube.com/support/">support page</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our patented magnetic connectors allow the modules to maintain perfect electrical contact and seamless data flow between them, no matter how the cube is rotated. This ensures that data can be transferred between autonomous modules on the fly, enabling data sharing and distributing low voltage power across the WOWCube …</p></blockquote>
<p>Each of the 24 displays can be set to show a solid color for solving a simpler, but still captivating, Rubik’s puzzle. Alternatively, the screens can be twisted and turned to play dozens of different games, including <em>Block Buster</em>,<em> Space Invaders</em>, and <em>Jewel Hunter.</em></p>

<p>Also part of the toy is a gyroscope, 6-axis accelerometer, and eight speakers. Cubios claims the integrated battery can last for up to seven hours before needing a recharge.</p>
<p>In order to add games or other apps to the WOWCube, you must download the WOWCube Connect iOS or Android app, pair the toy with your phone over Bluetooth, and then use the mobile app to download games onto the WOWCube.</p>
<p>Currently, the WOWCube’s online app store <a href="https://wowcube.com/store/category/all-games">lists 47 games</a>; some cost money to download, and some aren’t available yet. The WOWCube runs its own operating system, dubbed CubiOS, and Cubios (the company) offers a <a href="https://wowcube.com/devkit/">free DevKit</a>.</p>

The game comes packed with a full campaign, collectibles to hunt down, and plenty of achievements to earn. Below, we'll break down the mission list and all of the side objectives you might want to tackle during your playthrough of Battlefield 6's story.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How long is Battlefield 6 - Campaign length and missions</h2><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 has a total of nine campaign missions. On average, it should take you around 4-5 hours to complete the campaign on the normal difficulty level. Of course, you can take your time to explore the map, hunt down collectibles, and attempt the game's specific achievement/trophy requirements. A harder difficulty could lead to slower mission progression, naturally.</p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-float-feat-jim-adkins-by-jay-som">Patrick Recommends: "Float (feat: Jim Adkins)" by Jay Som</h3><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L8zILRiE5wk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Jay Som - Float [OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO]"></iframe></figure><p>If video games were my primary interest in elementary school and middle school, music was my primary interest in high school. Some of that was writing about video games transitioning from a curiosity to a legitimate career trajectory, but I also happened to grow up at such a cool fucking time for technology. Napster, the iPod, CD-Rs—<em>all</em> of that was happening while I was in high school. Oh, and street teams. It was the era of the street time, the time when you were sent a box full of tapes and tiny posters you were supposed to put on people's windshields in the parking lot. I promise it was sick as hell.</p><p>My high school era cemented so much of the music that I still listen to now. I do listen to new music, but it often goes in one ear and out the other. Not much sticks. When I don't know what to listen to, I'll randomly pick a band I like (i.e. Flaming Lips) and ask Apple Music to make a radio station out of it. The result is something very pleasant while answering emails or writing an article like this, but it rarely results in me going "holy shit, who <em>is</em> this artist?"</p><p>So when something <em>does</em> stick, it feels notable. I only discovered Jay Som's single for an upcoming album in a message board thread, because I looked at the "feat: Jim Adkins" part and went "huh, why is that familiar." Oh, right: Jimmy Eat World. I was eating up anything Weezer-adjacent around high school, too, and while many of those bands are lost to time, Jimmy Eat World was one of the really good ones. The Middle remains one of my favorite albums. </p><p>Float would be an excellent track without Jim on it. It's a <em>transendent</em> track with Jim's vocals on it. Plus, the music video is such a throwback, too. High school and early college was the time of house parties. Do people still do house parties, where you'd wander around the entirety of a house half drunk and have a million different conversations that you won't remember the next day? That stuff ruled.</p><p>Also, I highly recommend playing this very, very loud in a car.</p><p>FLOAT DON'T FLYYYYYY FLOAT DON'T FLYYYYYY</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-stick-apple-tv">Rob Recommends: <em>Stick</em>, Apple TV+  </h3><figure><figcaption><span>You should also watch Shrinking on Apple TV!</span></figcaption></figure><p>I love sports movies but one of my favorite movies is <em>Tin Cup, </em>a Kevin Costner romantic comedy where he’s a burned-out never-was golfer who falls in love with his golf nemesis’ girlfriend. I turns out I might be a sucker for ”washed-up middle-aged golfer” stories because I’ve really enjoyed <em>Stick</em>, an Owen Wilson dramedy on Apple where he plays a man who crashed-out of the pro tour due to personal tragedy and who crashed out of the rest of his adult life due to his inability to process or handle any of the ensuing fallout. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-persona-5-skins-crossover-mercy-genji-joker-2000625739"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i></a><span> is winding down its 18th season this week, with its 19th set to begin on October 14. The season doubles as both a return of the hero shooter’s previous Halloween events, and a chance to shake things up with new modes, tweaks, and some rarer rewards than seasons past. While breaking down all that’s coming in season 19, Blizzard also teased something coming in season 20: hero 45.</span></p>  <p><span>Blizzard’s full developer update breaks down several changes and additions happening in season 19. The Halloween event this year is called Haunted Masquerade, and it lets you put on masks based on different heroes that grant you different perks. Some of these buffs are simple, such as Tracer’s mask granting you increased movement speed and Junkrat’s making your enemies explode when they die. Other hidden perks are found when you pair some masks with specific heroes. If you’re playing as Brigitte, for example, wearing the Reinhardt mask will make your shield as large as his. It also looks like a Mei mask might add a Blizzard effect to Juno’s Ultimate, allowing you to freeze enemies in a straight path. So it looks like a lot of interesting, unexpected combos await.</span></p>

 <p><span>On the Stadium side of things, Torbjörn, Sojourn, and Hazard are being added to the build-centric mode, and some of their upgrades look pretty nasty. Torb can create multiple upgradable turrets to place around the field, Sojourn can get a Soldier: 76-style auto-aim when she ults, and Hazard can now shoot bursts from the spikes on his back. Those are just a few examples of how their play styles will no doubt change as you upgrade and tweak your build throughout Stadium’s long matches. Ana has been in the mode for a while, but she is also getting a rework to change up some of her loadouts. All characters are also getting consumable gadgets that they can use throughout the match that will grant you temporary buffs. One example shown in the video is an item that makes your hero grow in size with increased damage and defense.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Mythic Skins, the customizable prestige skins released each season, have been a bit hit-or-miss since </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s launch, but the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lifeweaver-overwatch-2-pansexual-season-4-support-hero-1850294521"><span>Lifeweaver’s</span></a><span> Divine Druid Mythic skin is really fucking gorgeous. Blizzard is retooling the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-mythic-skin-store-prisms-battle-pass-mercy-1851414356"><span>Mythic upgrade levels</span></a><span> so you’ll unlock more significant alterations more quickly, but that’s not the only major change happening this season. In season 19, Blizzard will release two mythic skins, rather than just one. The second one will be for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-skin-contest-china-junkrat-furry-diaper-2000630263"><span>Junkrat</span></a><span> and will be available in the mid-season patch. We didn’t see it, but Blizzard says it’s called “Cyberfuel.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Closing out the presentation, Blizzard revealed it is finally putting all of the external lore media, such as comics and animated shorts, in the game itself. So now those of you who only really interact with </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> through the game itself will be able to read and watch these in your launcher. Everything we can glimpse in this new section of the main menu during the presentation is recent material from </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>, so it’s unclear just how far back in the lore we’ll be going here. Will this be a one-stop shop for works dating back to the original game? We’ll see next week. After talking about the past, Blizzard also teased the future with hero 45. The sword-wielding damage hero will be getting a trial session at some point during season 19, but all we saw of her was a silhouette and a brief shot of her legs as she shouts, “Ready yourselves for war!”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This mystery swordswoman was briefly teased in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-comic-zenyatta-ramattra-2000628236"><span>latest motion comic</span></a><span> starring Ramattra and Zenyatta, where she was seen standing in front of an explosion with her giant sword. </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>doesn’t have enough melee-centric heroes, so hopefully she spices things up when she joins the roster in season 20.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Switch game vouchers. Discounted eShop gift cards. Those are the keys to getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leaks-switch-2-image-mega-evolution-2000630717"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-release-date-motorcycle-open-world-2000625308"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> for the cheapest possible price at launch. You think Nintendo does Black Friday deals for new games? In this economy?! Nope!!!</p> <p>You’re probably already familiar <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-game-voucher-discount-save-deal-cheap-1851684045">with this discount method</a>. You wait until Newegg or some other virtual currency reseller <a href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004">has a deal</a> on Nintendo eShop gift cards. Usually it’s $5 off of $50. You can then add that currency to your digital wallet and use it to buy Switch game vouchers which act as free coupons to redeem full-price games. You get a pair for $100 and use them to buy two $60 games. In this case, that’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, out October 16,&nbsp;and <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, out December 4. You save $30. It’s effectively buy one, get one 50 percent off.</p>

 <p>But you’re thinking, “Wait, I have a Switch 2 now. I want the Switch 2 versions of those games.” The same deal applies. You just have to pay for the $10 Switch 2 upgrades separately. You end up shelling out $110 instead of $140 (the Switch 2 versions are normally $70). It’s still $30 off the combined total but more of a buy one, get one 40 percent off deal. So it goes with Nintendo.</p>

 <p>The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-vouchers-pokemon-za-metroid-prime-4-preorder-1851785969">announced earlier this year</a> that it’s killing off game vouchers going forward, but fans still have until January 30, 2026 to purchase them and use them on current Switch games. After that date, Nintendo will stop selling the game vouchers, but you’ll have an additional 12 months to redeem any existing ones before they expire. Maybe Nintendo will introduce a revised version of the program for Switch 2 once we’ve fully transitioned over.</p> <p>In the meantime, it’s your best bet for a more affordable double-feature this holiday, at least if you don’t mind owning the games digitally. Which I know some of your do. At least neither of their physical versions are game key cards, even if they do fall victim to the ugly new Switch 2 box art labels.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of VR’s biggest music games is launching an all-new entry, Synth Riders: Overdrive, on the Nintendo Switch later this year.</p>



<p>The music action genre is one not explored as much as it should be. Games like Rhythm Heaven, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-aaron-greenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, and the upcoming Unbeatable bring the beats and fun, but the genre still unexplored. However, the VR space, led by Beat Saber, has been a beacon of groovy gameplay and entertainment. One such game was 2019’s Synth Riders, which has launched on multiple VR platforms like Oculus Rift and PSVR. The game mixes Tron-like cyberpunk visuals with music-based gameplay featuring today’s biggest songs. Its success with fans and critics left its mark on them and, now, the acclaimed series is returning, this time for the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<h2 id="h-synth-riders-overdrive-brings-the-beats-to-nintendo-switch">Synth Riders: Overdrive Brings The Beats To Nintendo Switch </h2>

</p></figure>



<p>Announced today with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfeXfq44AiM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new trailer</a>, developer Kluge Interactive revealed that Synth Riders: Overdrive, a new game in the series, is coming to the Nintendo Switch. Made from the ground up, the title brings the music-filled gameplay to newer audiences, along with the addition of multiplayer and story mode. With three difficulty modes, you can play through dozens of pop songs from artists like Charli XCX, Jack Harlow, Starcadian, and more. In a statement from Kluge, founder and CEO Arturo Perez said the following:</p>



<blockquote>

This set lets you build and display the logo, with tons of “greebling,” or LEGO-y texture on it. It even has a hidden compartment where you can house a minifigure. It comes with a buildable stand, a regular and a gold Batman minifigure, plus a gold coin celebrating 20 years of Batman LEGO sets.</p></div><p id="batman-v-superman-batmobile"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Batman v Superman Batmobile">LEGO DC Batman: Batman v Superman Batmobile</h2></p><div catalogid="b7aa58a6-51ca-4d7b-900d-fcddcb0f0df5" id="229381"><div id="229381" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO DC Batman: Batman v Superman Batmobile</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From the universally beloved 2016 movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice">Batman v Superman</a> comes this sleek, gray, angular take on the Batmobile.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eco-focused-nonprofit-releases-standard-to-make-games-%E2%80%98the-most-sustainable-form-of-entertainment%E2%80%99.1321180/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week, The Sustainable Games Alliance, a nonprofit made up of games industry professionals and environmental researchers, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sustainable-games-alliance_today-were-proud-to-announce-the-launch-activity-7381260693489999872-pgQP/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> a framework that any developer or studio can apply to make their games more sustainable. The <a href="https://sustainablegamesalliance.org/standard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sustainable Games Standard</a>, as it’s known, is the product of a year of work and collaboration with game companies and scientists. The goal? To make games “the most sustainable form of entertainment.”&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a lofty one for sure, especially considering that at this point the games industry has proven <a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-companies-vow-action-on-climate-change-but-1838420425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inconsistent</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/climate-goals-targets-video-game-companies-carbon-1849810896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at best</a> when it comes to environmental matters. But the goal is to make the standard as accessible as possible so that a significantly greater number of companies can get on the same page. This, according to the Sustainable Games Alliance, will allow companies to “track emissions accurately within the game lifecycle, identify cost-saving, impact-reducing opportunities, comply with new global regulations, optimize energy use and battery life, reduce hardware load while improving performance, enhance player experience while lowering environmental impact.”</p><p>The standard, research lead <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/10/07/afterclimate-video-games-climate-change-ubisoft-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Abraham</a> told Aftermath, necessitated some creative thinking to meet the unique needs of game developers.</p><p>“In terms of methodology, each one is a little bit different,” said Abraham. “I started with whatever already existed, talked to a lot of our member companies and some other contributing ones. We knew we needed a quick and dirty method for as many as possible, so where there's the option to make a ‘spend based’ calculation, we've put one in there. Those are good for fast and easy numbers, but they don't give you any control over the emissions, because the only way to reduce them is ‘spend less money,’ which you might not want to do if you're marketing your new game.”</p><p>This meant that in some cases, Abraham – alongside games industry experts – had to devise new methods entirely.</p><p>“Like the [section 3.11] use of sold products (mobile) component, which says ‘OK, phones have batteries, what if we measure the battery level at the start and the end of a game session, that will tell us how much power the game has used,’” said Abraham. “Because the use of energy at the battery doesn't actually directly generate emissions, we also have to trace it back to the source, which is grid electricity emissions. To get power from the grid there has to be a charger that converts AC to DC, and when you do that you get power losses, so you also need to account for that by adding some extra on top for charger losses.”</p><p>The Sustainable Games Alliance says that 30+ companies are already among its ranks – with standouts including Remedy, Starbreeze, and Colossal Order – and Abraham believes that more will inevitably jump on board now that the standard is out in the wild.</p><p>“It's so easy to join the SGA," said Abraham. "Companies literally only need to send an email and say ‘We want to join,’ and the board considers and approves their application. … We've been talking to several big games companies for a very long time, and a lot of them are on board with the goals of the SGA and the standard; they have just needed a big public reason to join. It's also a hard time to get any spending approved in the games industry, so we get it. It just takes time. I'm confident that we're demonstrating the value of what we're doing.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-review"><h3>100 Meters Is A Soulful Gem About The Poetry Of Running</h3></a><p>Studio Rock’N Roll Mountain’s rotoscope take on Uoto’s track manga unearths raw truths and soulful cadence with every thunderous footfall</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chess-dungeon-crawler-yeah"><h3>Chess Dungeon Crawler, Yeah</h3></a><p>Below the Crown combines roguelike hallmarks with chess</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange"><h3>Baby Steps’ Manbreaker Did Not Break Me</h3></a><p>Baby Steps' Manbreaker is an optional, brutal challenge that is as much a test of your humility as it is your skill.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-patch-notes-impaled-swordfishes"><h3>Good Patch Notes</h3></a><p>"The trash chute now ignores impaled swordfishes"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/epic-games-suing-two-fortnite-island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement"><h3>Epic Games Suing Two Fortnite Island Makers Over Inflated ‘Bot’ Engagement</h3></a><p>Epic Games says Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser made tens of thousands of dollars worth of ‘unwarranted payouts’</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/sustainable-games-alliance-standard-sustainable-environment-climate]]></content:encoded>

<p>Seriously, this one looks cool</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Devolver Digital has confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a> will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>8th December 2025</strong>, and the latest trailer is looking seriously cool.</p>
<p>Created by solo dev Sam Eng, Skate Story is a psychedelic adventure in which you take on the form of a demon made of "glass and pain". It's your job to hone your skills and skate through nine layers of the Underworld to become a serious hardened skater.</p>
<p>Gosh darn, that sounds good. It looks gorgeous too; certainly one of the most unique skating games we've seen, aesthetically. Only time will tell, however, if the gameplay itself can hold a candle to the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>.</p>
<p>Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Stylish Street Skating Adventure -</strong> Skate through nine layers of the Underworld. Journey through streets and surreal landscapes full of waxed ledges, unholy gaps and tortured demons.</p>
<p><strong>Succumb to the Beauty of the Board -</strong> Sell your soul for decks, wheels and trucks to keep your skating fresh. Over 70+ skate tricks to progress and improve. Complete skate trials to level up and get new gear.</p>
<p><strong>Hypnotic Beats for Demonic Streets -</strong> Cruise through the Underworld to a psychedelic soundtrack by enigmatic New York artist Blood Cultures, with additional tracks by John Fio.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-4-6-star-rated-soundcore-portable-bluetooth-speaker-selling-for-post-prime-pennies-2000633350</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-4-6-star-rated-soundcore-portable-bluetooth-speaker-selling-for-post-prime-pennies.1321159/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The memo that Prime Day is over hasn’t made its full rounds yet, because there are still some crazy tech deals floating around Amazon that are too good to miss. Here’s another one that could be a “like it now, love it later” buy, looking ahead to when the warm weather returns: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4669/">the Soundcore Motion 100 portable Bluetooth speaker, with IPX7 waterproofing to go along with its great sound, just had its price cut in half to just $40.</a></p>
<p>The Soundcore Motion 100’s waterproofing, compact size, and handy built-in loop for carrying or hanging make it a perfect shower speaker for when the pool and beach parties aren’t an option, and when the great outdoor are calling you back, it’s ideal for looping onto bike handlebars, hanging from a backpack or a canopy with a carabiner, or just carrying since it only weighs 1.3 pounds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4669/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Little Speaker, Big Sound</h2>
<p>A speaker this small shouldn’t sound this big or this good, but that’s the Soundcore Motion 100’s calling card. It brings quality, detailed sound at up to 40kHz, with the option to hit the BassUp button to get that deep chest-thumping bass going. It’s app-controlled, with a detailed 9-band EQ control that gives you the power of in-depth customization.</p>
<p>That sound is driven by dual full-range drivers, with a bold 20W output with or without the extra bass. The total effect vastly outpunches the modest size of the speaker — barely over 7 inches long by 2.5 inches wide by 2 inches tall. As a shower speaker or compact yet powerful home speaker living on a shelf, it more than does the job. As a source of quality music on the go, it’s among the best.</p>



<h2>Why Stop at Just One?</h2>
<p>The Motion 100 can also be paired with another Motion 100 to create a surround-sound experience. When one Motion 100 is just $30, why stop there? A quality portable surround sound system for $60 is more than a little tempting. You won’t wear them out, either, since they have a robust 12-hour life on a single USB-C charge.</p>
<p>When a 4.6-star-rated portable Bluetooth speaker is available at Amazon for $60, and it’s IPX7 waterproof so it can be a shower speaker, poolside speaker, and everything in between, it’s worth serious consideration. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4669/">When that very same speaker gets an unexpected 50% price cut and becomes a $40 speaker, it becomes a truly great deal</a>. We’re still leaning toward buying two of the Soundcore Motion 100 portable Bluetooth speakers to get that surround sound going, but there is going to be at least one in our Amazon shopping cart imminently.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has announced that it’s adding two classic Heroes of Might &amp; Magic games to the Xbox Game Pass library. </p>



<p>Starting today, October 9, both Heroes of Might and Magic II: Gold and Heroes of Might and Magic III: Complete are available for all members on the platform. The games will be available on PC for PC Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p>



<p>“I can think of no better way to teach a new generation the meaning of key words like throng, necromancy, and logistics,” Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2kNoEMd70" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Watters said</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to the games being added to the service, it was also revealed that Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era’s Early Access release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-early-access-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was being pushed to 2026</a>. To fill in the gap between now and the launch, however, developers Unfrozen have released a demo on PC via Steam.</p>

                <p>The new patch notes are in for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/news/">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-update-buffs-vault-hunters/1100-6535180/" data-ref-id="1100-6535180">and like several other updates</a>, this new round of tweaks to the game is focused on empowering players--specifically, their arsenal of weapons. Gearbox says that it's focusing on smaller gear adjustments, starting with several Legendary-class weapons. These hard-to-find weapons haven't felt as good to use in combat despite having unique perks, so their overall power is getting dialed up substantially.</p><p>One prime example here is the Hellwalker, a Jacobs fire-and-forget shotgun that was introduced in Borderlands 3 and is almost a carbon copy of the Super-Shotgun used by the Doom Slayer in Id's Doom games. This will now do 30% extra base damage, so if you have a Jakobs mod equipped and the right skills activated, it should shred through rank-and-file enemies with ease. Queen's Rest, a pistol manufactured by Torgue, will also start firing rounds faster, as this has been increased by 50%, while the chance for its unique perk to spawn a homing sticky projectile has been increased from 30% to 50%.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Other notable changes include damage and fire-rate increases to Ruby's Grasp, the drone deployed from Bully will do 50% more damage, and Convergence base damage has been increased by 25%. If you don't have one of these Legendary-class weapons yet, they can be farmed from bosses found throughout Kairos, or you might want to check Mauricie's Black Market vending machine to see if he has it in stock.</p><p>Maurice offers unique Legendary gear for any player who accesses his machine, so if RNG is on your side, you might be able to purchase one of these upgraded guns with a very desirable roll of stats. You can also take a chance with the Golden Treasure Chests, as these often hand out Legendaries when you open them. To stock up on Golden Keys, check our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-shift-codes-all-active-keys-and-how-to-redeem-them/1100-6533833/" data-ref-id="1100-6533833">Borderlands 4 Shift Code guide</a> for updates.</p><p>Gearbox has also made a few other changes, like ensuring that the legendary Tediore shotgun Anarchy properly rewards stacks of Mutualism after auto-reloading or killing enemies, and Vex's Bleed skill will now count as status effect damage. You can see the full patch notes below, and next week, Gearbox will upload a patch that focuses on fine-tuning Class Mods, Repkits, Shields, and Firmware. Borderlands 4 has also struggled with performance issues since launch, but Gearbox says next week's update will address these issues and add some highly requested quality-of-life changes.</p><h2>Borderlands 4 Update Notes</h2><h4>Weekly Activities</h4><ul><li><b>Weekly Big Encore Boss</b> switched to a tougher variant of a different existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool for those who take it on.</li><li>The<b> Weekly Wildcard Mission</b> changed. These missions feature a guaranteed Legendary drop you can earn repeatedly to get your ideal roll.</li><li><b>Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine</b> moved to another location and changed its offerings.</li></ul><h4>Gear Balance Adjustments</h4><ul><li>Ruby's Grasp damage increased by 50%</li><li>Ruby's Grasp fire rate increased by 25%</li><li>Bully drone damage increased by 50%</li><li>Bully base damage increased by 50%</li><li>Rangefinder base damage increased by 30%</li><li>Queen's Rest spawn chance increased from 30% to 50%</li><li>Queen's Rest fire rate increased by 50%</li><li>Seventh Sense orb damage increased by 250%</li><li>Hellwalker base damage increased 30%</li><li>Convergence base damage increased by 25%</li></ul><h4>Additional Changes</h4><ul><li>Legendary Tediore Shotgun <i>Anarchy </i>was adjusted to properly award Stacks of Mutualism when auto-reloading or killing enemies</li><li>All Pets from all classes (such as Trouble, Specters, Reapers, and Forgeweapons) now properly gain Critical Hit Chance from Passives and Gear</li><li>Adjustment made to Vex the Siren’s Bleed to count as Status Effect Damage</li></ul>

<hr>
<p>The hardware side of things is much as you might expect, though there's been a slight uptick in PS5 sales — hey, all those copies of Ghost of Yotei have to be played somewhere. The Switch 2 remains out front with 44,439 sales this week, followed by the standard PS5 and the Switch OLED.</p>
<p>Combining the three Switch 1 SKUs pulls in a total of 24,109 units sold this week, while the three PS5 models rack up 27,344. A win for Sony!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Discord Hack Sounds Really, Really Bad]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I got a strange <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-sdk-nitro-ads-ipo-profitable-splitgate-2-1851770484">email from Discord</a> last Friday at the very end of the work day informing me of “a recent security incident on September 20 involving your personal data.” It said personal info related to my account had been compromised, but not full credit card info or my personal address. The email made it seem like only a small number of people were impacted and simply told me to “stay alert” about any suspicious emails I might get. Suspicious? On the internet? In 2025? Good luck! Nearly a week late it’s becoming clear that this “limited access” hack of a “third-party customer service system used by Discord” is a much bigger deal than it originally seemed.</p> <p>“A small number of government‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport) from users who had appealed an age determination” were included in the leak, Discord informed users like me last week. According to a <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-discord-hack-is-every-users-worst-nightmare/">new report by <em>404 Media</em></a>, the hackers responsible gloated in a Telegram group that they actually had 1.5TB of users’ personal data. Discord admitted to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/797051/discord-government-ids-leaked-data-breach?ref=404media.co"><em>The Verge</em></a> last night that it actually believes up to 70,000 users may have had their government IDs breached. There’s already a <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/2397306/discord-sued-after-user-info-leaked-in-breach-of-vendor">class-action lawsuit</a> being filed in California.</p>

 <p>One of the big culprits in this entire mess is legislation like the UK’s controversial Online Safety Act which requires users to prove to platforms that they’re 18 years or older using selfies and government IDs. In the era of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-10-07/openai-s-nvidia-amd-deals-boost-1-trillion-ai-boom-with-circular-deals">a $1 trillion generative AI deal-industrial complex</a>, that feels like potentially putting your entire identity up for grabs on the internet. “Online ID checks may seem like a common-sense solution, but that facade hides a much darker truth: lawmakers are pressuring companies to implement surveillance and censorship tactics and it’s putting all of us in danger,” <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2025-03-06-new-letter-90-civil-rights-and-privacy-organizations-condemn-id-checking-bills-citing-effectiveness-censorship-and-privacy-concerns/">anti-surveillance campaigner</a> Sarah Philips told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em><em>&nbsp;</em>in an email.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Chat, we are cooked</p> <p>Discord is being extorted by the people who compromised their Zendesk instance</p> <p>They've got 1.5TB of age verification related photos. 2,185,151 photos</p> <p>tl;dr 2.1m Discord users drivers license and/or passport might be leaked.

The samples reportedly include screengrabs of thumbnails of users’ identification selfies as well as a help desk ticket that seemingly belongs to alleged <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">Charlie Kirk shooter Tyler Robinson</a>.</p>

 <p>How did the hackers get this data to begin with? A spokesperson for ZenDesk, the third-party customer service company supporting Discord, told 404 Media its systems were “not compromised.” Infosec account vx-underground <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1976238815665856646?ref=404media.co">was told</a> the breach came via an outsourced support agent.</p>

 <p>“All affected users globally have been contacted and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, data protection authorities, and external security experts,” Discord spokesperson Nu Wexler told <em>The Verge</em> earlier this week. “We’ve secured the affected systems and ended work with the compromised vendor. We take our responsibility to protect your personal data seriously and understand the concern this may cause.”</p> <p>Discord did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the claims it’s being extorted or the vulnerability that led to the hack.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After originally being scheduled for a release in Q2 2025, Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era’s Early Access has been pushed to 2026. A specific window for the year wasn’t announced.</p>



<p>As part of Ubisoft’s celebration of the Might &amp; Magic franchise’s 30th anniversary, it was also revealed that the Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era demo is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241970/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam.</a></p>



<p>First announced during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-announced-by-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamescom 2024</a>, Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era is the eighth installment of the long-running turn-based strategy game. It’s the first title in the series since 2015’s Might &amp; Magic Heroes VII.</p>



<p>The game features six factions at launch—Temple, Necropolis, Sylvan, Dungeon, Hive, and Schism—as well as several modes, including campaign, random single maps, custom maps, local multiplayer, and online multiplayer with modes like classic, single-hero, and arena. </p>



<p>Online multiplayer, for the first time in series history, will even feature general matchmaking that allows you to quickly jump into a game with other players.</p>

<p>As mentioned, the game was first set to launch in Q2 2025, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed in June</a> to “later in 2025”. At the time, Unfrozen said it was done to “ensure we give Olden Era the care it deserves”.</p>



<p><strong>“From the beginning, our goal has been to create something truly special, and that takes time, care, and iteration,”</strong> they said. <strong>“However, as an indie studio, we need a bit more time to get everything ready for the big Early Access release.”</strong></p>
