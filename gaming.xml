            <p>HBO's CEO has suggested that the TV adaptation of The Last of Us could be wrapped up as soon as next season.</p>
<p>Asked to confirm if The Last of Us' upcoming season was "final" in an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/hbo-casey-bloys-the-pitt-heated-rivalry-euphoria-interview-1236700801/">Deadline</a>, CEO and chairperson of HBO, Casey Bloys, said: "It certainly seems that way, but on decisions like that, we will defer to the showrunners. So you can ask them."</p>

<p>Previously, that aforementioned showrunner, Craig Mazin, had claimed that the team <em>was</em> working to a four-season plan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">insisting there was "no way" the narrative could be wrapped up in three seasons</a>.</p>
<p>That wasn't even the first time the magic number four has been floated in regard to The Last of Us' TV adaptation, either. Mazin started the chatter all the way back in 2023, suggesting the show could "end up being three or five [seasons]. But four seems like a good number. Some seasons, because of the story we're telling, will need fewer episodes and some will need more."</p><p>Mazin discussed a four-season arc last May, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Neil Druckmann stepped away from the TV adapation's third season last September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-will-retain-high-level-role-on-the-last-of-us-season-three-to-ensure-its-as-deeply-faithful-as-season-one">stating he'd accomplished his "crazy goal" of elevating video games</a>. Mazin has yet to publicly respond to Bloys' comment.</p>
<p>ICYMI, the upcoming third season of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-three-to-recast-manny">HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation will feature a new actor playing WLF member Manny</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-timeline-explained</link>
            <guid>1422142</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The ninth entry in the mainline Resident Evil series is fast approaching, but if you’re thinking that it could be the ideal point to jump in for the first time, you’ll almost certainly be left wondering what the hell is going on as you play through its opening hours. Resident Evil Requiem builds atop a three-decade legacy of survival horror, so you’re going to have to do some homework before you get started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help you out, we’ve put together a (very condensed) synopsis of the main Resident Evil story and everything you need to know leading into Resident Evil Requiem, presented in chronological order. As I’m sure you’ve already worked out,<strong> the following contains spoilers</strong> – lots and lots of spoilers – for the entire Resident Evil series prior to Requiem. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil Zero<br>July 23, 1998</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-0-1769098847328.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s July 23, 1998. The Bravo Team of Raccoon City Police’s elite S.T.A.R.S division is dispatched to investigate a number of murders in the Arklay region. The team believe evidence can be found in the area’s mountains, but their helicopter crashes before they can reach their landing zone. Survivor Rebecca Chambers makes her way towards a nearby spooky-looking mansion in an attempt to find the rest of Bravo Team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before she makes it to the house, Rebecca, along with her newly acquired convict companion Billy Coen, come across an abandoned training facility where they discover that its former director, Dr James Marcus, along with former partner, Oswell E. Spencer, were responsible for a new biological weapon dubbed the T-Virus: a deadly infection that turns humans into zombies and other monstrosities. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil<br>July 24, 1998</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-1769098864537.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team is dispatched to find out what happened to the missing Bravo team. Their search leads Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, Barry Burton, and team leader Albert Wesker to the aforementioned grand estate, the Spencer Mansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gang splits up and discovers the horrible fates of the missing S.T.A.R.S. members, who have been decimated by the monstrous results of the T-virus. As he explores the mansion’s many rooms and hidden chambers, Chris finds Bravo team member Rebecca Chambers still alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jill and Chris eventually discover that the Umbrella Corporation, a pharmaceutical company with shady business practices, is behind the illegal experiments that led to undead horrors (and the odd oversized animal) roaming the mansion’s halls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, once they reach a sinister laboratory hidden beneath the house, the duo discover that Wesker is not actually a loyal S.T.A.R.S. operative, but a traitor who works for Umbrella. Wesker infects himself with a strain of the T-virus as part of an elaborate plan that also involves releasing a new biological super weapon, the “Tyrant”, from containment. Unfortunately for him, the creature swiftly kills him. After managing to defeat the Tyrant, the remaining S.T.A.R.S. team members escape the lab (relatively) unscathed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our heroic survivors return to Raccoon City, only to learn that the corruption runs deep. They decide to go rogue, leaving the RPD to investigate the grand corporate conspiracy. Chris heads off to Europe solo, while Jill stays in the city to learn more about Umbrella.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 3<br>September 28, 1998</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-3-1769098887240.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s September 1998, just a few months after the Spencer Mansion incident, and Raccoon City is overrun with zombies. Umbrella sees the outbreak as an opportunity to test its latest bioweapon, the experimental Nemesis; a hulking beast armed with a rocket launcher, tasked only with the destruction of all remaining S.T.A.R.S. members.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Jill desperately tries to escape the outbreak with the relentless Nemesis hot on her heels, rookie R.P.D. officer Leon S. Kennedy and Chris Redfield’s younger sister, Claire, both arrive in Raccoon City at the worst possible time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 2<br>September 29, 1998</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-2-1769098902156.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After being separated following a car accident, Leon and Claire agree to meet up at the nearby police station. Unfortunately for both of them, the building is already infested by the undead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As she navigates the station’s dangerous hallways in search of information about her brother’s whereabouts, Claire runs into Sherry Birkin, a young girl pursued by a monstrous weirdo who not only turns out to be her Dad, but also Umbrella's leading scientist, William Birkin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turns out Billy B had planned to betray his corporate masters and sell his newly developed G-virus, but he was gunned down by Umbrella before he had the chance. As he bled out, William managed to infect himself with the G-Virus. His monstrous form massacred Umbrella’s troops and proceeded to dump both the G- and T-virus formulas into Raccoon City’s water supply, creating the enormous mess all our characters now have to deal with. Nice one, Willy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Leon runs into Ada Wong, an FBI agent seeking the G-Virus for her own investigation into Umbrella’s corruption. The two decide to form an alliance, for now…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leon and Ada run into Birkin’s wife, Annette, who is not a big fan of the pair. They follow Annette deep underground to a secret Umbrella facility called NEST in hope of securing the G-virus sample.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pretty much simultaneously, Claire also arrives at NEST, in search of a vaccine for the now-infected Sherry. Leon manages to obtain the G-Virus sample but runs into the hideously deformed William, who mortally wounds his wife. As she struggles to hold on, Annette reveals to Leon that Ada is not what she seems: she’s actually a mercenary looking to sell the G-Virus to the highest bidder. Ada arrives on the scene and demands the G-Virus, but before Leon can hand it over, Annette manages to shoot her, sending both Ada and the virus sample falling into the lab’s seemingly bottomless chasm. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Claire finds a vaccine for Sherry. As Annette administers it to her daughter, Claire tangles with an out-of-control William. Sherry is cured, but Annette eventually dies of her injuries. The facility is set to self-destruct, and Claire, Sherry, and Leon board a train to escape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With NEST destroyed, the crew finally manage to escape the nightmare and, on the outskirts of Racoon City, vow to continue their fight against Umbrella.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil Outbreak<br>September 23 - October 1, 1998</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While Jill, Leon, and Claire are dealing with their own issues amidst a zombie outbreak, eight other Raccoon City residents are also in a desperate fight for survival. Among them is a local journalist, Alyssa Ashcroft, who is trying to shine a spotlight on Umbrella’s evil ways. Remember her name, as it’ll come in handy when you start playing Resident Evil Requiem. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alyssa manages to escape Raccoon City before the government annihilates the entire area with an evidence-destroying thermobaric missile strike, carrying information that could expose Umbrella once and for all.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 3 (continued)<br>October 1, 1998</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-3-cont-1769098919835.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in Racoon City, in the hours before the missile strike, Jill Valentine is infected with the T-Virus. Fortunately for her, Carlos Oliveria – an uncharacteristically friendly Umbrella mercenary – arrives on the scene to not only cure Jill, but also help her find the important vaccine that could save the city. Unfortunately, the government has a different “cure”; our heroes discover the plans to wipe out Raccoon City, which is publicly explained away as the only sure method to eradicate the zombie outbreak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Carlos and Jill head to <em>another </em>underground lab, this time creatively called “NEST 2”. Unfortunately, the Nemesis is still alive and very much still in pursuit. Jill and Carlos manage to take out the abomination once and for all, and with the vaccine sample in hand, manage to escape the city before the missile hits. Unfortunately, Nicholai, Carlos’s former colleague/secret operative, is waiting for them and manages to destroy the vaccine vial. Jill and Carlos take down Nicholai, leaving him for dead, and escape just before government-approved thermobaric hellfire arrives to completely demolish Raccoon City for good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And as is tradition, our hero vows to take down Umbrella before the credits roll…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil: Code Veronica<br>December 27-28, 1998</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-code-veronica-1769100639172.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Three months after escaping from Racoon City, Claire Redfield, still in search of her brother, attempts to raid a European Umbrella facility. Things go south and she’s captured, taken to an island prison ruled over by Alfred Ashford, the governor of Rockfort Island.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As is mandatory for a Resident Evil game, an outbreak occurs, and amidst the chaos Claire is freed, allowing her to get to work looking for Chris and escaping the island. Unfortunately, Mr. Redfield is nowhere to be found, so after much trouble, Claire tries to escape in a plane. Ashford, who is revealed to have a split personality disorder and often believes himself to be his twin sister, Alexia, remotely takes control of the plane and crashes it into <em>another </em>Umbrella facility, this time in Antarctica. Knocked unconscious, Claire has a dream that turns out to be the plot of Resident Evil Survivor 2. Weird. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ashford, believing Claire to be a spy, pursues her in a quest for revenge. But after he’s fatally wounded, he frees the real version of his sister, Alexia, who has been cryogenically frozen this entire time, her body riddled with a new virus called T-Veronica.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, back on Rockford Island, none other than Chris Redfield shows up, looking for Claire. But rather than finding his sister, he runs into his old pal/mortal enemy, Albert Wesker, who’s alive, super strong, and on a mission to find the T-Veronica sample. Turns out he had actually planned to be killed by the Tyrant back in the Spencer Mansion, as that would ensure he could reach the full potential of some experimental virus he was infected with… or something. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pair make their way to Antarctica, where Chris hopes to be finally reunited with Claire, and Wesker hopes to secure the T-Veronica sample. A restored, very powerful Alexia becomes the final boss of Chris’ latest adventure, and everyone escapes the facility before – you guessed it – it self-destructs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wesker claims a virus-infected corpse to experiment on. Chris and Claire vow to take down Umbrella… are you seeing a pattern here?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 4<br>Autumn, 2004</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-4-1769098936664.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Six years have passed, and the Umbrella Corporation is now long gone due to a government suspension and stock value crash. Is this the lamest way possible for a big bad to go out? It’s certainly up there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leon S. Kennedy, former rookie RPD officer, is now a government agent with full permission to roundhouse kick anyone who stands in his way. He’s sent on a mission to rural Spain, where the president's daughter, Ashley, is being held by kidnappers. As he explores the area, he discovers that not only are the kidnappers part of a cult called Los Illuminados, but they’re also all infected by a brand new mind-controlling parasite: Las Plagas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Leon hunts for Ashley, he unexpectedly bumps into someone he thought long dead, Ada Wong, who is very much alive and is once again on the hunt for virus samples.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After rescuing Ashley, Leon confronts the cult’s leader, Saddler, and, with the help of Ada, defeats him, bringing down the parasite and all the hordes it infected. Once again showing her true colours, Ada takes a sample of Las Plagas and escapes by helicopter, but not before – you guessed it – setting the base to self-destruct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leon and Ashley manage to dramatically escape on a jet ski, which they appear to ride all the way from Spain back to the US. I mean, they probably just went back to the mainland and took more traditional routes, but imagining they jet-ski’d across the Atlantic is funnier, so let’s just say they did that.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil: Revelations<br>2005</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-revelations-1769098954618.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Shortly after the events of Resident Evil 4, our original protagonists, Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, become involved in a new investigation into biological organic weapons. They discover a new strain of the T-Virus called T-Abyss, developed by evil organisation Il Veltro, which plans to use its new weapon to infect a fifth of the world’s oceans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot of evil plots and betrayals unfold, involving names and organisations that mostly don’t feature in the wider series except for one: the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, or BSAA. Chris and Jill are founding members, and this new organisation’s motives become the driving force for these characters going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, Chris and Jill survive the events of Revelations, taking us directly into the next chapter of Resident Evil. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 5 - Lost in Nightmares DLC<br>August, 2006</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Two years after Resident Evil 4, our original big bad, Wesker, is still on the loose. Chris and Jill, now operating under the banner of the BSAA, follow a thread that should lead them to Umbrella’s founder, Oswald E. Spencer. Instead, they run into Albert Wesker, who has killed Spencer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wesker, seemingly even more powerful than before and now dodging bullets for fun, is more than a match for Chris and Jill. To save a wounded Chris, Jill sacrifices herself, sending both her and Wesker to their deaths. Chris, understandably, is a bit sad.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 5<br>March 4-6, 2009</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-5-1769098971612.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Almost three years after Jill’s death, Chris is tasked with apprehending terrorist Ricardo Irving, who is selling bio-organic weapons in Africa. Along with his new partner, Sheva, Chris discovers that the locals are infected by a modified Las Plagas parasite. The duo set out to solve the crisis, but Chris has another thing on his mind: the BSAA believes Jill could still be alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After defeating a mutated Irving, Chris and Sheva learn that Tricell, the company that funds the BSAA, has taken over Umbrella’s seedy work in conjunction with – shock, horror – <em>Albert Wesker, </em>who is very much still alive and has been conducting human experiments. Unfortunately, one of his victims is Jill, who is <em>also</em> still alive and now under Wesker’s control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chris and Sheva manage to subdue Jill and remove Wesker’s mind-control device before it’s too late. Wesker tries to flee on a plane, which crash-lands in a volcano. After some boulder punching, Chris and Sheva finally kill Wesker once and for all, and all is well in the world… for now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil: Revelations 2<br>January, 2011</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-revelations-2-1769098994900.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Claire Redfield is now a member of TerraSave, an anti-bioterrorism taskforce, and once again finds herself trapped in an island prison, this time with her new partner, Moria Burton, daughter of Barry Burton. Remember him from the Spencer Mansion incident? He’s the “Jill Sandwich” guy…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jill and Moira are directed around the prison’s labyrinth-like halls by someone known only as the Overseer, all while being stalked by mysterious monsters. After the entire playbook of typical Resident Evil hijinks involving other survivors, shady corporations, and betrayal unfold, it’s revealed that the Overseer is a woman named Alex Wesker. Although she shares the surname, she’s not actually a relative of the series’ infamous villain, but rather a child who was kidnapped for her “talents” and inducted into “The Wesker Project”, a sinister plot developed by Umbrella founder Oswell E. Spencer to try and develop a race of superior beings. Alex has been doing her own experiments on the prison island, creating a fresh batch of monstrosities. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, Claire and Moria corner Alex, and with nowhere left to run, Alex commits suicide. But not before, <em>of course</em>, setting the base to self-destruct. Claire manages to escape, but unfortunately, Moira is trapped under the rubble. Enter big daddy Barry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Six months pass before Barry reaches the island, who has been desperately chasing Moria’s SOS signal. But before finding his daughter, he comes face-to-face with Alex, who’s now heavily mutated into her disgusting final form, complete with orange glowing weak points.

Mercenary Jake Muller is immune to the virus, on account of being the child of Albert Wesker (who has… let’s say “unique” DNA after all those experiments), and so is believed to be the key to creating a vaccine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2013, the American president decides enough is enough with all these bioterrorism incidents, and that it’s time to reveal what really happened in Raccoon City. However, before he can spill the beans, there’s another viral attack. The president, now a zombie, must be taken down by his loyal agent, Leon Kennedy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ada Wong arrives on the scene to tell Leon that National Security Advisor Derek Simmons is affiliated with Neo-Umbrella, and is behind the terror attack that zombified the president. Leon heads to China in pursuit of Simmons. Chris Redfield, now wracked by post-traumatic stress and a thirst for revenge after his team was slaughtered by Ada, also heads to China. As does Jake, because, you know, plot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s no secret that Resident Evil 6 is the most convoluted game in the series, so let’s just get through this quickly:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Chris finds out Jake’s true identity, and despite an awkward moment where Chris tells Jake he killed his dad, they mostly work it out. </li><li>Simmons dies. </li><li>Chris’s buddy, Piers, is wounded, then grows a new arm thanks to the C-Virus, and saves Chris. </li><li>Jake kills his boss, who’s not worth talking about.</li><li>We discover that there are two Adas, with one being an imposter called Carla.</li><li>Finally, all the good guys win and go their separate ways. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Basically, a lot is going on, and it’s not very good.

His search eventually leads him deep into Louisiana, where he finds her imprisoned by the Bakers, a very odd and very disgusting family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ethan is captured by the family’s patriarch, Jack Baker, and forced to join a vomit-inducing dinner with Jack’s wife, Marguerite, son Lucas, and a mysterious elderly woman. It turns out the entire family is infected by something called “mold”, a sort of parasitic, fungal virus that has the added benefit of increasing your resilience, but the downside of making you just a bit gross.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Side note: you can find a newspaper clipping written by Alyssa Ashcroft in the Baker’s house. Remember her from Resident Evil Outbreak? Turns out she’s still a journalist, now investigating the disappearances in Louisiana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After escaping and managing to kill hideous forms of both Jack and Marguerite, Ethan reunites with his wife and develops a serum to help shake off her apparent mold infection. The couple attempt to flee on a boat, but the vessel is capsized by a mysterious creature that turns out to be a “girl” named Eveline. This child is actually a bio-weapon that Mia, who’s actually a secret agent, was tasked with escorting. Eveline is responsible for the Baker family’s mind-altering infection because she was desperate to create her own family. You know, like all bioweapons are. Classic stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ethan injects Eveline with a toxin, which causes her to revert to her true form: the mysterious old woman from the Baker’s disgusting dinner. It turns out she’s been rapidly aging. Of course, a senior is hardly an ideal final boss, so Eveline mutates into a giant blob like all classic Resident Evil big bads do, and after a climatic confrontation with Ethan (who gets a little help from a recently arrived military squad), she’s finally destroyed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a final twist, the leader of the military squad is revealed to be none other than Chris Redfield, who emerges from a helicopter branded with the <em>Umbrella </em>logo. Man, things have really changed around here.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 7 - Not a Hero DLC<br>July 20, 2017</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/resident-evil-7-not-a-hero-1769099051621.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Chris and his team pursue Lucas Baker, who had avoided Eveline’s mind control thanks to a serum provided to him by a new shadowy organisation called The Connections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They were the ones behind Eveline’s creation, and Lucas had been gathering data on her for them. Naturally, he planned to betray his masters, because Lucas is a Resident Evil villain, and that’s apparently part of the contract.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After working his way through a series of traps, Chris manages to kill a mutated Lucas.

On a desperate quest to find Rose, Ethan works his way through the abandoned village and into a nearby castle inhabited by vampires, most notably an enormous goth mommy called Lady Dimiterscu. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lady D, along with a wider group of oddities including a fish man and a cowboy Magneto, all belong to cult that worships Mother Miranda; a god-like, mold-infected matriarch who, in a quest to resurrect her dead daughter, Eva, became consumed by the infection and spread it to her four elevated lords and houses. Ethan discovers a crest for these four lords that looks eerily similar to Umbrella’s logo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ethan’s journey to rescue Rose and take down Miranda’s lords eventually leads him back to Chris Redfield, who explains that the Mia he gunned down wasn’t actually Mia at all, but rather a shape-shifting Mother Miranda. Miranda believes Ethan and Mia’s daughter, Rose, is the successor of bioweapon, Eveline, based on the fact that both her parents were infected by the mold. After Miranda finally confronts Ethan in her true form, she explains that the mold will help rebirth Rose as her own daughter. Without hesitation, Miranda rips out Ethan’s heart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chris and his squad launch a full assault against Mother Miranda, battling through her waves of monsters and destroying a large mold barrier that protects her. Once inside, Chris and the team discover a large mold root called the Megamycete; the source of the mold that plagued both the village and the Baker family. Turns out the Megamycete not only infects its victims, but it also absorbs their DNA and memories. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chris plants a bomb, but before destroying the mold once and for all, he passes through Miranda’s lab for one last lore dump. He discovers the entirety of her plan to find a suitable vessel for her daughter’s consciousness to be reborn into. Miranda was also responsible for the creation of Eveline, working with The Connections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not the most shocking revelation, though: Chris discovers that Oswell E. Spencer, founder of Umbrella, was actually a student of Miranda's and began his work on the progenitor virus based on her teachings. To honour this, he designed Umbrella’s logo after Miranda’s four lords’ symbol. So not only is Miranda responsible for everything in Resident Evil 7 and Village, but she’s the inspiration that started this <em>entire </em>30-year, virus-riddled affair!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Chris exits the exposition-packed hallway, he encounters the true version of Mia, who’s very much alive and reveals that Ethan isn’t quite dead, either. It turns out that Miranda didn’t kill Ethan after all – Jack Baker did, way back at the start of Resident Evil 7. Ethan was infected by the Mold, which had kept him moving and “alive” this entire time, and explained how he could regularly reattach body parts with just a bit of healing juice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite his mold infection, Ethan is falling apart, only able to muster just enough energy for one last stand against Mother Miranda. Upon defeating the big bad once and for all, he hands his daughter over to Chris and agrees to stay behind with the detonation device that will activate the bomb planted on the Megamycete, destroying the village, the mold, and himself once and for all. Ethan triggers the explosion as Chris, Mia, and Rose escape.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil Requiem<br>October 2026</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/residentthumb-1765504800570.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The upcomming adventures of Leon Kennedy and Grace Ashcroft take place in 2026.

She takes a jaunt through a version of the village her father was once trapped in, guided by the spirit “Michael”, who is actually Ethan’s remaining consciousness. As she explores, Rose is taunted by the trapped consciousness of Mother Miranda, who is desperate to escape this realm of memories. With the help of Ethan and her newfound abilities, Rose manages to defeat Mother Miranda and share one last moment with her father before she returns to the real world.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The hardcore survival simulator Road To Vostok will launch into early access on April 7th, developer Antti has announced. To mark the announcement a new trailer has been released showing off new parts of Road To Vostok, including environments and dynamic events. The game will also launch with a discount of 25%, with the price set as €14,99, but that will rise to €19.99 two weeks after Road To Vostok’s launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Early Access Trailer | Road to Vostok" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTFgTRsz43Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Road To Vostok is a single player experience set in a post apocalyptic border area between Finland and Russia, and the are is called Area 05. In this region, players need to learn to survive, loot items, deal with other survivors, and plan every step before heading to Vostok. Preparation is heavily encouraged because once the first steps are taken into Vostok there is no going back, as it is a permadeath zone. While there are story elements around the world, Road To Vostok is a primarily sandbox experience so players can experience their own stories. The game will also support mods so there may also be new stories to experience created by the community.</p>
<p>When Road To Vostok eventually gets its full release it will feature 10 Area 05 maps, 10 Vostok maps, 10 Crossing Points, 10 Shelters, three trader types including generalists, gunsmiths, and doctor, three enemy types including bandits, guards, and the military, special NPCs like driver, grandma, shaman, fisherman, and scientists, over 300 weapons, and over 30 weapons. Road To Vostok will be launched on PC first, but console versions are being considered. In terms of multiplayer, no PvP content is being considered but Road To Vostok may eventually get co-op depending on the success on the single player release.</p>

Welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island">Last time</a>, we matched up a pair of covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/super_mario_advance_3_yoshis_island">Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island</a>, and it was a pretty close-run contest. The classic SMW2 art came out on top in the end, though, with North America taking 59% of the vote, leaving the pretty Japanese variant with 41%.</p>
<p>This week, to mark the announcement of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-announces-launch-line-up-for-switch-online-virtual-boy">Virtual Boy's Nintendo Switch Online launch line-up</a>, we're taking a look at one of the titles that you'll be able to play from 17th February: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a>. This <strong>Star Fox</strong>-style space shooter joins the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/teleroboxer">Teleroboxer</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a> on the service right from the jump, so it seems only right that we all become acquainted with its box art ahead of time.</p>
<p>Being a Virtual Boy title, there's obviously no European cover to look at this week, but the North American and Japanese designs make for a neat head-to-head. So, let's get into it.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:3793,196709 @ 1769957455 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9b139dcf8dc29"><a title="Red Alarm - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b139dcf8dc29/red-alarm-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14253-red-alarm">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American box art is just about as bright and colourful as they come. It's packed full of action with ships, explosions, a trench run backdrop vaguely reminiscent of the Death Star, and one of those green-outline maps that you only ever find in spy thrillers. Sure, it couldn't look less like the actual game, but it does a good job of selling the experience</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="a58c1fe1dc9df"><a title="Red Alarm - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a58c1fe1dc9df/red-alarm-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/14253-red-alarm">T&amp;E Soft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ooooh, the Japanese design goes full <strong>Top Gun</strong>. This is less about action and more about looking cool (something that's not so simple with a Virtual Boy headset strapped to your noggin). Be it the muted colour palette of blacks and reds — a more realistic image of the vibrancy you'll see in game — or the badass ship reflection in the central pilot's visor, this cover oozes cool.</p>

            <guid>1422085</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Fantasy MMORPG <strong>Ashes of Creation</strong>, developed by <strong>Intrepid Studios</strong>, has suddenly imploded: with several key members already resigned and mass layoffs incoming, <strong>the game's future seems dead</strong>. A few hours ago, people started noticing that many employees had changed their LinkedIn status to 'open for work', including Director of Communications and Marketing <strong>Margaret Krohn</strong>, who only hinted at the circumstances <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7423531204198436864/?originTrackingId=7VqOggD80HGyVa1KG3AfeQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a LinkedIn blog post</a>:</p>



<p><em>As for how this all ended… I don’t really have the words. It wasn’t what I expected. But I’m holding onto the good because there was so much of it.</em></p>



<p>More information came to light when finally founder, CEO, and Creative Director <strong>Steven Sharif</strong> shared the following message in the official Ashes of Creation Discord channel:</p>



<p><em>I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation. Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support. Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership team resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue WARN Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff.</em></p>



<p><em>I cannot responsibly speak to further details at this time due to ongoing legal and governance matters. What I can say is that the developers and staff acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty they are now facing. I am incredibly dismayed by the situation.</em></p>



<p>Sharif says in his statement that <strong>the Board made decisions that he did not feel comfortable carrying out</strong>. However, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qsm3r2/the_board_composed_of_me_and_my_husband/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to public records from the State of California</a>, <strong>the Board includes only him (as CEO and Secretary) and his husband, John Moore</strong>, who is listed as Chief Financial Officer.</p>



<p>Originally announced in 2016, Ashes of Creation <a href="https://wccftech.com/ashes-of-creation-funding-massive-mmorpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was funded on Kickstarter the following year</a>, <strong>earning over $3.2 million in pledges</strong>. Intrepid Studios then continued selling pre-release access to the game for a long time, and <strong>it did not take long for some users to warn that it could be a scam</strong>, especially because of the founder's past in the shady world of <strong>Multi-Level Marketing (MLM)</strong>. However, the development team posted regular updates, and the game did seem to be progressing, albeit very slowly. In late 2021, the studio <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ashes-of-creation-mmorpg-is-the-latest-game-to-upgrade-to-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">switched from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Eventually, last month, Intrepid made the decision to <strong>launch the MMORPG on Steam Early Access</strong> while it was still technically in Alpha. It was a controversial decision, especially because Sharif maintained that the game just needed more feedback from a wider player base, while funding was supposedly not an issue, as Sharif would contribute his own money, as he had from the start.</p>



<p>However, due to the game's blatantly incomplete state, reception to Ashes of Creation <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> was 'Mixed'. User reviews, both recent and total, sit at 51% right now. According to SteamDB, the MMO only reached a concurrent player peak of <strong>31.8K</strong> at launch and has dwindled ever since. Overall, sales estimates range between <strong>220K</strong> and <strong>320K</strong> units. This means the game earned between <strong>$11</strong> and <strong>$16</strong> <strong>million</strong> on Steam, although with Valve's 30% cut, the money that actually went to Intrepid ranges between <strong>$7.7</strong> and <strong>$11.2 million</strong>.</p>



<p>There's one last tidbit that dismayed backers have pointed out: in the original Kickstarter campaign, Intrepid <strong>had promised to refund all backers in full if the game did not launch</strong>. But it did launch, and people are wondering whether that wasn't simply a way to 'fulfill' that promise (which, however, was not legally binding).</p>



<p>Whatever the case, it's yet another blow <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a genre that was already flailing</a> after several high-profile closures, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon's New World</a> and its in-development <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new The Lord of the Rings MMO</a>. Speaking to <strong>Wccftech</strong>, two industry veterans, <strong>Greg Street</strong> and <strong>Jack Emmert</strong>, who also recently had their MMOs cancelled after NetEase pulled funding from their studios, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-model-future-western-mmo-jack-emmert-greg-street/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed to Warframe as the best model for Western developers</a></strong>: start small and slowly expand.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/vitality-push-bcgame-lower-bracket-iem-krakow/</link>
            <guid>1422076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>IEM Krakow yielded a long-awaited clash between BC.Game’s Oleksandr ‘s1mple’ Kostyliev and Vitality’s Mathieu ‘ZywOo’ Herbaut this weekend. It was the first time in almost three years that the pair had met on the competitive stage, and it ended with s1mple’s squad being forced unceremoniously into the lower bracket at IEM Krakow.</p>



<p>It was almost a predictable outcome, and it comes after s1mple declared ZywOo as being the closest Counter-Strike pro player to his own ‘prime’ status, back in the day.</p>







<h2 id="h-into-the-lower-run-for-bc-game">Into The Lower Run for BC.Game</h2>



<p>BC.Game opened the series against Vitality with the upper hand, but quickly faltered, with Vitality shutting the door on the team in rapid fashion. The ZywOo-led squad dropped just <strong>one round </strong>before closing out the map in the second half, going on to eliminate BCG from the upper bracket with a decisive 13-5 finish.</p>



<p>Both ZywOo and s1mple held their own, with the former edging out the latter in the numbers, but it’s a team game at the end of the day, and Vitality was the better unit on stage.</p>



<p>Before IEM Krakow, the two superstar competitors hadn’t met since Gamers8 in 2023, hosted in Saudi Arabia. The event has long since been rebranded as the Esports World Cup, but it was the last time that the two gamers shared a stage on opposing sides of the table.</p>



<p>Despite the loss, BC.Game’s journey in Krakow is far from over. They’re now in the lower bracket of their group, and while they have to focus squarely on survival, they have a chance to produce a huge upset over FaZe Clan tomorrow, February 2nd. The squad, featuring the talents of broky, karrigan, frozen, jcobb, and Twistzz, was also pushed into the lower run, but by a dominant 3DMAX side.</p>

<p>VALORANT’s next Night Market event lands on February 5th and runs to March 2nd, allowing players to secure sweet skins for a discount. The trouble is, you won’t know what skins are in<strong> your </strong>Night Market until the event kicks off, as players are offered <strong>six randomized skins</strong>, rather than the option to choose a specific selection.</p>



<p>Below, we’ve outlined the full spread of VALORANT skins coming to the Night Market this February. Take a look and see if there’s anything you’re hoping to unlock.</p>







<h2 id="h-full-list-of-valorant-night-market-skins">Full List of VALORANT Night Market Skins</h2>



<p>VALORANT’s Night Market is a sought-after and anticipated event that surfaces a few times a year. It offers some deep discounts on the game’s best skins and allows players to secure skins that might have long since disappeared from the active store rotation.</p>



<p>Typically, the Night Market <strong>only </strong>features skins from a select few tiers of the ecosystem, locking out Exclusive and Ultra skins, which are much more valuable and boast higher price tags that Riot Games just doesn’t want to discount!</p>



<p>If you’re waiting for the full list of Night Market skins for February’s run, you don’t have to look any further than <strong>right here:</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Haunted Chocolatier is Still Coming, But It’s Taking a While to Finish]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/haunted-chocolatier-long-time-to-finish/</link>
            <guid>1422064</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ConcernedApe has addressed concerns (does that work?) surrounding Haunted Chocolatier, the next major release from the developer of Stardew Valley, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-smashes-steam-record-portal-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most positively rated game</a> ever released. In a recent blog post, ConcernedApe came out to answer questions and quell fears from fans about Haunted Chocolatier’s lengthy development cycle.</p>



<p>It has been years since Haunted Chocolatier was announced, but ConcernedApe stressed that, while it’s taking a while to finish, it’s <strong>absolutely </strong>still coming.</p>







<h2 id="h-i-am-not-going-to-abandon-haunted-chocolatier">‘I Am Not Going to Abandon Haunted Chocolatier’</h2>



<p>ConcernedApe, whose real name is Eric Barone, released Stardew Valley almost a decade ago, in February 20216. His second game, Haunted Chocolatier, has a similar vibe and was unveiled in 2021. In <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent blog post</a>, Barone admitted he announced it way too early, but he ‘had his reasons’.</p>



<p>He then went into more depth about some key concerns regarding the game, such as the leading worry that it might have been abandoned by the solo developer, and the scrapped content would be pulled into Stardew.</p>



<p>He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>No. First, I am not going to abandon Haunted Chocolatier. But even if I did, I am not going to add it to Stardew Valley. Stardew Valley and Haunted Chocolatier are separate games. </p>



<p>It doesn’t even make sense from a technical perspective, as Haunted Chocolatier is written from scratch, it’s not the same “engine” as Stardew Valley. You can’t just copy and paste Haunted Chocolatier into Stardew Valley.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Barone has turned his attention to Stardew Valley again, working on a critical update to appease the millions of people who still play the game. He said that he’s only working on Stardew again because it’s such a drastically popular game and he ‘still has additional ideas for how to improve it.’</p>



<p>In the closing sections of the blog post, Barone confirmed that Haunted Chocolatier still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s <strong>not </strong>cancelled or abandoned.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Ashes of Creation Shutting Down? Cancellation Controversy Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-ashes-of-creation-shutting-down-explained/</link>
            <guid>1422058</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ashes of Creation is an ambitious MMORPG that was released in early access in December 2025. The launch came after almost a decade of playtests, production, and evolution, but it has met a vicious end as the entire studio behind the game has crumbled. In this guide, we’re answering a clear question: ‘Is Ashes of Creation shutting down?’</p>



<p>It seems like the writing is firmly on the wall with Ashes of Creation, which was released just weeks ago by Intrepid Studios onto the Steam platform, but what’s the truth of it?</p>







<h2 id="h-what-happened-to-ashes-of-creation">What Happened to Ashes of Creation?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ashes-of-creation-collapse-entire-intrepid-studios-laid-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashes of Creation <strong>imploded</strong></a><strong> </strong>around February 1st, 2026. On social media, reports surfaced of Intrepid Studios, the game’s developer, facing complete and indiscriminate layoffs after the studio’s leadership team collectively resigned.</p>



<p>Ashes of Creation’s Steven Sharif, Intrepid’s founder and the game’s creative director, explained in a statement that ‘the Board’ wrestled control of the company away from him, prompting <strong>his </strong>resignation. However, a subsequent investigation determined that Sharif might have been the <strong>sole member </strong>of the Board.</p>



<p>Ashes of Creation’s team has been completely laid off, and what’s worse, the company’s financial position meant that final paychecks couldn’t be processed. This is despite the game selling approximately 250,000 – 300,000 copies on Steam, under a $49.99 price tag.</p>



<p><strong>A global shutdown of Ashes of Creation is almost guaranteed</strong>, but at the time of writing, the game remained live on Steam. Intrepid Studios, however, has collapsed, and as of this point, has no staff to work on the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-ashes-of-creation-refund">How to Get Ashes of Creation Refund</h2>



<p>If you’ve played Ashes of Creation for less than two hours on Steam, you can collect a refund via Valve’s internal support channels, but if you’ve played for <strong>more </strong>than two hours, you’re not entitled to an instant refund.</p>



<p>However, you can still <strong>try </strong>to go through the customer support channels, as this is an extraordinary circumstance.</p>



<p>Many have predicted that class action lawsuits will surface, especially given the suspicious timing of the Ashes of Creation shutdown. The game’s Kickstarter always stated that if the game didn’t launch on Steam, full refunds to all backers would be issued. Even though it was only live on Steam for mere weeks, that clause was effectively fulfilled.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ashes of Creation, an old-school MMORPG that dropped in an alpha state on Steam after <strong>years </strong>of development, has imploded this weekend. The game has been struck with a total collapse, as the team at Intrepid Studios has either resigned or been laid off. It was just two days ago that the team at Intrepid was posting updates and promising a roadmap of improvements to the game.</p>



<p>In a recent message on the game’s Discord server, the company’s founder and creative director for AoC, Steven Sharif, made a damning statement about the situation. He stressed he was forced to resign after ‘control of the company’ was shifted away from him, prompting a walkout that ultimately led to the entire remaining company being laid off.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-ashes-of-creation-shutting-down">Is Ashes of Creation Shutting Down?</h2>



<p>It’s almost <strong>guaranteed </strong>that Ashes of Creation, the ambitious, old-school MMORPG that was in development for almost a decade, will disappear forever. In his statement on the AoC Discord server, company founder <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1qsldun/ashes_of_creation_has_just_been_canceled_all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steven Sharif wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation.</p>



<p>Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support.</p>



<p>Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership team resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue WARN Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff.</p>



<p>I cannot responsibly speak to further details at this time due to ongoing legal and governance matters. What I can say is that the developers and staff acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty they are now facing. I am incredibly dismayed by the situation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On Steam’s community forums, users came forward to declare the situation a ‘pump and dump scam’, with some suggesting that class action lawsuits should be sprung up to chase refunds.</p>



<p>However, that might be easier said than done. In a video shared on social media, an internal communication was shared, explaining that ‘all job titles and all positions’ would be hit by an ‘entire and permanent plant closing’. It was then explained that the expected payroll set to run on February 1 will <strong>not </strong>happen because of the company’s financial position.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>𝐀𝐒𝐇𝐄𝐒 𝐎𝐅 𝐂𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐋𝐎𝐎𝐊𝐒 𝐓𝐎 𝐁𝐄 𝐒𝐇𝐔𝐓𝐓𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐃𝐎𝐖𝐍</p><p>What some players thought would be the answer to all their MMO questions has come to an abrupt end with Game Director for Ashes of Creation (<a href="https://twitter.com/StevenJSharif?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@StevenJSharif</a>) stepping down.</p><p>The news comes after more… <a href="https://t.co/q1q53dJX0x">pic.twitter.com/q1q53dJX0x</a></p></div>— N_Tys (@N_Tys26) <a href="https://twitter.com/N_Tys26/status/2017792177167036842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>That means that employees under the WARN notice will <strong>not </strong>be paid, which will undoubtedly prompt financial suits.</p>



<p>If you load <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ashes of Creation’s Steam page</a> <strong>right now</strong>, you still have the option to purchase it for £41.99 ($49.99). According to SteamDB’s aggregate systems, as many as 319,000 people may have purchased Ashes of Creation, which averages out to around $14 million.</p>



<p>Those customers who picked up this early access title that has now been dropped just a month after release will be <strong>demanding </strong>satisfaction and compensation.</p>



<p>Popular creator ‘Pirate Software’ addressed the situation on socials, standing up for the developer somewhat:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Not really. At that time in development the game was doing just fine. Stuff was moving forward and the areas of the game he showed weren't actually flat featureless environments as he described.</p><p>It wasn't until the last 6-8 months that shit really hit the fan and fell apart.…</p></div>— Pirate Software (@PirateSoftware) <a href="https://twitter.com/PirateSoftware/status/2017849283043827851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Bizarrely, the situation took <strong>another turn </strong>when eagle-eyed and investigative fans turned up registration information for Intrepid Studios that confirmed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1qsnhhx/intrepid_studios_board_of_directors_is_just_steven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steven Sharif as the sole Board member</a>. This was taken from a filing made on December 30, 2025, and it lists Sharif as the CEO and an individual named John Moore as the CFO. </p>



<p>Sharif is the only named director on the Board, per the document. </p>



<p>On social media, users noticed a troubling clause <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1791529601/ashes-of-creation-new-mmorpg-by-intrepid-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in the game’s Kickstarter</a>, which explained that if the game <strong>doesn’t launch on Steam</strong>, full refunds will be issued to all backers. Well, guess what? The game <strong>launched on Steam,</strong> so that promise was effectively fulfilled. Coincidence?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a whole new month, and that means it’s time to smash another batch of NYT Connections puzzles! I’m here as always to provide you with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions so you can start February on the upswing with a series of instant successes. Below, you’ll find all the hints and tips you need to get through today’s NYT Connections as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Enjoy!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-1">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 1)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #966:</p>



<ul>
<li>WEDGE</li>



<li>HYPE</li>



<li>MORGAN</li>



<li>FLAT</li>



<li>BOP</li>



<li>THORN</li>



<li>BOOST</li>



<li>MULE</li>



<li>HEATER</li>



<li>SHARP</li>



<li>JAM</li>



<li>PLUG</li>



<li>GLUTE</li>



<li>CLOG</li>



<li>PITCH</li>



<li>BANGER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Ways to talk something up</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Footwear with a twist</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> Tracks that absolutely go off</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Hidden instruments</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 1:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-1-966">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 1 (#966)</h2>

</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Fancy a plant?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is a whole new take on the world of Pokémon, where you'll be able to farm, grow veggies, collect resources, build things, decorate, and of course, make friends with many different Pokémon.</p>
<p>With the game scheduled to arrive on the Switch 2 on <strong>5th March 2026</strong>, more pre-order bonuses are now beginning to surface online. As highlighted by Serebii.net, the latest one is available on Amazon in the US and Best Buy in Canada.</p>
<p>If you order the game from either of these places before the release date, you'll get a download code for a 'Flat Leaf Plant' item, which can be used to decorate spaces in the game. The same bonus has been previously made available on the Amazon store in Japan.</p>
<figure data-uuid="0fefb8d8c9db2"><a title="Pokémon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0fefb8d8c9db2/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: via Serebii.net / The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're not planning on getting Pokémon Pokopia from these stores, you'll apparently still be able to get this plant through regular gameplay. So no trainer should miss out!</p>
<p>Once again, Pokémon Pokopia launches exclusively for the Switch 2 this March. You can see what other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/where-to-pre-order-pokemon-pokopia-for-nintendo-switch-2">pre-order offers and bonuses</a> there are in our guide here on Nintendo Life, and find out more about the game in our previous coverage.</p>

            <p>
Crafting a world that begs to be explored is a tricky thing to do, especially when the world is kind of sucky, doubly so when it's woven mostly through words with only supplementary imagery to provide a broader context. Yet <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper's</a> is one I'm often thinking about because amongst all the grand sci-fi concepts is a grounded sense of reality that you'll always find in the best of the cyberpunk genre. And here I am, a year on from the second game's release, tempted to return once more, but this time in a form based on its tabletop origins.
</p>
<p>
Citizen Sleeper: Spindlejack is not technically a new game, it actually came out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/citizen-sleeper-now-has-a-free-solo-tabletop-rpg">last May</a> as a free-to-download mini-RPG, but now through Lost in Cult it is being turned into a tangible, physical thing you can add to your dragon's hoard of tabletop RPGs. Spindlejack takes place in a particular corner of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector">Citizen Sleeper 2's</a> world, on the Far Spindle, a place where the airbike riders are "notorious." It's a solo TTRPG, where you fly around said airbike making tricky deliveries for "cryo, reputation and fun."

<p>
Where this release mainly differs is obviously the physicality, coming with a set of 10 themed D6 dice, some fancy bits of informative paper, and stickers, but it also comes with a couple of additional modules. One is Sprocket's Shop, which comes with new upgrades and items for some added tactics and techniques. The other is a story-based one, Kadet's Climb, where you play as Kadet from the original video game, who is "trying to survive on the far Spindle as she rises up through the ranks of the station's most infamous delivery couriers."
</p><p>
I am certainly quite tempted by such a luxurious item, but again, none of us have to feel FOMO as it's available to play for free through <a href="https://jump-over-the-age.itch.io/citizen-sleeper-spindlejack">itch.io</a>. If it is something you're interested in however, <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/citizensleeper2">here's a handy link for you</a>.

            <p>
There are not enough games in the world where it feels like the initial concept was born from the thought, "wouldn't it be funny if…" I'm no fool, I know this is because developing a video game is akin to getting hit by a car, miraculously coming away from it unscathed, only to be hit by six more cars as you continue your journey. In any case, this is still how I would like to imagine Trust Me, I Nailed It was born, a turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game where you have to make cool video edits of some warrior to make him seem like a monster slaying legend.
</p>
<p>
This is, through and through, a ridiculous concept, one that aesthetically maybe doesn't mesh entirely well, but I am still clowning with all the same. This is one of those fake OS kind of games a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnospace-outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/her-story">Her Story</a>, with the main bit of faux software you use being World Movie Weaver (i.e., Windows Movie Maker).

<p>
On your timeline, rather than finding the usual video section and audio section, there is an enemy attack pattern section, pre-filled, showing you exactly where an enemy will strike on the grid-based battlefield, and the warrior's attack pattern section, which you are dictating in the edit. You can drag different clips to make the warrior move, perform different types of or block attacks, there's "post-processing" modifiers that let him teleport, or even just take no damage at all. It's movie magic, baby.
</p><p>
Little bits of story are then relayed through emails and posts on MSN (Mana Scroll Network (nice once)), where you can see whether people believe this actually quite cowardly hero is as cool as you've edited him to be or not.
</p>
<p>
The lack of aesthetic meshing I mention is because the hero scenes are all sort of generic fantasy, and the fake OS honestly just looks straight up like Windows 98. I wish there was a stronger sense of identity, what would an operating system look like in a fantasy world? How would technology impact the world, and magic, in kind? This is just a small gripe, though, the concept is fun enough that I won't lose sleep over it. Plus it'll be free! Can't complain about free.
</p>
<p>
It's also due out really soon, as it's currently slated for release next week on February 6th, so in the meantime, you can wishlist it right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4311000/Trust_Me_I_Nailed_It/">here</a>.

<p>The latest trailer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> highlights some gameplay changes and showcases a version of CM Punk that has never officially appeared in a video game.</p>



<p>During the WWE Royal Rumble event, a new gameplay trailer premiered for the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe-2k26/" id="3461">WWE 2K26</a> video game. The trailer showcased the returning Inferno Match, the debut of the Dumpster Match, the return of the ability to stack tables, and the return of thumbtacks in WWE games for the first time since WWE Legends of WrestleMania in 2009.</p>



<p>Another key focus was the reveal of CM Punk’s Ring of Honor gear. CM Punk was shown in a square-off with his younger self. Ring of Honor is a promotion that launched the careers of wrestlers like CM Punk, Samoa Joe, and Bryan Danielson. The CM Punk model also featured his blonde hair from the early days of his career, from 2002 to 2003. This is the first time that this young version of CM Punk has been officially on display in a wrestling game.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>As first reported by Insider Gaming, the WWE 2K26 Showcase campaign features the career of CM Punk. It will also be narrated by CM Punk and tease some what-if matches that could have taken place had Punk not left WWE nearly a decade back in 2014.</p>



<p>CM Punk is also the cover Superstar this year. His first time on the cover since WWE ’13 back in 2012. That game also featured a spotlight on the WWE Attitude Era, as this game will. The WWE Attitude Era edition of the game will cost $129.99. See all game prices at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/" id="172964">this link.</a></p>

You know, I'm surprised that EA has never made a Sims reality show where contestants have to act out odd, Simish challenges on a Truman Show-esque production lot, given how much the games themselves feel like simulators for the trashiest (said lovingly) TV show genre. In the meantime, while it isn't at all themed reality shows, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4's</a> next expansion, Royalty &amp; Legacy, seems like a perfect fit for a fictitious one of your own making.
</p>
<p>
A new gameplay trailer showed off how the packs dynasty system works, which is very much about family values. Starting your own dynasty begins with things like choosing your family crest, those aforementioned values, and the family members (or otherwise) you want included. There's also a prestige and unity meter, which can be affected in different ways, like, say, stabbing a mannequin, or getting a promotion because you're a nepo baby.

Your Sims also have personal ranks, and lowering the prestige and unity meter may also lower their rank, and another member could challenge your leadership. And then you can just start a new one, so who gives a hoot! There's even some conspiracy nonsense, affairs, scandals to take advantage of, can you see why I think this is ripe for a reality TV show scenario? That'll be up to you to figure out though.
</p><p>
Alongside all of that, there's three new neighborhoods to shape to your will, each of which is already ruled by a pre-established dynasty. Sims can now perform powershifts, which "add fantasy, storybook twists to your royal tale," according to a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/royalty-and-legacy-expansion-pack">blog post</a> about the expansion pack, where they might pull the sword in the stone, or flirt with a fancy frog. Said blog post goes into a lot more detail about what you can expect, so head there for more.
</p>
<p>
You've not got long to wait for the new expansion pack, as it's currently slated for release on February 12th, just under a couple of weeks away.

            <p>Phasmophobia developer Kinetic Games has shared its 2026 roadmap, complete with hints of four seasonal events, two reworked maps, one completely new location, and a load of "major updates", including the player character overhaul, a Unity 6 update, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> release, and, of course, that highly-anticipated 1.0 release.</p>
<p>And it all starts pretty soon, too. That player character overhaul - which some had hoped would release last year - should be out by March, complete with free cosmetics, new character models, and "fine-tuned animations".</p>

<p>"Brave ghost hunters will need to gear up for a host of new spooks and scares, with the pivotal 1.0 launch set to release across all platforms simultaneously this year," Kinetic teased. "Set to be one of the biggest moments since the game's launch, players can expect lots of surprises, as this will also include what was previously known as Horror 2.0."</p><p>Following on from the reworked farmhouse maps, Willow Street and Tanglewood are the next residential maps to get the decorators in. While Tanglewood's layout will remain "similar" (interestingly, the same is not said of Willow Street, which is my personal favourite), players can expect "a range of new interactions, a few small layout changes, and more."</p>

<p>"For those with a keen eye, there's also a mystery lurking in the shadows of 6 Tanglewood Drive waiting to be uncovered," the team added.</p>
<p>As for the new map? Kinetic is playing its cards very close to its chest on that one, but it did tease that along with the return of the usual seasonal events, a mysterious one-time event is also planned for later this year, too.</p><p>"This year is set to be a big one for Phasmophobia, and we are so excited for our 1.0 launch, which will be one of the biggest moments since we released the game," said Daniel Knight , Kinetic CEO and game director of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>"We are constantly working on creating a truly immersive experience for ghost hunters, and have been developing the game with this in mind. Previous updates including Chronicle and our upcoming Player Character update have all been steps in fulfilling our vision, and we hope the 1.0 launch will feel as fresh and exciting as when the game first launched back in 2020."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games reckons 2026 will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2026-will-be-one-of-the-biggest-years-in-the-history-of-co-op-ghosthunting-game-phasmophobia">"one of the biggest [years] in the game's history" as it moves towards the full release of the game</a>. In an update shared at the beginning of the year, the team says we can expect to see "more immersive animations" added to the early access ghosthunting game, such as physically seeing your character model turn on your EMF Reader, opening and closing doors, and picking up or dropping equipment.</p>
