<p>Now that's Friendship</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After months of leaks, teases, and unexpected inclusions, Digital Eclipse's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> finally has a release date for both digital and physical versions.</p>
<p>Digitally, the game will launch on the Switch eShop — both Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions - on <strong>30th October 2025</strong>. A physical release follows on <strong>12th December</strong> and, don't forget, the Switch 2 Edition will be fully on the cartridge.</p>
<p>Physical pre-orders are already live <a href="https://atari.com/collections/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection?srsltid=AfmBOorB3CMFaCmt2V-Cea21SYKweOIyoV7zM0JfqX0lt2VmvON0Oc5i">on Atari's website</a>, but digital pre-orders are going up on 15th September.</p>
<p>For those hankering for a digital history lesson of one of the fighting game genre's most-important franchises, this is the Kollection for you. With online play, rollback netcode, and tons of documentary footage, the history of Mortal Kombat will be immortalised with the loving care we're used to from Digital Eclipse.</p>
<p>Here's a complete list of all the games included in the collection:</p>
<ul>

Coordinate Experts on far-flung expeditions to discover new Exhibits, generating Buzz to entice droves of knowledge-hungry guests who will expect top info-tainment if they’re to leave impressed. This is all while you keep your Exhibits safe, rooms clean, staff happy… and children off the dinosaur bones.</p><p><strong>Exploring for Exhibits</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As Curator, the design and management of your expanding museum is in your hands! Send your team of partially trained Experts on Expeditions in search of rare and mostly well-preserved artefacts. When (and hopefully not if) your Experts return from their <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,545 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>, proudly display their fantastic finds in your museum.</p><p>You’ll unlock new locations as you decide where the next adventure takes you, and complete a sticker book to document your journey as a souvenir of your discoveries.</p><p>Your work doesn’t end there; Exhibit maintenance is crucial. While some Experts are gallivanting across Two Point County and beyond, you’re in charge of managing staff back home to ensure Exhibits and the museum stay in tip-top condition. If taking care of the carnivorous Chomper isn’t enough, there are also meddling thieves to watch out for. Thieves, and more frequently, children, are known for touching and grubbing up the displays, so make sure enough security is guarding your prized collection!</p><p><strong>Design-osaurs</strong></p><p>Get creative to design your museum layout your way! You have decorative freedom, so design thematic areas to guide your guests’ visit. Splash paint and lay carpet as you lovingly arrange each prehistoric fern, potentially melting iceman, and dinosaur remains wherever you see fit.</p><p>Once you’ve created the perfect atmosphere, arrange guided tours with custom routes led by a charismatic Expert. Tours are a fantastic way to enrich your guests’ experience. To keep guests enthused, showcase Exhibits with the highest Buzz—those that are top quality, provide ample info and beautiful decorations are likely to attract the most donations!</p><p><strong>Guest-ertainment</strong></p><p>Guests know best! The different types of guests who will frequent your museum may have different interests, but they do have some things in common… they expect the place to be kept clean, have plenty of refreshments, ample toilets, and a gift shop filled with goodies. And, of course, they need to be dazzled with knowledge of your Exhibits, which are kept well-maintained… or else you could make them sick.</p><p>Two Point County will bring a variety of guests to your museum, and they all hope to discover their new favorite Exhibit… From dino fanatics and botany buffs to haunted horror seekers, you’ll need to cater to their personal preferences to meet their needs. By exceeding their expectations, you can keep them engaged, leading to longer visits, increased donations, and glowing reviews!</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/two-point-museum-for-switch-2-launches-october-28]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The main advantage of Nintendo Switch 2 over its predecessor is its improved hardware, so it's nice that so many developers, Nintendo included, are taking advantage of it to boost Switch 1 titles. Today's Nintendo Direct may have announced huge new games, like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-comes-to-switch-2-in-2026">Fire Emblem Fortune's Weave</a> and Y<a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/nintendo-announces-yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book-for-switch-2-next">oshi and the Mysterious Book</a>, but we also got smaller improvements to some exciting games from the Switch 1's lineup. From Stardew Valley to Hades II, here's every Switch 2 version we learned about today.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Lead" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7a3e50e01ab33/mario-lead.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>As expected, Nintendo spent a good chunk of its latest Direct presentation focusing on the 40th anniversary of <strong>Super Mario Bros.</strong> with a host of announcements both big and small.</p>
<p>The platforming icon celebrates his big four-zero on 13th September 2025 and, while we didn't get the brand-new 3D Mario that we were perhaps expecting, we're quite pleased with the reveals regardless.</p>
<p>So we thought we'd compile everything in one place for your perusal. Be sure to let us know with a comment which announcement was your favourite.</p>

<p>Kicking off the festivities, Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed that the Nintendo Museum in Japan would commemorate the 40th anniversary in two key ways.</p>
<p>First, attendees will receive special 40th anniversary-themed tickets, which will be available through September 2026, and a special light display will be planned from December 2025.</p>

<p>In addition to the re-release of Galaxy 1 &amp; 2, Nintendo has also confirmed a pair of amiibo based on the games.</p>
<p>Launching on 2nd April 2026, the two figures will consist of 'Mario and Luma' and 'Rosalina'. It's not known whether these will have specific properties in-game, but they look pretty awesome.</p>

<p>Yes the Talking Flower from Super Mario Wonder is getting its own physical product.</p>
<p>Although it won't be interactive, as such, the Flower will occasionally utter lines from the game. Should make for a nice little gift for those particularly keen on these little guys!</p>

<p>Mii like the look of this</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During today's Direct, Nintendo shared a trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> which, well, it's got some fairly disturbing voices in it, amongst other things.</p>
<p>While we don't have a release date yet, Nintendo did confirm that the sequel to the 3DS's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a> is coming to the Switch 1 in <strong>Spring 2026</strong>, narrowing that window down a little bit.</p>
<p>As you can see from the trailer above, this one's is all about living your dream life on a little island full of terrifying Mii-styled characters. There's plenty of customisation here in terms of both your character and their styles, and the island itself looks very similar to the sort of colourful island we all know and love from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>.</p>
<p>Players oversee control of the island setting out, and can then create a whole bunch of Miis to act as their residents. Once happy with their appearance, you then get to choose personality traits - which could be very amusing if it's got some flexibility to it - and the modulated voices are always funny, let's face it. Weird, but amusing.</p>

<p>With minigames on display in the snippet of action you can see up top, and a definite dark streak in the humour on display, we'd say Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream is one to keep an eye on for 2026.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to hit you up with the exact release date as soon as we've got it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dying Light: The Beast was initially due to release on August 22 2025, but less than a month ahead of that date, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-receives-four-week-delay/">Techland announced it would be delaying it by four weeks</a> to September 19, 2025. Now, Techland has changed the release date once again, this time moving it up by one day from September 19 to September 18, 2025, to celebrate the game surpassing 1 million pre-orders.</p>



<p>"<em>Big news!</em>," Techland began in a <a href="https://x.com/dyinglightgame/status/1966525687247839702?s=46">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. "<em>Since more than 1 million players have already secured their copy of Dying Light: The Beast ahead of launch, we're moving the release forward to</em> <em>September 18!"</em></p>



<p>Alongside the post, Techland shared a graphic displaying the new global launch times for the game, telling players exactly when the game will be going live depending on where you live in the world.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Big news! Since more than 1 million players have already secured their copy of Dying Light: The Beast ahead of launch, we're moving the release forward to SEPTEMBER 18! Check out the global launch times for the game to play it as soon as it drops.</p><p>Pre-order now 👉… <a href="https://t.co/PcTnkwB80r">pic.twitter.com/PcTnkwB80r</a></p></div>— Dying Light (@DyingLightGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DyingLightGame/status/1966525687247839702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 12, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Having the release date moved forward is always welcome news for players anxiously waiting to play an upcoming release, even if it might ruin the plans some people may have made to take the Friday off from work to play Dying Light: The Beast. </p>



<p>In the lead-up to launch, Techland <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-techland-combat-parkour-deep-dive/">has been releasing</a> behind-the-scenes <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-bts-creating-dying-light-the-beast-road-to-launch/">looks at the making</a> of Dying Light: The Beast. The most recent was a look at how the studio designed the infected that plague the game's world, and how they developed the voices behind them.</p>

            <p>Smile and say AIEEEEE, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> fans! Tecmo and Team Ninja are bringing a "remake" of PS2 survival horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fatal-frame-2-crimson-butterfly">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly</a> to PC via Steam in early 2026. Why am I brandishing a glyph-covered Canon EOS 90D at you, while singing the Ghostbusters theme? Allow me to explain: Fatal Frame's signature touch is that you defeat spooks using a magic camera. Naturally, this also means that you have to look steadily and calmly at said spooks while they shimmer and sway towards you. Catch some of that nonsense in the remake's announcement trailer.

<p>I've only ever played one Fatal Frame game, 2005's Fatal Frame III: The Tormented, in which you alternate between a relatively safe daytime apartment and a dream manor where the monsters are. I'm told that Crimson Butterfly is the best of the lot. It's the story of twin sisters Mio and Mayu Amakura, who visit a stream one day to reminisce about their childhoods before the area is submerged by the construction of a dam.</p>
<p>Alas and alack, Mayu spots a nice red butterfly that lures her away to a "village of never-ending night", home to a "forbidden ritual". I had a similar thing happen to me while hiking along the Dales Way, once. The butterfly was a deceptively cheap Airbnb listing, the village was Kendal, and the forbidden ritual was all-night karaoke at the Olde Fleece Inn.
</p><p>According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3920610/FATAL_FRAME_II_Crimson_Butterfly_REMAKE/">the Steam page</a>, the Crimson Butterfly remake will be a "complete overhaul", with "richer and more engaging gameplay in both exploration and combat". In particular, you can expect a "Holding Hands with Mayu" mechanic that, presumably, lets you hold hands with Mayu. I really hope there's more to this so-called remake's "richer and more engaging gameplay" than simply letting major characters hold hands, Tecmo. 
</p>
<p>I enjoy the nerdiness of Fatal Frame's photography mechanics. The camera can be upgraded with different lenses and types of film, and it's not impossible that you might learn something about shot composition while you're flashbulbing poltergeists. Given nerves of steel, you might find yourself demanding that the ghost go out and come in again, because dang it, this one could be worthy of the New Yorker. The ghost will not listen to you, of course, but don't let that stop you yelling at your TV screen.
</p>
<p>Two previous Fatal Frame games have made the leap to PC - Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse and Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water. Our Mask of the Lunar Eclipse reviewer Kim Armstrong was not keen, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fatal-frame-project-zero-mask-of-the-lunar-eclipse-review">commenting</a> of the PC port, "while this unique combat may have carried the game's lifeless story back in 2008, this rerelease is nothing more than an expensive reskin of a relic." 
</p>
<p>We didn't review Maiden of Black Water, possibly because it was so terrifying that Graham (RPS in peace) refused to assign it and instead threw it into a lake one dark and stormy evening. Or possibly because it was so boring that Graham (RPS in peace) refused to assign it and instead threw it into a lake one dark and stormy evening. He's gone now, so it's impossible to say for sure.</p>

<p>No twist of fate</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During the big hour-long Nintendo Direct, Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> got a release date for Switch 2! And it's landing on the console on <strong>13th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The game was revealed back in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/capcoms-monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-announced-for-switch-2">July's Partner Showcase</a> and has received a huge glow-up from its lovely-looking predecessors. But this is more of that charming turn-based Monster Hunter action we've seen on 3DS and Switch.</p>
<p>In the brand new trailer, there's a revelation: twin monsters are "a portent of disaster" and we've got twin Rathalos(es?) on our hands. One of them is yours and you'll be riding them around the world as you tame Monsties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While new details are sparse, we do have a rundown of the game from its Steam page, so check that out if you need a refresher:</p>
<p>Embark on a new adventure in the third installment of the turn-based RPG series set in the world of Monster Hunter! Become a Rider in the Monster Hunter Stories series as you hatch and build kinship with friendly monsters known as Monsties, then explore and battle alongside them in a world full of potential!</p>
<p>Set two centuries after a conflict that divided neighboring kingdoms, the drums of war are reignited as twin Rathalos—long thought extinct—hatch from a single egg: an omen of destruction.</p>
<p>Two kingdoms, two Riders, and two Rathalos; their fates now intertwined. As calamity encroaches, seek hope beyond the border and into forbidden lands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Stories 3 is coming to Switch 2 in March 2026 — ready to ride Rathalos into the skies? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/charlie-kirk-shooter-allegedly-had-bullet-with-possible-helldivers-2-reference-engraved-on-it.1296570/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>New information has surfaced in the federal investigation into the assassination of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk that includes a potentially <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251">unexpected link to <em>Helldivers 2</em></a>. Bullets left behind near the crime scene had markings on them, according to information shared at a news conference on Friday morning by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, one of which included symbols that line up with a military Stratagem from last year’s hit sci-fi extraction game.</p> <p>Investigators said Discord messages from the suspected shooter led them to believe he had engraved the writings on bullets he used to kill Kirk at a Utah Valley University event earlier this week. A bolt-action rifle with a scope was recovered from a wooded area near the school on Thursday, with unfired bullets containing engravings on the casings.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨Spencer Cox confirms writings on bullet casings and says they included "hey, fascist" and "if you read this, you are gay LMAO." <a href="https://t.co/9gow1IhynD">pic.twitter.com/9gow1IhynD</a></p> <p>— Off The Press (@OffThePress1) <a href="https://twitter.com/OffThePress1/status/1966506342039900267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>One of the casings reportedly had the words “Hey fascists! Catch!” on it alongside an up arrow, right arrow, and three down arrows.</p> <p>While that last part might seem meaningless to most people, <em>Helldivers 2</em> players immediately understood it to be a reference to the <a title="Eagle 500kg Bomb" href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Eagle_500kg_Bomb">Eagle 500kg Bomb</a> stratagem which requires players to input those button presses on their keyboard or their controller’s d-pad in order to call down a giant payload that explodes moments later.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">⇧⇨⇩⇩⇩ (Up, Right, Down, Down, Down) is an orbital stratagem code from the game Helldivers II. It calls in an Eagle airstrike that drops a 500K bomb — the most destructive piece of single ordinance in the game. <a href="https://t.co/GzMvH9Dxrj">https://t.co/GzMvH9Dxrj</a> <a href="https://t.co/7M2nfvQFGJ">pic.twitter.com/7M2nfvQFGJ</a></p> <p>— Steve Skojec (@SteveSkojec) <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveSkojec/status/1966514346390962483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s not yet clear if the suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, who was recently arrested in connection with the assassination, meant for the engraving to be connected to <em>Helldivers 2</em> or what significance that reference would have had in connection with the crime.</p> <h2>What is <em>Helldivers 2</em>?</h2> <p><em>Helldivers 2</em> was made by Arrowhead Game Studios and published by Sony for PlayStation 5 and PC early last year, instantly becoming one of 2025’s most popular games after selling over 10 million copies. The multiplayer shooter has players step into the shoes of space marines as they battle alien threats across the galaxy as a parody of sci-fi fascism in the vein of <em>Starship Troopers</em>.</p> <p><em>Helldivers 2</em> came to Xbox Series X/S just last month and has continued to be one of the most played games on PC and console in part due to constantly-evolving in-game storytelling and a robust social community of dedicated players. Players team up, go down to random planet surfaces, complete mini-objective while dodging waves of hostile aliens, and repeatedly die in often absurd ways thanks to the game’s complex ragdoll physics.</p> <div> <p>Players have been flooding the game’s Discord today following the press conference sharing their shock and disgust, as well as debating whether Arrowhead Game Studios should make a statement addressing the situation. Robinson’s name has already been banned from the <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord servers so that any attempt to mention the suspected shooter by name is automatically filtered out.</p> <p> <h2>“Weird day to be a Helldivers mod”</h2> </p> </div> <p>On the game’s subreddits, which include over 1.5 million members, fans have been trying to process the news. “Not for nothing, but it’s gonna be weird to have one of these tattoos,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/helldivers2/comments/1nf5sxh/damn_not_for_nothing_but_its_gonna_be_weird_to/">wrote in a thread</a> referencing a past photo shared by someone over a year ago with a tattoo of the same Eagle 500kg Bomb stratagem reportedly referenced on Robinson’s bullets. “Don’t let some delusional person take what’s ours,” wrote another.</p>

 <p>“Community is necessary because of events like this,” wrote one of the subreddit’s moderators. “If we as people spent more time learning about each other and overcoming our differences instead of bickering we might actually achieve equity and not just equality.&nbsp;As Helldivers it’s our responsibility to keep those we love and are sworn to protect safe from outside evils.&nbsp; Sometimes those evils exist within our own society.”</p> <p>Politicians have long tried to link gun violence with video games, including President Donald Trump. Earlier this week, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said his department was looking into any potential links between gaming and increases in school shootings. The U.S. suffers from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/21/us/school-shooting-us-versus-world-trnd">exponentially more school shootings</a> than other countries, despite having the same number of video games.</p> <p><em><strong>Updated, 9/12/2025 12:53 p.m. ET:</strong> Added more reactions from</em> Helldivers 2 <em>players.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced a rather unexpected Pokémon spin-off, Pokopia. Revealed during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-nintendos-latest-direct">12th September Nintendo Direct</a>, the new game is coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> in 2026 and is being developed by Koei Tecmo Games.</p>
<p>In the game players are tasked with creating their own Pokémon paradise, with Ditto as the protagonist - albeit Ditto taking on a human-like appearance.</p>

<blockquote><p>About Pokémon Pokopia</p>
<p>As Ditto, players can explore and learn moves from the Pokémon they befriend—such as Bulbasaur's Leafage to grow greenery, or Squirtle’s Water Gun to revive dried-up plants—expanding their capabilities and helping them create an inviting environment to attract a variety of Pokémon.</p>
<p>Players can collect materials, build furniture, grow vegetables, and create homes for Pokémon, allowing them to experience a cozy, slow life with Pokémon—one that they build themselves from the ground up. Over time, players can develop a town of their own and invite other players or Pokémon to visit. Pokémon Pokopia also features a day-night cycle linked to real-world time, changing weather, and in-game locations with their own unique characteristics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Koei Tecmo has dabbled in this sort of title before, providing much of the work for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-quest-builders-2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a>, another Minecraft-esque spin-off of a major Japanese RPG series. It could be that some of the development talent is shared between these titles - though as with most Pokemon games, Game Freak is also clearly deeply involved.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Developer LocalThunk has announced that the 1.1 update for Balatro will not be ready for 2025, and there is no new specific release window for when it will be ready. In a blog post, LocalThunk said the release timing is being moved a to a done when it is done approach, so there is no pressure to meet a public deadline. You can read the full blog post from LocalThunk below.</p>
<p><em>I have some unfortunate news: The promised 2025 Balatro 1.1 update isn’t going to come out in 2025. I know, I announced that it would, but it has become clear now that it won’t happen by the end of the year and I wanted to tell you all now. I feel bad for not keeping that promise, and I am sorry.</em></p>


<p><em>The truth is that I probably shouldn’t have announced any date for the 1.1 update at all. I’m a hobbyist developer at heart and I love to tinker. If you read my blog post about the Balatro timeline, you’ll know that since the game went public in the summer of 2023 I have become all too familiar with the crunch and stress that inherently come with professional game development. The struggles of pre-launch are detailed in that blog post, but unfortunately it didn’t stop at launch. Immediately after Balatro 1.0 came out in February 2024 I dove right in to a big balance patch (1.0.1), then into the mobile port of the game right after, and by the time the mobile version came out in late 2024 I was well and truly burned out.</em></p>
<p><em>I took a break from everything to do with the game for a few months until the start of 2025 when I very slowly eased myself back into the work. However, I chose to only work on the game like I did when the project began, as a hobbyist (a few hours per day, and not always on the 1.1 update), and it turns out that it’s a lot slower than working in crunch mode 12 hours per day like I was around launch.</em></p>
<p><em>I still love drawing my silly jokers, I carry around a notebook that is now teeming with ideas to implement or test in the game, and thankfully I still consider this my hobby, but the prospect of rushing the work and going back into crunch mode to get it out this year just felt terrible.</em></p>

<p><em>I am working slowly, but I like it that way. I love getting sucked into rabbit holes and I don’t like trying to force things creatively. I have never, before Balatro, set a deadline for any of my creative projects and I now realize how important that is for my process. I am in a very lucky position in that I can choose to work this job however I wish, and I think the best version of “work” for me is the version that makes me want to come back to my keyboard every day, healthy, and hopefully just as excited about game development 5 years from now as I am today. I don’t want 1.1 to be the last update this game gets.</em></p>
<p><em>So I’m apologizing here, now, to you. I won’t be making the 2025 deadline I said I would. Balatro 1.1 will still come out, of that I am certain, but the new timeline is going to be it’s done when it’s done. It will be a free update for everyone on all platforms when it’s ready, and it’ll probably need some adjustments when it’s out there in the world (like 1.0 did), but that won’t be this year.</em></p>
<p><em>I posted a few months ago that I finally got 100% of the achievements in Balatro, and for a bit of reassurance, the Balatro player in me will absolutely not allow me walk away from developing this game. I’m already super excited to try and 100% the game all over again from a second profile when 1.1 is ready. Rest assured, it will happen.</em></p>

<p>Another free upgrade</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> is the gift that just keeps on giving — just a few weeks after ConcernedApe announced it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/stardew-valley-creator-announces-version-1-7-update">working on a 1.7 update</a>, today's Nintendo Direct also unveiled a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> of the beloved farming sim.</p>
<p>And of course, the upgrade is 100% free too. Plus, it includes Mouse Mode controls, which will make decorating your house and farm <em>so</em> much easier.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Edition isn't just about the mouse, though. Four-player split-screen multiplayer and eight-player online multiplayer is also coming.</p>
<p><em>And</em> just in case you still didn't think Stardew was great value, you can now use GameShare to play with up to up to three others if they don't have the game. And yes, it works with Switch 1 and Switch 2. That's pretty amazing.</p>

<p>Stardew Valley is already one of the best games on Switch, and it's easily one of the best farm sims of all time. We can't wait to lose our life to this again on Switch 2. It might be time for a new co-op farm...</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to the Switch 2 Edition in the comments</em>.</p></section></article><div><p>Alana has been with Nintendo Life since 2022, and while RPGs are her first love, Nintendo is a close second.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>it's not even out yet, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is <em>already</em> getting DLC, and it was announced during today's Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension</a> doesn't have a release date yet, but it looks to focus on the Pokémon Hoopa and features two brand new Mega Evolutions for Raichu — Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y.</p>
<p>Hoopa is apparently opening up dimensions across Lumiose City. What that means for our intrepid trainer? No idea, but we bet we'll get hoop-ing (sorry) in to find out.</p>

<p>But that wasn't the only Z-A news we got today. Just before that, we got <a href="https://youtu.be/PPTqA10lt-c?si=Wl_17ewBg7a7QQF0">a little peek at three new Mega Evolutions</a>, and they're for the Kalos Starter Trio.</p>
<p>Yep, Chesnaught, Delphox, and Greninja are all getting their own Mega. <em>Finally</em><em>.</em> You'll need to earn a Chesnaughtite, Delphoxite, and Greninjite via the Z-A Battle Club in order to see them, but they're excellent evolutions of their original class-based designs.</p>
<p>However, the kicker is that they're only available via <em>online</em> Ranked Battles. According to the press release, "Chesnaughtite, Delphoxite, and Greninjite stones cannot normally be obtained during regular gameplay. Mega Stones obtainable as promotion rewards are planned to be redistributed in future seasons." So that's a bit of a bummer.</p>

<p>We've already seen a brand new Mega Evolution in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/pokemon-legends-z-a-unveils-a-newly-discovered-mega-evolution">Mega Malamar earlier this week</a>, so with this batch of five newbies, we're swimming in new battle opportunities.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of these new Megas in the comments below!</em></p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection was <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-nintendo-switch-2-2026/">first announced this past July</a>, with a release window set for 2026. Today, during the hour-long <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">Nintendo Direct</a> presentation, Capcom confirmed that the latest entry in the Monster Hunter Stories series will arrive on Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this coming March 13, 2026.</p>



<p>A new trailer showcased today delved more into the game's story and showed off some more gameplay for the upcoming title.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3's narrative is kicked off with the birth of Twin Ratholos' with players stepping into the role of the heir to Azuria. "<em>Ride, befriend, raise, and battle with monsters in a vibrant and expansive world filled with a colorful cast of characters</em>," reads the video's description for the trailer. </p>



<p>The game will focus on the divide between two nations, with the birth of the two Ratholos' bringing both a sense of hope and terror, as they could either be part of the solution to the nations not destroying each other, or be the key to that dreaded destruction.</p>



<p>The last Monster Hunter Stories title surpassed <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240619.html">2 million units sold</a> as of June 2024, and this follow-up will surely be another strong seller in Capcom's portfolio of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-high-price-playstation-5/">Monster Hunter games</a> that have been selling like gangbusters. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.6, and the next major update for the turn-based gacha RPG is landing later this month.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-34-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-33-release-date" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, Version 3.6 will be arriving on September 24th, and it'll be bringing two playable characters with it, as well as a new high-difficulty challenge and more.</p>

<p>First up, you can, of course, expect new story content in this&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>update. HoYoverse says that the world of Amphoreus "stands at a crossroads", and that Miss Evernight (who's also joining the roster as a playable character) will be unveiling her plan to save the world, which "diverges from the prevailing creed of salvation".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.6-release-date-evernight.jpg?itok=DkZYlyPW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.6-release-date-evernight.jpg?itok=akkEmXwy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.6 brings new characters and more later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, you're getting two new playable characters into the bargain with this update. The first is the aforementioned Everwild, who joins as a 5-star Ice fighter. She can summon a sprite to help her accumulate extra damage, then deal that damage as soon as the stack is full. Her Ultimate, meanwhile, deals extra damage and sets her up for even more buffs.</p>

<p>Your second playable character for this update is the rather improbably-named Dan Heng • Permansor Terrae, who can buff his team by shielding them, but don't worry; he can also deal his own damage and hold his own in a fight.</p>

<p>Until the end of&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 4.0, you can also claim Dan Heng • Permansor Terrae for free simply by logging into the game. He's a five-star character, too, so he's no slouch, and he should be a solid addition to your team.</p>




<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.6 launches across all platforms on September 24th. The game is <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">available to play for free</a> right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices. Stay tuned for more on this one!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>'s free 1.1 update won't release in 2025 as originally planned, developer Localthunk has announced. There's no new release date, but they say the update'll arrive when they've been able to complete it, while continuing to work at a healthy pace.</p>
<p>This update was first announced by publishers Playstack in August last year, with Localthunk subsequently revealing in a chat with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-07/maker-of-smash-indie-hit-balatro-talks-about-what-s-next">Bloomberg</a> that it'll feature, among other stuff, some new jokers and a revamp of the Matador card. The latter dishes out a cash boost whenever you play a hand that triggers a boss blind's ability.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/im-slow">blog post</a> about the decision to delay the update, Localthunk wrote that it all comes down to wanting to ensure they keep on taking care of their health and desire to keep on developing the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilder in the way they work, as you can read below:</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is that I probably shouldn’t have announced any date for the 1.1 update at all. I’m a hobbyist developer at heart and I love to tinker. If you read my blog post about the Balatro timeline, you’ll know that since the game went public in the summer of 2023 I have become all too familiar with the crunch and stress that inherently come with professional game development. The struggles of pre-launch are detailed in that blog post, but unfortunately it didn’t stop at launch. Immediately after Balatro 1.0 came out in February 2024 I dove right in to a big balance patch (1.0.1), then into the mobile port of the game right after, and by the time the mobile version came out in late 2024 I was well and truly burned out.</p>
<p>I took a break from everything to do with the game for a few months until the start of 2025 when I very slowly eased myself back into the work. However, I chose to only work on the game like I did when the project began, as a hobbyist (a few hours per day, and not always on the 1.1 update), and it turns out that it’s a lot slower than working in crunch mode 12 hours per day like I was around launch.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, they now plan to keep on working at that slower cadence. "Balatro 1.1 will still come out, of that I am certain, but the new timeline is going to be it’s done when it’s done," the developer explained, "It will be a free update for everyone on all platforms when it’s ready, and it’ll probably need some adjustments when it’s out there in the world (like 1.0 did), but that won’t be this year."</p><p>I'm glad to see Localthunk putting their health and happiness above all else. After all, given that Balatro's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/balatro-review">well-earned</a> (not just because it led Edwin to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/balatro-mod-jimbos-big-naturals-is-a-lot-funnier-and-safer-for-work-than-it-sounds">have to write about boobs</a>) and rampant popularity isn't going to evaporate into nothingness anytime soon, there's no sense in trying to rush 1.1 out. Folks will still be here for it further down the line, and ready to whip out their decks the moment it drops.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-microsd-card-just-got-even-cheaper-a-practically-free-way-to-expand-your-switch-storage-2000625014</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung%E2%80%99s-microsd-card-just-got-even-cheaper-a-practically-free-way-to-expand-your-switch-storage.1296513/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We all know that storage is a hot commodity. Whether it’s managing to have enough space on your phone to record new videos and photos or having enough room on your PC or gaming console to download an upcoming title, there never seems to be enough room. That’s why when stuff like SSDs, external storage, or MicroSDs go on sale, you pick them up.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4089/"> Right now, the Samsung EVO Select series of memory cards are on sale, going for as much as 26% off.</a></p>
<p>Amazon has a handful of options at various capacities all on sale at the moment. The 128GB, normally $17, is several bucks off down to $13. The 256GB option is down from $26 to just $20. The 512GB MicroSD has been cut from $44 to $35 and the full 1TB option has dropped from $87 to just $75.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4089/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Give Your Switch Room to Breathe</h2>
<p>For gamers, you can put this in your Nintendo Switch to manage both save data and the storage of the digital games themselves. The launch Nintendo Switch only comes with a measly 32GB. Now thankfully most Nintendo games aren’t too big by comparison to Xbox, PlayStation, and third-party AAA titles. Some of those shoot into the triple digits of gigs. One of Nintendo’s largest games,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, is only 18.2GB. But still, that’s more than half your console’s storage.</p>
<p>Pop in the 1TB Samsung EVO Select for just $75 and you won’t ever have to worry about game storage on your Switch again.</p>



<p>Important to note: These MicroSD cards are not compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2. The new console requires MicroSD Express cards which are faster at reading and writing data. Inserting one of the Samsung EVO Select MicroSD cards into a Nintendo Switch 2 console will not allow you to save or load neither your save data nor any digital games. It is still compatible with the original Nintendo Switch console along with the Nintendo Switch Lite and Nintendo Switch OLED.</p>
<p>The Samsung EVO Select MicroSDs have a read and write speed of up to 160MB/s. While not enough for the Switch 2, Nintendo only recommends speeds of up to 90 MB/s on its predecessor anyway so this will have no problem with the OG Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4089/">While the price is still down, you can at least quadruple your Nintendo Switch’s storage for as low as $13.</a> That’s a hell of a deal. Make sure to download&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> once you’ve installed that sucker into your SD card slot.</p>
