<p>But why?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="5c582cec1f55a"><a title="Gran Turismo 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c582cec1f55a/gran-turismo-7.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PlayStation</em></figcaption></figure><p>PlayStation's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gran_turismo_7">Gran Turismo 7</a> has apparently been linked to the Switch 2 in a wild new rumour, but it doesn't necessarily mean what you might be thinking.</p>
<p>This information comes from video game journalist Jeff Grubb, who recently responded to a fan on his show, asking a question about "the real driving simulator" and the possibility of it racing on to another platform.</p>
<p>While there was a fair amount of speculation on Grubb's end about <em>other</em> Sony franchises during this segment, in terms of Gran Turismo, he claims he's actually heard about a Switch 2 version, but doesn't expect anything to come of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jeff Grubb:</strong> "I heard recently that Gran Turismo was running on the Switch 2. I don't think it's going to come to the Switch 2, but I heard it was running on it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, why would Sony bother to get a game like this up and running on the Switch 2, but not even consider a release?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1reac3w/jeff_grubb_playstation_had_gran_turismo_7_running/">One popular theory</a> seems to be it's testing the waters <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/sony-allegedly-encouraging-devs-to-use-ps5s-new-low-power-mode-prompting-fresh-ps6-handheld-speculation?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">as rumours circulate</a> about the company potentially releasing a new PlayStation handheld. In other words, this could be research and development, and nothing more.</p>
<p>Gaming enthusiasts online have also pointed out how companies over the years <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2020/05/gears_of_war_ps3_footage_appears_online_epic_games_comments">got titles up and running on certain platforms</a>, but never went any further. If this is more than a rumour, it wouldn't necessarily be the first time we've heard about something like this.</p>
<p>As our <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/for-some-reason-sony-apparently-got-gran-turismo-7-running-on-switch-2">friends at Push Square</a> further note, Switch 2's primary controllers <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-1-and-2-games-with-analogue-trigger-compatibility-that-work-with-the-gamecube-nso-controller">don't have analogue triggers</a> and the system doesn't offer "robust" steering wheel support, all of which is considered essential to experience Gran Turismo "at its best".</p>
<p>Of course, if there are any significant developments, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>

<p>Last May, an Xbox Wire post announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/ecco_the_dolphin">Ecco The Dolphin</a> would be making a comeback with a remaster of not only the first game, but also the sequel <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/ecco_the_tides_of_time">Tides of Time</a>.</p>
<p>Platforms weren't mentioned at the time, but a new two-page spread for the remaster in Famitsu this week lists the Switch - seemingly confirming the remaster is on its way to Nintendo's hybrid platform.</p>
<p>Additional details have also been shared by the series creator Ed Annunziata in this feature. As highlighted by Nintendo Everything, the plan is to include 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit versions in a single package, and allow players to swap between visual styles in "real-time".</p>
<p>The final name of this project is still being decided, but the favourite at the moment appears to be "Ecco Complete". Of course, this is all subject to localisation changes.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, these remasters will also be joined by a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/ecco-the-dolphin-is-making-a-comeback-with-remasters-and-new-game">"new, third game"</a> at some stage. More updates related to Ecco are expected to take place this April, according to an <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">official Ecco the Dolphin countdown website</a>.</p>
<p>As we've previously mentioned, the original Ecco the Dolphin game, which launched in 1992 on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis, is playable via the Switch Online + Expansion Pack.</p>

<p>New marriage candidates, pre-release footage and more</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The indie success story <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> is today celebrating its 10th anniversary. As part of this, the game's creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has announced a special video broadcast.</p>
<p>It will apparently run for "about 23 minutes", and fans can expect to see some "pre-release footage" as well as the reveal of the new 1.7 marriage candidates at the end. Barone actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/stardew-valley-creator-teases-two-more-marriage-candidates-for-update-1-7">teased this upcoming reveal</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>Here's exactly what you can expect to see and hear about during the anniversary broadcast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ConcernedApe:</strong> "I made a video for tomorrow's 10-year Stardew Valley Anniversary, it will "premiere" tomorrow at 11am PST...I go over some old builds of the game w/ commentary, briefly go over the many updates, give a special message to the players, and reveal the 2 new marriage candidates in 1.7."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What time is the Stardew Valley 10-Year anniversary video premiere?</h3>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 11am PST / 12pm MST / 1pm CST / 2pm EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 7pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 8pm CET / 9pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 4am (Thu) JST / 3am (Thu) AWST / 6am (Thu) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>To date, this hugely popular farming and lifestyle sim has now sold millions of copies worldwide and it's been updated over the years with a lot of free content.</p>
<p>Most recently, the game was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-is-now-available">made available for the Switch 2</a>. This version hasn't been released in every region just yet, but Barone mentioned last week that the Switch 2 Edition (and free upgrade for existing players) would be coming to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/stardew-valleys-new-update-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-now-live">European and Japanese eShop in "a few weeks"</a>. If you are eager to jump in right now, you can access the free upgrade from the US eShop.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">What are the odds?</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The attorney general of New York Letitia James is suing Valve, alleging the platform illegally promotes gambling to children.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-game-developer-promoting-illegal-gambling-through" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release issued by the attorney general's office today</a>, which states that following an investigation, the office of the attorney general "found that Valve’s video games, including Counter-Strike 2, Team Fortress 2, and Dota 2, enable gambling by enticing users to pay for the chance to win a rare virtual item of significant monetary value."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In Valve’s most popular game [Counter-Strike 2], the process resembles a slot machine, with an animated spinning wheel that eventually rests on a selected item. The randomly selected virtual items have no in-game functionality but can be sold online for money, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/counter-strike-skin-sells-for-over-1-million">one item reportedly being sold for more than $1 million</a>. The lawsuit alleges that Valve has made billions of dollars luring its users, many of whom are teenagers or younger, to engage in gambling in the hopes of winning expensive virtual items that they can cash in on. With this lawsuit, Attorney General James seeks to permanently stop Valve from continuing to promote illegal gambling in its games and to pay disgorgement and fines."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The lawsuit itself describes both the mechanics of how loot boxes work in all three games, as well as the ways in which users can "cash in" virtual items, either by selling them on the Steam Community Market, or by connecting their accounts to third-party marketplaces, the latter of which the attorney general's office says it found Valve "facilitates and even assists." The attorney general's office argues that Valve's loot box model is "quintessential gambling, prohibited under New York's Constitution and Penal Law." Gambling is illegal in New York with only some exceptions, which the attorney general says are all irrelevant here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question of whether loot boxes can or should be regulated as gambling has been ongoing for more than a decade, with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/loot-box-state-of-play-2024-another-trip-around-the-world-of-regulation" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different countries issuing various regulations around them over the years</a>. China, South Korea, and some other countries require companies to disclose odds on receiving certain items in very specific ways. In Australia, the presence of loot boxes automatically nets a game an M rating (not recommended for children under 15, albeit not legally restricted), and anything with simulated gambling gets an R18+ rating, meaning it cannot be sold to minors. Belgium has attempted to ban them entirely, though it is apparently struggling to enforce this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The New York lawsuit aims to permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its games, make full restitution to consumers and give up all profit its made from this practice, and pay fines for violation of New York laws. If successful, this case could have significant ripple effects on the rest of the industry, as companies are forced to confirm to an increasing array of different loot box laws in different regions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people,” said Attorney General James in a statement. “Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes. These features are addictive, harmful, and illegal, and my office is suing to stop Valve’s illegal conduct and protect New Yorkers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to Valve for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>The physical distributor Limited Run Games is teaming up with Marvel and Konami to revive multiple retro games in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_maximum_collection"><strong>Marvel</strong></a> <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_maximum_collection">Maximum Collection</a></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>This superhero-sized collection, "coming soon" to Switch and other platforms, will feature six "classic titles" spanning across the Arcade, 8-bit and 16-bit consoles.</p>
<p>The collection covers multiple genres and promises to take fans on a "comprehensive tour" of Marvel's gaming legacy. It won't just feature one version of a particular title, either - it offers "every major console and arcade iteration" available.</p>
<p>Here are the titles included in this new collection, with rollback netcode also confirmed for X-Men: The Arcade Game.</p>
<p><strong>X-Men: The Arcade Game (Arcade)</strong></p>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wolfenstein/" id="2953">Wolfenstein 3 </a>could finally be in the works.</p>



<p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-wolfenstein-3-first-story-details-unveiled-as-casting-begins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to a report from MP1st,</a> a casting call has been uncovered tied to the project. This appears to be our first look at the plot details. The project is codenamed “Valkyrie,” and it is attached to two people who previously worked on several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/machinegames/" id="87686">MachineGames </a>titles: performance director Tom Keegan and casting director Emily Schweber. Keegan directed performances for the cast of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-2/" id="97055">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-apparent-wolfenstein-3-plot-details-and-production-schedule">Apparent Wolfenstein 3 Plot Details and Production Schedule</h2>



<p>Reportedly, the story centers around a character named Sofiya. She’s described as a Ukrainian orphan aged 8 to 11 who forms a bond with William Blazkowicz, the franchise’s main protagonist. The young character is also said to be traumatized by War, making her suspicious, but she’s ultimately labeled a strong survivor. </p>



<p>The casting call also notes that performance capture is scheduled to begin in April, with shooting dates planned for later in 2026 and extending into the next year.</p>



<p>MachineGames had previously stated that they always intended to continue the franchise. Jerk Gustafsson, studio director, said earlier this month that while he wouldn’t comment on a timeline for the third game’s release, they were never finished with the franchise. Read his full comments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/machinegames-still-plans-to-finish-the-wolfenstein-trilogy/">here</a>.</p>







<p>There’s still no exact confirmation from the studio, but we may be inching closer to finishing the Wolfenstein Trilogy. Insider Gaming will continue to report on the franchise’s future as more information becomes available.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Valve for “illegally promoting gambling” through the loot box systems it has built for video games like <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, and <em>Dota 2</em>, <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-game-developer-promoting-illegal-gambling-through">according to a press release</a>. The attorney general seeks to “permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its games, disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and pay fines for violating New York’s laws.”</p><p>“This loot box model that Valve has developed — charging an individual for a chance to win something of value based on luck alone — is quintessential gambling, prohibited under New York’s Constitution and Penal Law,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/27417060-new-york-v-valve/">the lawsuit says</a>. Valve has made “tens of millions of dollars” selling loot box keys to “thousands” of New York residents and has “made millions of dollars more in commissions from New Yorkers who sold virtual items obtained from loot boxes.” The company’s loot boxes are also “particularly pernicious” because they’re popular with children and adolescents, according to the complaint.</p><p>Users can purchase keys to open loot boxes in some Valve games and receive randomly-selected virtual items as rewards. If they want, users can then sell those rewards on the Steam Community Market and on third-party marketplaces; the rarer items can be worth “thousands of dollars,” the lawsuit says. These systems, however, require that users pay Valve $2.49 plus tax to open the loot boxes, and users often get items that are “worth less than what the user spent on the key”. The lawsuit also notes that Valve’s experience for opening a loot box in <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> resembles that of a slot machine.</p><p>Valve didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/884978/valve-lawsuit-loot-boxes-new-york-attorney-general-lawsuit]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight/" id="164327">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> is slated for release later this year, and it’s already promising to honor the multiple eras of everyone’s favorite billionaire playboy-turned-vigilante.</p>



<p>That same attention to honoring the bat’s legacy will also be evident in the gameplay of the upcoming title. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tt-games/" id="462">TT Games</a> isn’t afraid to say they’re influenced by Rocksteady’s iconic Batman: Arkham series, but they still want to make sure the story focuses on core characters that let the gameplay shine, while also offering the kind of quirky experience only LEGO can provide.</p>







<h2 id="h-lego-batman-promises-collectibles-honoring-the-bat-s-decades-long-legacy">LEGO Batman Promises Collectibles Honoring the Bat’s Decades-Long Legacy</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-are-not-leaving-anything-behind-how-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-is-balancing-old-and-new-ign-fan-fest-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking to IGN at IGN Fan Fest 2026,</a> Jonathan Smith, Head of Development at TT Games, elaborated on the team’s approach to the game’s story, which centers on core characters and promises multiple collectibles, allowing everyone to enjoy a Bat Cave full of memorabilia.</p>



<p>“We then want to give you lots and lots of options to see the full range of what those characters can be by giving you more than a hundred different suits to collect,” he said. “So you still get that moment in the Bat Cave where you’ve got all the different suits from all the different characters arrayed in front of you, colorful and glorious. You’re still compelled to want to complete that collection.”</p>







<h2 id="h-lego-batman-will-be-a-game-for-all-bat-fans">LEGO Batman Will Be A Game for All Bat Fans</h2>



<p>Furthermore, Smith explains why he’s not worried about a game like this alienating traditional fans looking for something more akin to the Arkham series, believing that the LEGO games offer broad appeal across multiple generations of players.</p>



<p>“On the contrary, what we find with all our LEGO games is that the more we can draw upon different aspects of a character, the wider we can make our gameplay, the more appealing it is to us as players, and to younger players and older players,” he answers. “There’s something about Lego that just translates well for everybody. So the more we can put into that, we don’t find that it misses the mark for anyone at all. It just brings more to the party.”</p>

Each game in the Marvel Maximum Collection will also include save states and the ability to rewind. The collection also features various display options to make the games look better on modern displays or to replicate the classic CRT look.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Quality, not quantity.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight’s reveal at gamescom 2025, one of the hottest topics surrounding it has been the surprisingly small number of playable characters on its roster. But developer TT Games promises that there’s a very good reason for this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the past decade or so, Lego games ranging from DC and Marvel superheroes to Star Wars and Harry Potter droids and wizards have included unlockable playable character numbers stretching into the hundreds, but in the upcoming Legacy of the Dark Knight, that total at launch is just seven. Those that made the cut include the Bat family and a few friends: Batman, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Jim Gordon, Talia Al Ghul, and Catwoman.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN recently spoke to the head of the TT Games development team, Jonathan Smith, to find out why this number has been reduced so drastically by comparison. “We're taking these individual characters on a journey,” Smith explains. “So you are constantly upgrading and developing new skills and opening up new abilities for each of those characters. Within the Bat family, as well, we really wanted to focus on making those characters really unique, making their personalities come across and their abilities very distinct.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, Batman can throw batarangs and use his grapple to assist in combat as well as solve puzzles, but Catwoman can utilise her rangy whip and call in the help of her kittens by triggering a laser pointer on a target. Those same cats can also be directly controlled by the player to grant access to small vents and distract unsuspecting guards with a delightful “meow”.</p><p>You still get that moment in the Bat Cave where you've got all the different suits from all the different characters arrayed in front of you.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the focus is seemingly on a deeper gameplay experience this time around, with a Rocksteady Arkham-influenced combo-based combat system leading that charge, fans of old-school Lego games shouldn’t fear too much, as Smith promises there will still be plenty to collect across its open world and movie-inspired levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The story is more focused on a tighter roster of characters that are now more differentiated with much deeper gameplay,” confirms Smith. “So they work well in partnership with each other, and we then want to give you lots and lots of options to see the full range of what those characters can be by giving you more than a hundred different suits to collect. So you still get that moment in the Bat Cave where you've got all the different suits from all the different characters arrayed in front of you, colorful and glorious. You're still compelled to want to complete that collection.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Bat Suits, take a look at every one confirmed to be in Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight so far, and if you want to know a lot more about the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-are-not-leaving-anything-behind-how-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-is-balancing-old-and-new-ign-fan-fest-2026">check out more from our interview</a> with the studio as part of IGN Fan Fest 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

      <p>Today <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper/"><u>self-admitted minor-messager</u></a> Guy “Dr Disrespect” Beahm tried to pretend he was part of an event for a major multiplayer game launch, only to be slapped down by the game’s developers. This is <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-lies-about-being-invited-to-highguard-preview-event-2000663184?ref=aftermath.site"><u>not even the first time</u></a> this has happened this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Beahm, a 43-year-old man who despite his age dresses like a clown and yells at video games for a living, <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/2026707147447586823?ref=aftermath.site"><u>posted</u></a> on X The Everything App that he “just finished our photoshoot for tomorrow” and that the ensuing promotional stunt would be “CINEMA,” tagging himself as a #marathonpartner and claiming that he’ll be offering drops during his stream.</p><p>Roughly an hour later, the official <em>Marathon </em>Development Team account swatted him away like a frail, irrelevant gnat, responding to a question about the veracity of Beahm’s claims by <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2026723192606454167?ref=aftermath.site"><u>saying</u></a>, “He’s not partnered.”</p><p>The rampant suspicion that met Beahm’s initial post was correct, considering that he attempted to pull a similar – and frankly more brazen – stunt last month ahead of <a href="https://aftermath.site/highguard-studio-developers-laid-off/"><u>notoriously doomed shooter</u></a> <em>Highguard</em>’s launch, going so far as to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HighGuardgame/comments/1qnd1vl/is_dr_disrespects_badge_fake/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>post an image of a fake badge</u></a> for an in-person event he was not invited to. In that case, too, a developer ultimately <a href="https://x.com/thingscp/status/2015884206329463060?ref=aftermath.site"><u>set the record straight</u></a>, though not before some took Beahm’s words at face value and lamented what they considered to be questionable choices on the part of the <em>Highguard </em>studio.</p><p>Now Beahm is acting like getting caught somehow means he pulled a fast one on everybody.&nbsp;</p><p>“This is the industry in 2026,” he <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/2026750906465996966?ref=aftermath.site"><u>wrote</u></a>, posting images of <em>Marathon </em>devs and publications calling him on his lie. “These people are actually real and dead serious too. I love it.”</p><p>Understandably perplexed responses from followers only yielded <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/2026753296648855742?ref=aftermath.site"><u>further declarations</u></a> that, actually, Beahm was the winner in a game of 12-dimensional chess no one else had any interest in playing.</p><p>It’s clear, of course, that Beahm is attempting to reinsert himself into the headlines, because he has literally nothing else going for him as the clock rapidly ticks down on his empty shell of a life. But even the edgelord crowd that would’ve once appreciated his stunts has moved on to more overtly political (not to mention <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/conservative-reaction-tucker-carlson-nick-fuentes-interview?ref=aftermath.site"><u>heinously noxious</u></a>) figures like Asmongold and Nick Fuentes or the <a href="https://howtodothingswithmemes.substack.com/p/clavicular-and-contentmaxxing?ref=aftermath.site"><u>nihilistically vapid</u></a> yet bizarrely compelling antics of (still <a href="https://howtodothingswithmemes.substack.com/p/clavicular-and-fuentes?ref=aftermath.site"><u>very much right-leaning</u></a>) looksmaxxers like Clavicular.

But they won’t – at least, not in any lasting sense. To the extent that it ever wasn’t, public embarrassment is the only tool Beahm has left. It’s 2026, and the world he helped create by being a massive piece of shit has passed him by. Soon, it will forget him entirely.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper/"><div><p>He’s (Probably Not) Cooked - Aftermath</p><p>Dr Disrespect confessed to exchanging inappropriate messages with a minor, but where there’s an audience, there’s a way</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

		<p>March’s PlayStation Plus monthly games have been announced, and it’s a very mixed bag with three big franchises.</p>
<p>First up, fans of loud trousers and little balls will be delighted with PGA Tour 2K25 on PS5, which originally launched just under a year ago.</p>
<p><iframe title="PGA Tour 2K25 - Launch Trailer I PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/56kdTsvVzYU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We gave the game a respectable<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/26/pga-tour-2k25-review/"> 8/10 in our review.</a> “While not striking the same feeling of EA’s golf games of old, PGA Tour 2K25 is HB Studios’ best effort yet,” said Nick. “There’s enough here to keep you going for a while and if the PGA Tour 2K series continues on this trajectory, might just have the best take on golf games in years to come.”</p>

<p>The next title is rather older, Monster Hunter Rise launched on Switch March 2021 with the PS5 version launching in 2023. Both the PS4 and PS5 version will be available.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Rise - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_zAOt8auYbw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Monster Hunter Rise is an incredible game,” gushed Dominic in our<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/23/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch/"> 9/10 review of the Switch version</a>. “While it may not feel quite as ground-breaking for the series as World did, it boasts a stronger and distinctly Japanese identity, and the changes and streamlined gameplay simply focus on the franchise’s true stars – the monsters. Rise is easily one of the best games for the Nintendo Switch, and one of the finest Monster Hunters ever.” He also gave the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/17/monster-hunter-rise-ps5-review-xbox-series-x/">PS5 version 9/10 as well</a>.</p>

						<h5>God of War: Sons of Sparta</h5><p><span>February 12th, 2026</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Publisher</h5><p><span>Sony Interactive Entertainment</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Mega Cat Studios, Santa Monica Studio</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p><strong>Sony</strong>’s latest <strong>State of Play</strong> was full of surprises that players weren’t expecting from both old franchises and now, but perhaps the most unexpected was a new <strong>God of War</strong> title developed by a studio about as far as you could get from <strong>Santa Monica Studio</strong>’s AAA pedigree: <strong>Mega Cat Studios</strong>. A retro-first developer that’s made some of the latest titles to be released for the Sega Genesis and NES, the concept of <strong>Cory Barlog</strong> lending out the likeness off <strong>Kratos </strong>to another indie studio was something players would have never expected from 2026’s Sony Interactive Entertainment, where so many of their signature exclusives either dabble in live service or the cinematic and thousand-man-hour graphical powerhouses. <strong>God of War: Sons of Sparta</strong> represents a radical take on Kratos’ origin, but does this trip to Laconia appeal to more than just series tourists?</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/God-of-War-Sons-of-Sparta-Love-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>On the surface, God of War: Sons of Sparta shares so little with the namesake beyond a tattooed Kratos spending his afternoon whittling a gift for his daughter Calliope and sharing a story from his past</strong>. Strip these sentimental moments of narration, and you’re left with a Greek tragedy that could have just as easily been told about any other two Spartan brothers without dipping into the rich lore of David Jaffe and Cory Barlog’s franchise. The Olympian gods and the gifts they bestow sight unseen fit the Metrovania formula without anything that feels inherently linked to God of War.</p>



<p>Beyond the shaky ties binding Kratos and his brother Deimos to this Greek tragedy is <strong>a rather memorable story about the brotherhood of Spartans and how abandoning one means abandoning Sparta</strong>. Kratos’ journey is a rather simple one on the surface: find out what happened to fellow cadet Vasilis and safely bring them back home. Along the way, there are a few other Spartans who help guide and shape Kratos’ first formative adventure, but none have the same staying power in the story as Deimos. <strong>The two constantly banter back and forth like a straight man and funny man Manzai routine</strong>, with Kratos usually playing the stoic, serious older brother. <strong>Yes, there is a co-op mode</strong> here as promised by the developers, but it already has two strikes against it: it isn’t unlocked until after beating the game for the first time, and is limited to a select number of combat challenges for the brothers to overcome.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/God-of-War-Sons-of-Sparta-Stab-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>What can make or break an explorative platformer comes down to two core systems: exploration and how players interact with the environment, whether it’s by way of combat or solving emergent puzzles ala Rain World and Animal Well. <strong>The first is something I do have to applaud Mega Cat Studios for: trying something new with the franchise</strong>, even if it felt heavily bloated by the end of the 30 hours I spent running through Laconia's various biomes. New abilities are provided at a regular clip, with new gifts bestowed by the gods upon Kratos, which all serve a dual purpose of traversal and murder.</p>



<p>Long before he was “gifted” the Blades of Chaos, Kratos was a proud Spartan of the Agoge and only knew discipline with the spear and shield. As the single weapon used during the adventure, <strong>the options at the player’s disposal are quite limited compared to what one might expect from a God of War prequel</strong>. Among the two types of resources Kratos can spend on attacks is Spirit, a type of energy that augments almost all of his attacks to deal less damage but builds up a separate stun counter for that enemy. Fill it, and the enemy is left wide open for a Brutal Kill, perhaps the single most inspired by God of War above everything else that can be found in Sons of Sparta.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/God-of-War-Sons-of-Sparta-Spirit-Box-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>One thing that made the franchise so memorable was the dynamic combat, giving Kratos so many different tools to murder his foes. <strong>Scaling it all down to a single weapon not only limits that freeform combat but also reduces it to something that doesn’t fit into the greater ethos of the series</strong>. Even with the various gifts he receives from the gods, combat feels largely stiff and is at odds with the concept of what Kratos will eventually become. Enemies, especially in the later biomes or when Kratos’ level is lower than his foe’s, are HP sponges that simply take too long to dispatch. What’s intended here is to use your regular attacks to fill your spirit gauge and then hold down R1 to augment your strikes to deal additional damage (and recover a small amount of health in the meantime). I get that Mega Cat Studios is trying to combine the orb fountains of earlier God of War games with the deliberate flow of something like DooM Eternal, where each attack is intended to recover a certain resource or be more effective against a specific enemy type. <strong>Unfortunately, without the careful balance of these other titles, not playing the way the devs intended just makes routine fights drag on and pad the runtime</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>What I have to give the developers credit for is how the different biomes of Laconia slowly open themselves up to the player</strong>. Out-of-reach platforms and one-way obstacles are routinely scattered around the critical path for players to pass by the first time they traverse through the expanse biomes, only to return much later in the campaign with the requisite tools to do so. Sometimes players will get a gift and learn how to use it for traversal through emergent gameplay rather than just explicitly telling players outright exactly what every tool is used for (although there are more than plenty of tutorials to stop players if you want the signposting). One that wasn’t immediately apparent was that I assumed I was missing something crucial, where a variety of trees were scattered around Laconia, each bearing a single fruit. Since I couldn’t cut them free or otherwise interact to pick them off the vine, I assumed they were intended for a side quest, and I wouldn’t be able to gather them otherwise. It wasn’t until by pure accident that I tried plucking and sucking the fruits off the branch with the same suction powers granted to the Lycurgus Bust that was used much earlier in the adventure to gather up noxious fumes to traverse safely.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Midway through the adventure, Kratos will get a signature upgrade to take a snapshot of the room he’s in and create a catalog of points of interest when stumbling across an obstacle that takes a tool he’s otherwise missing</strong>. Granted, this was something I had first seen in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, but I am excited to see other developers embrace the feature as we’re well past the days of having to draft out maps and plot out points of interest by hand. Each biome also has its own discrete list of objectives and collectibles, so no needing to scour the entire world map just to find one iron bar you’re missing for the last craftable recipe.</p>



<p>If anything would detract from the exploration of God of War: Sons of Sparta beyond the combat, it would be the sheer length of the adventure. <strong>Most of the Iga-developed Castlevania titles can be comfortably finished in around 8-10 hours</strong>, depending on your appetite for completion. Here, with the adventure running triple that length with far less enjoyable (even if more mechanically complex) combat, <strong>I was eager to roll credits before I even hit the twenty-hour mark</strong>. For $30, players will certainly get their money’s worth, even if the adventure isn’t as refined as the pixel art would show.</p>

<p><strong>God of War: Sons of Sparta is a perfectly fine Metrovania on its own, but it doesn’t live up to the Kratos lineage otherwise</strong>. Either temper your expectations for Kratos’ origin story, or go into this one with an open mind that it’s another generic Greek adventure, and you won’t find your time in Laconia to be a tragedy.</p>

						<section>
				<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta plays it safe when no other God of War title had done so before. Rather than the rage-fueled narrative of a Kratos beyond redemption, this story focuses on his formative years as a proper Spartan and learning the meaning of duty. Trouble is, the story could have just as easily been told with any two Greek brothers to the same effect.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Rich pixel art that makes the various biomes and populace feel distinctively different
</li><li>Hundreds of secrets and collectibles scattered around the world
</li><li>One particular unlockable (found within Sparta itself) pings hidden collectibles
</li><li>Each biome has its own collection list, so no scouring the world for one missing item
</li><li>No missable trophies or collectibles
</li><li>Close to thirty hours per playthrough for the completionists</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Kratos has a constant hunch when charging about like a caveman with spear in hand
</li><li>Padded in unnecessary ways (especially when trying to complete the entire skill tree)
</li><li>Combat lacks dynamic moments and instead feels like a slog even as Kratos earns more gifts of the gods
</li><li>Only a few surface level references to Kratos' history on an adventure that doesn't live up to the God of War legacy
</li><li>Co-Op mode is not what players would expect and remains a postgame unlockable
</li><li>Narrative loses steam part-way and has some major padding issues throughout</li>						</ul>

<p>The latest Xbox Wire has announced updates to cloud screening quality for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members. They’ve also announced updates to ROG Xbox Ally and more.</p>



<p>The latest Xbox Wire has tied together a major change to Xbox platforms. The top change spotlighted an upgrade to Xbox Cloud Gaming. They have begun to allow up to 1440p, higher bitrate streaming for Game Pass Ultimate members. This update is specifically for current and last-gen consoles, joining the PC app, handhelds, and other tech that can run Game Pass.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-rog-xbox-ally-updates">New ROG Xbox Ally Updates</h2>



<p>They have also announced upgrades to the ROG Xbox Ally family of handhelds, including the ability to easily format removable storage. This update also works with officially licensed SanDisk microSD cards made exclusively for the handhelds. Now, when you’re installing a game on your Ally, you can select your removable storage Drive and format them directly.</p>



<p>They’ve also announced an update to graphic shaders on the Ally handhelds. When playing certain games, Ally and Ally X players will now see a pop-up indicating whether shaders were pre-compiled. Advanced Shader Delivery preloads game shaders during download to ensure a smoother experience when opening a game for the first time.</p>







<p>Other updates include adding Reanimal, High on Life 2, and Dragon Quest VII Reimagined to the handheld compatibility program. Reanimal is listed as “mostly compatible,” while the other two games are optimized for handheld play.
