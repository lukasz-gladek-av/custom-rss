Snow might be settling in where you are, temperature's dropping — or perhaps you're lucky to be reading from somewherein the southern hemisphere. But there's one thing that remains the same wherever you're reading from; it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a> time once again!</p>
<p>Here we are once again, looking back at the last month of excellent releases. And it was a busy one in Switch 2 land, with two major Nintendo releases in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment and Kirby Air Riders both launching. Did we get time to play much else?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tvhupm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Of <em>course</em> we did — and we've got a handful of the best hidden gems here from November 2025. Same rules as always apply: Our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from November 2025 from titles we've reviewed of reviews. The three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p>
<p>Easy, right?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:194301 @ 1765123204 -->
<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>Admittedly, the eShop was a bit quieter than previous months this year, so we have a limited selection. Looking at just 8/10s, so the best of the best, 5 games were in contention for the three spots. But that just means all five of these are absolutely worth your time.</p>
<p>Here's what just missed out, with the top three to follow...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/morsels">Morsels</a> (NS1) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/morsels">8/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/videoverse">Videoverse</a> (NS1) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/videoverse">8/10</a></li>
</ul>
<div><div><h2 data-toc="3 to 1" id="top-3">3. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">3rd Place - Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Well wasn't this a nice surprise? The first of Lara's reboot series came to Switch and Switch 2 on the eShop in November, and it's a pretty impressive port, if we do say so ourselves!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> is a refreshing reminder of the talent at Crystal Dynamics, a studio that has been hit by layoffs over the years. While Mouse Mode and graphical fidelity hold this back from being the definitive way to play, it's still a great way to experience Lara's origins. The gameplay is as rock-solid as ever, and the visual design and world is incredible.</p>
<p>We recommend the Switch 2 version wholeheartedly, and scored it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">an 8/10 in our review</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:194042 @ 1765123204 -->
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">2nd Place - Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Goodness, it's like Level-5 never let off the gas. After wowing us with Fantasy Life i earlier this year (an eShop Selects winner, too!), the long-awaited <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> <em>finally</em> launched in November after years of delays and name changes. And, guess what? It's excellent.</p>
<p>Packed from goal-to-goal, Victory Road is a game that feels like you could play it forever. Heck, you don't even have to engage with everything, because the central soccer RPG loop is so darn good that you might not want to do anything else. It's a fabulous return for the series, and has us ever hopeful for that remake.</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">another 8/10 in our books</a>, meaning that Inazuma Eleven is worth the wait; the Switch 2 version is excellent, too.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:194063 @ 1765123204 -->
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">1. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">1st Place - Demonschool (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> might have been late to class — it was delayed multiple times prior to its release last month — but here's another game that was absolutely worth the wait. So worth it, in fact, that it <em>just</em> sneaked into the top spot to become month's eShop Selects winner.</p>
<p>Twisting tactical RPG gameplay into a new form, and blending it with daily school life and demon hunting, Demonschool is almost too cool for school. It's bloody, messy, and street smart, full of quips and humour and dashes of Italian horror-inspired imagery. We can't get enough of that unique grid-based action, either.</p>
<p>Rounding out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/demonschool">our set of 8/10s</a>, Demonschool earns top marks from us, and we hope you consider enrolling.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-november-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[A love letter to glory days of iPhone gaming]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/839050/simogo-legacy-collection-review-switch-steam</link>
            <guid>1375570</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It may be hard to believe now, but the App Store was once a thriving place for inventive indie games. The ubiquity of the iPhone coupled with the relative ease of development for the platform meant that smaller studios were able to get their games in front of huge audiences, leading to a great time of experimentation that unfortunately didn’t last. But if you want to relive those better days, Simogo’s new collection is just the thing.</p><p>You might recognize the name Simogo from more recent titles, like the noir mystery <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24157530/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-switch-steam"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a> or the vibrant interactive pop album <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/621706/sayonara-wild-hearts-ps5-review"><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em></a>. Before that, though, the studio was a creative force in mobile. The <em>Simogo Legacy Collection</em>, as it’s called, collects seven games from this period, plus a companion app, which were all developed over a five-year span between 2010 and 2015.</p><p>The most striking thing about the collection is the sheer range of games. It’s hard to believe they were all made by the same team. Some of the early titles, like the arcade game <em>Kosmo Spin</em> and the charming automatic platformer <em>Bumpy Road</em>, feel like slightly more stylish takes on popular mobile genres. But from there, you can see the studio getting bolder and more confident. <em>Beat Sneak Bandit</em> is a rhythm action game, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/21/4013456/year-walk-iphone-ipad-vision-quest-game"><em>Year Walk</em></a> is an adventure about going on a folklore-inspired vision quest. (Also in the collection is the <em>Year Walk</em> companion app, which details the strange creatures you’ll encounter in the game).</p><p>Things get weirder from there: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/17/4844472/device-6-iphone-ipad-report"><em>Device 6</em></a> is a combination of game and mystery novel; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/6/7162959/the-sailors-dream"><em>The Sailor’s Dream</em></a> is a mixed-media storytelling experiment; and rounding out the bunch is the most traditional title, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/24/9386121/spl-t-iphone-puzzle-game"><em>SPL-T</em></a>, a puzzle game that burrows into your brain like <em>Tetris</em>.</p><p>If there’s any connective tissue between these disparate releases, it’s an incredible sense of style and clear sense of purpose. The games may all be very different, but each has a specific focus and vision. You can tell each was made with care in every element, from the visuals to the game design to the music.</p><p>The same goes for the collection itself. I played the game on the Switch 2 (it’s also on Steam and the original Switch) and it re-creates the mobile experience by essentially turning your device into a giant smartphone, complete with a basic menu where the games all appear as app icons. There are a whole bunch of extras to dig into, including playable prototypes of some of the games and other bonus materials, like a podcast series that was released as a companion to <em>The Sailor’s Dream</em>. Don’t sleep on the music player; there are some amazing tracks here.</p><p>The <em>Simogo Legacy Collection</em> isn’t just a well-crafted collection of some great games; it’s an important act of preservation. You can still find them in the App Store right now, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/23/23038870/apple-app-store-widely-remove-outdated-apps-developers">Apple’s digital store can be hostile to older games</a>, so this release ensures the likes of <em>Year Walk</em> and <em>Device 6</em> can continue on through other platforms. It’s also a great reminder of how vibrant those early days were and how the best stuff stands the test of time.</p><p><sub><em>The </em>Simogo Legacy Collection<em> is available now on Steam and the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/839050/simogo-legacy-collection-review-switch-steam]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="52ff1a7a464fb"><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/52ff1a7a464fb/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Apart from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, one other significant Switch 2 release this week was the third-party title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. While Ubisoft's new feudal Japan outing has been mostly well-received by critics on Nintendo's new hybrid platform, it seems the experience hasn't been quite as enjoyable for some players.</p>
<p>Multiple message board posts and social media threads online are filled with player reports about the game randomly crashing. Some players have even experienced repeated crashes, forcing them to completely halt their play sessions until Ubisoft deploys a patch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ZZTIyng2dUk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZZTIyng2dUk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytZZTIyng2dUk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZZTIyng2dUk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZZTIyng2dUk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed746e4bnhrgjm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The following comments in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1pcp97o/assassins_creed_shadows_has_a_bad_crashing/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=action_bar&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/assassins-creed-shadows-on-switch-2-supposedly-unplayable-for-some-players-after-repeated-crashes">thread on the Switch 2 subreddit</a> highlights just how much of a problem this has become for some players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DrLukeyy</strong> - "I also had 4 crashes back to back when trying to complete that add a building mission. Probably gonna wait for a patch"</p>
<p><strong>dennishylau</strong> - "I’m around Senri Hills now, and the crash is so frequent it is unplayable. Playing on dock and using internal storage."</p>
<p><strong>ApprehensiveLie8032</strong> - "My game crashed 10 times in 20 minutes, I couldn't play. And the worst part is we paid for it and there's nothing we can do; Ubisoft doesn't care."</p>
<p><strong>Safe-Reputation-2737</strong> - "My game crashes no joke every 5 minutes it’s unplayable"</p>
<p><strong>EmotionAwkward411</strong><strong>3</strong> - "Yes I confirm it is difficult to play it correctly the game keeps cutting 5 crashes in 30 minutes. I'm waiting for an update, it's impossible to play it correctly"</p>
<p><strong>stevenandthecg</strong> - "For me it is unplayable, it crashes every 2 minutes. Support is gaslighting me saying that it is an issue with my console. Never had any issue with any other game. I tried everything, I am kind of desperate..."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is seemingly no clear solution or fix to stop these game crashes, but it hasn't stopped players sharing their own ideas.</p>
<p>Some suggest playing the title exclusively in docked mode, making sure the game is installed on Switch 2's internal storage, changing the system resolution, turning off HDR, disabling various other options, and even reinstalling the game...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Central</strong> - "Im playing Assassin's Creed Shadows on handheld &amp; I haven't had a crash yet &amp; the game is still on the internal hard drive of the Switch 2."</p>
<p><strong>andrsperdomo</strong> - "I installed it directly on the console and the problem does not go away."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some users here on Nintendo Life have also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">reported encountering crashes</a> in Assassin's Creed Shadows for Switch 2.</p>
<p>Critics have noted <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-impresses-in-handheld-play">issues with frame-pacing</a>, and recommend handheld mode for the best experience, but there seems to be fewer reports about game crashes during the review phase. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/03/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-review/">TheSixthAxis</a> was one site that directly acknowledged this "underlying issue" – referencing "a series of crashes" not long into the adventure, but "no clear trigger". <a href="https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/73520/assassins-creed-shadows-first-impressions-nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo World Report</a> also mentioned the "occasional" software crash.</p>
<p>In our own review here on Nintendo Life, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">we admitted Assassin's Creed Shadows wasn't the perfect port</a>, but still felt it was a colossal achievement on Nintendo's new system.</p>
<p>So, when might we see a patch for this problem? As highlighted in the Reddit thread above, the <a href="https://youtu.be/KYaby1Yb1Ck">YouTube channel 'What's It Like?'</a> (which also "experienced several crashes" during its review of the game) says it reached out to Ubisoft's support and there's supposedly a patch planned for mid-December, which will apparently address "some" technical issues with the Switch 2 version. And with so many player reports now, Ubisoft has hopefully got the message.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194517 @ 1765123948 -->
<p>Until we get an update from Ubisoft, tell us how your time with Assassin's Creed Shadows on the Switch 2 has been so far? Have you experienced any crashes? <em>Vote in our poll, and let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>Kurakasis, a video game researcher and notable leaker who has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-believe-they-know-what-machinegames-indiana-jones-game-is-called">correctly leaked announcements ahead of time before</a>, first <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1996337045921493050">teased</a> the news last week, stressing that the "big Star Wars game" has "nothing to do with Star Wars: Zero Company or Eclipse", two Star Wars-flavoured games already announced.</p>

<p>Then, over the weekend, the leaker turned it up a notch and alleged the title of the game "ends with The Old Republic", appending a wide-eyed emoji.</p> <div>

<p>As many are speculating on in the comments on X/Twitter, thoughts immediately turn to Saber Interactive's long-in-the-works and reportedly troubled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> remake. In March, the team broke its silence to assure us that it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-kotors-troubled-remake-still-coming-suggests-studios-latest-comments">still on the way</a>, telling us, "Everything that we have talked about is still in development", but it's been pretty quiet ever since.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though, the leaker clearly uses the word "announcement", intimating it's either huge news about an existing game... or a revelation about one we don't yet know about.</p>
<p>That's possibly why some fans hope it will be a single-player Old Republic game. But without any formal word from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/lucasfilm-games">Lucasfilm Games</a>, it's probably best not to get your hopes up just yet. With The Game Awards just days away, though, we may finally get to see more later this week. Watch this space.</p><p>Admittedly, there hasn't been much information about any of the Star Wars games currently in development lately, either, but in October, Quantic Dream assured us that it was still developing Star Wars: Eclipse, the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavy-rain-developer-quantic-dream-reveals-star-wars-eclipse">first revealed in 2021</a>. In October 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quantic-dreams-star-wars-eclipse-development-is-simmering">development was said to be "simmering"</a>, while earlier this year, Quantic Dream CEO Guillaume de Fondaumière <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">confirmed the studio was not impacted by cuts at NetEase</a> and development continued "at full pace".</p>
<p>Go just a little further back, and EA finally gave us our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-zero-company-is-a-gritty-and-authentic-story-coming-to-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-in-2026">first look at its upcoming Star Wars strategy game, Star Wars: Zero Company back in April</a>. The single-player turn-based tactics game by Bit Reactor and Respawn was confirmed back in 2022, described as a "gritty and authentic original story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars".</p>

            <guid>1375549</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="5411d4a95e9ac"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5411d4a95e9ac/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>They say history repeats itself, and right now I’m living through a redux of my own childhood gaming obsession.</p>
<p>To understand my plight, we need to rewind to 1988. I had cut my gaming teeth on a dusty Atari 2600 my dad picked up at a garage sale. I loved me some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/missile_command">Missile Command</a> and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/warlords">Warlords</a>, but once my best friend and next-door neighbour got an NES, it was Game Over for Atari. I didn’t want an NES of my own; I <em>needed</em> it.</p>
<p>Hint-dropping became my full-time job until, lo and behold, an NES Action Set and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a> appeared under the Christmas tree.</p>
<figure data-uuid="d3c7a307cc71f"><a title="Nintendo Action Set" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3c7a307cc71f/nintendo-action-set.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>A modern recreation of past events — <em><span></span> Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Well, well, well, how the turntables...</strong></h2>
<p>Fast forward almost 40 years and the tables have turned. Now I’m the parent pestered by a passionate guerrilla marketer. This generation’s Nintendo fanatic is subjecting me to the same level of sustained pressure that I, no doubt, applied to my parents all those years ago. He doesn’t just want the Switch 2; he <em>needs</em> it, and with a resolve that frankly terrifies me.</p>
<p>Here’s a recent interaction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Son:</strong> Hey, Dad, did you see the reviews for Kirby Air Riders?<strong><br>
Me:</strong> No, what’d they say?<strong><br>
Son:</strong> They like it, but everyone agrees with you that it’s weird Nintendo released two racing games in six months. If we had a Switch 2, would you rather get Mario Kart World or Kirby?<strong><br>
Me:</strong> Mario Kart, I guess. But it’ll be a while before we get a Switch 2.<strong><br>
Son:</strong> True. It could be four or five years before we get a Switch 2, so we’ll see how you feel then. Thanks, Dad!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interactions like this occur daily. He delivers Switch 2 news with the regularity of a weather report and the cunning of a snake - mirroring my objections, using decoy options, emphasising shared values, and deploying every other psychological trick in the preteen playbook.</p>
<p>I’m witnessing a masterclass in emotional manipulation.</p>
<h2><strong>The Holdout</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="431ff12ca8ccf"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/431ff12ca8ccf/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Why don’t I already own a Switch 2?</p>
<p>Frankly, I'm unconvinced by Nintendo’s latest console. I operate on logic, rational thinking, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-how-does-your-personality-affect-your-gaming">spreadsheets</a>, and the Switch 2 hasn’t passed my cold calculus. Call me a Switch 2 holdout, but I’ve weighed the scales and don’t yet see a positive value proposition.</p>
<ul>
<li>No OLED screen</li>
<li>No proper Zelda or Mario exclusives</li>
<li>Storage prices that should come with a side of lube</li>
</ul>
<p>No judgement to the millions of Switch 2 owners out there, but I can wait, thank you very much.</p>
<p>Not so, for my boy. He doesn’t care about the cost of MicroSD Express cards; he cares that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Age of Imprisonment</a> runs at a smooth 60fps, that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a> would look great in HDR mode on the upstairs TV, and that you can use the mouse controls “on your pants!”</p>
<h2><strong>The Trojan Horse</strong></h2>
<p>Last week, my son pulled the ultimate move, and it might be the straw that breaks this proverbial donkey’s back.</p>
<p>As a birthday present for his brother-in-law, my son wrote a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WetljuBFBBUjMEpQ6yN4FyxWQqBlEcqooM40aauZpdE/edit?usp=sharing">nine-page, 3,000-word summary</a> titled "Everything I know about the Switch 2". Ostensibly, this was a gift for his oldest sister’s husband, but in reality, I know it’s a precision-guided Trojan horse aimed directly at my wallet.</p>

<p>He casually asked if I’d proofread the paper. Of course I said yes, knowing full well it was a trap, but two pages in and I couldn’t help but admire the craftsmanship. He didn’t just itemise specs and list games; he was analysing the industrial design with the scrutiny of a structural engineer and previewing games with more brutal honesty than Ricky Gervais hosting the Golden Globes.</p>
<p>An entire page breaks down the kickstand alone, comparing it positively to those on the original Switch ("it tips EASILY") and the OLED, before waxing poetic about the Switch 2’s rubber-bottomed, 150-degree adjustable stand.</p>
<p>I found myself nodding. <em>Rubber on the bottom? My, that is practical.</em></p>
<p>His tome explicitly told me — sorry, my son-in-law — to "save your money" on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza DLC</a> because “one new world and a new mode” isn’t worth 20 bucks. He also argued that buying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> would be a poor value proposition since “you don't need two racing games on your Switch.”</p>
<p>Wait, another psychological trick? He’s been gushing about Air Riders for weeks! He was arguing <em>against</em> a purchase he wanted in order to strengthen his core position. I’m telling you, the kid’s a mad genius.</p>
<h2><strong>Heart or Mind?</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="85bd4c62cbf5b"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/85bd4c62cbf5b/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As much as I’m still sceptical of the Switch 2’s value proposition, I have to admit that my son’s tactics are working. He’s presented the data. He’s acknowledged the flaws. He’s even acted as a <em>consumer advocate</em> to protect his dear old dad’s pride.</p>
<p>The effort he put into this document — analysing frame rates, first-party titles, and the rubber on the bottom of a kickstand — has me thinking that this isn't about value propositions or fiscal responsibility anymore. Rather, it's that same, powerful emotional connection I felt in 1988, staring at the 2600 and dreaming of an NES.</p>
<p>His treatise ends with a question, “Should you buy it?”</p>
<p>And his answer: “Well in my opinion, yes. But… I'm kinda biased lol so decide on the info that I've given you.”</p>
<p>Well played, son. Come Christmas morning, we’ll find out what wins: my Greek mind or my son’s Trojan heart. Then again, Santa Claus might just surprise us both.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora 2.0 Update Adds Third Person, NG+, NVIDIA DLSS 4, MFG & RR, and AMD FSR 4]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Exactly two years ago, Ubisoft's Massive Entertainment released Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, an open world action/adventure game set in the fictional world created by James Cameron's movies.</p>



<p>Despite the hype surrounding the combination of the developer behind the successful The Division franchise and such a high-profile intellectual property, which grossed over $5.2 billion in film sales alone, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora didn't receive the warmest welcome from either critics or gamers. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Nathan Birch rated it 7.5 out of 10, noting that it was a remarkable technical achievement, but the combat often felt frustrating. The game didn't set any new sales records, either.</p>



<p>That said, it has a second wind to exploit now: the upcoming release of the third movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash, scheduled to be available in theaters from December 19. That's why Massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-expansion-december-release-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is going to launch a new expansion called From the Ashes</a> on that same day. </p>



<p>In the meantime, though, they just released the big 2.0 free update. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-new-game-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> a few months ago, it includes the long-requested third-person view modes and New Game+. <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-leak-shows-new-images-game-likely-to-be-first-person-only/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ever since the first leaks</a>, it was clear that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora would be a first-person only game, but that's changed now, potentially opening up the experience to all those players who can't or won't deal with first-person motion, due to sickness or sheer preference. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora: Third-person Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mWHd5neGekk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Following the patch, players can seamlessly switch between first and third-person by pressing the J key on PC, holding the touchpad on PlayStation 5, or holding the View button on Xbox Series S and X. As for New Game+, it allows you you carry over all of your gear and skills from a completed playthrough and even get access to a new skill tree for the Sarentu, as well as higher level gear. As you'd expect in such a mode, you will face more challenging enemies.</p>



<p>But that's not all that the developer has added in Update 2.0. There are several notable additions from a technical standpoint, including NVIDIA DLSS 4 (the latest transformer model, although the previous CNN model can still be selected), DLSS Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, <a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-xess-2-now-enabled-in-44-games-more-titles-coming-soon-enhanced-ai-upscaling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XeSS 2</a>, XeSS Frame Generation, and AMD FSR 4, though the latter can only be enabled by AMD users at a driver level, not in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.</p>



<p>That said, Massive shared a few known issues related to Frame Generation:</p>



<ul>
<li>Crash on startup when XeSS Frame generation is enabled.</li>



<li>Frame Generation cannot be activated while the Steam Overlay is on.</li>



<li>FSR3 Frame Generation causes stuttering when used in Borderless Fullscreen.</li>



<li>Switching from Borderless to Fullscreen while Frame Generation is on causes the framerate to drop significantly.</li>
</ul>



<p>Hopefully, those can be fixed soon.</p>

<p>This week, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Prime 4</a> finally in our hands, we're throwing things back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/metroid_prime_pinball">Metroid Prime Pinball</a>. Now, is this the best game with 'Metroid Prime' in its title? Probably not. But there's no knocking Nintendo's efforts to try something new — and, aside from Kirby and Pokémon, who's better to star in a pinball game?</p>
<p>Europe and North America opted for the same design on this one, so we have a good old match-up between East and West on our hands. Let's check 'em out.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/ds/related-articles:1590 @ 1765124083 -->
<h2>Europe / North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="5d50e26799760"><a title="Metroid Prime Pinball -" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5d50e26799760/metroid-prime-pinball.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6557-metroid-prime-pinball">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You've got to give it to the Western cover, there's no doubting what the game has in store after looking at that design. Samus looms over the top half of the box, and a pinball table occupies the bottom. Simple. It's all a little bit subdued, opting for the metallic greys and yellows that dominated sci-fi in the mid-2000s over anything particularly eye-catching, but hey, it's Metroid Pinball, alright!</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="2f586aa3aae8e"><a title="Metroid Prime Pinball -" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f586aa3aae8e/metroid-prime-pinball.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6557-metroid-prime-pinball">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese design has a lot of the same cues as its European counterpart, but the end result is rather different. Right from the jump, look at all of those colours! The dull greys of the other cover are overshadowed by neon lights and lasers, making the pinball table look that bit more exciting. There are also Metroids floating overhead, and nothing screams 'action pinball' quite like <em>aliens</em>.</p>
<p>Samus is a lot less prominent in this one, shrinking away into the upper right corner, but we'd say that the series' vibes are still present and correct.</p>

<p>Spot the difference</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo released a new update for the Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, bumping the racer up to Version 1.4.0.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, this is a major update, including all sorts of adjustments, changes and improvements. One highlight, in particular, is tied to the game's courses. As mentioned in the patch notes, the layout of select tracks has been changed for certain modes.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/fMbSBsq-qeQ">YouTube channel 'RetroArchive'</a> has now shared a look at all these changes and redesigns in a side-by-side comparison video featuring footage of the original versions. As a point of reference, here's what's been updated according to Nintendo's official patch notes:</p>
<h3>Mario Kart World - Version 1.4.0</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Changed the course layout of below courses for "VS Race", or "Race" in "Online Play" or "Wireless Play".</em></li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Streamer Awards have wrapped for another year, and the trophies have all been dished out to the most deserving content creators of 2025. It was a mixed bag, and while most awards were fairly predictable, there were a few hidden gems in the line-up. The least surprising of all was the award for Best VTuber, which went to TheBurntPeanut.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut has had a stellar year, putting up some remarkable numbers and growing at an alarming pace on account of his entertaining, high-energy content, hilarious animations, and genuinely enjoyable gameplay. This year, he pushed Ironmouse out of the spot that the former champion had held for three years straight.</p>



<h2 id="h-theburntpeanut-is-your-vtuber-of-the-year">TheBurntPeanut is Your VTuber of The Year</h2>



<p>If you’re unfamiliar with TheBurntPeanut, all you need to do is check out a compilation of his most entertaining clips on YouTube to get a taste of his brand. He’s an animated peanut that uses a mix of skins and ‘costumes’, combined with an energetic commentary and some hilarious gameplay, to keep tens of thousands of viewers entertained at any given time.</p>



<p>This year has been transformative for TheBurntPeanut, who has used games like Escape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders to propel himself into the major spotlight.</p>



<p>At The Streamer Awards this year, the nominations were pretty close to call:</p>



<ul>
<li>Chibidoki</li>



<li>Ironmouse</li>



<li>Kenji</li>



<li>Mori Calliope</li>



<li>TheBurntPeanut</li>
</ul>



<p>Ironmouse had previously won the VTuber of the Year award at The Streamer Awards for three consecutive years, but TheBurntPeanut’s stellar year managed to push him into the top spot.</p>



<p>In his acceptance speech, TheBurntPeanut said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am honored to accept this Best VTuber of the Year award.</p>



<p>It is a great honor to accept this Best VTuber of the Year award, big shout-out to QTCinderella for putting on this immaculate award ceremony as well as a shout-out to the Peanut team, making sure the streams are always the best they can be.</p>



<p>Obviously, the largest shout-out to the Bungulators, you guys are the best, thank you for all the support, gentlemen.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full ceremony can be watched here:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>TheBurntPeanut also scooped the award for Best FPS Streamer, making him one of only a few streamers to walk away with more than one award at the event.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/faze-eliminates-3d-max-budapest-major-dream/</link>
            <guid>1375498</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major has already proven to be an energetic event loaded with drama and breakout performances, and the third stage is adding spice to that mix now that high-tier eliminations are taking place. In a decisive clash, FaZe Clan pushed 3DMAX off the board with a 2-0 sweep, fighting to keep their playoff dream alive.</p>



<p>FaZe walked into the series under some intense pressure, given their performance thus far, which has resulted in losses against both Team Spirit and The MongolZ.</p>



<p>What will happen next for FaZe Clan? Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the Starladder Major Budapest 2025. Visit <a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a> to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>

<h2 id="h-faze-clan-remains-firm-for-now">FaZe Clan Remains Firm For Now</h2>



<p>The earlier losses for FaZe Clan at the Budapest Major raised questions about the roster’s cohesion and ability to adapt, but coming out against the underdog squad 3DMAX, the team looked somewhat revitalized. Going forward, FaZe Clan will need to hammer home the point against Passion UA to break a 2-2 lock for both squads.</p>



<p>For 3DMAX, the StarLadder Budapest Major marks the end of their 2025 sprint. The squad did well to reach this far, but they scraped through the second stage and failed to make waves in the third. It was a tough ask, though. The team was pitted against the likes of FaZe, Vitality, and paiN during the awkward run, which is a huge hill to overcome for any squad.</p>



<p>During the short-lived series, FaZe Clan barely gave 3DMAX a chance for respite. The first map, played out on Dust2, was a wash, and FaZe Clan’s Jakub ‘jcobbb’ Pietruszewski wasted no time showing why he was a valuable new signing with a stunning quad kill. The end scoreline was 13-6, setting the tone perfectly.</p>



<p>The second round was even more dominant, with jcobbb showing up again and the FaZe squad managing to secure a 15-5 finish to push 3DMAX from the tournament.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan’s final match in this stage will be against Passion UA, while six other teams will also look to break the 2-2 deadlock:</p>



<ul>
<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>Natus Vincere</li>



<li>Passion UA</li>
</ul>

<p>Use these Roblox Catch A Monster monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Coins, Potions, XP and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you a fan of the ultra-popular Japanese anime series Pokémon? If so, you need to stop what you’re doing and check out Catch A Monster on Roblox immediately. Catch A Monster can be considered the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-crash-bots-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> version of the various Pokémon games that have been released over the years. Players have to catch a variety of creatures and train them by fighting both trainers as well as other creatures. Each player will have a limited party of monsters they can have at any time, so picking the right ones is of crucial importance.&nbsp;</p>







<p>By training these creatures, players can increase their level and make them stronger, thereby allowing them to defeat harder and more powerful enemies. Players start the game on a basic island and have to work their way up the ladder, while also hatching eggs to gain pets. Bosses spawn at predetermined locations every 15 minutes in Catch A Monster, offering guaranteed drops and rewards. With plenty of things to do and a large open world to explore, fans of the popular Japanese series will surely enjoy their time in Catch A Monster.</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Catch A Monster is a simple process that doesn’t require players to complete any steps in advance. Input any of the active codes into the correct text box after navigating through the game’s menus to claim your rewards. If you’re new to the Roblox environment, however, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide that will make redeeming codes a walk in the park:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Catch A Monster.</li>



<li>Click on the Gift icon on the right side of the screen.</li>



<li>input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Redeem’ button to claim your rewards.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-catch-a-monster-codes">How To Get More Catch A Monster Codes</h2>



<p>Catch A Monster codes are usually released either through the game’s official channels or on the developers’ socials. Keeping track of all of these though, can be a hassle, especially because players are not notified when any of the existing codes expire. This is why we encourage all players to keep this page bookmarked, as we update it with new codes as soon as they release, while expired codes are also moved to their corresponding section.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The release date for Phantom Blade Zero will be revealed during The Game Awards 2025. It was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-release-date-reveal-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in August</a> that the Wuxia-inspired title will have its launch date shown before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Announced in 2023, Phantom Blade Zero follows an elite assassin finding the killer of The Order’s patriarch. With a mix of Soulslike gameplay and RPG staples, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zeros-boss-ai-uses-popular-fighting-game-mechanic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its intricate combat system</a> has been a highlight for fans. Earlier this year at the Future Games Show @ Gamescom, director Soulframe Liang stated that the game’s release date would be announced before 2025 ends. While many expected it to be at The Game Awards, it’s now been confirmed to be shown during the event.</p>







<h2 id="h-world-premiere-of-phantom-blade-zero-release-date-to-come-at-the-game-awards-2025">World Premiere of Phantom Blade Zero Release Date to Come at The Game Awards 2025</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Announced on <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1997456018897297841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> by The Game Awards, a short video reveals that Phantom Blade Zero’s release date will be unveiled at the event.  The video shows the protagonist painting a Chinese dragon, which goes berserk at the end of the clip. While no gameplay is shown in the short clip, it’s likely fans will see more at the world premiere.</p>



<p>Dated for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 11th</a>, The Game Awards are already stacked with reveals. From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-new-look-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and Devil May Cry, there’s much to look forward to. Plus, with the mysterious statue that many are still figuring out, it’s sure to be one to watch. Now, Phantom Blade Zero joins the roster, with at least something certain being shown: the release date. 2026 is already a packed year with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and 007 First Light, but S-GAME’s action title is definitely one to keep an eye on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When you sit down with a game, you make a pact with it: you’ll push the buttons, and it will show you what happens when you do. A lot of games don’t really care to interrogate what that means, to use the physical realities of the medium to tell a story. Remember having to plug your controller into the second port of your PlayStation to fight Psycho Mantis? That’s rare. Instead, many of them are content to be films where you control the action. Rhythm Doctor is not one of those games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the eight or so hours I spent seeing its 1.0 version through to completion, Rhythm Doctor frustrated me, earned some laughs, made me tear up, and used this medium to tell a story in ways I’ve never seen a game do before. It is one of the most difficult rhythm games I’ve ever played, and one I couldn’t put down. Near the end, I felt like I might need a little rhythm therapy myself, a shock to the heart to keep me going. But I wanted to live in that world a little longer, listen to these songs a little more, spend a little more time with these characters. It was worth it. Rhythm Doctor drove me crazy, and I loved it. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rhythm Doctor Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Rhythm Doctor, you are an intern assigned to Middlesea Hospital. You work remotely, so you sit behind a screen and watch what’s happening through the hospital’s cameras. The doctors and patients speak to you, but you cannot respond to them. Well, you can, but they can’t hear the intern. Like you as a player, the intern is part of this world but not of it. A participant, but not a resident. When you see yourself on screen, it is as a long arm hovering over a button. The patients sometimes jokingly call you Doctor Finger. It’s a brilliant bit of “player-as-character” that Rhythm Doctor makes the most of throughout its runtime. That this story features some absolutely gorgeous pixel art spritework is just a bonus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The simple but extremely effective gimmick here is that Middlesea is experimenting with a new treatment that promotes healing by defibrillating patients’ hearts in time with their heartbeats. Your job is to press the button on the defibrillator in sync with the beat of their heart. That’s it. There is only one button. Press it every 7th beat in time with the patient’s heart. Line the beats up properly, and you’ll cure what ails them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That might not sound hard, and it isn’t. At least at first. One, two, three, four, five, six, <em>press</em> is easy enough. But then you’ll get to polyrhythms, hemiolas, irregular time signatures, silent beats, the works. Again, all you have to do is press your button on every seventh beat. But it gets challenging quickly. I used to think I was good at rhythm games. I played Guitar Hero and Rock Band on Expert. I used to play a couple different instruments. After playing Rhythm Doctor, I no longer think that. Few games have challenged me like this did.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’ll have to keep pace yourself, and overcoming initially brutal levels was a thrill.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes you’ll be treating multiple patients at once, each with their own rhythm, and you’ll have to keep track of them simultaneously. Some may drop in and drop out. The excellent songs their hearts are beating to will abruptly change pace. You may have to hit notes in rapid succession or hold them or match a tempo you’ll hear and then have to reproduce. There is a visual indicator here, but it’s not going to hold your hand or tell you exactly when to press your lone button. You’ll have to keep pace yourself, and overcoming initially brutal levels was a thrill. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhythm Doctor will help you out – most levels feature a dedicated tutorial teaching you new concepts, certain beats are often preceded by unique sound effects to let you know they’re coming, and a nice nurse will often call out timing changes with a “Get Set Go!” in time to the beat before the change occurs, but visual prompts are limited. There’s no “fit the note into this handy-dandy slot it's barreling towards” in Rhythm Doctor. <em>You </em>have to keep time. I often found myself tapping my other hand against my thigh, silently counting to seven, or moving my head from side to side.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And you’ll need to, because Rhythm Doctor likes to mess with you, to use the idea that you’re a guy behind a screen pressing buttons to tell its story. If you’re treating a patient while a virus is messing with your connection, you’ll feel it. There will be static, the beat will be thrown off, and things will pop up or fade out. At one point, a bunch of pop-ups saying “DISTRACTION!” overwhelm your screen. As a player, it’s annoying, especially if you’re somewhat reliant on visual cues. As a storytelling conceit, it’s dynamite. Dealing with that would be difficult and irritating, especially at work! I could practically hear the virus mocking me; J.K. Simmons breathing in my ear. “Not quite my tempo.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not the only time Rhythm Doctor pulls this trick. Sometimes, it will shrink your screen and bounce it around to the beat. Once, when Cole, a down on his luck musician with a caffeine addiction, rushes across the screen to get to Nicole, a barista at the hospital’s cafe who he’s grown fond of, the game window travels with him as you struggle to keep up via the hospital’s cameras, going entirely off your monitor before reappearing. Even the songs themselves tell a story: when a patient named Logan has trouble admitting his feelings for another named Hailey, their songs reflect it, and he often loses the beat during that level. As the two get closer across several songs, their heart rates grow closer in time. When he finally summons the courage to make it happen, the track resembles a duet at a Broadway show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The songs here vary from showtunes to dubstep to techno and everything in-between, and each is used to tell a story like this. Every patient’s unique heart rhythm can and will show up in other tracks as they bond with one another, whether it’s a miner helping an injured baseball player rehab from an injury, an elderly couple at opposite ends of the hospital who long to see one another, or Cole and Nicole hash out their issues through song. In Rhythm Doctor, the music is part of the story. Each track moves the narrative forward, and gets to the heart of who these people are and how they feel about one another. You can treat a lot of things with medicine, but sometimes the only cure for a damaged heart is working through what caused it in the first place. I cared about these characters and their relationships, and I wanted to stick around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s good, because you’ll probably have to. Rhythm Doctor holds you to a high standard. Cs may get you degrees, but you’ll need a B grade or better before you can move on to the next level. That can be a little frustrating if you get stuck, and I’m not ashamed to say I had to turn the difficulty down to clear some of the harder stages. Some even have “Night Shift” versions for an extra challenge and a bit more story, and there are several bonus levels to tackle as well, which are goofy and a lot of fun, like the one where a group of nurses pursues a limousine, kicking away projectiles the limo is hurling at them. Others are just chill vibes where you hang out with the characters. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I cared about these characters and their relationships, and I wanted to stick around.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Through it all, though, you’re reminded that while you’re part of this story, it’s not about you. Without spoilers, there’s a rather touching scene later on that you hear about but don’t witness because you’re busy helping another patient. Almost every other character is there, but you’re helping someone else, and the scene happens without you. You only hear the other characters react to it. On one level, it’s smart commentary on the limitations of being behind a screen and the role of the player; you’re not part of this world physically, not matter how badly you might want to be. Your job is to watch and press buttons. On another, it’s a reminder that no one recovery, no one part of the hospital, and no one patient, is less important than any other. It all matters. And there’s emotional resonance here. When one of Cole’s tracks says “Sometimes I’m angry I’m not doing better than I thought I’d do at this point,” I had to pause the game for a moment. I’ve been there. I understand that feeling. I understood that character, and all his flaws. And I admired his persistence in spite of it all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhythm Doctor also features some shockingly relevant commentary on the state of healthcare and capitalism. As the program you’re part of gains traction, there’s pressure from the hospital’s administrator (and head doctor) to expand it, eventually resulting in layoffs to hospital staff and overworked doctors. After all, why have staff when you can have a miracle treatment an intern in their pajamas can perform from their laptop? You don’t need people, right? Just results. Rhythm Doctor ends about as perfectly as it can given all the plates it’s spinning, but it’s nice that it never pulls punches. Nothing is free; everything has a cost, and that cost might be other people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you need a break from the story, there’s also a comprehensive level editor to play with and community tracks to download. I’ll be honest with y’all; I’m not much of a level editor cat, but what I’ve played of the community tracks is genuinely impressive. Rhythm Doctor’s soundtrack is so good that I’ve listened to it in between sessions, but it’s great to see developer 7th Beat Games turn their baby over to the community and say “go nuts.” In a world obsessed with selling you something at every moment, editors like this feel increasingly rare, and I’m glad it’s here.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Rhythm Doctor is one of the hardest games I’ve played in a hot second, regardless of genre. But the music, the humor, and the characters are all so strong that it compelled me to stick with it. Most of all, I loved the way Rhythm Doctor embraces being a game and uses that to tell its story in a way no other medium could. These songs aren’t just something you play along with; you feel them. You experience them and the emotions they convey because of how they’re presented. It’s a remarkable achievement. And all it takes is one button. Moreover, it made me want to play music again. I’ve always wanted to learn to play piano. Maybe it’s time. I’ll probably fail, at first. I’ll probably fail a lot, actually. But if Rhythm Doctor believes anything, it’s that it’s the courage to keep going, even when all seems lost, that counts. That’s what makes you who you are.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/rhythm-doctor-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The eternal problem with online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> of any flavour that has some variation on a levelling system, is that eventually you run out of room, and can't progress any more. That's why so many of them essentially allow you to reset your levels, or to prestige as it's often colloquially known. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> is one such game that will feature such a system, and in a new blog post, developer Embark have outlined what you get when you prestige.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-expedition-project-is-departing-soon">blog post</a> discusses the game's Expedition Project, its version of prestiging, explaining that it will kick off on December 17th, running for a six-day period until the 22nd. Within this period, you can choose to leave The Rust Belt for good, as long as you've reached level 20, and you'll start from a new character with some buffs and advantages.
</p>
<p>
Here's how it works: once an Expedition has departed, any items you have in your stash are put towards it. Every one million coins worth of value nets you an extra skill point you can use on your new raider, with the ability to earn five skill points total. Restarting with a new raider does mean that your skill tree, level, stash, workshop, crafting abilities, and blueprints will be completely reset, but you won't have to do the initial onboarding again.
</p>
<p>
In turns of some permanently unlocked bonuses, carrying out an Expedition nets you the Patchwork Raider outfit, Scrappy Janitor Cap, Expeditions Indicator icon, and +12 stash space. You also get some temporary buffs, like a 10% repair buff, 5% xp boost, and 6% more materials from Scrappy. One point to note though is that "the account buffs will expire if you choose not to depart with the subsequent expedition. Bear in mind, buffs will increase in power for your next three expeditions (but only one departure allowed per Expedition Window!)."
</p><p>
Explaining why they're handling a progression wipe like this, Embark said that making the Expedition Project optional is their "solution to some of the problems that inevitably arise with mandatory wipes - specifically, by respecting your time investment in the game." They want to offer people a choice between accomplishing more if there's things they're yet to do, but if they're ready to move on, they can do so. Basically, start planning for what you want to do come December 17th! Happy Arc Raiding!

Video games have a tendency to be very impatient in a way that I think often makes for a worse experience. Constant rewards of many flavours push us to chase after the next challenge, there's not nearly enough games that ask us to slow down. That's why I love a fishing minigame. It is a test of patience that you cannot win by brute forcing anything, the fish must come to you, and you must wait for the right time. About Fishing, the next release from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arctic-eggs">Arctic Eggs</a> developer The Water Museum, does ask for your patience… as well as for your willingness to embark into strange, murky waters.
</p>
<p>
Quickly into the game's demo (or playtest, as it's listed as on Steam), you are shown how to fish in a tutorial that perhaps needs a smidge more of a nudge in the right direction, but I did work it out in the end. Like in any <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>, the fish you're trying to nab will prod your bait, inviting your twitching finger to pull the trigger. The main difference is that the camera follows your hook into the water, and if you successfully fool a fish into taking the bait, you must reel it in, moving your mouse or WASD keys as you do so to point the fish towards your corporeal form for a successful catch.

<p>
This is a game about fishing, not a game with fishing in it, so it's much more involved than a minigame, and appropriately tactile. After catching your prey, you bring it back to a man who I think is your grandpa, who is also kind of a weird asshole. There are curly fries to be hand, it is raining, yet according to him you must fill the tacklebox.
</p><p>
So, you do your best to do so, catching everything you can until your maybe grandpa teaches you a new trick: attaching a fish you caught to your hook lets you puppeteer its dead body. And you do that too, going deep into a hole, where you find a Laura Palmer-esque dead body… and a mermaid.
</p>
<p>
This is simply the opening section to About Fishing, the first chapter of a larger game that takes its cues from both Sega Bass fishing and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a>, a delightful combination. There is clearly a mystery to be solved, fish to be caught, and based on the game's trailer and Steam page, townspeople to meet.
</p>
<p>
Arctic Eggs was equally as odd and concentrated in the thing it was trying to be, and About Fishing is seemingly no different in the tiny bit of time I've spent with it. You've caught me hook, line and sinker, The Water Museum. I'll be keeping an eye out on the full release, but for now you can join me in wishlisting it on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3856530/About_Fishing/">here</a>.

You get to fight the Minotaur, you get to have a boss battle with Scylla and Charybdis, and you also just get to hang out with the gang from Percy Jackson. It's pretty epic.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Percy Jackson: Siege of Monsters</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dior Goodjohn, who plays Clarisse on the show, agrees: “It's really, really sick.

It's crazy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Percy Jackson Creator Rick Riordan says it was important to adapt his stories for a younger, modern audience. “I cannot tell you how many years the fans have been asking me, ‘When are we going to get a Percy Jackson immersive game?’” Riordan says. “I (played) my share of World of Warcraft when I was younger, (so) I get it. I totally get it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leah Sava Jeffries, who portrays Annabeth, says she used to play Fortnite but intends to jump back in now that she and her co-stars are featured in the game. “This is making me want to go back and play it again,” Jeffries says. “I have been waiting for this for so long, and now I really feel like this is our moment.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 2 of Percy Jackson and the Olympians hits Disney+ December 10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Michael Peyton is the Senior Editorial Director of Events &amp; Entertainment at IGN, leading entertainment content and coverage of tentpole events including IGN Live, San Diego Comic Con, gamescom, and IGN Fan Fest.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-runs-well-on-pc-emulators-can-even-be-played-in-stereo-3d/</link>
            <guid>1375321</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The final triple-A game release of the year, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, was just released. Our Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-scanning-wider-horizons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewed the game for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but the game is also available for the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Indeed, as you might remember, it was initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-announced-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> for the previous Switch during Nintendo's E3 2017 Spotlight, just a few months after that console's debut. It famously had a troubled development phase, as Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-indeed-developed-bandai-namco-according-multiple-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had originally picked Bandai Namco</a> instead of Retro Studios to make the game. </p>



<p>The project wasn't going well, which led to Metroid Prime 4: Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being rebooted and handed back to Retro Studios</a>, resulting in an inevitable significant delay. Even though the Austin-based studio eventually launched the game well after the debut of the Switch 2, Nintendo still kept its promise to release the game on the original Switch, too.</p>



<p>That's great news even for PC gamers because, while there are no Switch 2 emulators yet, there are plenty of Switch emulators. Sure, Nintendo cracked down hard on the scene and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced the closure of Yuzu</a> (and its fork<span>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/suyu-yuzus-emulator-fork-gets-taken-down-just-hours-after-the-first-build-release/" target="_blank">Suzu</a>), but many alternatives are still active, including <a href="https://ryujinx.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryubing</a>, an open-source fork based on</span> the historic Ryujinx emulator, as well as newer emulators like <a href="https://eden-emu.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eden</a> and <a href="https://citron-emu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citron</a>. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Metroid prime 4: Beyond - Eden vs Citron" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bxSycDP8e3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>All of these are running Metroid Prime 4 well, as you can see from the embedded video. But the real kicker is that with ReShade, it's even possible to render the game (and other Switch titles) in stereoscopic 3D and play it on a giant screen through the <a href="https://www.vrdesktop.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virtual Desktop software</a>. To begin, you will need to <a href="https://reshade.me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download ReShade</a> 6.6.2 with full add‑on support and the Rendepth shader to convert the game’s depth buffer into a side‑by‑side 3D image that Virtual Desktop can interpret as stereoscopic video.</p>



<p>After installing ReShade (select the Vulkan option), enable the Rendepth shader and set the output to side-by-side with stereo strength at 100%, Z-buffer scaling at around 30, and parallax/overlap adjusted to your preference. To verify that depth is being captured correctly, ensure that the Show depth buffer setting is toggled on and use the AdjustDepth/DisplayDepth add-on to cycle through Vulkan depth sources until the buffer displays a proper gradient from black to white, rather than a flat white image.</p>



<p>If the depth preview is inverted, upside‑down, or flat, simply edit ReShade's global preprocessor definitions, toggling flags such as “depth input is reversed” or “depth input is upside down” from 0 to 1, until the depth image looks correct. Once the right Vulkan depth source is selected (it'll be the one with the most vertices) and the image is oriented correctly, disable the debug view, enable performance mode, and keep Rendepth active to generate the 3D image in normal gameplay.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Using Rendepth and ReShade to play stereoscopic 3D Metroid Prime 4 and Switch games." width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VoCFGIvgiA4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Now, in Virtual Desktop, set the 3D mode to half side‑by‑side or over‑under so that the double image from Rendepth fuses into a stereoscopic view on the virtual big screen. The creator of the video, lionellion, describes the result as a “Nintendo 3DS pop‑out” visor effect with a presentation akin to having a giant curved screen in front of you. Of course, to replicate this effect, you will need a Virtual Reality/XR headset or glasses or a glassless 3D display <a href="https://wccftech.com/samsung-2d-3d-gaming-monitor-concept-supports-glassless-3d-and-vr-gaming-wins-ces-2024-innovation-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like this one</a>. </p>



<p>Needless to say, playing Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on PC can only be legally done if you purchased an original copy for the Nintendo Switch and then dumped it for your own personal use.</p>

            <p>
A new trailer for the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> update, The Last of the Druids, was shared earlier this week, showing off all the cool things you can do in it! Which are mostly relegated to turning into animals, but in my eyes that is eternally a cool thing to be able to do, in a game or not. And with that trailer also came a release date for the update.
</p>
<p>
It's less than a week out now, due to be released on December 12th, just in time for the next weekend. As part of the new druid class that comes with the new update, when in human form you can wield "magical staves to channel the powers of the earth and the natural world," including summoning volcanoes, getting trees to use their roots to trap enemies, you know, druid stuff.

<p>
Then, there's the three forms you can take, that of a wolf, a bear, or a fire-breathing wyvern. Looks pretty neat honestly! Druid also comes with a couple of ascendancy classes, one being the Shaman, who "channels nature’s fury, harnessing rage to empower his spells and becoming a walking natural disaster raining down meteors, lightning, and ice," and the Oracle, who has "perfected the power of Foresight, using it in combat to gain a massive advantage by peering into the future to predict a monster's movements and even allocate passives from alternate timelines!"
</p><p>
Here's the rub, however: Path of Exile 2's 1.0 release date most likely won't be March 2026 like it was previously planned for. "I'm fairly confident that we won't be out of 2026," game director Jonathon Rogers told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-release-date-slips-again">Eurogamer</a> in a recent interview, continuing, "but as I said, I never want to really completely promise anything. But I don't think it'll end up being March; we'll have to see."
</p>
<p>
While there was no specific updated timeline shared, Rogers said he "certainly wouldn't want to be any later than the end of next year. Obviously we're trying to get there as fast as we can, but I certainly wouldn't want to slip into 2027." I'm sure this won't be welcome news to some, but hey ho, this is just how early access is sometimes. Have patience, friend, the 1.0 will come.
