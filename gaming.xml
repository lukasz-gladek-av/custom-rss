<p>Additionally, Battlefield 6 will have "visual performance enhancements" that will be exclusive to the PS5 Pro version, though it's currently unclear what these enhancements will entail.</p><p>This spot of news is hardly surprising. The Battlefield franchise has a long history for pushing visual fidelity, and have often been touted as top-of-the-line games for benchmark testing, especially given the series' penchant for photo-realistic graphics and simulated destruction of environments.</p><p>Elsewhere on the FAQ page, EA states there is "currently no dedicated support for Steam Deck for Battlefield 6." This doesn't necessarily rule out that it would ever switch gears in order to make it happen, but in the meantime, I wouldn't get my hopes up about playing the upcoming game on on Valve's handheld in the near future.</p><p>Battlefield 6 will be released on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. There will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">open betas</a> for the game throughout the month of August leading up to its launch this fall.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-feels-like-a-safe-explosive-return-to-the-shooter%E2%80%99s-past.1259004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering we’re living through a period where it feels like every other game is a remake, remaster, or throwback of some sort, perhaps I should be less surprised that Battlefield 6 feels a lot like Battlefields 3 and 4. They were, of course, the glory years for EA and DICE’s large-scale multiplayer shooter – excellent maps, engaging objective-based modes, spectacular destruction, and the all-important class system. It seems like Battlefield 6 replicates all of that, at least as far as I can tell after having played two hours and change of the new, contemporary-set FPS across a number of maps and modes. That is a good thing, of course, especially since recent Battlefield history has been a bit of a rocky ride. But is this resurrection of past glories actually <em>exciting</em>? In the moment, absolutely. But on a grander scale? That’s a more difficult question. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those exciting moments are often the result of the well-defined class system, which returns in a comfortingly familiar guise following Battlefield 2042’s missteps with its hero shooter-like Specialists. The Assault class can use their grenade launcher to breach through walls and then turn the startled soldiers who once huddled behind it into swiss cheese. The Engineer is the vital cog in a tank battle, using their acetylene torch to repair friendly armour and keep the cannon fire rolling, even as an entire building collapses around them. The Support is the squad’s literal lifeline, diving onto the objective with bags of spare ammo and soldier-reviving defibrillators at the ready. And finally there’s the Recon, the tactitician who marks enemies for all to see before scoring a hattrick of headshots with a sniper rifle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s nothing revolutionary about these classes, but they are much clearer in their parameters than they have been in the past. You won’t find the team’s dedicated infantry killer fulfilling anti-tank or medic duties, for instance, as the Assault has been forced to do in the likes of Battlefields 4 and 5. But as clean and traditional as these roles are, there is a minor shake-up. Like Battlefield 2042, any class can use any weapon, but now each role has a “signature” specialism designed to encourage you into the specific loadouts of yesteryear. For example, the Recon is able to hold their breath while aiming sniper rifles, making them the clear choice for long-range engagements, while the Engineer benefits from improved hip-fire control when using SMGs. As someone who would score a low-end grade in a sniper exam, this means I can play Recon while swinging around an assault rifle or LMG, which fully opens up the class roster. But I can’t help but wonder why I should brute-force my way into playing Recon when I could find my specialism elsewhere. Isn’t that what class play is all about? </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The odd, freeform elements of 2042’s weapon system saw their fair share of criticism, and I agree that tighter restrictions would have been of benefit both there and here in Battlefield 6, especially since there’s real strength in the design of the prescribed specialist gadgets for each class. The Support’s deployable cover is a solid example – it’s great for hiding behind while resurrecting fallen squaddies, provides a safe space for allies to restock on the ammunition bags you can drop, and acts as a surface to mount the LMG that the class specialises in. In short, the components of each kit can harmonise wonderfully, and I think the interesting choice is finding which class kit provides the best melody for your playstyle, rather than adjusting the individual notes within that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately the weapons system is a small wrinkle in a very familiar package, and that applies to basically all the new ideas present in Battlefield 6’s demo. A new movement system (ridiculously dubbed the “Kinesthetic Combat System”) promises smoother leaning around corners, bracing against cover to reduce recoil, combat rolls as you land from high jumps, and several other improvements, but I can’t say I found these valuable additions – especially the contextual lean, which rarely seemed to activate. Like the omnidirectional movement in last year’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, I wonder how much genuine impact this will have on the experience of regular players. The one addition that I do love is the ability to grab a fallen soldier by the scruff of their neck and drag them to safety before reviving them. It’s a useful ability that everyone has access to (which admittedly does infringe on the Support’s duties, but it’s far from the instant revive of the defibrillator.) More importantly, it’s something that creates a “moment” – there’s few things more heroic than dragging a buddy to cover while machine gun fire kicks up dust around you. If all the small additions add up to something that feels as good as that, then maybe Battlefield 6 will develop a more distinct character in time. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is a series that needed to find secure footing after a couple of wobbly outings, and it certainly feels like this new iteration is standing on reinforced concrete. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about the battlefields themselves? The series has always had to find its own formula when it comes to level geography, simply because the classic three-lane design doesn’t work for 64-player chaos. Thankfully that rule still applies, which means Battlefield still feels unlike any other shooter out there. The flagship Conquest maps retain that almost open-world feel – much more expansive than Call of Duty arenas, with an eye for real-world authenticity. City streets feel like genuine (albeit thankfully evacuated) population centres, and buildings are realistically laid-out with coherent stairwells and floorplans. The designer’s hand <em>can </em>be felt when you realise that there are maps nested within maps, but they leave a good impression. The broad edges of Empire State replicates the wide, tank-friendly streets of New York City, but push further into the centre and there’s rabbit warren-like alleys and a large concrete multi-storey building that’s perfect for claustrophobic, close-quarters fighting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One or two matches simply isn’t enough time to understand the nuances of a map, and so I can’t say where exactly the few on offer would rank among the all-time greats. But Liberation Peak, set along the slopes of the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan, provides the ideal amount of wide, rocky terrain for land vs air battles alongside pocketed military bases that give birth to desperate infantry fights, while Siege of Cairo has the dense street networks ideal for luring tanks into RPG ambushes. With no demolition centrepieces there’s nothing that instantly becomes a map’s signature element, but I hope that continued play will reveal carefully-placed details in each street, room, and capture point. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking of demolition, Battlefield’s trademark chaos remains very much in-tact. It is somewhat restrained in comparison to the map-shifting “levolution” system that powered Battlefield 6’s most obvious touchstones, but the alternative is much more useful in the minute-to-minute play. Entire building facades crumble away under cannon fire, opening up buildings like sardine cans to reveal the fleshy fiends hiding within. You can breach floors, allowing for Rainbow Six Siege-like downward assaults… or simply blow the support from beneath a pesky sniper. This late into Battlefield’s lifespan it’s hard to be truly excited about all this – this is the series’ schtick and likely always will be now – but it’s nonetheless impressive. As much as it is a technical feat to be boasted about alongside the most photo-realistic graphics in the series’ lifetime, it’s also a foundational tool that makes Battlefield its own distinct beast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If it seems odd that we’ve reached this far into the preview without mentioning the multiplayer modes – you know, the things you actually <em>play </em>– then it’s only because they almost blend into the background among the explosions and squad roles. The hands-on session provided matches of Conquest, Breakthrough, and Squad Deathmatch, and they’re exactly as Battlefield tradition dictates. Personal preference naturally applies, but at least from my perspective it’s the classic story of the objective-focussed modes reigning supreme and the smaller-scale, kill-everything-in-sight games still feeling like a square peg in Battlefield’s round hole. It’s not that they’re a bad time, it’s just that the “Battlefield Moments” EA likes to shout about seem to only happen when you’re desperately holding down Point C during a close game of Conquest, or pushing tooth-and-nail through the fiercest defence in Breakthrough. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of what seems like a project attempting to recapture the glory days of Battlefields 3 and 4, I don’t hold any grudge against these modes feeling like business as usual. This is a series that needed to find secure footing after a couple of wobbly outings, and it certainly feels like this new iteration is standing on reinforced concrete. But I can’t help but feel that those old, faithful objectives could have been freshened up a little, perhaps with unconventional capture point designs or equipment used specifically for objectives. Perhaps new thrills lie in the new Escalation mode, which was unavailable to sample at my hands-on demo, although considering the official description provided to press claims that it “sees two teams fight to capture strategic control points,” I’m not expecting it to add too much extra fizz to the established formula. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-suffers-significant-leaks-ahead-of-official-multiplayer-reveal">Battlefield 6’s open betas go live across a couple of weekends in August</a>, I expect there will be a lot of fans who will be relieved to find a package that largely seems focussed on returning Battlefield to its peak years. And I can’t deny that the modern combat aesthetic, equipment, and classes speak to me in a way that the series’ near-future and pseudo-historical guns never could. I had a good time. More than a decade after Battlefields 3 and 4, though, it doesn’t fill me with the same sense of adrenaline it once did. But nostalgia’s still a hell of a drug, and maybe that’s just what the medic ordered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you have any questions about Battlefield 6?

But there was a significant net loss as well, with losses being higher than predicted: $279.8 million compared to $207.2 million in Q2 2024.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Monte Cook Games has announced a new edition of their award-winning TTRPG system. Their new Cypher RPG system, which will provide a streamlined experience, complete with GM narrative and creative freedom, will be arriving via crowdfunding campaign.</p>

<h2>The New Cypher RPG System Announcement</h2>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.montecookgames.com/announcing-cyphers-new-evolved-edition/" rel="nofollow">official post</a> on Monte Cook Games' website, Charles Ryan explains the reasoning behind introducing the new Cypher RPG system.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cypher-rpg-rulebook-artwork.jpg?itok=Bl3pyJqO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cypher-rpg-rulebook-artwork.jpg?itok=vSTi3_MW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Ryan mentions that the Cypher system has been around for twelve years, garnering a passionate fanbase thanks to its accessible but rewarding gameplay system. He even mentions the game's malleability, bringing to life games like the far future fantasy of <em>Numenera</em>, the existential far fantasy of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/return-to-actuality-with-invisible-sun-electric-and-indigo-by-monte-cook-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Invisible Sun</em></a>, and the disturbing cosmic horror of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-review-leitner-worthy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em></a>.</p>

<p>But with all TTRPG systems, feedback from players has led to certain parts of the system being streamlined or changed. Certain changes or additions may have been featured in certain licensed products and are being grandfathered into this new system. Furthermore, a new edition allows a studio to reformat their core rules for readability and clarity.</p>

<p>Some of the changes coming to the new Cypher RPG system have been long requested. Damage will no longer drain the player character's different stat pools. An armor system is being introduced, granting players more defensive options. New, genre-specific character generation options will be available, and there will be a greater focus on subtle cyphers: the imperceptible aids players can call upon in times of crisis.</p>

<p>But the pillars of the Cypher RPG system will still in place. Characters are still created with a combo of a Type, Descriptor, and Focus. Tasks are still assigned in difficulty from 1-10 and can be eased with a mix of Effort, Assets, and Skills. Also, enemy statblocks will remain easily readable and quick to implement for GMs.</p>

<p>The new Cypher RPG system will be released as two books. The first is the Cypher Character Rulebook, which will contain rules for making characters in a wide variety of genres, including high-fantasy, space opera, cyberpunk, and post-apocalyptic future. The second book, the Cypher GM's Guide, will contain rules and aids to help GMs run the game.</p>

<p>Both of these books will be available through a crowdfunding campaign that will launch in late summer, with a retail release set for mid-2026.</p>

            <p>
EA have given us our first proper look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s multiplayer, after revealing the game with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-has-finally-been-revealed-with-a-firmly-anti-helicopter-trailer-and-no-release-date">a single player trailer last week</a>. They've also confirmed the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s release date - 10th October 2025 -  and announced dates for a series of beta weekends in August. 
</p>
<p>
The game they're pitching is a return to the contemporary warring of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-3">Battlefield 3</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-4">Battlefield 4</a>, after the mildly futuristic disappointments of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. It's got four familiar classes, the old Battlefield mode trinity of conquest, breakthrough and rush, and maps that incline towards close quarters combat or wide-open vehicular blasting or some blasphemous hybrid of the twain. It seems fine. And loud.

<p>
You've likely already heard about the returning classes, thanks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-let-battlefield-6-players-lock-weapons-to-classes-in-latest-scuffle-over-how-much-battlefield-should-enforce-teamwork">all those Battlefield Lab bulletins</a>, but let's give them a proper intro. Assault is your kamikaze jarhead, able to equip an extra primary weapon and armed with an adrenaline shot for those last-ditch offensives. The RPG-packing engineer is great at fragging vehicles or fixing them. The MG-toting support can heal and revive people and deploy cover. Recon, finally, is about sniping, spotting foes with a quadrotor drone, mining heavy armour and obstacles with C4, and guiding missiles safely home with a laser pointer.
</p>
<p>
The handling looks familiar - slower than Call Of Duty and Halo, but nippy enough to sustain a killstreak, with a mixture of familiar and novel moves. You can drag downed friendlies by the collar while reviving them, which I think is rather sweet - like yanking a dog away from a barbecue. You can lean and peek, and mount guns on walls for stability. You can roll on landing after a big jump to preserve your momentum, a spectral homage to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a>. You can also hitch a ride on tanks, so there will hopefully be fewer tantrums when six players all vie for the same gunner seat.
</p>
<p>
The game will have nine maps at launch, including a glossy restoration of Operation Firestorm from Battlefield 3. The Egypt map is built for infantry and land vehicles, while Gibraltar seems fairly claustrophobic, the kind of place where rocking an APC is seriously asking for it. Tajikistan is about big views and air war, and Brooklyn is designed to cater to every style. The maps are made up of different combat zones built with different modes in mind.
</p>
<p>
As for those modes, they are conquest, breakthrough, rush, team deathmatch, squad deathmatch, domination, king of the hill, and escalation. The latter sounds strongly like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-rumoured-to-get-a-battle-royale-mode-as-leaker-finds-footage-of-an-exploding-dam">Battlefield 6's rumoured battle royale mode</a>, pushing the opposed parties towards a gruelling final encounter, though EA danced around the details in their presentation.
</p>
<p>
Needless to say, you will be able to perforate and demolish a lot of architecture. It's hard to discern the granularity of the destruction physics from the reveal video's montage of eviscerated apartment blocks, but individual playable scenarios include smashing through floors with a sledgehammer to ambush campers below, or rigging the ceiling to take out snipers above. It makes me wonder if the game's developers - that's DICE, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect - have been playing a lot of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six: Siege</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last and maybe best, there's a new version of Battlefield 2042's Portal editor on the way, which lets you tinker with maps extravagantly and apply special rules such as one-shot-kills. The options include propping a motorway against a skyscraper and sliding a bunch of tanks down it, like roaring metal children made of bombs. 
</p>

</figure>
<p>
As ever with Battlefield multiplayer trailers, and FPS multiplayer trailers in general, it's worth noting that the average match will look nothing like the balletic bloodshed and giddy demolition combos on display here. In my experience, the average match is going to be a mixture of dying immediately when you spawn, hiding forever in a basement while enemy artillery try to burrow through the roof like a giant with a ladle, commandeering a tank only to immediately wedge it under a bridge, and being vigorously told off by your squad leader when you go for a nice walk beyond the map perimeter. Oh, and there will doubtless be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajh9e3PDAOc">a few bugs</a>.
</p>
<p>
Those betas? The first one starts August 7th-8th, and you can get access by watching a select few hundred streamers as part of today's multiplayer showcase. Then there are general access betas on August 9th-10th and August 14th -17th.
</p>
<p>
Concluding verdict: still fine. Channelling the BF3/BF4 energy should work for them; whether it's enough to get them <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">100 million players</a> is another matter. Smaller complaint: I would quite EA to lay off the percussion just a little in their Battlefield videos. I realise that bangs and booms are Battlefield's vital fluids, but if there are too many bangs and booms it makes the game seem almost constipated, like it's trying to find that one bang or boom that will finally shatter the viewer's reservations.</p>
<p>The livestream above is on-going at the time of publication - let me know if you have any thoughts.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Combat, Classes &amp; Destruction Breakdown Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Each class will feature a signature weapon set, as well as gadgets and traits exclusive to them, and clearly the developers have shuffled around some of the familiar tools in Battlefield 6's revamped take on the system.</p><p dir="ltr">The assault class will wield flashbangs and grenade launchers to punch holes in defenses, use an adrenaline shot to improve resistance to stun effects, sprint speed, and provide various combat boosts, and will even be able to wield a second primary weapon in battle.</p><p dir="ltr">The engineer class will, as usual, deploy rockets and mines to hound vehicles down and will be the only class with the ability to fix friendly armor. This class seems the most familiar, and seems to have shed some of the bloat that was added to it over time.</p><p dir="ltr">The support class has many of its familiar skills, such as the returning ability to heal, revive, and provide ammo to their squad and teammates.  In a change for the support class though, players will now be able to deploy cover.</p><p dir="ltr">Recon remains the ideal class for lone-wolf types that want to skulk around and pop enemies with headshot via their sniper rifle. However they have added utility in a squad now that they can also deploy drones that mark enemies and use a laser designator that helps guide friendly missiles. They are also now the exclusive owners of C4, making them essential to the elimination of ground vehicles like tanks.</p><p dir="ltr">These changes, which in some cases return these classes back to their most basic essence, comes on the heels of Battlefield 2042, which was released back in 2021. At the time, Battlefield 2042 shook up the class system by introducing specialists, who were hero-like characters with unique abilities, and as a result, many of the formerly strict design principles surrounding classes were made more lenient and flexible. This meant that classes could use weapons and gadgets they previously couldn't, which in turn subtly eroded the squad-based gameplay of the series, which the existing class system promoted.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 will continue the open-ended approach to loadouts and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-brings-back-controversial-change-from-battlefield-2042/1100-6531734/">share weapons between classes</a>, but now each class will have a form of proficiency with their signature weapon types, which will unlock signature game-changing traits when used in concert.</p><p dir="ltr">Players won't have to wait long to get their hands on Battlefield 6 and sample the revamped class system for themselves. An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/">open beta</a> is set to run across multiple weekends in August, and the game itself is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-multiplayer-trailer-shows-off-chaos-and-destruction-with-limp-bizkit-too/1100-6533607/">set to arrive on October 10</a> on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2-is-off-to-a-speedy-start-for-big-third-party-games.1258962/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With the Switch 2, Nintendo seems to be closing the release date gap with some of its third-party games. It’s a problem that plagued previous Nintendo consoles, which often received games years after other platforms, if at all.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/716586/nintendo-partner-direct-july-2025-news-trailers">today’s Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> may have lacked the splash of anticipated third-party games like <em>Hades 2</em> or FromSoftware’s <em>The Duskbloods</em>, what was on display offered some interesting insight.</p><p>Showcases like this one offer Nintendo’s second- and third-party development and publishing partners the chance to show off what they’ve got on the way. In the original Switch days, multiplatform games like <em>Control</em> would get Switch release dates months or even years after their initial launch, if they came to the Switch at all. And even then, the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538173/control-cloud-version-nintendo-switch-release-remedy-entertainment">might sometimes be the cloud version</a>, requiring it to be streamed on the console, and these were generally hated for their inconsistent graphics and performance issues.</p><p>With this Direct, it seems like Nintendo is working to bring third-party games to the Switch 2 faster and, hopefully, with gameplay experiences similar to the other consoles. During this Direct, we got a look at <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, a new game from <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake studio Bloober Team. <em>Cronos</em> looks like the kind of game that would have struggled on the original Switch, but it’s releasing across all three consoles and PC on September 5th.</p><p><em>Madden NFL 2026</em> is also launching across the Big 3 at the same time — August 14th — a feat of note considering the last time a Madden title was on a Nintendo console was <em>Madden NFL 13 </em>more than a decade ago.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24230628/star-wars-outlaws-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a> has been out since August of last year. Its arrival on the Switch 2 in September represents Ubisoft’s most graphically and technically complex game on the platform since the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fassassins-creed-anniversary-edition-mega-bundle-switch%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Assassin’s Creed Anniversary Edition Mega Bundle</em></a>. (And the most recent game in that collection was released more than 10 years ago.) <em>Borderlands 4</em>, while not launching exactly day and date, will come out on the Switch 2 a mere three weeks after its PC/Xbox/PlayStation launch.</p><p>Even the third-party games that weren’t shown today still represent exciting new prospects for the Switch 2. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641985/nintendo-switch-2-every-game-announced-direct">During the Switch 2 Direct in April</a>, <em>Elden Ring</em> was shown as one of the games coming to the new console. With the way the original Switch struggled with more complex games, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23420732/bayonetta-3-review-nintendo-switch">even ones designed with that console in mind</a>, a big-ass, pretty-ass, particle-y effect-ass game like <em>Elden Ring</em> running on it was unthinkable. But <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-among-slate-of-three-bandai-namco-games-coming"><em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition</em></a>, along with <em>The Duskbloods</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641335/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-announcement">a totally original FromSoftware<em> multiplayer</em> joint</a>, are both coming to the Switch 2.<em> Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, a game with the same kind of, if not higher, technical complexity as <em>Elden Ring</em>, is on the way too.</p><p>Nintendo’s always been the kind of company to do what it wants rather than chase market trends, and that strategy has served the company very well. The original Switch wasn’t at the bleeding technical edge and, because of the high quality of its games, it didn’t have to be. The Switch 2, similarly, isn’t pushing the same kind of power as Xbox and PlayStation, but the console has evolved just enough that it can support some of the still-popular recent games of its competitors.</p><p>And even if not everything new will come to the Switch 2, the console still has a robust back catalog to bring forward. During today’s Direct we saw that Sega’s Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is bringing the <em>Yakuza Kiwami</em> series to the Switch 2.</p><p>We don’t know how any of these games will perform when they’re finally released on the Switch 2. We’ll have to wait and see if the console fulfills the promise of bigger and better games running on improved hardware. We also don’t know if the trend will continue beyond the initial excitement of a new console’s launch window. But if <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/review-cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-is-a-switch-2-stunner/">the</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/604269/switch-2-cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-best-title">critical</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-review-update">acclaim</a> of the Switch 2 edition of<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> is anything to go by, the ports won’t just be coming faster; they’ll be good, too.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/716859/nintendo-partner-direct-july-cronos-star-wars]]></content:encoded>

Just stay mobile and try not to get stuck in any corners. The explosions won't do a ton of damage individually, but getting hit multiple times adds up.</p><p dir="ltr">There are multiple rolls of film and a healing item in the arena, so make sure to pick those up if and when you need them.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll receive the <strong>Neighborhood Page</strong> for defeating the spider.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Archive">Archive</h2><p dir="ltr">You'll awaken in the Archive.

                <p>EA is trying its hand again at a Battlefield-themed battle royale mode, it seems. As part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a> multiplayer reveal event today, the company strongly teased the revival of the <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Firestorm_(Gamemode)" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Firestorm mode from Battlefield V. </a></p><p>A teaser video showed soldiers scattering through a tropical location as the camera panned backwards to a massive firestorm spreading down a mountain toward them. The developers never mentioned battle royale or Firestorm by name, but the suggestion is quite obvious. In any event, whatever this is, fans will get to try it first in the Battlefield Labs testing program. </p><p>EA's hosts at the event alluded to the mode being called Firestorm, but stopped short of confirming this.</p><p>Firestorm for Battlefield V was part of that game and was only playable to people who owned a copy. It remains to be seen if the next iteration of the mode, if real, would be a standalone download or only available with a purchase of Battlefield 6.</p><p>At the time of its release in 2018, many remarked that Firestorm felt like a half-baked idea that EA implemented to try to capitalize on the growing popularity of battle royale modes at the time.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-multiplayer-trailer-shows-off-chaos-and-destruction-with-limp-bizkit-too/1100-6533607/" data-ref-id="1100-6533607">Battlefield 6 launches on October 10</a>, and it won't cost $80. Instead, EA is charging $70 for the standard edition or $100 for the Phantom Edition.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The move is not entirely unprecedented, seeing as how we're now almost five years into the current generation of consoles, and both Xbox and PlayStation have signaled that they're in production on <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiMyaSj4eeOAxXTmIkEHRt2IosQFnoECBgQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw2gh2IQUYeTUf17Tm5VRJR5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successors to Xbox Series X|S</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiuiPuy4eeOAxUTm4kEHVq-KPcQFnoECCEQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw17N4v-2zjvyqY8UUvtpRGV" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5</a>.</p><p>Additionally, when preorder and wishlist pages first went live around the reveal of the game's campaign, many spotted the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/battlefield-6/9p2ff14jzll3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absence of dedicated</a> <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009568" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pages</a> for the older generation of systems.</p><p>Typically, developers leave behind previous generation of consoles to better support the newer hardware allowing the team to push the title's tech further than it would if it were hamstrung supporting multiple systems of varying power. Some developers have already struggled to get games running on different systems within the same generation, like Larian Studios did when porting Baldur's Gate 3 to both Xbox Series X and its weaker counterpart, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/" data-ref-id="1100-6511819">Series S</a>.</p><p>Battlefield 6 marks the series' return to the modern age after Battlefield 2042's foray into the near future, as well as more typical formula complete with the franchise's iconic classes and a single-player mode. Battlefield 6 will be releasing on October 10 and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">series of open betas</a> will take place in August.</p>
