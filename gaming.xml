            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have announced the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>release date, and it's only a few more months before you'll get to play the survival-focused multiplayer spinoff.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1889676062071656525" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches across PC and consoles on May 30th. Pre-orders are, according to Bandai Namco, open now via the game's <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/shop-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>, although I wasn't able to actually pick the game up when I checked, so you may have to wait an hour or two.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">multiplayer-focused spinoff</a> of the immensely popular 2022 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>(although just like its forebear,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>can also be played solo).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-witch.jpg?itok=dkB0RnB0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-witch.jpg?itok=SKViCQdy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is launching in May.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will take place in the parallel world of Limveld, where you and two other friends (but not one other friend, strangely enough) must battle increasingly tough waves of enemies and bosses over the course of three in-game days and nights.</p>

<p>Rather than creating your own character,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will give you the chance to play as one of eight predetermined characters, each with their own backstory and lore to discover, as well as their own skillset to utilize.</p>

<p>FromSoftware has confirmed that you will be facing enemies from both&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>series</a>, and new types of enemies will also be appearing.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>has been designed to offer a standalone experience set in the broader&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>universe, so even if you haven't played the base game or its&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC, you should find something to enjoy here.</p>




<p>Ahead of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s launch, a network test is scheduled to take place in February, giving some players the chance to try out the game's online features and spend a little time in its world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, signups for that test have concluded, but if you were lucky enough to get into the test, you'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>between February 14th and 16th across a number of set time periods.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox on May 30th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Sharkmob have punched the green light, cracked open the hangar doors and launched a public playtest for their windblown open world extraction shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exoborne">Exoborne</a>, which I would gingerly summarise as Anthem meets <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a> with a touch of PUBG. From today till 17th February at 1pm GMT, 2pm CET, or 5am PST, you'll be able to get your fill of mech-o-looting via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705130/Exoborne/">Steam</a>. Here's a trailer's worth of wiggly whooshes, big bangs and exowotsits to celebrate. Mmm, exowotsits. They used to be 25p a bag in the 1990s.

If references to antique British crisp brands only leave you confused about what Exoborne actually is, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sharkmob-announce-exoborne-an-open-world-pvpve-shooter-featuring-exo-rigs-and-tornadoes">may I reading my first article about the game from 2023</a>. The narrative premise is that a notional "save the environment" project called Project Rebirth has fucked the world instead, producing a landscape of renegade whirlwinds, broken cities, big sci-fi towers and lashings of loot. 
</p>
<p>
You are a "Reborn" adventurer in an exosuit with high-jumping and grappling capabilities, plus a parachute. Your job is to get in, finish quests and extract with some rad valuables before the match timer runs out, while fighting other players and NPCs. The game is built for groups of three, with a choice of exo-rigs akin to RPG classes, and there's a home hub area where you can shoot the breeze with various story characters. Hah, "shoot the breeze"! I guess that also applies to tangling with inclement weather phenomena as well: some of the game's better items are to be found inside them.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure about Exoborne so far. The idea of hook-chuting through hurricanes while gunning down robot-shouldered hooligans certainly has its charms. On the other hand, this all feels very "we smooshed a bunch of genres together in the hope of alchemising something new", and the art direction is a bit dreary. There's no release date yet - let us know if you have thoughts about the beta.

Players will have a chance to explore a randomized world map across a day and night cycle as a<em> Fortnite</em>-like circle slowly closes in on them. </p><p>It’s honestly a bonkers premise for a FromSoftware game, but early impressions of the beta test build paint a glowing picture of the <em>Dark Souls</em> studio’s  experimental genre mashup. “<em>Nightreign </em>provides a delectable hit of <em>Elden Ring</em> in a repeatable microcosm,” Ed Nightingale <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes for <em>Eurogamer</em></a></span>. “It’s got the difficulty, the levelling, the boss battles, and the sense of discovery, but all at high speed for a new type of challenge, while its grim enemy selection is like a best-of Souls mixtape I’m itching to replay.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/gaming/522325/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-network-test&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/522325/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-network-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em>’s previewer</a></span> came away similarly impressed. “In many ways it would feel more like a frantic, PvE battle royale than it would the original <em>Elden Ring</em>,” writes Austen Goslin. “What’s even more surprising is just how well all of these elements mix together into a package that feels both true to the Soulslike genre, and totally new at the same time.” He says it’s less the open invitation to new fans that <em>Elden Ring</em> was than a love letter to existing <em>Souls </em>devotees. </p><p>Unlike the 2022 GOTY hit, <em>Nightreig</em>n features faster-paced combat and  streamlined progression during each run. Leveling up happens more quickly, Sites of Grace heal you automatically as you run by, and there’s no fall damage this time around. Relics, meanwhile, provide extra stat bonuses that last in-between runs, so not all of your progress is reset each time. Combined with eight character classes, there’s potentially a lot of room to develop custom strategies and replay through the same content over and over like a classic arcade game. </p><p>I’ll have a better sense of that for myself after playing this weekend’s beta test. I was already looking forward to it and now I’m extra stoked. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Open-world extraction shooter Exoborne from former The Division developers begins its playtest today over on Steam.</p>
<p>The studio, Sharkmob, was formed in 2017 by core members of The Division team from Ubisoft, and previously created battle royale Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodhunt, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/12-months-on-battle-royale-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-is-ending-development">shut down a year after release</a>.</p>
<p>Now it's launching a new project, first revealed at 2023's The Game Awards, that sees players in Exo-Rigs battling in teams in extreme weather conditions like violent tornadoes. Check out a gameplay walkthrough in the video below.</p>

<p>Alongside team-based extraction gameplay in this post-climate change world, Sharkmob promises an evolving narrative, dynamic public events like high-stakes missions for rewards, and plenty of Exo-Rig customisation to "harness the fierce forces of nature".</p>
<p>The public playtest will be worldwide and is accessible via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705130/Exoborne/">Steam</a>. It will run from today until 17th February (1pm UK time).</p>
<p>It's not clear how much of the game will be included in the playtest, but it's certainly a great opportunity to get to grips with the game's team-based tactical action, vertical movement, and those weather effects.</p>
<p>Though the test is PC only, the game is set for release across PS5 and Xbox Series X/S too. It's being developed in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>There's also no final release date yet, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/post-apocalypse-extraction-shooter-exoborne-announced-by-ex-division-devs">Sharkmob has confirmed it will be a premium release</a> and not free-to-play.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Elden Ring Nightreign, the multiplayer spin off of Elden Ring, has been given a release date of May 30th, Bandai Namco has confirmed. Additionally, pre-orders are now open for the game too. This was all announced via a brand new trailer which shows more of Elden Ring Nightreign’s gameplay, which you can watch below.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Official Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-z3Le3HeKQs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<li>Deluxe Edition – This version of the game includes access to the post release DLC, digital artbook, and mini soundtrack. Those who pre-order will also get a bonus gesture. This version is priced at £47.99.</li>
<li>Seekers Edition – This version includes a steelbook with the full game, post release DLC, digital artbook, and digital soundtrack. Again, those who pre-order will get a bonus gesture too. It is also worth noting that the Seekers Edition is only available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</li>
<li>Collector’s Edition – Included with this is the full game, steelbook, digital soundtrack, a 25cm statue of Wylder, eight Nightfarers cards, and a 40 page hardback artbook.</li>
</ul>
<p>We scored Elden Ring top marks,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/23/elden-ring-review/">10/10 in our review</a>&nbsp;back in February 2022. “Elden Ring is the game Souls fans have been waiting for,” said Jason. “From the open world design, to riding into battle on Torrent’s back, and the dark narrative woven through the world, this is a clear Game of the Year frontrunner that will have us all ensnared for a long time to come.”</p>

But he also said <em>Erdtree </em>is “about the same volume as the Limgrave part of the base game,” the starting area of <em>Elden Ring</em>, containing “slightly more content.” </p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24183692/hidetaka-miyazaki-interview-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjEwNTg1" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">Elden Ring Nightreign takes a big swing at a bigger audience</a></h2><div><p>It’s inaccurate and reductive to call <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320097/elden-ring-sequel-nightreign-the-game-awards-trailer">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em> a <em>Dark Souls </em>take on <em>Fortnite</em>. And yet, if pressed for an extremely brief elevator pitch — say, the kind you’d give to your friends who are curious about soulsborne games but are put off by all the discussions of their difficulty — it’s about as best as you could do. In my hands-on time with the game, I was compelled to ask my team at the outset of our very first run, “Well… where we droppin’ boys?” as we flew over the map in the claws of spectral birds. The similarity to<em> Fortnite</em> and other battle royale games was so striking, the reference simply had to be made. But once we got on the ground, <em>Fortnite</em> took a big ol’ backseat and <em>Elden Ring</em> reemerged as the foremost game <em>Nightreign</em> compares to.</p><p><em>Nightreign</em> strips out the combat and visual aesthetics of <em>Elden Ring</em> and lays them over gameplay that combines multiplayer battle royale action with roguelike live, die, repeat mechanics. Matches will take place over three days. During daylight, players will assault a Limgrave-like map (called Limveld), either solo or in teams of three, beating regular enemies and mini-bosses for powerful weapons, accessories, and runes to level up their characters. As daylight turns to night, a destructive, HP-draining storm called Night’s Tide shrinks the map, forcing the players to a tiny arena where they’ll face a major boss. Defeat the boss to begin the next day, when the cycle repeats and the match ends by defeating the final boss on the third night.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Lo-fi beats to chill / Waterfowl Dance to.</p><p>If video game soundtracks are what you use to get through the workday, then FromSoftware has a gift for you.

In response, the publisher <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122">is implementing a “calibration update”</a> that will reduce the level of difficulty by making players stronger.

FromSoftware also shared a new launch trailer to herald the DLC’s arrival, but it’s chockful of spoilers, so beware. The update isn’t particularly earth-shattering, but it does include some things worth keeping in mind before all you Tarnished <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">get your head beat in by the vicious monsters patrolling the Shadow Lands</a>.</p><p>Firstly, we get new hair options! I was pretty down on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s character creator <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22951205/elden-rings-character-creator-black-hairstyles">for its lack of Black hairstyles</a>. It just didn’t make sense that the character creator was so robust and detailed but lacked hairstyles that represent a good chunk of the human population. There are five new styles to choose from, with two of them being dreadlocks. I chose the loose loc option so my Tarnished can finally get rid of her abhorrent pigtails. I’m not sure if the “white hairs” option was present in the base game or a new addition with this patch, but I really like how it adds gray to my locs, reminding me of when I started picking out errant gray hairs when I had locs.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24182462/tips-for-starting-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Elden Ring has an ‘issue’ on Steam Deck right now.</p><p>“Leaving your Steam Deck inactive for more than 5 minutes may stop the game from accepting inputs,” <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427">according to the <em>Elden Ring</em> X account</a>.

The patch notes are indeed massive, but I’ve picked out a few highlights.</p><p><strong>Glintstone Pebble / Shard Spiral: </strong>increased attack power</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/13/23402616/elden-ring-dlc-patch-notes-update">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTAyMTg2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009950/elden-ring-giant-map-game-design-from-software">All hail Elden Ring’s ever-growing map</a></h2><div><p>One of <em>Elden Ring’s</em> most polarizing features is its willingness to withhold information. While it’s less arcane than earlier FromSoftware titles like <em>Dark Souls</em>, the game constantly hands you items, quests, and mechanics <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954823/elden-ring-open-world-guide">with very little explanation</a>. But after 130 hours and counting in the Lands Between, I’m in love with how well it sometimes deploys that obscurity.

But if you’ve played a bit of the game, you might know what I’m talking about. <em>Elden Ring’s </em>map offers a constant give-and-take of showing players new spaces to explore, then pulling back a curtain to more places that they didn’t even realize could <em>exist. </em>It withholds information only to reveal it in a way that’s delightful, satisfying, and entirely in keeping with the world’s vast scope. It’s not just an interface element — it’s a meta-game in its own right.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009950/elden-ring-giant-map-game-design-from-software">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTAzOTU2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979436/elden-ring-speedrunners-world-record-race-30-minutes">Elden Ring speedrunners race to the bottom</a></h2><div><p><em>Elden Ring</em> is just so massive and its bosses are so tough that the average player will probably take over 60 hours to beat it.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will release 30th May 2025 on Steam, developers FromSoftware and publishers Bandai Namco have announced. In a few short months, you and up to two friends will be called upon to rush a few bosses on a large, shrinking map set in the same universe as the 2022 open worlder. Is it the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-2-isnt-in-development-right-now-but-from-software-do-have-several-other-games-in-the-works">many would like</a>? No. Is it going to kindle similar feelings of frustration, despair and sporadic religious ecstasy? The omens seem good.
</p><!--more-->
<p>

A recap in case you missed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-software-reveal-elden-ring-nightreign-a-three-player-co-op-spin-off">the game's announcement last year</a>: each round of Nightreign challenges you to survive three in-game days, touring the environment in search of randomised elements and events so as to level up and prepare yourself for a boss fight at sunset. Make it to day three and you'll face one of eight Nightlords, whose ranks include characters from previous From Software games. As for player characters, you don't create your own as in vanilla Elden Ring. Instead, you'll pick from upgradeable Nightfarer prefabs such as the omnipurpose Wylder, the tanky Guardian and the agile and devious Duchess.
</p>
<p>
While the game is geared for co-op, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-will-support-singleplayer-but-it-might-not-reward-it">you have the option of playing offline with bot pals</a>, and you can queue for matches either alone, in pairs or in trios. So it doesn't quite depend on you having a banger human team of seasoned Tarnished ready to go, though I imagine that'll help. There's a beta test coming this weekend, though it's only on console. It runs from Friday 14th February to Monday 17th February as a series of three hour long sessions, and gives you access to four of eight Nightfarer characters.
</p>
<p>
We may or may not have somebody checking out the console beta. I won't name the individual in question because I do not wish to publicly associate them with one of those awful Eggsbogs or StayPlaytions and Tarnish their career forever. Did you know people don't even play games on Eggsbogs and StayPlaytions while sitting at desks? No, they play them while lolling on the sofa, like disgraceful Golden Retrievers. Fie!

Reimagined in Minter’s signature assault of colors, shapes and sounds, this new take on the eclectic arcade title is built from the ground up with new challenges, new twists, and a whole lot of llamas.</p><p>The premise of <em>I, Robot</em> is simple: You take control of an ox-headed robot on a mission to outwit the all-seeing eye. In each level, you’ll navigate across tiles, flipping each tile to proceed to the next. Make sure you don’t jump while the eye’s watching, or you’ll be zapped away in a flash. If you make it across the tiles, you’ll race down a tube blasting away any enemy shapes that move into your path and try to stop you. And you have to do all this inside of the 3D space of Minter’s kaleidoscopic visualizer.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Don’t get too comfortable, Minter has also thrown in some arena levels that challenge you to pick out and blast an onslaught of lethal enemies.</p><p>At its core it is a game that only Llamasoft could have made.

Now, HoloLens lives on in a new way--as a military product being run by Oculus creator Palmer Luckey's defense contractor Anduril Industries.</p><p>In a <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2025/02/11/anduril-and-microsoft-partner-to-advance-integrated-visual-augmentation-system-ivas-program-for-the-u-s-army/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Microsoft said Anduril will take over production and future development of hardware and software for HoloLens as part of the US Army's Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) program. This program is not new, of course, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-discontinues-hololens-for-consumers-but-remains-committed-to-selling-it-to-the-military/1100-6526836/" data-ref-id="1100-6526836">Army previously pledged $20 billion for IVAS systems.</a></p><p>To celebrate this announcement, Luckey recreated his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/internet-reacts-to-time-magazines-goofy-oculus-vr-/1100-6429551/" data-ref-id="1100-6429551">memorable (and goofy) Time Magazine cover from 2015</a>, but with a military spin.</p><p>Microsoft and Anduril said modern warfare is more complex than ever, which means the need for "intuitive, information-rich tools" is "increasingly urgent."</p><p>"Traditional mission command systems--that rely on flat maps, static dashboards and verbal communication--are ill-suited to the dynamic nature of modern battlefields," the companies said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/3815072-holo.png" data-ref-id="1300-3815072" data-ratio="0.58214285714286" data-width="840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/3815072-holo.png" data-ref-id="1300-3815072"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Microsoft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/3815072-holo.png"></figure><p>The IVAS program aims to address this by giving soldiers a headset that incorporates AR and VR systems to increase "combat effectiveness" and "survivability against drones," among other things.</p><p>As part of the deal, Anduril will make use of Microsoft's cloud and AI services to serve as the "backbone for the program," with Anduril using Microsoft's Azure as its "preferred hyperscale cloud."</p><p>Luckey, the founder of Anduril, said his aim with the company is to "create a military ecosystem where technology acts as an extension of human capability," and IVAS and HoloLens could help achieve that. "By empowering soldiers with the tools they need to make faster, smarter decisions, we're building a future where technology and human ingenuity combine to ensure mission success."</p><p>Microsoft has come under fire for its various gigantic contracts with the Department of Defense. Some employees criticized Microsoft's efforts in the military space in an <a href="https://twitter.com/MsWorkers4/status/1099066343523930112" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open letter</a>, saying, "We did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is used."</p><p>CEO Satya Nadella previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reaches-22-billion-deal-with-us-army-for-ar-technology/1100-6489650/" data-ref-id="1100-6489650">defended his company's involvement with the military.</a></p><p>"We appreciate the partnership with the US Army, and are thankful for their continued trust in transitioning IVAS from rapid prototyping to rapid fielding. We look forward to building on this successful partnership with the men and women of the US Army Close Combat Force," Microsoft said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/crysis-4-development-put-on-hold-as-crytek-confirm-layoffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Crytek has confirmed a round of layoffs that will affect around 15% of its 400 employees – so around 60 people from the team – and stated that development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crysis-4">the next Crysis game</a> was put on hold last year.</p>
<p>“Like so many of our peers, we aren’t immune to the complex, unfavourable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years,” the company wrote on social media.</p>


<p>“It pains us greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15 percent of our around 400 employees. The layoffs affect development teams and shared services. This has not been an easy decision to make, as we deeply appreciate the hard work of our talented teams.”</p>
<p>A new Crysis game was in development, but put on hold in Q3 of 2024, with Crytek prioritising the work on their extraction game revamp <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hunt-showdown-1896">Hunt: Showdown 1896</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/crysis-4-crytek-china-crysis-battleground/">Crysis 4 was announced back in 2022</a> with a short teaser trailer, the company looking to revive the first person shooter series on the heels of the Crysis trilogy remasters that arrived through 2020 and 2021. However, Crytek was also enjoying some success within the burgeoning extraction shooter genre with Hunt: Showdown, an occult and monster-infused take on the genre.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/25/hunt-showdown-1896-will-replace-the-original-in-august-sunsetting-ps4-and-xbox-one/">Hunt: Showdown 1896 has been a big reboot and sequel to that game</a>, bringing a new generation of Cry Engine to bear on the game (shutting the original down in the process), as well as overhauling the game’s core content. It didn’t strike true for us in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/hunt-showdown-1896-review/">Hunt: Showdown 1896 review</a>, but has been a solid evolution for the company.</p>
<p>They continue, “While Hunt: Showdown 1896 is still growing, Crytek cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable. Even after ongoing efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses, we have determined that layoffs are inevitable to move forward. Crytek will offer affected employees severance packages and career assistance services.”</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to those affected by these layoffs, and hopefully they can find their feet again soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-profitable-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy Entertainment has announced that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>is finally profitable, having recouped its development costs and marketing fees by the end of last year.</p>

<p>According to a new financial <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/6930dba3-2c3f-41a3-a596-8933ce7c454b/remedy-q4-fy-2024-financial-statement-release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> covering the full 2024 fiscal year, not only is&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>profitable, but it had also exceeded two million sales at the close of 2024, meaning it's picked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">another 200,000 sales or so since November</a>.</p>

<p>Back in April 2024, Remedy reported that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials" rel="nofollow">still hadn't earned back its budget</a>, although the studio said it had "recouped a significant part" of its expenses (stopping short of elaborating on exactly how much).</p>

Hurrah!</figcaption></figure><p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-q3-financials-alan-wake-2" rel="nofollow">inching closer towards profitability</a> as of November, at which point Remedy reported that it had earned back "most" of its development and marketing costs. That leads us to the present moment and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>'s final crossing of that all-important finish line.</p>

<p>In terms of finances, Remedy says its revenue jumped by 49.3% in 2024 when compared to the previous year, although the company hasn't had a profitable year overall.</p>

<p>That could well be down to the fact that Remedy hasn't released any major games this year (although it did launch two DLC packs for&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>), as well as the company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights" rel="nofollow">acquisition of the rights to&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>from former owner 505 Games</a> back in February last year.</p>

<p>With regards to the fourth quarter of 2024, Remedy says its revenue increased compared to last year's fourth quarter, although once again, profits are down compared to the same period the year prior.</p>

<p><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is still on track to launch this year, while&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>entered full production earlier this month and the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes are "making steady progress". Neither of the latter two have release dates yet, unfortunately.</p>

            <p>Well, this is nice. Remedy's exceptionally good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> is finally making royalties for the studio for the first time since its release in late 2023, after shifting over 2 million copies. The jubilant news comes from <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/">Remedy latest financial report</a>, as spotted <a href="https://www.vg247.com/alan-wake-2-finally-earning-royalties-for-remedy">by VG247</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-quite-made-its-money-back-according-to-remedys-latest-financials">As of September last year</a>, the musical-with-guns had "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses", but still wasn't quite in the green. Since then, they've released both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2s-the-lake-house-is-a-dark-brilliant-parable-on-the-devaluation-of-art-and-artists">The Lake House expansion</a> and physical console editions, which appear to have done the trick. "October saw particularly high activity around Alan Wake 2," says the report.</p>

<p>While I can't definitely say that my own personal word of mouth campaign has helped matters, I <em>did</em> use my best carving knife to write 'Play Alan Wake 2' into all those mangoes I chucked at people in Cardiff town centre, so who's to say who the <em>real</em> Sam Lake is here?</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the report, Remedy provided updates on their projects in progress, namely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, "Action RPG" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>, and their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-are-remaking-max-payne-1-2">Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remasters</a>. In short: yep, still cooking. Firebreak should be out this year, and Control 2 is just gearing up to enter full production. There was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resign-following-dispute-with-owner">some walkout chaos</a> at Annapurna Interactive last year, but this doesn't seem to have slowed down the deal made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-partner-with-annapurna-to-co-finance-control-2-and-explore-control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-film-adaptations">between them and Remedy</a>.</p>
<p>Max is "making steady progress in full production", too. Love a bit of Max. "It's the best blend of goofy and ridiculous," celebrated Alice Bell (RPS in peace) for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/happy-birthday-to-the-original-bullet-time-superstar-max-payne">original's 20th birthday</a>. "The writing also contains lines like, "The sun set with practiced bravado", which is absolutely incredible. And you can listen in to the idle bitching of your enemies before you round the corner and they notice you, at which point someone will yell, "IT'S PAYNE!" just before you drop into slow motion and watch bullets drift gently past you."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Furthermore, Remedy <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a> that they took over “Control-related publishing operations and community management handled by 505 Games” in the second half of 2024. They are preparing for their 30th anniversary in 2025, which will be “their biggest year as a developer and publisher yet.”&nbsp;</p>

I always approach From Software titles with a methodical and slow style. When I started playing this game, everything felt like it was in fast-forward so it felt very unnatural for a little while. Is that [impact on longtime fans] something that you thought about when designing the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Junya Ishizaki</strong>: One of the initial game concepts for Nightreign stemmed from creating a new sense of battle. I was a battle designer on Elden Ring and previous From titles; I wanted to take that in a new direction and try something new and fresh with the battle. But I wanted to do something new and expand on that. So, taking the battle systems of Elden Ring and expanding on those and changing the tempo was something we put great importance on when creating Nightreign.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What has it been like to have your scope expanded beyond the battle [elements of a game]? Now you are custodian of an entire gameplay experience.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Of course coming from a battle designer to a director of a game brings with it a lot more freedom. I have to make a lot more decisions. I have to look at a lot more of what's going on in other areas of the game. But this new freedom and this new scope is very liberating and very fun, but also quite challenging. Obviously there are many, many staff involved and a lot of people with different opinions that you have to take into account. But that aspect is especially interesting and it helped me to understand this new difficulty in making games. But it's not just about designing the battle, even on Elden Ring, while I was assisting with that. It was intended to make the game more interesting as a whole, so being able to translate that into a directorial role has been really fulfilling and really interesting.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441449-nighreign%282%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441449" data-ratio="0.61764705882353" data-width="2176" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441449-nighreign%282%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441449"></a><figcaption>In Nightreign, you take on challenges as a member of a squad of three.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441449-nighreign%282%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I was trying to pay attention to how core principles or design decisions that are unique to From Software are manifesting in this game. One of the important ones is a sense of self-growth, where you learn and overcome challenges. From your perspective, where in Nightreign's gameplay loop is that found? And how do you account for implementing that when there are randomized elements?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">First of all, thank you for your comments about our games. It sounds like you are quite familiar with them and you understand them to quite a deep degree. And as you say, this kind of self-growth of the player that we sort of put a lot of trust in them to learn and to overcome these challenges. That is a crucial aspect of Nightreign, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">We would say one way in which it differs from previous titles and Elden Ring is the player planning aspect. So in something like Elden Ring, it's a lot more of a long play. You have an extended experience and extended journey which culminates eventually in a boss battle. But for Nightreign, it's something that is a little bit more on the fly--it's a little bit more loose and it's a little bit more ad-lib. Players have to make these decisions and change their build and, maybe even their play style, on the fly while they're going through this gameplay loop. So we feel like this will provide a new way for the player to learn and to grow during their adventure with Nightreign.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Was the battle royale format always the framework that you wanted to work within or was there experimentation and you arrived at that format being the best place for your style of game and the game you wanted to make?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The battle royale-type structure was not considered to be the base of the game. It wasn't a starting point, it was something that sort of took shape, or elements of these games took shape during development of Nightreign. For instance, the Ring of Reign that closes in around the field is definitely something that players will be familiar with, but it wasn't there from the start. It's something that we implemented in order to encourage that movement and to guide the player's route through the map, and encourage their decision-making. That's something that we tried and we thought it worked well, so it stuck.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Many parts of what I experienced in Nightreign were the complete opposite of what I come to From Software games for. I'm one of those people who really loves the feeling of isolation and then I start playing this and immediately I've got two friends next to me. Was there ever a worry that this could impact the tone of the game or how From Software usually present their games in terms of atmosphere?</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441448-elden-ring-nightreign-trailer-cover.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441448" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441448-elden-ring-nightreign-trailer-cover.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441448"></a><figcaption>You can glide above the world in Nightreign.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441448-elden-ring-nightreign-trailer-cover.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">We definitely appreciate that players like yourself got into the tone and that sort of sense of isolation when enjoying these games. And we do want to feel like the tone is not too divided from Elden Ring in terms of atmosphere and setting. However, [for] players who might otherwise be intimidated by Elden Ring's structure and facing that deep dark world alone, we feel like this is an opportunity for them to find a more approachable experience and just jump right into the action.</p><p dir="ltr">And also, while it's designed as a multiplayer game and you are likely to find playing among other people, we do feel like this is a game that you can queue up for solo. And in matchmaking, if you have matchmaking set, you can all go your different ways on the map and you can spread out and do your own thing. You don't <em>have</em> to babysit one another, but eventually it will culminate in this shared experience of a cooperative boss battle. While it is a multiplayer game, we want this to feel like a loose and flexible experience that retains some of that feeling of isolation and feeling of going off into the unknown on your own, too.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One of the things that I thought was interesting was the way that over the course of a run I experienced pretty much every foundational and important aspect of a role-playing game experience and also a From Software experience. There was exploration, character development, a challenge to overcome, for example. I know this is something that you've talked about before but what was the thinking behind that and how difficult was it to achieve that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">One thing about these games is that there's an awful lot of weapons and equipment and player actions to choose from. And when making Nightreign, we wanted to figure out a new way in which players could have access to these and enjoy these in a different way. Of course, each player has their own preference and maybe they go into the game with a prerequisite of what sort of character they're going to build and what kind of weapon they want to use, so obviously they will have a lot of things that they're unfamiliar with and that they don't necessarily like using or don't necessarily go in with an intent to use. But we wanted players to feel more comfortable and like they were able to approach the things they don't know and aren't familiar with a lot easier in Nightreign. We wanted to keep this large selection of weapons and abilities very open and available to use, and free for players to experiment with and mix and match with. We wanted this to be one of the driving factors of Nightreign's gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, just because of the wealth of parameters in this game, you have to choose your character attributes, you have to choose your weapon, how that weapon performs, that weapon's attributes. One of the challenges involved in implementing this was [how it] creates a whole lot of moving parts. And while we wanted to streamline that in a way, if you streamline and cut back too much that starts to lose the fun and lose the element of interest and surprise. And so it was a difficult balancing act to try to get these two things to live in harmony with one another, the streamlining and this experimentation. But we feel like we've landed in a good place with the final product.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441450-nighreign%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441450" data-ratio="0.61764705882353" data-width="2176" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441450-nighreign%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441450"></a><figcaption>Looking cool is always the number one priority in a Souls-like.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441450-nighreign%283%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>When I was picking a character, it felt like I could identify certain archetypes of characters that I'm familiar with: healer, soldier, tank, and so on. But then when I got into the game and noticed there were very few restrictions on what I could use and how I could craft that build from that point on, it was an interesting experience because then I felt a little more free to experiment. At the same time, I was a little confused about what my role should be on the team. Do you expect people to try and fulfill roles or do you expect people to just build who they want and try to find the synergy?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yes, this is something we were conscious of during development. Of course, you have some of these character archetypes, like the guardian, who, just from their looks and from their abilities and from the outset, you understand, "Oh, this is probably closest to a tank-type character." Players want to dive in with that mindset and this was, of course, intentional. But we didn't want players to feel restricted by that archetype or by that role. We wanted to keep the essence of these games that allow you to be loose and change up your play style, change up your equipment on the fly, and change as you go through. We wanted to really emphasize that with Nightreign, so we didn't want to restrict that too much. So while players can approach this from a role-playing or a team role aspect, we didn't want to restrict them too much in that sense. We wanted to keep it quite flexible. This was very intentional.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How did you come up with the abilities for the Nightfarers? Some of them are really interesting. Like Duchess, for example, being able to repeat damage. The Recluse has a really cool ability where you siphoning magic from around you and building a spell. Where did that idea come from? And if it's just, "my brain," then silly question on my part.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yeah. Essentially these ideas came from myself and the team. We tried our best to think up some original and unique abilities for each character. A lot of us, myself included, play a lot of games. We love gaming, we love doing battle with these enemies in different ways [in] different titles. And so when we designed these characters and these abilities our main focus was, "Well, what's fun about using them? Why do we enjoy the feeling of using these abilities?" With the Recluse, they're a magic-oriented character. So what's fun about using magic? It's using your intelligence. It's using your brain, and figuring out the enemy's weak point, and figuring out how to use your magic effectively. So a lot of the characters were designed, and the abilities were designed with this at the forefront; just thinking what's fun about being this role and how we can effectively translate that into game feel.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="603360891" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

also interesting. I have a one-track mind, so if I know I like great swords, anything that doesn't look like a great sword is getting filtered out of my brain, usually. But with this system, I was forced to pay attention to everything. And, even if I had no intention of using it, I'd still grab things because there was a buff I wanted. What was the thinking behind that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The passives that you speak of tie back to the aspect of balancing the game between the overwhelming amount of parameters and wanting to have a fun feeling of experimentation and changing on the fly. The passives were something that offered that variety and that ability to experiment. It's something that we landed on quite early in development [and] we wanted to keep that going forward as a solution to that balance problem.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, from a balancing perspective in terms of the meta gameplay, we want players to feel like there was something there that they could tap into, get really crazy combinations, and figure out how they could synergize their build with these passives and their equipment and their abilities. This was just another element that allowed us to really imagine the player possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Attacking your teammates also heals them when they're downed. I had this moment where I was trying a katana but I had a halberd in my back pocket specifically just to revive my teammate because it has a good sweeping attack and, if I needed to, I could hit them from a distance while also hitting the enemy, which was really cool. How did you come up with the idea of attacking your friends to heal them?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">When designing the revival with this being a multiplayer game and having allies close by in mind, we did consider several traditional methods such as approaching your downed ally and holding a revive button--things like this. But we felt like a lot of these didn't quite maintain that sense of tension and that sense of focus in battle that we wanted to keep; that flow of battle in Nightreign. So when considering this, again, from a character perspective and what feels good, one of the more obvious conclusions we landed on was, well, we have a wide variety of attacks and abilities, why don't we try to leverage those? And this is just something that we tried throughout the course of development and it felt like it was working well. People responded well to it, and so we started to build on that.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="949953874" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

like that. Is there a concrete explanation for why this is happening and is it part of the story or is it just one of those things where it's for gameplay reasons or it's a good use of assets that already exist?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The primary reason for these existing bosses in Nightreign is from a gameplay perspective. Of course, with this new structure and with this new style of game, we needed a lot of different bosses. We needed a lot to add to this mix, so we wanted to leverage what we deemed appropriate from our previous titles.</p><p dir="ltr">We obviously understand that our players have a lot of affection for these characters and they have a lot of fond memories of battling them in these games, so we didn't want to encroach too much on that lore aspect. We wanted them to make sense within the atmosphere and vibe of Elden Ring Nightreign.</p><p dir="ltr">But mainly from a gameplay perspective, we wanted to incorporate these bosses, make adjustments to them to suit the gameplay of Nightreign and to make sure they felt at home. But it was more so from a numbers perspective. And just to add to that quickly, also from a personal standpoint, I thought it'd be kind of fun. So that's one simple reason why we included some of these old bosses.</p>
