<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has reached 5m sales worldwide, in just three days of release.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-shipped-25m-units-worldwide">Elden Ring had shipped 25m units</a>, meaning 20 percent of all players have already jumped back in for the DLC in its opening weekend.
</p>
<p>
"To the many who tread the path left by Kindly Miquella, we extend our heartfelt gratitude," reads a social post to celebrate.

<p>
Let's just hope all those who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/time-is-running-out-to-prepare-for-elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree">bought the DLC have actually been able to access it</a> - as it requires killing two specific bosses in the base game which, as per Steam records earlier in June, only 37.8 percent of players had managed.
</p>
<p>
A quick check on Steam now shows 40.3 percent of players have the necessary achievement, so Tarnisheds have been busy.
</p>
<p>
Shadow of the Erdtree has received plenty of praise, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">criticism from critics</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-falls-to-a-mixed-steam-rating-as-pc-players-complain-about-difficulty-and-performance">players alike</a> in part for its high difficulty.


</p>
<p>
One <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-legend-let-me-solo-her-is-back-but-with-a-new-name">returning player is Let Me Solo Her</a>, who's back with a new name to kill one of the DLC's toughest bosses.

Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, the 2002 action-adventure game, is getting a remake courtesy of Aspyr.
</p>
<p>
The developer describes this as "a new title that brings the original Star Wars: Bounty Hunter to modern platforms with visual enhancements, improved environmental textures, new dynamic lighting effects, and a new flashlight tool."
</p>
<p>
It's set for release on 1st August across Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC (Steam). It'll be priced at $19.99 (£TBA).

<p>

The game has players in the role of Jango Fett shooting and gliding his way across the galaxy, though in this version players will be able to unlock a new Boba Fett skin too as part of an Easter egg from the original game.
</p>
<p>
Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-swbountyhunter-ps2">Star Wars Bounty Hunter review</a> from back in the day described the game as "pretty and stylish" but the Star Wars setting "can't mask the shallow, unexciting gameplay from view".

</p>
<p>
Aspyr, part of Embracer Group, has released a number of Star Wars re-releases and remakes, including most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/players-criticise-star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-for-bugs-server-woes-at-launch">Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection</a>, which was plagued with bugs and server woes at launch.

</p>
<p>
It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-2-the-sith-lords-restored-content-dlc-has-been-cancelled">cancelled expected DLC for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 - The Sith Lords</a>, which would have restored lost content.

</p>
<p>
Outside of Star Wars, the developer was mostly praised for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-review">Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered collection</a>, but courted controversy with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered-will-restore-pin-up-posters">inclusion of pin-up posters</a>.

            <p>YouTube is a stocked repository of hours upon hours of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> lore. Ranni’s ending? No worries. Miquella and St. Trina? We got you. Mohg and the Formless Mother? Say no more. Turtle Pope? Sit back. The frenzied flame? Make yourself comfortable. The Elden Ring itself? One page is not enough to contain it all.</p>
<p>And yet, what use are any of you when I cannot find a single solitary lore snippet about these idiot worms?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here is everything I know about these worms:</p>
<ul>
<li>They like to hang out near gravestones, but so do a lot of things.</li>
<li>They seem to be somehow connected to the spirit jellyfish in the Lands Between. They even glow red when they’re angry.</li>
<li>I found a bunch of them protecting a turtle once.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m honestly ravenous for lore here. They’re so numerous and prominent in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> that I’m convinced that they’re absolutely vital to the entire setup. They don’t seem to drop any items. None of the NPCs will shut up about Miquella long enough to give me a scrap of information about them. I tried asking one some questions and it just very slowly retreated in the dirt</p>

Please, help me understand. First person to tell me something good gets a fiver. I mean, not really, but you know.</p>

<p>There were talks for a Grand Theft Auto (GTA) movie, but it never got much further than that.</p>



<p>Dan Houser, the co-founder of Rockstar Games and former head writer at the studio, recently <a href="https://theankler.com/p/dan-houser-absurd-ventures-hollywood-videogames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke to The Akler</a> where he talked about the time Rockstar met with Hollywood executives about making a possible film.  These “awkward dates”, as he called them, had him never being convinced howa movie could benefit Rockstar more than the games themselves would.</p>



<p>“[W]e’d ask [the executives], why would we do this?” Houser said, to which the response would always be along the lines of, “You get to make a movie”.</p>



<p>“And we’d be like, no, what you’ve described is&nbsp;you&nbsp;making a movie and us having no control and taking a huge risk that we’re going to end up paying for with something that belongs to us,” he said.</p>



<p>He then continued to talk about how it felt like the executives pitching a movie to Rockstar thought the company would be “blinded by the lights” of Hollywood. Houser said, however, that the company never wavered on what it knew it had with the GTA franchise.</p>



<p>“We had what we considered to be multi-billion-dollar IP, and the economics never made sense,” he said. “The risk never made sense. In those days, the perception was that games made poor-quality movies.”</p>



<p>He did admit, though, that times have changed, especially with quality adaptations of games into TV shows such as The Last of Us and Fallout.</p>



<p>Houser left Rockstar Games in 2020. He now leads a new studio, Absurd Ventures, that is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dan-houser-rockstar-studio-open-world-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working on new third-person open-world game</a>.</p>

internet</a> are wondering if Rockstar Games is doing this as a test of sorts prior to Grand Theft Auto VI's release next year (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-online-just-locked-a-quality-of-life-feature-players-have-wanted-for-ages-behind-the-gta-paywall-and-fans-worry-it-sets-a-dangerous-precedent-for-gta-6/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesRadar)</a>. From Rockstar and parent company Take-Two's perspective, GTA+ is another revenue stream beyond the initial game sale and standard microtransactions to become a third prong for making money. The thinking from fans goes that if putting features behind a paywall like GTA+ leads to more sign-ups to the service, then Rockstar/Take-Two might be encouraged to expand even more in this area.</p><p>In addition to the new Vinewood Clup App, GTA+ subscribers get an infusion of $500,000 worth of in-game cash for GTA Online every month, along with member-only Shark Cards that include 15% extra GTA$. Members also receive extra GTA$ multipliers for some GTA Online missions and modes, along with regular discounts on in-game vehicles, upgrades, properties, and more.</p><p>Beyond the GTA Online perks, a number of Rockstar Games titles are included with GTA+. Right now, the library of free games for subscribers includes L.A. Noire, Red Dead Redemption, GTA The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, GTA Chinatown Wars, and GTA Liberty City Stories. Rockstar's action game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/la-noire-and-bully-free-for-gta-members-this-year-along-with-millions-in-gta-online-cash/1100-6522333/" data-ref-id="1100-6522333">Bully will join the GTA+ catalog later this year.</a></p><p>Earlier this year, Rockstar Games raised the price of GTA+, pushing membership fees from $6/month to $8/month, or an increase of 33%. There is no multi-month or yearly membership option for GTA+.</p><p>Given the enormous success of GTA Online, many are wondering what kind of multiplayer mode Rockstar Games might offer in GTA VI. Also unknown is how GTA+ might factor in to the next GTA game. Hopes are high in general for GTA VI, as some believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-ref-id="1100-6521839">it's the most important video game release in history. </a></p><p>GTA VI is set for release in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-boss-highly-confident-in-fall-2025-release-window/1100-6523562/" data-ref-id="1100-6523562">Fall 2025</a>, but it would be surprising if it doesn't slip, given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">nearly all of Rockstar's releases in the past decade have been delayed beyond their original target dates.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/27/frostpunk-2-delayed-to-september<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Frostpunk 2 has been delayed. Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.</p>

<p>Developer 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:</p>

<p>“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/frostpunk-2-delayed-to-september-after-beta-feedback/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Frostpunk 2 has been delayed to a new release date on 20th September, developer 11 bit studios has announced, as they look to address feedback from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> Beta held a couple months ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/07/frostpunk-2-release-date-25-july/">Previously planned for launch on 25th July</a>, 11 bit is taking an extra two months to try and refine the game in key areas identified by players of the beta – they say the game had an 8/10 from the post-beta survey, which is pretty solid for a work in progress game. There will be changes to game mechanics to help things proceed more smoothly, and improvements to the UI and UX so that it’s the core decision making that gives you pause, not figuring out where that management feature is. And in response to players no longer feeling a connection to the actual citizens of their frozen city, there’s new Zoom Stories to cut back down to the personal level while retaining the broader scope of this diesel-powered sequel.</p>


<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>
<p>1. Additions to the game mechanics</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Changes to temperature, Heat and proximity-based gameplay, including new and rebalanced Hubs, that will make the city-building gameplay deeper and more impactful,</li>
<li>More detailed and flexible workforce management,</li>
<li>More direct-use abilities in the game loop, to allow you to react to crises more dynamically,</li>
<li>A new resource to make city-building and expansion more strategic, helping you stabilise the city’s economy,</li>
<li>Ability to reshape your districts after their construction,</li>
<li>Factions’ behaviour that is better aligned with their lore,</li>
<li>A more thorough and complex approach to dealing with protests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Extensive UI &amp; UX enhancement</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Improving the HUD (Head-Up Display) to make it clearer and more intuitive,</li>
<li>Adding a new construction menu along with five new city Hubs,</li>
<li>Improving the clarity, readability and look &amp; feel of the Idea Tree and frostland.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. A new city feature called ‘Zoom Stories’</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Zoom in on specific city parts to watch the day-to-day life of citizens</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the above features have already been previewed and tested by a select few players, while 11 bit state that these are not the full extent of what they’re working on over the next few months.</p>

<p>Looking back at that original game, Jason wrote in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">Frostpunk review,</a> “Frostpunk is a horrifyingly playable post-apocalyptic survival game that demands more out of you than most games ever could. Each decision and each sacrifice you make is hard on your city and on you. There are so many impossible choices and no win situations that the game is almost hard to play, but it’s so compelling that you will be unable to step away from it. The only real negative is the sheer overwhelming nature of the world the game is set in, and really that is more of a compliment to the designers than anything else.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-top-5-million-in-under-a-week.913281/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>sales have hit a major milestone less than a week after the long-awaited DLC's release, publisher Bandai Namco has revealed.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/eldenring/status/1806326803276906929" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly known as Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>has sold five million copies since its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-release-date">release this past Friday</a>. The publisher extends its "heartfelt gratitude" to those who are treading "the path left by Kindly Miquella".</p>
<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>itself has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million">sold 25 million copies</a>&nbsp;at last count, that means around 20% of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s players have picked up the DLC so far. It's likely that more players will discover the Land of Shadow as time goes on, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-fire.jpg?itok=6cKNkUAt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-fire.jpg?itok=XPazlTWn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is selling very well.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is the first - and probably also the last - expansion for From Software's huge open-world masterpiece&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>. The DLC adds a number of new bosses to fight, as well as new lands to explore and new weapons to collect.</p>
<p>Since it's a From Software project,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>boasts a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-trailer">typically obscure story</a>, but on the face of it, you're journeying to the mysterious Land of Shadow to follow in the footsteps of the Empyrean Miquella and discover the reason behind his journey.</p>
<p>Along the way, you'll have to reckon with the terrifying Messmer and his all-encompassing flame, plus plenty of other creatures that would love to kill you and display you on their mantelpiece.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-fight.jpg?itok=XLYWjjXS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-fight.jpg?itok=Iv2jCOEy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>For more of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s excellent combat, look no further than&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>On release,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>garnered <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16525/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/reviews" rel="noopener" target="_blank">universal acclaim amongst critics</a>, who praised its rich exploration, wealth of new weapons, and highly difficult bosses.</p>
<p>However, the difficulty of the DLC proved a sticking point for many players;&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>debuted to a Mixed rating on Steam (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/?curator_clanid=41005067#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now sitting at Mostly Positive</a>), with many players complaining about its difficulty being too high.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Bandai Namco <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-update-easier">issued an update for the DLC</a> to address this issue, and while it doesn't address things like boss attack patterns, it does make Blessings more potent, thereby potentially increasing players' damage while lowering the damage they take from enemies.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/9PMPZZLKQM43" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-game-recording-beta</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can-try-out-steams-new-game-recording-tools-right-now.913278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-game-recording-beta<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has announced a new suite of Steam game recording tools which will allow you to record, clip, and share game footage directly within Steam.</p>
<p>Per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/6087258371786989397" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official announcement</a>, the aptly-named Steam Game Recording feature offers two ways to capture your footage. You can either grab it in the background without needing to press record, or you can set the feature up to record on-demand according to your input.</p>
<p>Once footage has been captured, you can easily and quickly replay it, grab clips from it, and share those clips either to Steam chat or to external platforms.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-game-recording-beta-timeline.jpg?itok=P9BGPYhz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-game-recording-beta-timeline.jpg?itok=VFkWZ4Es 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Steam Game Recording lets you grab footage direct from Steam without needing third-party apps.</figcaption></figure><p>The tool's Timeline feature appears while you're recording, and if a game is "Timeline-enhanced", it'll automatically generate markers for certain events, like killing bosses or discovering new areas. Of course, you can also add your own markers.</p>
<p>Right now, two games are Timeline-enhanced, and it won't surprise you to learn they're both Valve games:&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-surprise-releases-counter-strike-2">Counter-Strike 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dota 2</em>.</p>
<p>Once you've got your footage, you can save it as a clip or export it as an MP4, and you can also send clips between a PC and a Steam Deck. Oh, that's right: Steam Game Recording is completely functional on Steam Deck as well.</p>
<p>The new Game Recording tool works across any Steam game; as long as you can access the Steam overlay, you can access Game Recording as well, which is pretty neat. Not all games are Timeline-enhanced, though.</p>
<p>You can also tell Steam how much disk space you want footage to take up, as well as for how long you want the tool to record if it's set up not to need your input.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-game-recording-beta-helldivers-2.jpg?itok=8n-mnmlc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-game-recording-beta-helldivers-2.jpg?itok=Q57fkjdM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new Steam Game Recording tool looks pretty powerful.</figcaption></figure><p>Steam Game Recording is available right now if you're using the Steam beta client; all you need to do is head to Settings, then Game Recording (assuming your Steam client is up to date).</p>
<p>If you're not using the beta, just head to your Steam settings, then Interface, then Beta Participation. Pick one of the two betas to participate in, then update and/or restart your client as needed.</p>
<p>As well as announcing the Game Recording beta, Valve also released some interesting Steam Input <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4142827237888316811" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stats</a> yesterday. According to Valve, controller use on Steam has tripled since 2018.</p>
<p>59% of controller sessions are using Xbox controllers, Valve says, while 26% are using PlayStation controllers and 10% are Steam Deck users.</p>
<p>Presumably, some of them will also eventually be users of the <a href="https://hori.jp/products/hpc/hpc-055/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newly-announced Wireless Horipad</a>, which is launching in October in Japan. No word yet on a Western release, so stay tuned for more.</p>

That is hilarious when you think about how the games he and FromSoftware have become famous for have garnered a community known for fawning over difficulty and creating the hateful phrase “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-calls-for-an-end-to-git-gud-1847272679&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-calls-for-an-end-to-git-gud-1847272679">git gud</a></span>.” The director reveals that once he’s developed a game, he typically doesn’t pick it up as a player, but ahead of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> he forced himself through <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p><p>But if Miyazaki sucks so much at video games, how did he get through <em>Elden Ring</em>? “My approach or play style was to use everything I have at my disposal,” he says, “all the assistance, every scrap of aid that the game offers, and also all the knowledge that I have as the architect of the game.” While that last part about designing the game doesn’t apply to other players, Miyazaki’s play style has some great lessons for anyone hitting a wall in<em> Elden Ring</em>: It’s ok to use something if the game provides it. </p><p><em>Elden Ring </em>takes the Soulslike formula and opens it up, quite literally, in the form of a sprawling world players can explore at their own pace. Per Miyazaki, this “lowered the barrier of entry,” and made the game more accessible to players. For some, that open design and the inclusion of mechanics like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-curseblade-meera-spirit-ash-where-find-1851554428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-curseblade-meera-spirit-ash-where-find-1851554428">Spirit Ashes</a></span> (which let you summon NPC aid) took away from the need to ‘git gud.’ Those people then began to accuse players who use those tools of not playing the “right way” or playing on easy mode. But with Miyazaki playing with those offered aids, it’s pretty clear that the right way to play is any way you want, and that the ‘git gud’ argument is bullshit. </p><p>Miyazaki and the developers at FromSoftware created every system with the intent that it would support players in surmounting the challenges they face, there is nothing wrong with using them. That is true in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>as well: summon as many co-op players and Spirit Ashes as you need to pummel enemies into the ground. Just remember, it’s what Miyazaki would do.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The news dump contradicted <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.resetera.com/threads/pyoro-leaks-switch-game-announcements-part-4.860007/page-23&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/pyoro-leaks-switch-game-announcements-part-4.860007/page-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pyoro’s vague expectation-setting</a></span> ahead of time, and seemed to expose them as out of information.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-21/rumors-go-dark-as-video-game-leakers-face-a-reckoning?sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-21/rumors-go-dark-as-video-game-leakers-face-a-reckoning?sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As <em>Bloomberg</em></a></span> reported at the time, fans quickly realized that unlike previous Nintendo Directs, many of the games announced didn’t immediately have store pages go live on the eShop, suggesting that perhaps backend data from those listings was part of how Pyoro had been getting their information. The leaker then took the incredibly odd step of leaking their own source to <em>Bloomberg</em>, stating that source was a Nintendo employee in Japan and  that the “backend theory is a reasonable guess” about where that person got their information from. Even more surprisingly, Pyoro later locked their account after stating they hadn’t expected their comments to a reporter to be included in a news article. </p><p>Store pages for the games announced last week have only recently started going live, including the one revealing the unexpected $60 premium for <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>. It’s possible that this is one of the steps Nintendo is taking to crack down on leaks, alongside potentially shifting how it engages with video hosting services like YouTube. We’ll have a better sense of how those strategies are working when and if we <em>don’t</em> hear about future upcoming announcements, including for likely Switch 2 launch games. </p><p>In the meantime, the video game leaking scene is still in shambles. Midori, another mysterious leaker, was recently revealed to be well known male <em>Persona</em> fan posing as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/midori-mysticdistance-leak-persona-6-kingdom-hearts-4-1851536988&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/midori-mysticdistance-leak-persona-6-kingdom-hearts-4-1851536988">a mysterious Japanese woman</a></span>. Until a new hero rises up, super fans will just have to wait for the eventual press releases like everyone else. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

(If you’re still hoping to play, check out IGN’s guide on <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/How_to_Prepare_for_the_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">How to Prepare for the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</a>.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Many would assume this to be an issue for developer FromSoftware and Bandai Namco, given the game itself is essentially stopping more than half its player base from accessing the DLC and therefore wanting to spend more money. But Bandai Namco Europe's chief marketing and sales officer Anthony Macare told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-bandai-namcos-most-ambitious-expansion-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GI.biz</u></a> that Elden Ring sold so many copies that it doesn't matter.</p><p>"That statistic does present a unique challenge," he said. "However, with over 25 million units sold, even a fraction of our player base constitutes a substantial audience. Our marketing efforts have been tailored to engage this significant segment effectively."</p><p>Five million sales after just three days on sale is an incredible result for Shadow of the Erdtree, and suggests an impressive 20% of Elden Ring base game owners paid another $40 for the DLC. Sales will surely increase over time, as Elden Ring's did over the course of 2022 and 2023.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>After an initial ‘mixed’ Steam user review rating for Shadow of the Erdtree, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-down-to-mixed-on-steam-as-players-complain-about-the-difficulty-and-performance">sparked by a feeling its bosses are too hard as well as performance problems</a>, the DLC is now up to ‘mostly positive.’ Shadow of the Erdtree has certainly enjoyed critical acclaim, and has become the highest-rated video game expansion of all-time by overtaking Witcher 3 DLC Blood and Wine on Metacritic. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review"><u>Shadow of the Erdtree review</u></a> returned a 10/10. We said: “Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single-player DLC expansions. It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/meet-the-nintendo-3ds-fans-hoping-to-finally-beat-puzzle-swap-by-tracking-down-its-rarest-puzzle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I vividly remember from young adulthood the thrill of pulling my 3DS out of my bag at the end of the day and seeing the familiar blinking light indicating I’d received a StreetPass while I was out and about. I’d open the app and see the Miis of the different people I’d passed that day, with cute messages and silly hats. And every time, I’d immediately open Puzzle Swap to see what puzzle pieces they had given me.</p><p>When I first started Puzzle Swap, I entertained delusions that I might someday complete every puzzle just by passing fellow 3DS owners on the street. I quickly learned this was a nigh-impossible fantasy for a number of reasons, one of which being that several of the available puzzles couldn’t even be unlocked unless I traveled across the globe for special, limited-time events where unique puzzles were being handed out. I settled for trying to finish the various Mario, Kirby, and Zelda-themed puzzles that came by default on the device, or through occasional online updates. Admittedly, I never managed that either.</p><p>Now, my 3DS is gathering dust in a cabinet somewhere, its online services having been permanently shut down earlier this year and my motivation to use it having long since dried up. But a dedicated group of fans are still trying to realize the dream of collecting every Puzzle Swap puzzle, and they’re doggedly working to find their white whale: ANA: the rarest puzzle of them all.</p><h2>Chasing ANA</h2><p>The missing puzzle is a bit of a strange one. It’s called ANAでDS, ANA for short, with ANA standing for “All Nippon Airways.” It’s a special puzzle distributed way back in 2012 from July 21 to September 30 in Japan, but only at three select airport locations: Haneda Airport Terminal 2 (Tokyo), New Chitose Airport (Hokkaido), and Naha Airport (Okinawa). What’s more, the puzzle itself cannot be passed to others via StreetPass. You can collect pieces from others who have them if you already have the puzzle unlocked, but with the event having concluded over a decade ago, there’s no “legitimate” way to acquire the puzzle if you didn’t receive it at the time. As a result, the puzzle is exceptionally rare compared to other puzzles distributed more widely, eluding many hunters over the years. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/26/20-ana28jap29-1719439427538.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>An image of the completed ANA puzzle, courtesy of the Nintendo fan Wiki. Notably, while all the other puzzles have high quality images, all we have of ANA is a photo of a 3DS screen. <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Puzzle_Swap">https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Puzzle_Swap</a></figcaption></figure></output><p>Which is where Benny and his fellow puzzle hunters come in.</p><p>Benny runs a Discord server called The Search for ANAでDS, where roughly 20 individuals have been collaborating over the last several weeks to track down the final missing puzzle. Benny tells me he became interested in finding ANA only recently, after his love for the 3DS was reignited thanks to a homebrew application called NetPass, which allows players to receive StreetPasses over the internet.</p><p>Through his interest in NetPass, Benny stumbled upon and joined the search for the Japan-exclusive マックでDS ビッグマック (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetPassNetwork/comments/1cyb3bg/japanese_big_mac_puzzle_%E3%83%9E%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%81%A7ds_%E3%83%93%E3%83%83%E3%82%B0%E3%83%9E%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF_is_now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a picture of a McDonald’s Big Mac</u></a>), which was only just officially cataloged last month. Just before that, others in the community managed to track down another time-limited puzzle, EU-exclusive <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetPassNetwork/comments/1cmgtrp/european_puzzle_swappers_obtain_the_event_puzzle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mario &amp; Happy</u></a>. With the inclusion of both Mario &amp; Happy and the Big Mac, 62 of Puzzle Swap’s 63 total puzzles were officially uploaded online and available for anyone to download. With just one puzzle left, Benny’s next objective was clear: ANA.</p><p>“Those puzzles were easier to recover because the required SpotPass data had already been dumped by users on the Internet; it was essentially just a matter of finding the data,” Benny explains. “In this case, it is more difficult because to the best of our knowledge, the ANAでDS puzzle data has not been publicly dumped anywhere, so we have to search for someone who has the puzzle so we can recover the required data from them directly”</p><p>What Benny and his fellow hunters need to document ANA is simple on its face: they just have to find one individual who has the puzzle unlocked on their 3DS who is willing to upload a file from their SD card to the internet. That’s it! No homebrew or modding required, and the individual doesn’t even need to have the puzzle completed. Just a single piece is enough.</p><p>Since May, the group has been spreading the word to news outlets, subreddits, forums, and other communities in an effort to find ANA. Once the file is uploaded, the community will take matters from there and incorporate the puzzle into a larger file with all the other puzzles, enabling anyone who wants a complete puzzle collection and doesn’t mind a bit of homebrew to download all 63 puzzles at once.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Do you have the rarest StreetPass puzzle? ✈️</p><p>In summer 2012, Nintendo collaborated with All Nippon Airways to distribute the Puzzle Swap puzzle “ANAでDS”. Currently, this is the only lost puzzle out of the entire collection.</p><p>(a 🧵; 1/?) <a href="https://t.co/XqogPwQvSD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/XqogPwQvSD</a></p></div>— The Search for ANAでDS (@PuzzleSwapANA) <a href="https://twitter.com/PuzzleSwapANA/status/1805680588524818567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 25, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>“If someone has the puzzle, they can contact us by email at puzzleswapana@gmail.com, send us a Twitter/X direct message at @PuzzleSwapANA, or join our Discord server at https://discord.gg/JTAJF3DgxY and we will guide them through completing the simple steps needed to recover the puzzle's SpotPass data (it should only take at most 10 minutes),” Benny explains.</p><h2>Puzzle Preservation</h2><p>It may seem strange that a community has rallied around a game like Puzzle Swap especially after Nintendo officially <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63227/~/announcement-of-discontinuation-of-online-services-for-nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>discontinued online communications</u></a> for the device earlier this year. While local communications are still possible, meaning StreetPass itself still works, not a lot of folks are carting 3DSes around in their bags in 2024.</p><p>But a number of those I spoke to in the community tell me that it was Nintendo’s discontinuation of services for the 3DS that motivated them to pick up the handheld device again.</p><p>“I’m personally using it about as much as my switch, but I think the shutdown motivated a lot of people (me at least) to start archiving, modding, getting replacement services (ie Pretendo), etc,” said Croton, another community member who’s been heavily involved in the hunt, “like I forget when the shutdown was announced but I only just modded on a random Tuesday in October, and when the SpotPass archival server started recovering game data I modded my family’s 4 other 3ds’s to archive more data.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even if it’s a relatively unknown or niche part of the legacy of the 3DS, it still matters.</p></div><p>Some of those in the community are in it simply for the collect-a-thon. One community member, MrNoobingtonThelll, tells me that after the Big Mac puzzle was found some of the energy for puzzle hunting started to die down. “[T]he missing puzzles topic kinda died but Benny was one of the few one [sic] actively searching for it, so with my collectors anxiety of [100 percenting] a game I started to offer a little help.”</p><p>Others, like Ninja Squid, see the hunt as critical to game preservation. “It’s rewarding to be a part of this team and see all the amazing work we’ve done,” he said. “Finding this puzzle is important because, even if it’s a relatively unknown or niche part of the legacy of the 3ds, it still matters and is a big part of eventually archiving most of the history of the 3ds. [I]t’s a very neat novelty from an interesting time in Nintendo’s history that I would love to know is accessible to anyone. Being a part of this gives me the opportunity to help archive an important and rare piece of this amazing console’s history, and it’s nice to know that we are getting to be one big step closer to archiving as much of the 3ds as possible.”</p><p>At the time this piece is being written, the ANA hunters do have one lead – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/random-streetpass-fans-are-hunting-for-a-super-rare-puzzle-swap-panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a comment on a NintendoLife article from a user claiming to have ANA on their DS</u></a>. The community has reached out and is waiting for a response. In the meantime, they’re keeping their eyes open for other leads on ANA in case this one falls through. But overall, the mood is hopeful.</p><p>“[D]ude since the file for every puzzle combined is new the first person to complete ana ds would be the first to actually beat puzzle swap,” observed MrNoobingtonThelll.</p><p>He may just be right – and it only took 13 years.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

You have the power to see them all. Help the spirit community to thrive again and use their magic – fly with the Harpien, dive with the Nixen, run through the Grasslands with the Zlatorog. Blend foraging, farming and crafting with heartfelt relationships and a community rich with stories. Embark on a serene journey to bring harmony to the worlds of humans and mountain spirits, transforming Kindred Vale back into a haven of peace and beauty.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_895537"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Bridge the Two Worlds</strong> – The Spirits and humans of Kindred Vale lived in harmony for many years before a tragic rift came between them. Ever since, more and more of the town has slipped into the magical fogs the folkloric creatures use to protect their home. This divide has led people to lose touch with the spirits. You, alone, can still see them all, interact with and communicate with them. You have the chance to mend old wounds and rebuild the trust that has been lost. It is up to you to bring the two communities back together.</li><li><strong>Encounter the Spirits</strong> – Kindred Vale is full of spirits inspired by the folklore of our home in the Austrian Alps. Wolpertinger, Perchten, the Tatzelwurm and many more are a part of life in Kindred Vale and always have been. By interacting with the spirits and exploring their needs, you’ll be able to befriend them and rebuild their trust in humanity, as well as unlocking strange and wonderful abilities that only you can harness.</li><li><strong>Use the Spirits’ Magical Gifts</strong> – Each spirit has a unique gift that allows you to explore Kindred Vale like never before. After befriending them, fly up to the peaks of the Alps with the Harpyien, dive down to the depths of the lake with the Nixen​, venture to the hidden places of the forest with the Wolpertinger​, or speed through the grasslands with the legendary Zlatarog. Use these gifts to help restore Kindred Vale to the peaceful and harmonious place it once was.</li><li><strong>Meet the Townspeople</strong> – Kindred Vale features a diverse community of townspeople. Like the Spirits, they have their own unique personalities, likes and dislikes. Each brings a distinct story and perspective to the town, which will be added to as we bring more and more updates to the game. Who you befriend is completely up to you. Among them, you may even find that special someone who makes your heart flutter, with relationships adding yet more depth to each character.</li><li><strong>Forage, Cook, Craft, and Decorate</strong> – <em>Kindred Vale</em> reimagines the cozy game classics! Once you’ve settled into town, you can forage and fish ingredients to cook, craft furniture to decorate your home, and give a range of gifts to your fellow townies. Unlock and discover more recipes through your interactions, explore the surrounding areas to find parts of Kindred Vale’s long history, and take them back to be celebrated in the local museum.</li><li><strong>Uncover the Secrets of the Vale</strong> – Kindred Vale is truly unique—nestled in the heart of vast mountains, lush grasslands, a beautiful lake and a mysterious forest. And in town, each district has much to offer; its own look and unique spirit. Explore at your own pace and enjoy the amazing views and vistas the area has to offer.</li></ul><p>But, there is more to Kindred Vale than meets the eye. The protective fogs that cover much of the town hold secrets that many don’t know and some don’t speak of. By working with both people and spirits to unify the town, you can uncover the truth of what happened many years ago, mend the rift between the two communities and—maybe—even learn something about yourself along the way…</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

        <p>49 people were reportedly let go yesterday</p>

    </div><div>



            <p><strong>Update</strong>: Gameloft has confirmed layoffs to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, with a spokesperson saying it was "necessary" for the studio to "implement a reduction in workforce" due to the current situation of the games market.</p>
<p>"As a company, we need to constantly review our production capacities," the statement read. "After careful consideration and in response to the ever-changing market conditions we are facing, it has become necessary to implement a reduction in workforce. </p>
<p>"Unfortunately, this leads us to substantially reduce our production activity in our Toronto studio and to let go some employees of the office. This decision has not been taken lightly, and we understand the impact it may have on affected employees. We will be working with them, on a case-by-case basis, to find the best way to handle their situation."</p>
<p><strong>Original story</strong>: The majority of Gameloft Toronto has reportedly been laid off, <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> has been told.</p>
<p>Only HR, IT, and management are believed to be unaffected by the cuts, which reportedly would see the developer's title, 2016's Disney Magic Kingdoms, transferred to Gameloft's studio in Kharkiv, Ukraine. All staff who had been working on the title in Toronto have reportedly been laid off, representing around 49 people.</p>
<p>In addition to our own sources, community manager Tasha Huggins has written a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7211838073465184256/">Linkedin post</a> in which she mentions that yesterday was her last day at Gameloft Toronto.</p>
<p>"As of today, there is a lot of incredible talent that has just entered the market," she said. "If you are interviewing anyone from the Gameloft Toronto/Disney Magic Kingdoms team, please reach out to me. I would love another opportunity to talk about just how amazing they are."</p>
<p>According to our information, the other project Gameloft Toronto was working on has been cancelled following the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gameloft-sees-staff-redundancies-in-lviv-and-toronto-offices">first round of layoffs at the company back in February</a>.</p>
<p>A second round of redundancies reportedly happened in April, during which 40 people were also let go.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> has reached out to Gameloft for comment.</p>

I’m not interested in clearing the base game prerequisites necessary to access it, nor am I really in the mood for the type of game it so clearly is right now. That said, I am positive I could beat it – obliterate it, actually – if I had a dedicated therapist to help me regulate my emotions throughout the process.</p><p>Kai Cenat, one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, recently brought in a therapist to help him topple the biggest <em>Elden Ring</em> boss of all: his feelings. By that point, Cenat had been marathoning the game for <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kaicenat/video/2180034612?filter=archives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 90 hours</a> and had died nearly 1,000 times. Dozens of those hours had been gobbled up solely by the expansion’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/shadows-of-the-erdtree-currently-has-a-mixed-status-on-steam-with-many-of-the-negative-reviews-complaining-that-the-bosses-are-too-hard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oft-lamented-about final boss</a>. Cenat missed his friends. He missed touching grass. He was frustrated, bordering on despondent. Then the therapist arrived:</p><p>Seven hours and 79 deaths later, Cenat <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2181718739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slew <em>Erdtree</em>’s final boss</a>, proving that therapy is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/therapy-broken-mental-health-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the solution to all of life’s problems</a>. So yeah, I’m pretty sure that if I had my own <em>Elden Ring</em>-specific therapist, I could buzzsaw through <em>Erdtree</em>’s gallery of notoriously sturdy bosses, probably on my first try. But sadly, I can’t afford one, so I guess we’ll never find out.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Xbox and Amazon have partnered up to deliver Xbox Cloud Gaming via select Fire TV devices.</p>
<p>"Today, we're announcing a collaboration with Amazon where Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members in over 25 countries can play games directly from the Xbox app on select Fire TV devices via cloud gaming, giving people even more choice in how they play their favourite games," Xbox announced earlier today.</p>
<p>The company called this latest cloud-based initiative "a great low-cost, convenient, and portable option" for players, with no console needed to access games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-guides-tips-tricks-9352">Starfield</a> and Fallout 4 on a TV.</p>

<p>Those interested need a Fire TV Stick, a Bluetooth-enabled wireless controller, and an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership "to gain instant access to hundreds of phenomenal games", the team said.</p>
<p>Here are details of how to get it set up, as per <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/27/xbox-cloud-gaming-amazon-fire-tv/">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply install and launch the Xbox app from your Fire TV device.</li>
<li>Sign in with your Microsoft account to play. If you're an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate member, you'll have instant access to hundreds of cloud-enabled games.</li>
<li>Not a member? No worries! You can join Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/ultimate">one low monthly price</a>, or check out Fortnite without a membership.</li>
<li>Connect a Bluetooth-enabled wireless controller. Controllers like the Xbox Wireless Controller, Xbox Adaptive Controller, PlayStation DualSense, or DualShock 4 controller are all compatible.</li>
<li>Start Playing!</li>

<p>"Over the past several years, we have been on a journey to deliver cloud gaming to more devices and to more people around the globe. We are excited to add Fire TV to our growing family of cloud gaming devices and eager to welcome new players into this experience," Xbox wrote.</p>
<p>"This increased availability and flexibility provide an ideal jumping-on point for anyone looking to see what the buzz around cloud gaming is all about," <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/xbox-gaming-on-amazon-fire-tv">Amazon</a> added in its own post.</p>

<p>Nintendo knows it takes more time for larger games to be released than before.</p>



<p>Over the last 10+ years, one thing that’s been common is how long it has taken for new large-scale games to launch. It’s a subject many people have questions about, and was even brought up during Nintendo’s annual shareholders meeting on Thursday.</p>



<p>As part of the Q&amp;A portion of the meeting, Nintendo was asked about the length between games in their franchises with Super Mario Bros. Wonder  being used as an example. Specifically, they were asked about releasing games in a series on a more consistent basis as opposed to the “once-in-a-decade” cycle. </p>



<p>“Currently, game development times are becoming longer and more complex,” the company said as <a href="https://x.com/NStyles/status/1806145357073842419">translated by NStyles</a> on Twitter. “We are expanding and investing in development resources.”</p>



<p>“The length of development time is unavoidable due to the advancement of game consoles,” senior managing executive officer Shinya Takahashi said. “The development environment has also improved, so I think we are making efforts to shorten the time. I want to create games that are fun and entertaining in a short period of time.” </p>







<p>Senior officer Takashi Tezuka then added, “When I talk about Mario Wonder, I was surprised that it took 11 years from the previous game. In the meantime, we’ve also released Mario Maker and 3D Mario. </p>



<p>“We’ve offered a number of Mario-related games. We are developing the game while thinking about how to make people fall in love with Nintendo. We are also considering short-term titles.”</p>



<p>Currently, Nintendo has a number of new games across its various franchises set to release this year, including Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and Super Mario Party Jamboree. </p>

<p>Nintendo knows about all of the online leaks surrounding its games and hardware development, and its working to prevent them from continuing.</p>



<p>During its annual shareholders meeting on Thursday, Nintendo commented on the leaks for the first time publicly when asked about it during the Q&amp;A section of the meeting. </p>



<p>“We have become aware of the specific issues pointed out through media reports and other sources,” Nintendo said as <a href="https://x.com/NStyles/status/1806143409180279055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">translated by NStyles</a> on Twitter. “We work with specialist companies to diagnose information security and take various other measures.</p>



<p>“The company has introduced information security management as part of its internal information security system, and is also working on continuous education for employees.”</p>



<p>These leaks have come from various sources within Nintendo as it was recently revealed by one well-known leaker Pyoro that their source was from a Nintendo of Japan employee. It was also uncovered that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-youtube-leaks-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google employees on the YouTube side</a> of the business had been able to access private Nintendo videos in order to get information out to leakers.</p>

                <p>In the '80s, some of the classic arcade characters weren't always called by the names that we know them by today. Pac-Man was originally Puck Man, which was changed in America because of how easily that name could have been defaced into an expletive. Even Mario was internally called Mr. Video and Jumpman before Nintendo settled on his famous name. Now, several of Donkey Kong's potential names have resurfaced, and one of the possibilities was Kong Dong.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-could-have-been-called-kong-dong-nintendo-court-documents-state" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, that very amusing alternate name for Donkey Kong emerged in legal documents from Universal Pictures' lawsuit against Nintendo, which were scanned by gaming historian <a href="https://x.com/GamingHistorian/status/1222939644217757697" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Norman Caruso</a>. Some of the other potential names Nintendo considered for Donkey Kong were Kong Man, Mr. Kong, Big Kong, Giant Kong, Kong Boy, Funny Kong, and Kong the Kong. The final Donkey Kong name was chosen as a rough translation of "Dumb Ape."</p>

      </div>
<p>In retrospect, Nintendo made the right call by going with Donkey Kong for the original 1981 video game that also introduced Mario to the world. However, Universal's 1982 lawsuit contended that Nintendo had infringed upon the studio's King Kong and sued the video game company for a share of the game's profits. Nintendo emerged triumphant in court when the company's attorney, John Kirby, successfully cited an earlier court case in which Universal argued that King Kong and all of its associated characters were in the public domain.</p><p>Universal and Nintendo eventually buried the hatchet, which led to Nintendo themed lands in Universal Studios locations around the world and The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which featured Seth Rogen as the voice of Donkey Kong. Of course, the Donkey Kong video game franchise lives on with a port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-preorder-nintendo-switch/1100-6524388/" data-ref-id="1100-6524388">Donkey Kong Returns</a> heading to Nintendo Switch in early 2025.</p>
