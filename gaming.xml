            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-publisher-whiskerwood-city-builder<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>publisher Hooded Horse has announced brand new city builder&nbsp;<em>Whiskerwood</em>, which apparently didn't get the memo that "a game of cat and mouse" is supposed to be metaphorical.</p>
<p>Developed by Minakata Dynamics, whose work you'll know if you've played train strategy sim&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1355090/RAILGRADE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Railgrade</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Whiskerwood</em>&nbsp;sees you constructing a home for a colony of industrious mice who are laboring under the "oppressive paw of their cat overlords".</p>
<p>Minakata Dynamics promises the ability to eventually decide whether you want to keep working under the cats' yoke or to "raise whiskers in defiance", so it sounds like you'll be able to lead some sort of rebellion against your feline masters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-city.jpg?itok=ZFMhpdpP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-city.jpg?itok=bu345fhE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Whiskerwood&nbsp;</em>is an actual cat-and-mouse city builder.</figcaption></figure><p>In gameplay terms, if you've played games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/timberborn"><em>Timberborn</em></a>, then you'll know roughly what to expect from&nbsp;<em>Whiskerwood</em>.</p>
<p>The devs promise "complex simulations" and "supply chain management dealing with over 40 commodities", so if building the perfect logistical operation is something that presses your gaming buttons, this one's definitely for you.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, you'll also be able to build both upwards and downwards in order to "maximize space", leading to cities that ask you to build "up into the sky" and to burrow "deep underground". I suppose the latter, at least, is sort of in keeping with the rodent theme.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-gameplay.jpg?itok=6GA0M_j6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-gameplay.jpg?itok=QN9294NU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love logistics-based city builders, this one's for you.</figcaption></figure><p>As you play, you'll also come across other factions of mice, and it's up to you whether you want to try and befriend them or move straight to hostility to defend your settlement.</p>
<p>Of course, there'll be a tech tree to work your way through, as well as a "strategic layer to expand influence beyond the colony". In short, this sounds like another Hooded Horse hit, especially if you're into&nbsp;<em>Ghost of a Tale&nbsp;</em>or the&nbsp;<em>Redwall&nbsp;</em>novels.</p>
<p><em>Whiskerwood&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> "soon", although no release date has been announced yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

For a big-name, highly anticipated, fully playable game to hit piracy sites <em>two months</em> before it’s due out, however, is astoundingly unusual. That’s what’s happened to <em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em>, the Saber-made sequel to Relic’s 2011 hack-n-slash hit, apparently including all 75GB of the nearly finished game, and even server binaries.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195928,196251" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Originally reported by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a></span>, the sequel—developed by <em>Evil Dead</em> and <em>World War Z</em> studio Saber Interactive—has leaked in a completely playable form. While there are reportedly some placeholder assets and missing bits and pieces, it’s said this unfinished build can be played online with other people. Absolutely horrific news for all involved.</p><p>People have been posting in-game footage of  the leaked game, although it looks as though publishers Focus are copyright striking it as fast as they can. However, a 47-minute Russian video I found shows the game running extremely smoothly, and looking extremely good. It has, if nothing else, got me hyped for the game’s official release.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076">Space Marine 2 Might End Up Being The Best Warhammer Game Ever</a></span></p><p>The original <em>Space Marine</em> was made by Relic, the studio behind <em>Company of Heroes </em>and <em>Homeworld. </em>In 2013, a sequel was in the works when the company became collateral damage in the miserable collapse of THQ. Almost a decade later, with the rights now in the hands of Focus Entertainment, the project was restarted by Saber in 2021, with footage first seen in 2022. By 2023 we learned of three-player co-op, and earlier this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076"><em>Kotaku</em> suggested it could be “the best <em>Warhammer</em> game ever.”</a></span></p><p><em>Insider Gaming</em> says it believes the leaked <em>Space Marine 2 </em>build is from February 23 this year. This obviously means it’s going to be months behind what Saber intends to release on September 9.</p><p>It’s also worth adding that leaked builds found online are fantastically likely to contain all manner of malware, added by those looking to take advantage of the situation, let alone all those who will mis-label absolutely anything else with the name of the game to lure in the gullible, giving even further reason not to consider downloading the leak. </p><p>While this must be devastating for all involved, it’s possible to take solace in the knowledge that historically, major leaks can offer enormous extra promotion for a game (I bet you’d forgotten <em>Space Marine 2</em> was coming in a couple of months). And when they’re as incredible-looking as what’s appearing in footage, even provide guerrilla advertising. I’m <em>certainly</em> going to be playing the released version come September 9, having glimpsed how good this looks.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1813203749973991561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thread on X</a>, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin revealed that Patch 1.2 is coming tomorrow, and also spoke about server updates for the game.</p>



<p>First, Rubin mentioned a server change designed to fix up matchmaking regions. In a series of replies to fan questions, they also elaborated on plans for future updates, including Patch 1.2. Rubin confirmed this new update will arrive sometime tomorrow.</p>



<p>One player asked about weapon updates “for nerfing and buffing different guns.” Rubin confirmed some are coming to XDefiant in Patch 1.2 tomorrow, and added “we have more coming in patch 1.3.” </p>



<p>They did not offer details about other changes coming to Patch 1.2. If some plans are already in place for 1.3, it might arrive sooner than later, but that is only speculation.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey all! We made a server change last night that may reduce the number of times you matchmake with a region that is not the one you are in. Let me know if you are still getting in games that are in a different region than your own. And if you do get a region that is not yours let…</p>— Mark Rubin (@PixelsofMark) <a href="https://twitter.com/PixelsofMark/status/1813203749973991561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Another fan asked about a server select option, as a potential addition to last night’s server fixes.</p>



<p>Rubin stated “that is something we are looking at,” but did not confirm plans to do so. They clarified there is “no eta at this time to know if/when we would add that.”</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Rubin also addressed concerns <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-executive-producer-addresses-spiderbot-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over the Spiderbot issues</a>. Ubisoft only just released Season 1 and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-season-1-patch-notes-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corresponding patch notes</a> this month.  Season 1 features the new Capture the Flag mode, more factions and maps, and more.</p>

<p>The developer also says that it's holding a closed beta test for Patch 7, which will begin on July 22nd ahead of the patch's full arrival in September. If you want to register for that beta, you just need to head over to the&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a> and request access.</p>

It's a delicious, delirious recipe–and one that composer Eli Rainsberry leaned into when concocting the tranquil, hazy score for Hollow Ponds' latest release, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This isn't Rainsberry's first rodeo. The IGF-nominated composer and sound artist previously cultivated the scores for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Saltsea Chronicles</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>No Longer Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Monster's Expedition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. For their latest opus, Rainsberry had to craft something both meditative and dynamic. A soundtrack that could embody the unpredictable verve of bird flight and the quiet serenity of a watercolor sunset.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer over email, they explain there are two signature soundscapes that comprise </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> musical palette. One was ambient and spacious, and the other was more upbeat and vibrant. It's a combination partly inspired by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> spiritual prequel, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hohokum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but Rainsberry was keen to avoid creating an obvious pastiche.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The ambient side of things was one of the very first things I explored as part of the process of developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> soundscape. I initially leant into more subtle, constant drones akin to the sort of works from Eno until we felt like we wanted to go more spacious, and letting things breathe where possible, ultimately aiming to figure out more of the sense of space, bedding the music more into the ambience," they explain.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I regularly bounced off feedback with the creative leads (Ricky Haggett, Dick Hogg), plus our sound designer (Dan Pugsley) who I collaborated closely for some of the music design and implementation. This was the first project I was on with that kind of collaboration since I tend to act as audio lead on most of my other projects. But I was pleased that during a lot of the time on production, there was music that I was able to compose first passes on that made it into the game with not much feedback, and to have that trust built up already–especially from after working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> before with Ricky and Dick–meant a lot to me, there."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A deliberate use of space and silence">A deliberate use of space and silence</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In scoring for the world of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">–a picturesque dreamscape filled with offbeat creatures–Rainsberry was adamant that players needed space. Their score should accentuate the landscape around players, not overshadow it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When I scored to support the world of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I wanted to make sure that there was a lot of space made to allow folks to take a breath in hearing the distant calls of these creatures, the ambiences of the trees, grass and streams. I think there’s power in how you use silence or at least quiet interludes when arranging music in a space like this," they note.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For each area of the world, I used different sets of synthesised textures and pads that I felt resonated with each space or [...] liked how they sounded against certain melodies that’d play in those areas. The Lupin Fields, for example, would feel a little different to the Grasslands with some textural and melodic changes, making sure they had different sonic identities.&nbsp;I also had a set of instruments that were more acoustic–stringed and plucky to layer on top. Having day and night cycles in the game, only the acoustic layers would phase out during the night."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rainsberry felt that blending electronic elements with woodwinds and strings would help layer in texture. The organic and synthetic swirling together to create a sound that feels both familiar and distinct–much like the myriad of creatures players will encounter in on their travels across the Uplands. It also pushed them outside of their comfort zone, with Rainsberry previously leaning more heavily on "purely electronic" sounds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I wanted to revisit my approach to writing for woodwinds and strings. My use of woodwinds, where you'd hear flute, clarinet and saxophone lines in places, felt somewhat 'on the nose' [...] for a game that’s about riding through the winds of fields and grasslands. [So] I used these predominantly for the rarer creature chase tracks and stings, where I thought it’d be a neat way to give each rarer creature, such as the Emperor Cosmet, a support for its voice and calls. I found that there was something quite earthy about woodwinds generally that made me want to try using that palette of instruments a lot more," they add.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Finding the right balance for came from experimenting between those textures and instruments, with some prioritizing of certain melodic woodwinds and any little arpeggiated patterns I tend to make. I’m also a sucker for reverbs and experimenting with the different ways my presets get processed (Valhalla's Vintage Reverb has been a big favourite for me recently, though Logic’s own Space Designer I still use), so I sometimes use them on select acoustic instruments and EQ/low pass in a way that sounds more close to a synth pad with extra texture. [This] helps bring a little balance for tracks with less synth instruments."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Comedic beats and electronic suites">Comedic beats and electronic suites</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is unashamedly laid back, but it also has heart and humor in abundance. Capturing the latter proved particularly challenging for Rainsberry, who admits they struggle with writing more comedic beats. "It's finding the timings of certain bits, making some sounds a little goofy while still considering the world we're in," they say, outlining the task at hand.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are moments in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where players will need to capture Burgling Bewls, pesky little creatures that have smuggled away some very important whistles. Apprehending those cheeky Bewls and collecting whistles allows players to attract new creatures and bolster their flock. It's a core part of the gameplay loop, but scoring those moments of lighthearted victory proved difficult.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When I struggle with these sorts of things, I always defer back to listening and watching references from other media that I enjoy to see if anything would resonate with what I’m doing, and maybe suit the humor of what I want to go for more," says Rainsberry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As someone who’s really into their animation (support The Animation Guild as they prepare to strike in the future by the way), I tend to watch those more for inspiration, especially shows like Adventure Time. I always admired how far out and abstract the music would go [in Adventure Time] while still remaining really funny to me. Its music would also be frequently something I'd listen to for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, Rainsberry decided to play around with sounds that some might perceive as too immature for game scores. It was a big swing, but one that helped capture the essence of those brazen Burgling Bewls. "I played around with instruments that’d typically be deemed as a little childish or goofy, some that’d pitch shift a little funny," they explain. "Xylophones can be cute and fun to create some little chromatic stings and riffs here and there. [...] For example, I synced some mouth pop-like sounds to when the Bewls steal those whistles during an early game cutscene."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing the more practical side of composition, Rainsberry explains the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> score relied heavily on a mix of instrument libraries such as Native Instruments' 'Massive' and 'Reaktor.'</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There was a fair bit of FM synthesis with NI's 'FM8' and u-He's 'Repro 5' too. Those two in particular were go-tos in terms of shaping that part of the sonic soundscape," they say. "Repro's instruments were great because I was able to tag and assign them as favourites to use for specific projects. I had a few to pick and expand on for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> especially, so they helped support some of my workflow that way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The other acoustic and woodwind instruments I used included Westwood Instruments' 'Untamed' suite, where the instruments recorded were more improvised and expressive. The higher the velocity raises, the more chaotic they get. That being said, I quite liked having them at a medium to low velocity since they still brought out breathy, murmured textures that I felt rested well against the synth pads I built up."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite their penchant for electronica, Rainsberry says they're a guitarist at heart and explains some of their acoustic recordings can be heard in tracks like 'To the Hilltop' and 'The Water Towers.' They also created sonic sketches on keyboard during production to help turn raw concepts into more tangible ideas. All of those building blocks were then assembled in Logic Pro, which Rainsberry explains "has always been how I've composed and arranged."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[Logic Pro] has always supported my workflow generally by letting me build a library of presets for each project," they continue. "I can just select them and either use them or work something else out from there. Part of the process for me generally is layering up different sounds, textures, and harmonies and hearing what works and compliments each other–it takes a bit of time and I feel like so much of my ‘writing’ is trialling and erroring different combinations of them, but I think it’s worth it for me in the long run, especially when it comes to the mixing and mastering stages."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They suggest their approach to mixing and mastering is still a work-in-progress, and says that with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> they tried Match EQing as close as possible to a handful of reference tracks.&nbsp;We suspect it's a sentiment most creative types can relate too. Perfection is always situated just beyond the veil, but in the case of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">blissfully understated yet soaring score, we think Rainsberry has come as close as you could probably get.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://elirainsberry.bandcamp.com/album/flock-ost">You can listen to Rainsberry's Flock score on Bandcamp</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p>In a new official <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/16/xbox-game-pass-july-2024-wave-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, Xbox announced the new wave of titles coming to Game Pass this week for July 2024, all of which are day-one releases.</p>



<p>Magical Delicacy and Flock both launched today and are available on Game Pass now. Xbox confirmed those <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2-more-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-july-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this month</a> with the first wave of games.

<figure></figure>







<p>The previous Game Pass wave of July 2024 titles offered several more options, including Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2. But fans often appreciate day one releases, and Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is a particular highlight.</p>

<p>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is a soulslike from A44 Games, and Dungeons of Hinterberg is a fantasy adventure from Microbird Games.</p>

However, any mention has now been scrubbed, with the service only available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. GTA+ coming to Switch would be somewhat surprising, since one of its main benefits is extras for GTA Online--which is part of GTA V, a game not available on Nintendo's system.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tower-of-fantasy-dev-reveals-neverness-to-everness-yet-another-gacha-rpg<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tower of Fantasy&nbsp;</em>publisher Perfect World and developer Hotta Studio have announced&nbsp;<em>Neverness to Everness</em>, another gacha RPG with an anime aesthetic that'll probably be asking you to dig deep into your wallet for its gacha element.</p>
<p>The game was revealed via both a cinematic trailer introducing its world and an extended gameplay trailer that demonstrates how it'll play. It turns out the answer to that second conundrum is "quite a lot like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a>, by the looks of things".</p>
<p>This one's got a distinctly&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>-style urban fantasy setting as well, and it revolves around a group of characters investigating Anomalies in the land of Helthereau.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neverness-to-everness-gacha-rpg-city-exploration.jpg?itok=mnWJjxmw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neverness-to-everness-gacha-rpg-city-exploration.jpg?itok=LCDMwXyu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Neverness to Everness&nbsp;</em>has a distinctly&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>flavor to it.</figcaption></figure><p>In the extended 13-minute gameplay trailer introducing&nbsp;<em>Neverness to Everness&nbsp;</em>(which Hotta Studio would like you to call&nbsp;<em>NTE</em>), you can see characters exploring an urban environment and interacting with the locals, as well as a few of the trippy&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghostwire-tokyo"><em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em></a>-style Anomalies you'll be investigating.</p>
<p>You can also see some combat, which looks fairly similar to HoYoverse's style; you'll be switching quickly between characters to build combos, and it looks like each character will have special abilities to take advantage of as well.</p>
<p>Rather unusually for an anime-style gacha game, you can also see characters floating down to street level from rooftops,&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham Knight&nbsp;</em>style, before hopping into cars to explore the rain-soaked streets of the city at night.</p>
<p>Here's the cinematic announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Neverness to Everness</em>.</p>

<p>If that trailer has piqued your interest, then I'd suggest checking out this 13-minute gameplay trailer as well, which shows off a wide range of different activities in&nbsp;<em>NTE</em>.</p>

<p>Both trailers conclude with a teaser for something more in September, so it sounds like we might get a release window - or, at least, a beta window - then. While you wait, you can check out the official&nbsp;<em>Neverness to Everness&nbsp;</em><a href="https://nte.perfectworld.com/concept0718/en/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> for more info.</p>

								<p><span>Back</span>  in 2005, a small firm offered a tantalizing vision of the future of computer keyboards.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>What if your keyboard was filled with tiny screens that showed you exactly what any given press would do, each built into a crystal-clear key? The keys would morph and shift as you needed, transforming from letters and numbers to full-color icons and app shortcuts, depending on what you were doing.
</p>


								<p>Readers and tech bloggers adored the idea. “It’s about time someone shook up this stagnant keyboard market,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050729090327/http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000740050460/">declared <em>Engadget</em></a>. “The concept is fantastic,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050829024522/http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/peripherals/input/index.php">wrote <em>Gizmodo</em></a>. <em>Slashdot </em><a href="https://slashdot.org/story/05/07/14/1335215/optimus-keyboard-with-oled-display-keys">lit up</a>.

								<p>The keyboard was just a concept, dreamed up by Art Lebedev, a Russian design firm, and it was an ambitious idea at that: called the Optimus Maximus, it would require over 100 built-in screens using display technology that wasn’t readily available at the time. With all the excitement, the firm decided to make it real.

								<p>The journey to create the Optimus Maximus would take years and end in multiple commercial failures. But Art Lebedev’s vision and the technology created along the way would live on and ultimately find widespread success —&nbsp;a success that’s been hidden inside another popular product: Elgato’s Stream Deck, a small desktop accessory covered in morphing, full-color keys.
</p>


								<p>By the time Elgato came to release its first Stream Deck in 2017, Art Lebedev’s Optimus keyboards had faded into history. But there’s more linking the two devices than a core idea. In fact, the Stream Deck hardware came from precisely the same company that developed the Optimus Maximus’ keys. In a very real sense, Art Lebedev’s work laid the foundations for what Elgato would go on to create.
</p>


							

			</div>
			<div>
								<p><span>In</span>  2010, Elgato was in “crisis mode.”&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>For around a decade, the German video capture company had been selling its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeTV">TV tuners</a> to people who wanted to watch and record live television via a connected computer. But by 2010, it was clear that the market for such devices was disappearing fast. On one side, broadcast TV was becoming increasingly encrypted, limiting what Elgato’s devices could do. On the other, the streaming revolution, led by Netflix and YouTube, was cutting out the humble TV tuner entirely.
</p>


								<p>“You’re on a sinking ship, you’ve got to figure out what you’re going to do,” recalls Elgato’s Julian Fest, whose parents originally founded the company in 1999.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Elgato started to take a hard look at its business, and it noticed one number that didn’t quite make sense.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Elgato knew how many TV tuners it had sold, but people had been registering far more copies of the company’s EyeTV recording software than its own customers would need. When it emailed those customers, it found out they were using a <em>rival</em> piece of hardware, the Hauppauge HD-PVR — and not to record broadcast TV. They were recording gameplay from their PlayStations to put up on YouTube. Right under Elgato’s nose was a new market opportunity.
</p>


			</div>
				<p><span>The market for online gameplay videos was poised to explode</span>
</p>
			<div>
								<p>Armed with over a decade’s worth of video encoding knowledge from its TV tuner days, a direct connection to Hauppauge’s customers, and Hauppauge’s own quarterly earnings reports to know just how many HD-PVRs it sold, Elgato decided to release a rival capture product specifically tailored to gamers. The result was the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/21/3034372/elgato-game-capture-hd-xbox-360-ps3-recording-announced">Game Capture HD</a>, released in 2012.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Three years later, when Fest took over as Elgato’s general manager, it seemed clear that the market for online gameplay videos was poised to explode. With Amazon acquiring the live streaming service Twitch for almost $1 billion in 2014, Fest was on the lookout for ways Elgato could double down. Perhaps it could offer a way to not just capture gameplay footage but also to help Twitch streamers control their broadcasts in the moment.
</p>


								<p>“If you looked at the state of Twitch and live streaming at the end of 2015, it was intriguing, but it was also kind of boring,” Fest tells <em>The Verge</em>. “Everybody’s stream was like, ‘Here’s my gameplay, here’s my webcam,’ and that’s it.” He figured that simplicity was because of all the different jobs a streamer has to handle during broadcasts: between playing the game, reading the chat, and entertaining an audience, it’d be difficult to <em>also</em> run a dynamic broadcast filled with changing layouts and eye-catching transitions.
</p>


								<p>Unless, Fest thought, there was a way to offer advanced broadcast controls without distracting a streamer from other tasks. The company found its answer in a <a href="https://youtu.be/oFqiNWyBnAo">popular German TV show</a> where the host had a so-called “nipple board” of buttons in front of him, built into a giant desk. “Every time you pressed one of these buttons, it would play a funny clip that his team had found on TV,” Fest recalls. The team wondered if Elgato could use a similar array of buttons to control a livestream.
</p>


								<p>Elgato had its idea — now, it needed to find the right buttons to make it a reality.&nbsp;
</p>


							

			</div>
			<div>
								<p><span>Art</span>  Lebedev had never intended to make a massive splash in the keyboard business. Timur Burbaev, who served as the keyboard’s industrial designer, tells <em>The Verge</em> that the initial idea came about shortly after he joined in 2003. The keyboard was just meant to be a concept, similar to its <a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/lavatrix/">Lavatrix washing machine</a>, to show off the studio’s design chops and drum up more business in the free time between projects.
</p>


								<p>In July 2005, the company released a <a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/concept/">series of concept images</a> of what it called the “Optimus keyboard.” It had the same basic layout as a full-size computer keyboard but with a twist: “Every key of the Optimus keyboard is a stand-alone display showing exactly what it is controlling at this very moment,” the website still reads. 
</p>


			</div>
		<div>
			<div>
				
				<p><span>A decade before the Stream Deck, the Art Lebedev Optimus keyboard convincingly imagined screens beneath keys.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				
				<p><span>The vision was an entire keyboard that could visibly change each key’s function to match your chosen app.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				
				<p><span>The concept called for 123 individual OLED screens; the final Optimus Maximus shipped with 113.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				
				<p><span>Even today, these renders look surprisingly real thanks to the pixelated imperfections visible in each key.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		
			<div>
								<p>One image shows how the keys could change to show an array of Photoshop tools; another shows dedicated controls for <em>Quake.</em> (This was 2005, after all.) On the left edge of the keyboard are macro keys that can be programmed to open specific programs, illustrated with a series of delightfully 2005-era logos like Internet Explorer and QuickTime. Although the images are renders rather than real photographs, the close-ups make an effort to show individual pixels present on the screens of the keys, a small imperfection that provides a tantalizing hint of reality. Nearly two decades later, the imaginary device still looks fantastic.
</p>


								<p>It was hard to ignore the amount of interest the design was getting. The team called an emergency meeting to discuss. “Back then, we just realized that if you get such a positive response, then let’s risk it and just produce it,” Burbaev says. It was “a clear indication” that the team should try and make it for real. The long and difficult journey of producing what would become the Optimus Maximus had begun. “No one imagined how much time and energy and especially investment it would take,” Burbaev says.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>A big early decision was working out what kind of screen technology to use. The first iPod with a color display had only just been released, and the iPhone had yet to make its debut. Candybar-style phones like the Nokia 1110 and Motorola C139 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_mobile_phones">reigned supreme</a>. Art Lebedev thought LCD screens of the era were too dim and offered terrible black levels, while E Ink screens had terrible response times and no backlighting at all. OLED seemed like the best choice.
</p>


								<p>But this was long before OLED displays were routinely shipping in mainstream smartwatches, smartphones, and TVs. “The problem with OLED displays was that you could potentially find such a small OLED display in 2006 but a) it would cost you a fortune and b) it would have a massive resolution,” Burbaev says. They were meant for military users to show tactical information like maps on tiny screens, not <em>Quake</em> icons on a keyboard. 
</p>


			</div>
				<p><span>“Finally we realized there is no other option than to make our own matrix for the display.” - Timur Burbaev</span>
</p>
			<div>
								<p>Art Lebedev decided its “only option” was to dive headfirst into the OLED display business. Burbaev believes his was one of the first companies to ship a product with these kinds of small, low-cost, low-resolution OLED screens. Doing so involved placing what Burbaev describes as a “very strange” order with a Taiwanese manufacturer with some prior experience. He adds that two managers from Art Lebedev ended up living in Taiwan for half a year while they were being made.
</p>


								<p>Not only did Art Lebedev need to find screens small enough to fit under each of its keys but it also needed to find a way for them to coexist with keys that you could actually type on. The final keyboard ended up being a bit of a fudge: the screens didn’t actually move. Instead, the company built a moving plastic keycap that moved <em>around</em> each screen. But even this solution had its challenges, Burbaev says. This plastic keycap needed to not only be transparent enough to show the display but also tinted enough to not reveal the ugly inner mechanism of each screen and durable enough to withstand scratches.
</p>


								<p>All of this meant the development process for the Optimus Maximus was long and difficult, and <em>Wired </em>featured the keyboard not <a href="https://www.wired.com/2006/12/vaporware-06-return-of-the-king/">once</a> but <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/01/ye-vaporware/?slide=7&amp;slideView=2">twice</a> in its annual vaporware roundups. Art Lebedev was unusually open about the troubled development process, cataloging its progress making the keyboard <a href="https://optimus-project.livejournal.com/">on a LiveJournal blog</a>. We’re used to receiving such updates in an era of Kickstarter and crowdfunding, but the approach felt novel at the time — and it shows just how slowly development went. It took months just to arrive on a keycap design, <a href="https://optimus-project.livejournal.com/3161.html">studying various possibilities</a> along the way. The company’s first OLED manufacturer <a href="https://optimus-project.livejournal.com/25029.html">went bust</a> before managing to deliver its pricy $10 keys, forcing Art Lebedev to hunt down a new Taiwanese supplier.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Finally, after years of development, hundreds of preorders, and dozens upon dozens of blog posts and concept images hyping up every aspect of the idea, the Optimus Maximus began shipping <a href="https://optimus-project.livejournal.com/53878.html">in February 2008</a>.
</p>


			</div>
		<div>
	
	<p><span>A diagram shows how Art Lebedev’s keys compare to normal laptop and desktop keyboard keys. The Maximus key has a gem-faceted prism of a lens surrounding its screen, while the Popularis key is simply a lens.</span>
</p></div>

		
			<div>
								<p>What was this legendary keyboard actually like to use? In a word: “Terrible.”
</p>


								<p>“Let’s put it this way, we sit around and type all day long and this thing wore us out in about 30 seconds to a minute,” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-02-22-optimus-maximus-at-long-last-we-bring-one-home-to-test.html"><em>Engadget</em> wrote after its first few weeks of testing</a>. “The Optimus Maximus is terrible for touch-typing,” <a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/optimus-maximus-review/"><em>CNET</em> concurred in its July 2008 review</a>, noting that “the tightly packed keys make for lots of mistaken presses, and the mushy responsiveness slows down your words per minute.” In 2018, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj7GYU-wedo">retro keyboard YouTuber Chyrosran22</a> called the keys “fishy fuck nuggets with a capital F” that are “extremely terrible” to type on.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>These are issues that would be hard to forgive on <em>any</em> keyboard, but the Optimus Maximus also carried a $1,600 price tag in 2008 (north of $2,200 in today’s money). At that price, it had to be perfect, and the reality was far from it.
</p>


			</div>
			<div>
								<p>So Art Lebedev came up with another, cheaper way to make screen-filled keys work: one big screen. In 2012, it released the Optimus Popularis, a more compact keyboard that placed one large LCD display under all its transparent keys, with no need for any individual OLED screens or mechanical switches underneath. Instead, you’d type on <em>lenses</em> that would activate the keyboard’s single large screen, with each lens held floating in place by an aluminum frame. This basic idea is the key to every LCD keyboard we’ve seen since, from the Elgato Stream Deck to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/10/2697370/razers-touchscreen-star-wars-the-old-republic-keyboard-hands-on">Razer’s discontinued Switchblade UI</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23518440/finalmouse-centerpiece-mechanical-keyboard-screen-features-price">the Finalmouse Centerpiece</a>.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Yet fundamental problems remained. Not only was Art Lebedev’s new keyboard only slightly cheaper (it still <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/Optimus-Keyboard-LCD-Screens,14365.html">cost north of $1,000</a>) but also the Optimus Popularis was an absolute pig to type on. Art Lebedev was kind enough to send one to us for the purposes of this story, and we had ambitions to write this entire piece on the Popularis. But after half an hour, we gave up. It was a struggle getting the keyboard to register keypresses in the first place. Its space bar, in particular, is a nightmare that refuses to actuate unless you press it firmly enough in exactly the right spot, which is nearly impossible if you want to type at any sort of speed.
</p>


						
								<p>Even in 2024, in an era of phones that are not just smart but that can <em>literally fold in half</em>, we still find ourselves wishing Art Lebedev had been able to deliver on its 2005 concept images. It’s a really beautiful idea with huge amounts of promise. But even if Art Lebedev never truly delivered, it did a lot of the vital iteration to get there.
</p>


							

			</div>
			<p><span>Four</span>  years after the Optimus Popularis’ failure, a strikingly similar gadget appeared on Indiegogo. The “Infinitton” contained just 15 individually customizable LCD keys, much like another old Art Lebedev concept dubbed the <a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/aux/">Optimus Aux</a>. But this time, gadget lovers didn’t praise the idea to high heaven — the keypad missed its first crowdfunding goal of $30,000 and barely made that money a year later on Kickstarter.
</p>

</div>

		
			<div>
								<p>But for Taiwanese manufacturer iDisplay, the Infinitton was far from a disappointment — it was a decade-old idea finally paying off.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>That’s because iDisplay was <em>the company</em> that built those OLED and LCD keys for Art Lebedev all those years ago, the Russian design firm and Elgato both confirmed to <em>The Verge</em>. It never stopped working on them. “The success of Optimus Maximus kept me interested to continue the research and development of the built-in screen keys,” iDisplay cofounder Jen Wen Sun tells us via translated email. By 2017, he’d racked up over a dozen patents on the tech and says he sold the screens into broadcast equipment, airplanes, and cars along the way.
</p>


								<p>The company was originally formed in 1998 and worked on <a href="https://www.idisplay.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E5%8D%80%E5%9F%9F-79-%E8%A4%87%E6%9C%AC-5@3x.png">buttons for the gambling industry</a>, he tells us, surviving off small-scale R&amp;D projects while he kept trying to sell casinos on his push-button screens. Casino owner Bally’s was once interested, he says, but a deal never panned out.
</p>


								<p>Back in Germany, the Infinitton caught the attention of Elgato’s Julian Fest, who was researching how to turn his screen-equipped streaming controller idea into a reality. “As we’re thinking about this controller, this crowdfunding campaign comes out and we’re looking at this box and we’re like ‘Oh, this is perfect. We need to talk to these guys,’” Fest recalls.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>By the time Elgato started talking to iDisplay, the Taiwanese company had already solved many of the hardware challenges needed to turn a thousand dollar-plus keyboard into a relatively affordable $149 computer accessory. It could use small off-the-shelf screens similar to what you might find in a car’s infotainment system. And iDisplay had a simpler job on its hands crafting the Stream Deck’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23706779/stream-deck-pop-bubbles-bubbledeck">bubble wrap-esque button feel</a> because it didn’t have to worry about people needing to type at 50-plus words per minute. That feel had been crafted before Elgato ever touched it.
</p>

					<span></span>
					<span>A tiny company named iDisplay was behind the Optimus keys; it tried to go it alone with this Kickstarter and Indiegogo project.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				
				<p><span>April 2017</span>
					<span>The Stream Deck arrives</span>
					<span></span>
					<span>Elgato took the Infinitton, turned it on its side, and built the software to make it a streamer’s delight.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		
			<div>
								<p>Elgato essentially turned the Infinitton into the Stream Deck. That first Stream Deck, Fest says, “was really just on a hardware level an iteration of what these guys did.” Look at the original Stream Deck next to the Infinitton, and the resemblance is clear; it’s the same three-by-five grid of buttons turned on its side and with a new housing. “We tried to keep it as simple as possible,” Fest says.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>The way Fest describes it, the main thing Elgato brought to the table when it started working with iDisplay was focus. In its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2086416348/infinitton-a-smart-touch-screen-keyboard/description">Kickstarter campaign for the Infinitton</a>, iDisplay pitched the accessory to anyone and everyone. It was for designers, traders, and musicians. It was for architects, engineers, and programmers. It was for video designers and photographers and business professionals.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>In contrast, Elgato knew exactly who it wanted its Stream Deck to be for: streamers. It held a six-month private beta to collect feedback from its intended users, and it poured a lot of effort into making sure the device integrated nicely with OBS, the industry-standard streaming software. “The big new component then was building software that was tailor made for live streamers,” Fest says. “What we did is we took something existing and just repositioned it for an audience that actually understood and appreciated what this thing could do.”
</p>


			</div>
				<p><span>Elgato turned a Kickstarter project into a streamer’s tool</span>
</p>
			<div>
								<p>That’s not to say Elgato didn’t have any challenges to overcome while developing the Stream Deck with iDisplay. Fest says a big one was ensuring that the Stream Deck could not only send information to a computer but also receive it back and show it to the user. Without being able to stay in sync like this, the Stream Deck risked being the glorified macro pad that critics claimed it was. “If you fire off a hotkey, you don’t know if that action succeeded,” Fest says. “What we wanted to ensure is that if you change a scene in OBS you can clearly see on your device [that] that scene is now active and the other one is not. Or if you mute yourself, you’re muted, and we can guarantee that you’re muted because we’re talking natively to OBS.”
</p>


								<p>The approach worked. iDisplay had sold just a few hundred units of its Infinitton via its crowdfunding campaigns, but the Stream Deck quickly became a staple of the Twitch streamer’s toolkit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/17/15327118/elgato-stream-deck-release-amazon">after its release in 2017</a>. A year later, <a href="https://www.corsair.com/newsroom/press-release/corsair-to-acquire-elgato-gaming">Corsair acquired Elgato</a> for an undisclosed sum — and in 2022, <a href="https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-acquires-majority-ownership-taiwan-based-electronics">it bought iDisplay</a>, locking down its LCD keys.
</p>


								<p>Other companies have taken notice. In 2022, Razer introduced the Stream Controller, and a year after that, competing PC accessory manufacturer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/18/23798716/logitech-loupedeck-acquisition-announcement">Logitech snatched up Loupedeck</a>, which had worked with Razer on the rival streaming accessory.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Much like when it morphed its TV tuner into a game recorder, Elgato developed an audience for a technology rather than the other way around. It had been the missing piece of the puzzle since the beginning. But ironically, the audience for the Stream Deck has since expanded almost as wide as the one iDisplay hoped would embrace the Infinitton.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Fest says he knows of Stream Decks being used in the hundreds by organizations ranging from call centers to police dispatcher services. The UK’s Virgin Atlantic airline <a href="https://www.elgato.com/eu/it/s/virgin-atlantic">uses dozens of Stream Decks</a> to simplify communications with pilots and air traffic controllers. Even SpaceX was an early customer, Fest says. (SpaceX did not respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.) The simple genius of the Stream Deck is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23703402/stream-deck-button-of-the-month">that it made LCD keys <em>peripheral</em></a>, useful for anything where you need a button that dynamically advertises what it’s doing.

			In this 3D animation, the original Optimus keyboard concept and the Stream Deck play a game of digital ping-pong across the entirety of their key-covered screens.
		</p>
</div>

		
			<div>
								<p><span>Art</span>  Lebedev was right about one thing: there was indeed a market of people prepared to pay top dollar for premium-quality keyboards. But in retrospect, the Russian design studio bet that the market would go in the opposite direction of the one it actually went in. Instead of a software-based future filled with screens, keyboards embraced <em>hardware</em>, rediscovering mechanical key switches that had been around since the ’80s. Users began fixating on typing feel, seeking out tactile switches and clacky keycaps. The many compromises of LCD keys might have been too much to ask.
</p>


								<p>But Elgato didn’t need to find a balance between typing feel and screen because its Stream Deck aimed to complement a traditional keyboard, rather than replace it. “Everybody has opinions on how Stream Deck’s keys feel. Some absolutely love it. Some say it’s way too mushy. But for everybody, it’s usable,” Fest says. You can forgive a key that feels mushy if you only need to press it to mute yourself while streaming.
</p>


								<p>Which is not to say there’s no space for the kind of screen-based design that Art Lebedev and iDisplay worked to create. The gaming accessories company Finalmouse appears to be banking on exactly that with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23518440/finalmouse-centerpiece-mechanical-keyboard-screen-features-price">forthcoming Centerpiece keyboard</a>, which draws on the single-screen approach of the Popularis but combines it with a set of actual mechanical switches — translucent ones — to retain the feel of a mechanical keyboard.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Like the Optimus Maximus, the Centerpiece has already blown past its first promised ship dates and is entering the vaporware realm. But if it does arrive, perhaps function and form will finally be aligned.
</p>


								<p>As for Art Lebedev, it doesn’t consider the Optimus keyboard a failure. “You could argue how successful the project was in terms of return on investment,” Burbaev says, telling us how much business it drummed up for the studio even a decade later. Sometimes a new client would admit that they, too, were fixated by those concept images back when they were a kid.

			<p>Today, Larian Studios <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4240783699885624491" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> the 28th Baldur's Gate 3 community update. It's largely focused on the upcoming Update 7, which is due in September. To start with, local co-op players will be excited to learn of the arrival of dynamic split-screen. This new feature allows the screen to merge when characters are near each other, removing the annoying split. You can glimpse an example below.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-might-be-about-to-get-honor-mode-difficulty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honor Mode</a> difficulty setting is getting more challenging, too. The bulette, Malus Thorm, and a few githyanki (Ch'r'ai Tska'an, Ch'r'ai Har'rak, and Ptaris) will receive additional Legendary Actions. Moreover, Dror Ragzlin will now also be able to use a new spell called Arachnid Compulsion to rally the spiders that reside in the nearby pit to fight you.</p>
<p>Patch 7's headline feature for Baldur's Gate 3 players who enjoy evil playthroughs might just be the addition of several cinematics for evil endings. But there are also plenty of fixes and improvements in general for all Origin characters:</p>
<p><em>This update will also see improvements made to some cinematics, endgame dialogues, and Origin characters - specifically things like clipping issues, a couple of broken triggers for quests, dialogues, and romances, the odd case of retrograde amnesia, and persistent exclamation marks.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, and the Blade of Frontiers will no longer absent-mindedly swing his sword mere inches from the aorta of shorter races who try to recruit him.</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, party banter will now work not only in single player but also when playing Baldur's Gate 3 in cooperative multiplayer mode. Of course, Patch 7 will also bring the public release of the modding tools ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-closed-alpha-starts-today-with-beta-in-july-and-release-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned September launch</a>. Anyone interested in checking out Patch 7's Closed Beta can sign up for the playtest directly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Steam page</a>. Players will be randomly selected ahead of the CBT's start, slated for July 22.</p>
<p>Larian saved the most surprising tidbit for last: Patch 7 won't be, despite what we had assumed, the last major update for Baldur's Gate 3. The studio is still working on major features like crossplay and a photo mode, not to mention further gameplay tweaks, quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and performance optimizations.</p>
<p>In other news, read how Baldur's Gate 3's countless awards won <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-won-so-many-awards-that-it-caused-larian-a-few-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly hampered Larian's workload.</a></p>

<p>Patch 7 will feature a dynamic split screen mode, “several new cinematics” for evil endings, a variety of fixes, and the anticipated modding toolkit.</p>



<p>Larian <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-will-add-modding-in-september-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a> that Patch 7 will release sometime in September 2024, with a Closed Beta coming this month.

<p>Registration for the Closed Beta is now open, and randomly selected registrants will gain access to the playtest.</p>

<p>Many fans believed that the addition of mod support would likely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-likely-the-games-last-major-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mark the final major patch</a> for Baldur’s Gate 3. </p>



<p>However, Larian Studios just confirmed that “Patch 7 won’t be the final update for Baldur’s Gate 3.” The devs added that “we still have a few things up our sleeve.” </p>



<p>Some of the features to follow Patch 7 will include “crossplay and a photo mode.” There will also be “gameplay tweaks and quality-of-life improvements to bug fixes and performance optimizations.”</p>



<p>However, Larian Studios has made it clear that it still plans to move on from Baldur’s Gate 3.

<p>Pokemon Sleep, the sleep-tracking app, has reached a significant milestone, completing its first year.

Obtain enough points and you can call in a scorestreak. More effective scorestreaks cost more points. For example, in Black Ops Cold War, the Combat Bow cost 500 points. The Chopper Gunner, however, costs 8,000 points.</p><p>In Black Ops Cold War, Treyarch’s last Black Ops game, score carries over even after you die. But in <a href="https://youtu.be/KMFDkQ_5m1U?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the inaugural episode of the COD POD</a>, Treyarch’s associate director of design Matt Scronce confirmed this system was ditched for Black Ops 6, which reverts to a more traditional scorestreak system in which score resets on death.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>But perhaps the more significant change for Black Ops 6 is that it does not feature what are called ‘looping streaks.’ Looping streaks means you can continue to earn your streaks over and over again within the same life, if you don’t die. So, once you’ve earned your three streaks, you don’t have to die to reset them. You can continue to loop through them if you don’t die within the same life.</p><p>Scronce confirmed that in Black Ops 6, scorestreaks do not loop. His explanation is that this change, in combination with score resetting on death, helps avoid the ‘scorestreak spam’ some players hate in Call of Duty.</p><p>“We’re going back to a traditional scorestreak system,” Scronce said. “Score will reset on death. Right now scorestreaks do not loop. That was something we talked about quite a bit. Really the goal there is we want to reward players in a single life fairly, with high-end rewards, or low-end depending on your selection.</p><p>“But we really want to avoid scorestreak spam. That’s something I personally just really don’t like. I know a lot of players don’t like it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This confirmation has sparked a debate within the Call of Duty community about the rights and wrongs of streak looping. Some players, particularly high-skill players, do enjoy it because it helps them dominate a match.</p><p>The argument goes that ditching streak looping for Black Ops 6 artificially holds back high-skill players players from dominating a match because without looping streaks, once high-skill players earn their top streak, they may as well kill themselves so they can work towards earning it again. (Unless they’re going for a nuke, but that’s extremely rare.)</p><p>The counter-argument is that, as Scronce says, such a change helps avoid scorestreak spam, which can be extremely annoying to face in a match. There are all sorts of sub-arguments within this debate that get to the very heart of Call of Duty multiplayer. Do fewer streaks in a match make for a better or more boring experience? Should high-skill players be rewarded for their high-skill play at the expense of others?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We really want to avoid scorestreak spam. That’s something I personally just really don’t like. I know a lot of players don’t like it.</p></div><p>Treyarch has made its position clear, although the wording of Scronce’s statement (“right now scorestreaks do not loop”) suggests there may be wiggle room, depending on feedback. Speaking of feedback, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-confirmed">we finally have the Call of Duty Black Ops 6 beta dates</a>, set to arrive ahead of the game’s launch in October.</p><p>Black Ops 6 is the first mainline Call of Duty to launch straight into Xbox Game Pass, following Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-a-hot-topic-as-microsoft-hikes-xbox-game-pass-prices">But the Game Pass tiers are getting more expensive and more complicated</a> — with Black Ops 6 at the heart of the changes.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

That's in part because it was only just a few months ago in February that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-offering-college-athletes-600-to-appear-in-new-football-game/1100-6521289/" data-ref-id="1100-6521289">EA signed Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals with college athletes for the game</a>. In the time since, EA created "thousands of player likenesses" for the game, and also processed the "massive volume of reference materials" sent to the developer from the 134+ participating FBS schools.</p>

<p>"Certain schools like Stanford, Western Michigan, and Jacksonville State will show with outdated logos, and a small subset of players will have missing or incorrect likenesses initially," EA said, noting that it will attempt to addresses the issues as quickly as possible.</p><p>In total, College Football 25 features about 11,390 real players, along with 5,000 or so player models for coaches, fans, and created players, totalling more than 16,000 character models. EA said it was "never going to be a viable option" to create the characters manually by scanning them all into the game.</p><p>Instead, EA used a machine learning toolset to create the character models. EA inputted "hundreds" of head shapes, hairstyles, skin tones, complexions, beards, and brows into the model. Using this data, along with a single reference photo of the athlete or coach in question, EA said it was able to create the player likenesses in the game.</p><p>EA has also confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-team-builder-isnt-live-at-launch/1100-6524983/" data-ref-id="1100-6524983">the TeamBuilder mode won't be available at launch</a>, and will be released at some point later on. Like EA's other sports games, players can expect regular updates to the game that will deliver new features, as well as fixes and other improvements.</p><p>College Football 25 is available now through the $100 deluxe edition or via the 10-hour trial available to EA Play subscribers. The game launches for everyone else on July 19.</p><p>According to the in-game player-counter, College Football 25 had <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FGameOverGreggy%2Fstatus%2F1813066685320175793&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fcollege-football-25-will-have-inaccuracies-at-launch-ea-says%2F1100-6524998%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 619,000 concurrent players on July 15.</a> The game kicked off EA's annual sports-game release schedule, with Madden NFL 25 to follow in August, and then FC 25 in September, followed by the presumed release of NHL 25 in October. EA's sports games are popular in their own right, and they also bring in money beyond the initial purchase price through their lucrative Ultimate Team modes.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/" data-ref-id="1100-6523506">College Football 25 preorder guide.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-local-legends-review-legendary-bar-stories<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For many TTRPG groups, the campaign opens with the phrase, “you all meet at a tavern.” It's a quick and easy way to establish tone and group dynamics while introducing players to low-stakes challenges. It's a cliché that is at the heart of <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em>. A series of products all about helping bring personality and style to various fantasy watering holes.</p>
<h2>What is in <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em>?</h2>
<p><em>Epic Encounter: Local Legends</em> is a spin-off product of Steamforged Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/epic-encounters-preview" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Epic Encounters</em></a> boxes. It is made up of two different sets, which use the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> Fifth Edition</em> ruleset.&nbsp; The main set is the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Tavern Kit. It contains three books detailing ten different fantasy taverns, 60 unique NPCs that make up both staff and clientele, ten tavern maps, ten playmats, and a deck of cards printed with quick references. The second set is the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Encounter boxes. These contain miniatures, stat blocks, and battle maps for encounters hinted at in the Tavern Kit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-tavern-kit-contents.jpg?itok=8Ae1AsvH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-tavern-kit-contents.jpg?itok=isqUuQ0U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>GMs, the heavy lifting has been done for you.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Helpful is the GM material in the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Tavern Kit?</h2>
<p>When starting a fantasy TTRPG campaign, a tavern does a lot of atmospheric heavy lifting. It covers many important world-building details and can set the tone of an entire campaign. Are the patrons friendly or defensive? Is the atmosphere rustic, austere, luxurious, or seedy? What happens when patrons get rowdy?</p>
<p>For veteran players, these details can be taken for granted. After a while, cultural shorthand is developed and everyone at the table locks in. But for new players, making a compelling tavern experience can be bland and forgettable at best, or non-existent at worst.</p>
<p>The ten different establishments in the Tavern Kit do a fantastic job covering its bases. Warm, rural inns packed with ale, pipe smoke, and hearty stew. Shady suburban retreats where clients come to coordinate heists and fence stolen goods that also happen to serve excellent bread. Dens of vice packed with well-dressed temptations of flesh and chemical escapes. Bloodstained fight pits where patrons drink, fight, and place bets. The list goes on.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-tavern-descriptions.jpg?itok=5KsNsqAE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-tavern-descriptions.jpg?itok=twaYh3Vo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sensory info helps set a scene at a table. And each tavern sets the scene masterfully.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, people provide personality to a place. Every tavern has six NPCs with distinct personalities and attitudes.&nbsp; Each entry also has rewards and punishments for conversing with them alongside modifiers to the persuasion DC. These aren't background extras, but they don't completely overshadow the players' antics; a perfect balancing act for a TTRPG supporting cast.</p>
<p>My favorite inclusion in the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Tavern Kit are various games that can be played at each tavern. Generally, the games are light variations on parlor games – one is effectively <em>Blackjack </em>with dice rolls. They work great for establishing a theme and give players something to spend their gold on.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Tavern Kit's Inncounters Book gives GMs the tools to set up conflict at these establishments. They include dealing with drunken patrons up to getting into a bar brawl. The rules presented lean more into light cinematic presentation than tactical play, swinging on chandeliers, setting things on fire, a giant bruiser showing up, etc., which keeps things light and breezy.</p>

<p>Generally, the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> Encounter boxes provide small, compact battles. Each encounter has about 4-5 miniatures and one battle map. In addition, the contained booklet includes adventure hooks and modifiers to keep things exciting.</p>
<p>On their own, these encounter boxes are packed with variety and delight. With the Tavern Kit, they become a wonderful jumping-off point for a new TTRPG campaign.</p>
<p>Because of this, expressing the quality of all eight boxes in the set in a single review is a major task. Thankfully fellow dice goblin,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/author/giaco-furino">Giaco Furino</a>, and I delved into that dungeon together as a team. Here are our thoughts.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-owlbear-miniatures.jpg?itok=rcrGcZ_p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-owlbear-miniatures.jpg?itok=vmH8wYLs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>An Owlbear Was Sighted... Setting Traps?</h2>
<p><em>From Tyler:</em> Those who watched the <em>D&amp;D</em> movie,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-adaptation-that-understands-its-roots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em></a>,&nbsp;know just how powerful Owlbears can be and according to whispers in the Nodding Dragon tavern, one is actively hunting and terrorizing local hunters.</p>
<p>This is curious since Owlbears generally aren't intelligent. But this one has dug traps, set up ambushes, and has been seen using magic.</p>
<p>This encounter is a great mix of boss battle and mystery story. What is going on with this Owlbear? How can the player stop it? Throw in a river hazard and some unexpected bursts of magic to the arena and you have a memorable forest brawl.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-wraith-miniatures.jpg?itok=uxRbWT6k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-wraith-miniatures.jpg?itok=2KleHS7t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Descend Into A Wraith's Dungeon Lair</h2>
<p><em>From Tyler</em>: For fans of spooky ghosts, the Wraith Encounter has you covered. Patrons at The Silver Purse gambling parlor have reported seeing a mysterious ghost-like entity. Those who see it report sickness and memory loss. These coincide with rumors that The Silver Purse was built on a forgotten temple.</p>
<p>The central gimmick is a ghostly encounter combined with a dungeon maze. Enemies use the Frightened condition to push adventurers into the maze's traps and keep them away from potentially helpful items.</p>
<p>The Wraith encounter is my favorite encounter box in the set. It delivers an atmospheric setpiece, puts a novel spin on a classic <em>D&amp;D</em> concept, and presents it all as an elaborate combat puzzle.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-ghost-pirate-miniatures.jpg?itok=R2H356Lu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-local-legends-ghost-pirate-miniatures.jpg?itok=UaOUVXPA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Ghost Pirates Aren't Just After Your Gold, But Your Lives</h2>
<p><em>From Tyler:</em> For those who want a more nautical spin on a vengeful spirit, the Ghost Pirate Encounter is for you.</p>
<p>It is a familiar tale in the Salt &amp; Kraken tavern. A pirate captain seeks new crewmates. Except that captain has been dead for thirty years. Worse still, the people he recruits either show up years later barely alive at best, and dead at worst.</p>
<p>Generally, it is a solid swashbuckling encounter, if by the numbers. The arena is packed with environmental hazards and magical mist which can break caster's sightlines and keep martial classes on their toes. Not to mention the captain and his crew go after whoever has the most gold. Do with that what you will.</p>

<p><em>From Tyler:</em> The Night Hag encounter may be the most deceptively cosmic encounter in the set. It involves the titular hag setting up an elaborate ritual in the leyline-infused Adventurer's Rest tavern. If she is not stopped, she can tap into an infinite well of magic in its foundation and transcend to godhood.</p>
<p>This is an ambitious encounter against a CR 7 monster that low-level parties might not be prepared for. There is a clever environmental mechanic where characters can interrupt the ritual and buff casters, players can also take out the Hag's minions, permanently reducing her maximum HP.</p>
<p>It's an encounter that would be right at home in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/planescape-adventures-in-multiverse-review-player-options-still-disappoint" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Planescape</em></a> campaign and fits with the whimsical high-fantasy vibe of The Adventurer's Rest tavern. If you like your fantasy stories bold and bombastic, pick this up.</p>

<p><em>From Giaco</em>: Of the four Local Legends mini-encounters I received for review, this Green Dragon encounter might be one of my favorites (even if it is the “easiest” encounter of the group). Tied to the Huntsman’s Stag tavern as seen in the Tavern Kit, this adventure begins with food going missing from the inn’s larders, large footprints on the central table, and tales from exhausted hunters who can’t find “the green devil.”</p>
<p>That green devil is the titular Green Dragon of this encounter, a juvenile dragon who wants nothing more than to get a bite to eat and play innocent pranks on anyone who would hunt for it. As adventurers in this mini encounter, the goal is - first and foremost - to find the Green Dragon as it hides among Mangrove trees! And from there, it’ll swoosh and fly around the battle map, nipping at characters playfully and trying to knock them into the murky, cold, stagnant water of the Mangroves.</p>
<p>Fun and full of personality, this (potentially) combat light mini encounter delivers on the promise of these box sets - to surprise, delight, and inspire GM’s and players alike!</p>

<p><em>From Giaco</em>: For this Local Legends mini encounter, much like the Green Dragon encounter, this one’s not an out-and-out fight. Banjo the Hill Giant (great name) has made a nice little life for himself harassing the miners working in the pioneer town and frequenting the Draughty Rabbit tavern.</p>
<p>The fun twist on this mini encounter is how the Hill Giant uses the natural world around him. Once players track him down and find him standing at the top of his hill, he’ll continually roll giant boulders down the hill at them - inflicting some serious damage if they collide. It’s not until the adventurers schlep their way up the hill that the true fight begins, with Banjo trying to smash them with a giant bag filled with treasures.</p>
<p>Evocative and inventive, this is another Local Legends mini-encounter that feels much more memorable than a simple fight. It’s not really about squaring off against Banjo, it’s about avoiding his boulders and traps!</p>

<p><em>From Giaco:</em> This Local Legends mini encounter centers around the Shady Nook tavern and the local thieves guild that frequents the town. Drawn out by grief and suffering, this mini encounter features a fiend known as the Diaemus and the giant bats it calls down to attack the adventurers once they lure it out.</p>
<p>Of all the adventures I received, this one is - for me - the least compelling. Though there’s a bit of story to be pulled from the fact that this creature feeds on fear and despair, overall this isn’t much more than a rooftop battle. The miniature is nice, but other than that this one doesn’t truly break the mold like the others we’ve checked out.</p>

<p><em>From Giaco:</em> With a challenge rating of 11, the Efreet at the center of this Local Legends mini-encounter is by far the most challenging of the four I’ve checked out and it has one of the most interesting, closed-space encounters as well!</p>
<p>Taking place in the illicit but well-heeled Velvet Dreams tavern, the Efreet was summoned long ago and is stuck here. One of my favorite moments in any of these guidebooks is the suggestion that this Efreet was perhaps summoned by an intoxicated magic user who eventually sobered up and… forgot to banish the Efreet!</p>
<p>What a great concept, and now this terribly powerful and terribly angry genie is out for blood! With an incredible miniature and a truly difficult combat encounter within, this could easily have been expanded into a larger Epic Encounters box set -- but I really appreciate that it’s been kept contained within this easy-to-run, approachable box.</p>

<p>If you're brand new to GM'ing or dread creating interesting, bespoke taverns and inns, I highly recommend the <em>Epic Encounters: Local Legends</em> products. The Tavern Kit is a great resource for those behind the GM screen, and the encounter boxes are fantastic for providing bite-sized excitement to players at the table.</p>
