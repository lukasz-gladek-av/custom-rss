            <p>
By now, you've probably heard of massive Fallout 4 mod <a href="https://fallout4london.com/">Fallout: London</a>, given the struggles it's faced in the run-up to release. There's one last hurdle for players to overcome, however, with developer Team Folon having now confirmed it'll be necessary to downgrade Fallout 4's next-gen version to play it - a process thankfully being handled by its accompanying installer.
</p>
<p>
Fallout 4's long-promised next-gen update <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-free-next-gen-update-finally-arrives-this-month">finally launched in April</a>, but its arrival caused some major headaches for the Fallout: London team. The mod was originally due to launch on 23rd April, but it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-delays-the-release-of-dlc-sized-fan-mod-fallout-london">delayed</a> after Bethesda announced Fallout 4's next-gen update would arrive two days later - Team Folon admitting it was concerned about potential "complications". And with good reason, it turns out; Team Folon has now confirmed a downgrade from the next-gen version of Fallout 4 will be absolutely necessary to run Fallout: London.
</p>
<p>A downgrader was briefly mentioned in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-says-the-end-is-in-sight-as-testing-gets-underway">statement the developer shared over the weekend</a>, but its inclusion wasn't really detailed at the time. However, in a follow-up message on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/1234891241184038973/1259924540088123393">Fallout: London's Discord</a> (via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/fallout-london-devs-will-downgrade-fallout-4-to-save-their-massive-mod/">Ars Technica</a>), project lead Dean Carter explained, "At the 11th hour we've discovered that the next-gen [version of Fallout 4], even after updates, isn't stable enough and thus we are now going out on the old version - thus the need for a downgrader."

<p>
Carter added that Bethesda's continuing updates to Fallout 4's next-gen release hasn't helped the London mod's progress at all. "It's been an utter frustration and every setback requires the testing process to restart," he explained. "Which is why we've decided to go with the downgrader route and when the 'next-gen' is sorted, update it for that."
</p>
<p>
Fallout: London will release via GOG (its massive size meant it was too large to host on Nexus Mods), and it's currently going through the company's quality-assurance checks ahead of its arrival. There's no release date for the mod just yet, but a post over the weekend claimed "the end is in sight", with the team seemingly just waiting for GOG to finish its work at this point. "Once they've completed the process of double-checking that Fallout: London and its installer work on all supported machines," it wrote, "we should be good to go."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-is-teasing-an-unsettling-new-horror-game-with-a-creepy-smiling-man<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Nintendo really woke up this morning and chose chaos by dropping a deeply upsetting short teaser for what seems to be a new horror game. We're not sure of the title just yet, but it might be called Emio, or possibly Smiling Man.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>What the heck was that? Nintendo fans are baffled. There are almost no details as to what this "Emio" thing is. Apart from the trailer, the only other info we have is that Nintendo tweeted about it across its U.S., Europe, and Japanese accounts this morning with the hashtag #WhoIsEmio?. There's an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/emio/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Nintendo website</a>, too, which just features the creepy dude standing there and occasionally, briefly, changing his expression. And we've confirmed that the kanji in the background of all these teases reads "laughing man" or "smiling man."</p><p>So why is everyone so worked up about this? It's not necessarily that there's anything abnormal about teasing a work of horror like this. Plenty of films and games have played up horror elements by being deliberately vague and sudden in their reveals. But Nintendo is, uh, not exactly known for that kind of thing! It's just out of character for them to surprise drop a trailer for what seems to be an M-rated horror game on a random Wednesday morning with no other context.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>We don't even know who's making Emio. People are speculating that based on the fact that it has an official Nintendo website, this may be a first-party game, which would be even more out of character for Nintendo. That said, a number of individuals have pointed out on social media that noted horror developer Bloober Team <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/wiadomosci/20240708/bloober-team-nie-widzi-zwiazku-miedzy-koncem-wspolpracy-z-draw-distance-a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced just two days ago</a> it was working on something called "Project M," which is apparently coming to Nintendo platforms and is expected to be announced this year. Could this be Project M? Or something else entirely?</p><p>Whatever the case, we'll have to wait to find out, but the prospect of a new horror game made by Nintendo, of all companies, is an exciting one to imagine. Until then, we'll have to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review">make do with Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>Apple recently announced new games coming to Apple Arcade, its gaming subscription service for iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple TVs, and Vision Pro headsets. The headlining title is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>, an indie hit that combined the gameplay of bullet hell shooters and the addictive quality of clickers to become a mega sensation two years ago. Also coming is <em>Temple Run: Legends</em>, an updated take on the popular game from 2011.</p>
<p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> was already available on the App Store, but it was ad-supported, with the option to spend money in-app to get additional content. The Apple Arcade version, dubbed <em>Vampire Survivors+</em>, is more akin to the PC or Xbox versions that don't have ads. Both paid expansions will be included at no additional charge.
</p><p>Meanwhile, <em>Temple Run: Legends</em> is a completely new game (not just a remake of the original <em>Temple Run</em>) that bucks the "endless runner" genre label by breaking its gameplay into individual levels—though there will be some kind of optional endless mode, too.</p>
<p>If you haven't played <em>Vampire Survivors</em> before, it's worth a try. Both titles will launch on August 1.</p>
<h2>Arcade could use some fresher and riskier picks</h2>
<p>These new additions are the most recent in a long line of Apple Arcade titles curated with a risk-averse, only-if-it-is-proven mentality that more or less ensures the subscription service won't get the sorts of surprise breakout hits that draw people to it.</p>
<p>When Apple Arcade launched, its initial lineup was a fascinating mix of casual and indie titles, some of which went on to be popular on other platforms once Arcade's exclusivity ended. However, there were reports early on that Arcade wasn't gaining the traction Apple hoped for, so the company quickly switched gears. It turned to continued, ongoing engagement as the primary metric by which to judge success, which led to a preference for games-as-a-service as opposed to standalone or narrative experiences. And it began primarily releasing games based on established intellectual properties like Hello Kitty or Star Wars, as well as re-releases of games that had already proven their success elsewhere in the App Store.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Many of those re-releases were more than a decade old, hearkening back to the early days of the App Store when premium titles reigned and free-to-play, games-as-a-service hadn't taken the wheel.</p>
<p>This week, Apple released a new game-as-a-service in a mobile IP from 2011 and a viral indie hit many months after its virality died down. I'm not saying no one is interested in or playing <em>Vampire Survivors</em> now, but imagine how much more it would have driven iPhone owners to Arcade if it had been there when it was first making headlines.</p>
<p>It took only a short time for Apple to shift gears away from its initial strategy of approaching creative new developers that were presenting interesting work at events like IndieCade to leaning only on games that had proven they could be successful, IPs that had proven popular already, or experienced developers who had already made waves on the App Store. Perhaps Apple didn't give that strategy enough of a chance.</p>
<p>What we have now is a safe subscription service that essentially curates the best of what other people have already discovered and (thankfully) strips out ads and microtransactions. That's a nice enough value proposition, especially for the price. But we're unlikely to see breakout hits on Arcade making waves among players, influencers, or the press because, for the most part, Apple is following the headlines with this service, not leading them.</p>
<p>That limits Arcade's place in the landscape a bit, and limits its potential for growth. That doesn't mean it's not a good value for the right kind of player, but it means that those looking to play the next best thing are likely to be looking elsewhere, and by the time something makes it to Arcade, they've moved on to the next trend. Your mileage may vary whether that works for you, but with more competition from other mobile games subscription services, Apple might need to accommodate more kinds of players. A greater balance between proven hits and more experimental or ambitious titles day-and-date with other platforms could help capture both buckets.</p>

Riot Games was reportedly developing a Smash Bros. style fighter set in the League of Legends universe, but pulled the plug on the project earlier this year after perceiving Warner Bros' Smash-inspired MultiVersus to have been a commercial failure.
</p>
<p>
That's according to former Washington Post video games and esports editor Mikhail Klimentov, who - writing in his <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee">ReaderGrev newsletter</a> - claims 70-80 Riot employees were working on the Smash-style platform fighter, codenamed Pool Party.
</p>
<p>
Citing current and former Riot employees familiar with the  project, Klimnetov says Pool Party was initially envisaged as a hardcore fighting game but grew to incorporate party game elements and casual-friendly mechanics as development continued.

<p>
Riot executives reportedly saw an opportunity to build and support the game's esports scene, but started getting cold feet after the release of Warner Bros' Smash-style free-to-play fighter MultiVersus. That game's launch is said to have been perceived as a failure by Riot decision makers, prompting the studio to reassess the consumer appetite for a Smash competitor. As a result, it cancelled the development of Pool Party in May this year.
</p>
<p>
Klimnetov says approximately half the 70-80 Riot employees working on the project have received offers to be assigned elsewhere in the company, while others are seeking new positions through the company's internal job board.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to Klimentov as part of his report, senior comms director Joe Hixson said, "We always have a number of projects in various phases of R&amp;D, and spinning projects up and down happens multiple times a year".
</p>
<p>
Pool Party is not to be confused with Riot's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-free-to-play-fighter-officially-named-2xko">other League of Legends' fighter</a>, 2XKO. Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/project-l-will-be-free-to-play-new-champion-detailed">back in August 2022</a> under the name Project L, 2XKO will launch as free-to-play title for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime next year.

But for the PlayStation 5 (and PC) owners who still want a customizable, competitive-focused controller, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-PlayStation-Console/dp/B0BQ1PDR4R?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon has a wildly good early Prime Day deal on the Razer Wolverine V2 Pro</a>, one of the few officially licensed PS5 controllers. Normally $250, you can get the Wolverine V2 Pro for only $165 ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a>. This is by far the lowest price yet--in fact, we wouldn't be surprised if this is a pricing error that disappears soon.</p><p>Only the black model is eligible for this price, as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-PlayStation-Console/dp/B0BWSLLWF2?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the white version is discounted to $200</a>--which had been the lowest price yet for the Wolverine V2 Pro until today. We started writing this story with the $200 price in mind for both colors, but then the $165 price showed up. Admittedly, the $250 list price is on the high end, but regardless, deals on this controller aren't very common.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4217398-razer-v2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4217398" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4217398-razer-v2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4217398"></a><figcaption>Razer Wolverine V2 Pro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4217398-razer-v2.jpg"></figure><p>The Wolverine V2 Pro features Razer's mecha-tactile face and shoulder buttons that have shorter actuation distance, an eight-way microswitch D-pad for more accurate gaming, and trigger locks.</p><p>There are also six remappable buttons, interchangeable thumbsticks, and Razer's trademark flair via chroma RGB lighting that snakes its way across the device. With the Razer controller app, which is available on mobile and PC, you can remap inputs and set up custom profiles.</p><p>It's worth noting you don't get the adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, or a built-in speaker--so these omissions should be weighed before going the third-party route.</p><p>Overall, this is a solid controller to consider for competitive gaming in fighting game and first-person shooter genres.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-bloomburrow-value-boosters-introduced-providing-alternative-cheaper<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has revealed a new type of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> booster. As part of their latest set, the tabletop company has introduced <em>Bloomburrow</em> value boosters. These are designed to be cheaper alternatives to collecting <em>Magic</em> cards, and it is a decision that has lead to some friction.</p>
<h2>The <em>Bloomburrow</em> Value Boosters Announcement</h2>
<p>In an official blog post, Wizards of the Coast explains the creation of <em>Bloomburrow</em> Value Boosters. According to the post, value boosters are smaller, lighter boosters. They are designed to be budget-friendly compared to the Play Boosters and Collector Boosters.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloomburrow-promotional-artwork.jpg?itok=LM8-n2vB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloomburrow-promotional-artwork.jpg?itok=q2f72NSi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A single Value Booster will contain three commons, two uncommons, one wildcard of any variety, and one card that may be a land, traditional foil, or a Special Guests card. Aside from these values, the post is light on further details, including MSRP or the business decisions that informed the booster's development.</p>
<p>Thankfully, head designer Mark Rosewater held an informal AMA on his personal Tumblr.</p>
<p>One of the questions <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/755556573155295232/hey-mark-just-wanted-to-say-that-the-news-about">voiced concern</a> that the <em>Bloomburrow</em> Value Boosters were malicious on WOTC's part, given their decision to remove Draft Boosters and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-introduces-magic-gathering-play-boosters" rel="noopener" target="_blank">introduce Play Boosters</a>. Rosewater responded that Value Boosters is an experiment in providing cheaper booster options for pharmacies, grocery stores, and toy aisles.</p>
<p>This shift in price informs other parts of the Value Boosters. Because it is a low-cost alternative, Value Boosters do not guarantee rare cards. Since Value Boosters are meant for general stores and not dedicated game shops, they cannot be <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/755562714280099840/why-not-support-a-draft-format-using-value">used for Draft</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, Rosewater confirmed that Draft Boosters were dropped because there wasn't a large enough market buying them. And if the <em>Bloomburrow</em> Value Boosters end up the same way, they will be dropped as well.</p>
<p><em>Bloomburrow's</em> Prerelease begins July 26. Those attending this year's GenCon can also experience Bloomburrow events from August 1-4.</p>

			<p>Titan Quest II is the latest game by THQ Nordic that is eagerly awaited by many, with the first game from 2016 receiving Very Positive reviews on Steam. <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-as-an-open-world-game-powered-by-ue5/">The sequel to Titan Quest</a> was announced in August 2023 and is still in development with an unconfirmed release date.</p>
<p>THQ Nordic has released a brand new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1154030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dev diary </a>that discusses character styles, looting, and the quest system available in-game. There will be assigned levels to each area, scaling enemies, and plenty of weaponry to get your hands on and experiment with.</p>
<p>While there have been plenty of dev diaries about this exciting new game, there hasn't been any gameplay footage yet. However, the developers are changing that, and players can expect to see new footage arriving on August 2 in a brand-new gameplay trailer.</p>
<p>Additionally, to anyone who may be making the journey to Germany to attend Gamescom, attendees will have the opportunity to trial Titan Quest II between August 21-25. For those excited about the Titan Quest II showcase, mark your calendar. It will be released on August 2 at 12:00 PM PDT / 3 PM EDT / 8 PM BST / 9 PM CEST / 10 PM MSK.</p>
<p>This game comes from the developers of Spellforce 3, and players will get to explore a hand-crafted RPG world with fast-paced and precise combat where you can learn to exploit their weak spots, as well as huge character customizations that will allow you to make the world easier or harder depending on how you want to play out the game.</p>
<p>For those who are fans of Greek Mythology, this is a game that you will want to keep on your radar. Players will get to ride the gorgeous steed Areion and utilize the powers given to them by the Gods to defeat Nemesis, Goddess of Retribution, who's the main villain in the storyline.</p>
<p>There is no official release date yet, and the system requirements have not been released, but this information may be released soon after Gamescom.</p>

                <p>During the Night Market festival in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> you can go watch the Mermaid Show, which plays a funky little cutscene. While just watching the show doesn't get you anything besides the short cutscene, there is a hidden secret you can find, if you know the correct password. Here's what you need to know.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The Mermaid Show</h2><p>The Mermaid Show is part of the Night Market festival, which takes place from Winter 15 to 17. The Night Market is located on the pier, right outside Willy's shop and runs from 5 PM to 2 AM all three days, although <strong>the Mermaid Show closes at 12:30 AM</strong>. The Mermaid Show is located on the eastern part of the pier.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4331014-mermaidshow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331014" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4331014-mermaidshow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331014"></a><figcaption>You can unlock the secret reward by pressing the shells in the correct order after the show ends.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4331014-mermaidshow.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When you enter the Mermaid Show, it will automatically start playing, and it will restart if you leave and come back in. The show takes 1 hour and 40 minutes of in-game time to complete. Once the show ends, the curtains will close, leaving you in the room with 5 interactable shells in a line in front of you. Interacting with the shells will play a musical note, and the puzzle requires you to play them in the correct order.</p><div data-embed-type="breakoutBox"><p dir="ltr">More Stardew Valley guides:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p>Stardew Valley Traveling Cart Guide</p></li><li><p>Stardew Valley: Should You Pick Bats Or Mushrooms For The Cave</p></li><li><p>How To Get Clay In Stardew Valley</p></li><li><p>How To Use Bait In Stardew Valley</p></li></ul></div><p dir="ltr"><strong>The solution is 1-5-4-2-3, with the leftmost shell being 1 and the rightmost being 5. </strong>The way you learn this information is by finding the Secret Note with the answer. You can unlock Secret Notes by completing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-solve-a-winter-mystery-in-stardew-valley/1100-6524843/" data-ref-id="1100-6524843">Winter Mystery quest</a>, which can be done as early as Winter 1. <strong>You don't have to have the note to put in the correct solution.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Your reward for solving the puzzle is a Pearl, which you can only get from the Mermaid Show once per save file. Pearls are a treasure that can be sold for 2,500G, but it is also a universally loved gift, if you don't need the money.</p>

From a practical standpoint, this is helpful during the character creation process if you want your Rook’s body to look a certain way, it’s easier to do that when their shirt is off. <em>Game Informer</em> asked if there would be nudity elsewhere in the game, to which director Corrine Busche responded, “This is a mature RPG.”</p><p>As for whether or not <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> will follow <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-genitals-character-customization-options-1850616353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-genitals-character-customization-options-1850616353"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3's</em></a></span> example and include genitalia, BioWare apparently told <em>Game Informer </em>the studio wants fans to discover for themselves. That isn’t a resounding “yes,” but it’s a weirdly evasive answer if it’s “no.” Not to say that it’s impossible that they would avoid giving a direct answer if it’s disappointing news, but that’s also just setting yourself up for backlash if you tease discovering something that’s not there. Notably, you can customize your Rook’s bulge in the character creator, but it remains to be seen if that goes anywhere beyond how their underwear fits them.</p><p>Nudity has become a pretty standard affair in BioWare games over the years.

That plan apparently included prototyping a <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>-style game starring <em>League</em> characters called<em> Pool Party</em>, but according to a new report the project was recently canned, due in part to the uphill road faced by <em>MultiVersus</em>. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195697" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="170" data-playlist="195697,194842,196544" data-current="195697"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21194.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a new report</a></span> by former <em>Washington Post Launcher</em> editor Mikhail Klimentov on his Patreon, <em>Pool Party</em> was pitched as a <em>Smash Bros.</em>-esque game set in the <em>League of Legends</em> universe that would invest heavily in a competitive esports scene. Once in development, the project took on party game elements and “casual-friendly mechanics,” but Riot Games ultimately decided to walk away, in part because of the perceived failure of <em>MultiVersus</em>, a Warner Bros. crossover fighter that made a massive splash in 2022 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/multiversus-return-review-fps-laggy-locked-characters-1851506741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-return-review-fps-laggy-locked-characters-1851506741">but then went offline for months before relaunching to much less fanfare</a></span>. </p><p>Around 80 people were apparently working on <em>Pool Party</em> up until its cancellation in May. Now some have been reassigned while others were laid off. “We always have a number of projects in various phases of R&amp;D, and spinning projects up and down happens multiple times a year,” a spokesperson for Riot told Klimentov. </p><p>Riot Games is still working on a 2v2 <em>League of Legends </em>fighting game planned for release in 2025 called <em>2XKO</em>, and it also has an MMO based in the universe in development. Since the MOBA blew up, there have also been autobattlers and card-based spin-offs, as well RPGs, indie action games, and platformers all based around <em>League</em> characters. Riot Forge, the division responsible for publishing these games developed with outside studios, was shut down earlier this year amid 500 layoffs.</p><p>For its part, <em>MultiVersus</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/multiversus-review-smash-bros-batman-1851572599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-review-smash-bros-batman-1851572599">remains a fun game trapped in a terrible free-to-play grind</a></span>. There’s nothing stopping Warner Bros. from eventually turning it around but it’s clear its needs a new model to build off of. Still, it would be cool to see more companies take a stab at the platformer fighting genre. Maybe a <em>Dragon Ball Z </em>game could be the one that cracks the<em> Smash Bros.</em> code. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Meta Quest 3</h2><h3>Best VR Headset</h3><div id="189722" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Meta Quest 3</h3></p><div><p>Outstanding standalone VR headset running on a powerful Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip that is comfortable on head with excellent optical performance and well-tracked controllers. </p></div></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/LvWrP?object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><strong>See it on Target</strong></a></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Crisp, smooth visuals from the dual 2,064 x 2,208, 120Hz LCDs</li><li>Full-color pass-through mode for mixed-reality gaming </li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Significantly more expensive than the Meta Quest 2 at launch </li></ul><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/meta-quest-3-review"><u>Meta Quest 3</u></a> has everything you need in an entry-level. Starting at $499, it got a big price hike from its predecessor, but with all the impressive upgrades, the cost is justified. This headset is slimmer with better ergonomics than the Quest 2, making it more comfortable to wear. Dual 2,064 x 2,208 LCDs with a 120Hz refresh rate ensure crisp, smooth visuals, while pancake lenses, a wider 110-degree field of view, and other optical improvements make for a better viewing experience. The VR headset is paired with lightweight, well-tracked controllers. </p><p>What makes the Quest a standout from other VR headsets is it’s a standalone device that doesn’t require a PC or console to run—you can always grab the <a href="https://zdcs.link/B5BKN?_ga=480341026.1635262939&amp;object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>link cable</u></a> if you’re looking to play PC VR offerings. Meta has a massive library of immersive VR games, but at the moment, there aren’t many that showcase the true potential of this headset’s wildly capable Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip. This headset even has a sharp, full-color passthrough mode for those looking to get into mixed-reality gaming.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/22/meta-quest-2-1705937480957.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Meta Quest 2's lenses</figcaption></figure></output><h2>2.

You still get a robust library of immersive VR games, streaming apps, and educational content to learn in an enrapturing, fresh format. It does all of this as a standalone device that doesn't require a phone or PC, though similar to the Quest 3, you can connect it with a <a href="https://zdcs.link/B5BKN?object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>link cable</u></a> and open up a world of PC VR experiences.</p><p>The Meta Quest 2 offers crisp visuals and minimal screen door effect while warding off motion sickness thanks to its high resolution and 90-120Hz refresh rate. Since it runs without cables, you can use it anywhere, and its built-in camera warns you when you’re getting close to any obstacles in your environment. The controllers have decent haptic feedback with extra thumb space—only people with smaller hands may find them harder to hold. Sure, everything on the Meta Quest 3 is a little bit better, but the Quest 2 is hands down the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-budget-vr-headset"><u>best budget VR headset</u></a> and perfect for those just beginning to test the waters of VR. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/01/apple-vision-pro-1709311882956.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The innovative Apple Vision Pro</figcaption></figure></output><h2>3.

It delivers a sort of augmented reality, thanks to the stunning almost 4K displays that use 12 cameras to track the world around you and put it right into your eyes. Interacting with the headset involves mostly gestures using not only your fingers but your eyes; it’s not always consistent though still something to marvel at.  </p><p>Now, the Apple Vision Pro doesn’t offer VR games at the moment, but there are a few Apple Arcade games designed for the Vision Pro that use augmented reality, interacting with the space around you. If you’re looking to watch movies or take advantage of Apple TV’s immersive video, be prepared for wildly realistic, reality-bending experiences. When you want to work, you can place your <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-macbooks-to-buy"><u>MacBook</u></a> screen on the Vision Pro, as well as messages and other windows all about the space around you for easy access. </p><p>Admittedly, this headset isn’t perfect, from its exorbitant price tag to the less-than-comfortable design and lackluster battery. But the Apple Vision Pro demonstrates the exciting possibilities of how we will be interacting with this technology down the road. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/09/13/vlcsnap-2022-09-13-16h10m51s464-1663111134487.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Headset and sense controllers of the PlayStation VR2</figcaption></figure></output><h2>4.

Coming in at $550, this VR headset costs more than the console itself, but all the features on offer, from the built-in tracking cameras and eye tracking to the two tactile Sense controllers with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, make it worth the splurge. And unlike the original, the setup is simple, as you just plug in a single USB-C, do a bit of calibration, and you’re ready to go. </p><p>After you’ve got everything configured and the PlayStation VR2 resting comfortably on your head, you’ll enjoy 4K OLED panels offering HDR, a 120Hz refresh rate, and 110-degree FOV for some super smooth, gorgeous images to keep you immersed in the action. You’re truly getting PC-level VR in a headset with more features and better specs than many pricier PC VR headsets, like the Valve Index and HP Reverb G2. However, you, unfortunately, can’t play any of the expansive library of PC VR games or even a majority of the original <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-psvr-games">PSVR games</a> on this new headset, so you’re limited in what you can play currently.</p><p><em>See more </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-headset"><em>PS5 headsets</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>5.

If you want to play some of your PC VR games, this headset lets you do so wirelessly via a WiFi 6/6E connection. You can also hook it up directly to your <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-pc">gaming PC</a> via USB-C, which means you can lose the swappable battery pack on the back of the device, making the headset lighter with more of a glasses-type vibe. </p><p>The Vive XR Elite operates at a smooth 90Hz, and with a 1,920 x 1,920 pixels per eye resolution, it almost eliminates any screen door effect. Headphones on the headset deliver spatial audio for greater immersion in the action. Of course, you also get full motion tracking with four cameras and a depth sensor, and it comes with two motion controllers. However, the high cost is somewhat hard to justify, given many of its feature match the Meta Quest 2, which is less than half the price. </p><h2>6.

The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/28/valve-index-review"><u>Valve Index</u></a> has 1,440 x 1,600 per-eye resolution at a buttery smooth 120Hz. Expanded base stations enable you to map larger areas to play in, and the controllers have full finger tracking. </p><p>All that great functionality puts it ahead of the competition, but it’s also lot more expensive. Although you can mitigate some of that cost by using original Vive parts. Do this and you’ll be able to customize your setup, based on what you value most, or buy the full Valve Index to have the best visual VR experience available. It's perfect for titles like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-alyx-review"><u>Half-Life: Alyx</u></a>. Unfortunately, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> is not currently optimized for VR experiences, so you won't be able to use it very effectively with the Valve Index.</p><h2>7.

To determine which VR headset is right for you, keep these key things in mind:</p><h3>Platform</h3><p>The best VR headset is the one you can (and will) actually use. If you already have a beefy gaming PC, or are willing to spend serious cash to buy or build one, and you have space in a room large enough for room-scale VR, grab a SteamVR headset, which will give you the best experience, overall.</p><p>If you want the ability to play on a standalone system without a PC or you want a flexible setup where that is an option – get the Meta Quest 3.</p><h3>Games</h3><p>If there are any exclusive games you want to play, that is another huge factor. Buying the excellent PSVR2 will get you access to a bunch of great exclusive <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-heads-on-guide-to-the-playstation-vr2-games-to-consider-first-updated">PSVR2 games</a>, but that doesn’t do you any good if you want to play Half-Life: Alyx. </p><p>Moreover, buying into the PSVR2 means you will be dependant on Sony to release more games and support it, while the PC-centric nature of the other platforms gives you more flexibility in how the headsets can be used.</p><p>SteamVR works on basically all of the PC-based headsets, which is great. Meta also has some exclusives, and although they may be playable on SteamVR devices with <a href="https://github.com/LibreVR/Revive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Revive</u></a>, there is no guarantee. The Apple Vision Pro doesn't even offer VR gaming at the moment, while only a select few Apple Arcade games let you take advatage of augmented reality on the headset. </p><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/07/Valve-Index-720x405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3>Resolution &amp; Refresh Rate</h3><p>Performance is always incredibly important in gaming, but this can actually impact your health, too. While low resolutions can result in the “screen door effect,” which makes things look worse, poor frame rates and resolution can also cause eye strain and even motion sickness. While these normally occur at refresh rates lower than 90Hz, your mileage may vary. </p><h3>Stationary vs Room-Scale</h3><p>The most immersive VR experience is the room-scale one. Being able to move about freely (called “six-degrees of freedom”), jump, crouch, and move around lets you truly experience the wonder of VR. Realistically, not everyone has room, or the ability, to participate in that.</p><p>If you have limited mobility, or don’t have room in your home, options that only track head movement instead of body movement is the way to go. This is perfectly suited towards watching movies, and similar activities.</p><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2018/04/OculusGoProductShot-720x480.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3>Tracking System</h3><p>Much like the difference between Station VS Room-Scale, the tracking system is also really important and it will influence how your headset feels to use. </p><p>The Meta Quest 3 and more use inside-out tracking, which means the headset tracks your movement using cameras and sensors built into the headset. This means you don’t have to set up external cameras around your room, but it also means it’s less accurate.</p><p>If you are operating in a smaller space, or are a more casual user, inside-out tracking might be for you. If you want the best experience and have access to extra room, pick a headset with external tracking.</p><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/07/HTC-Vive-Wireless-Adapter-720x405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3>Wired vs Wireless</h3><p>This originally wasn’t a choice at all. The first VR headsets had cables, but lately more and more wireless options are becoming available. Like many of the other choices on this list, this basically comes down to “freedom” vs “performance.” </p><p>While wireless sets mean you won’t trip over a cable, and you can wander more freely in a larger space, wires aren’t that obtrusive once you get used to them, and they will give your headset higher bandwidth, which generally means the best resolution and image quality. Having a wire also means you don’t have to worry about headset batteries running out.</p><p>If that is important to you, picked a wired set, although there are several very high quality sets that can be used both wired and wirelessly, which is a great way to go if you aren’t sure what you want.</p><p>VR has tons of promise, and not just in the gaming space. As the years go on, you may be able to attend concerts for all of your favorite bands, visit other planets in our solar system, and more, all from the comfort of your own home. Follow our guidelines, and we hope you’ll discover a whole new frontier of entertainment, education, and more.</p><h2>VR Headset FAQ</h2><h3>What's the Difference Between VR and AR?</h3><p>Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are terms often thrown around in the gaming world but have some distinct differences. </p><p>AR is a much more accessible technology, as almost anyone with a smartphone can use it. With AR, you get virtual features in the real world, often through your phone or headset’s camera. One of the best examples of an AR game is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/pokemon-go-review"><u>Pokemon Go</u></a>, where you use your phone's camera to navigate through the real world, and virtual elements, such as Pokemon or PokeStops, appear. You can even interact with these elements through your device. But, of course, they are not actually physically in front of you. Augmented reality is just adding to your current surroundings. Apple's Vision Pro uses AR in extremely fun and innovative way. </p><p>VR uses some aspects of AR but takes things to another level by eliminating the real-world setting. Instead, your entire world is computer generated, so it doesn’t matter where you’re actually physically located. All of your surroundings are replaced, and what you see is controlled by a computer system. Therefore, headsets block out the real world, blindfolding you for a fully immersive experience. Some great VR game examples are Half-Life: Alyx, which places you in a dystopian sci-fi universe, or the PSVR 2 version of Gran Turismo 7, where you’ll be residing in the cockpit of a car. </p><h3>What's a Good Meta Quest 3 Alternative?</h3><p>The Meta Quest 3 appears to be in a league of its own with its standalone functionality, impressive motion tracking, and budget-friendly price. That means finding a suitable alternative is a challenge. </p><p>Of course, you could go with the Meta’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/ynbxr?object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>Quest Pro</u></a>, but it’s pricey and not even meant to play games. The  <a href="https://zdcs.link/nJpx4?object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>HTC Vive XR Elite</u></a> offers similar specs to the Quest 3 and even lets you play PC VR games wirelessly over a WiFi 6/6E. However, the astronomical $1,000 price is hard to justify when you get very few extras and can snag the Quest 3 for $500.  </p><p>That leads us to our best Meta Quest 3 alternative: the <a href="https://zdcs.link/LY40P?object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>Pico 4</u></a>. The Pico 4 and Quest 2 have a lot in common, as they’re both standalone wireless headsets, run on a similar processor, and support PC VR. A longer battery life, lighter design, more clarity, and a wider field of view even give the Pico 4 a slight edge over the Quest 3. But as great as the Pico 4 sounds, it has limited availability in the US, sometimes making the reasonably priced headset more expensive stateside. If you decide to grab the Pico 4, be sure to do research and shop around before purchasing. </p><h3>What VR Doesn't Need a PC?</h3><p>The majority of VR requires a PC to function, which can be difficult if you don’t have a powerful computer ready to run these often graphically intensive games or want freedom in where you play. Luckily, there are a few standalone VR headsets and options that run on other devices. </p><p>You can use <a href="https://zdcs.link/7LnE4?_ga=549648315.1689878480&amp;object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>Meta Quest 3</u></a> and the whole lineup of Meta headsets without being connected to a PC thanks to powerful processors. But if you’re looking to play some PC VR offerings, you can always link Meta Quest to your PC. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/LY40P?_ga=549648315.1689878480&amp;object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>Pico 4</u></a> is another great standalone option similar to the Quest 3. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/3y0GV?object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>HTC XR Elite</u></a> is also ready to run VR apps and games sans a connection. </p><p>Those with a PlayStation 5 can grab <a href="https://zdcs.link/yNXmJ?_ga=549648315.1689878480&amp;object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>PlayStation VR2</u></a> for a truly spectacular VR experience, though you can’t use the headset with PCs. There are also a few <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-smartphone"><u>smartphone</u></a> VR options, like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/xmRxP?_ga=549648315.1689878480&amp;object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>Atlasonix VR Headset</u></a>, but don’t expect too much from these <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-budget-vr-headset"><u>budget VR headsets</u></a> that use your phone’s screen. </p><p>Of course, Apple's Vision Pro is an extremely powerful standalone device. But it'll easy integrate into the Apple Ecosystem and connect to MacBooks for an innovative way to work on your devices. </p><h3>Does the Nintendo Switch have VR?</h3><p>Yes, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-oled-review"><u>Nintendo Switch</u></a> has VR and a handful of VR games, but it's relatively simple and lackluster compared to what the VR headsets are capable of on this guide. </p><p>For the Switch, you’ll usually rely on the device's own screen and slot it into a headset. One of the most popular options is the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/24/nintendo-labo-variety-kit-review"><u>Nintendo Labo VR Kit</u></a>, which features fun-shaped cardboard designs that you create yourself. Otherwise, you’ll find slightly more robust options with straps. There is a convoluted process to using the Switch with a more high-tech VR headset. However, it’s quite complicated and requires additional hardware. So, if you’re looking for a more immersive experience when playing the gaming handheld, you’re better off grabbing one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-headset"><u>best Nintendo Switch headsets</u></a> than seeking out VR. </p><h3>What’s Happening to Windows Mixed Reality? </h3><p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features?ranMID=24542&amp;ranEAID=kXQk6*ivFEQ&amp;ranSiteID=kXQk6.ivFEQ-6pAo6xZ0fzKuurNjBeYk_Q&amp;epi=kXQk6.ivFEQ-6pAo6xZ0fzKuurNjBeYk_Q&amp;irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AIDcmm549zy227_aff_7593_1243925&amp;tduid=(ir__otcxelxkeskfdjffe90lummxmn2x9ezjbgvr0xpp00)(7593)(1243925)(kXQk6.ivFEQ-6pAo6xZ0fzKuurNjBeYk_Q)()&amp;irclickid=_otcxelxkeskfdjffe90lummxmn2x9ezjbgvr0xpp00" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Microsoft has announced it will be forgoing support of Windows Mixed Reality</u></a>, its virtual and augmented reality platform, in a future Windows software release expected in late 2024. This will include both the Portal app and SteamVR driver, which are necessary for the Windows Mixed Reality headsets to function. The VR headsets should continue to work with Steam until late 2026. After that, there will be no updates or technical support.</p><h3>When Do VR Headsets Go on Sale?</h3><p>Although some of the best VR headsets never actually get discounted, there are generally a few times a year when you can find discounts on popular models. One of the overall best shopping events for VR discounts is <a href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-prime-day">Amazon Prime Day</a>, which takes place in July every year. After that, <a href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday tend to have the best overall deals consistently. Both events tend to primarily offer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-meta-quest-deals">Meta Quest deals</a>, but sometimes other headsets are avaialable at a discount.</p><p><em>Brian Barnett writes reviews, wiki guides, deals posts, features, and more for IGN.

			<p>NetEase's free-to-play survival game Once Human is out now on PC, available for download via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/once-human-b5c576" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>. We've been following it ever since it <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-receives-a-new-trailer-at-pc-gaming-show-2023-preview-pc-beta-test-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed up</a> on PC Gaming Show's 2023 Preview in late 2022. Over time, Once Human garnered a sizable following, becoming Steam's fifth most-wishlisted upcoming game and the most-played demo at the latest Steam Next Fest.</p>
<p>It's early to judge its success, but the game has already <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2139460/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broken into Steam's Top 10 chart</a> with over 131K concurrent players. We'll have to wait at least until the weekend to evaluate its peak potential, though. Meanwhile, let's recap what it is all about. The setting is firmly in the so-called 'New Weird' genre, and the developers have cited SCP Foundation, Lovecraftian Horror, and post-apocalyptic aesthetic in general as inspirations.</p>
<p>The premise is that a mysterious alien substance known as Stardust has contaminated Earth, reducing the planet to a post-apocalyptic state and turning life as we knew it into a twisted nightmare. Players, however, step into the role of Metahumans, who can resist the contamination and use Stardust to get more powerful. That said, this is still a survival game, so you must take care not to consume polluted food or water, as that would reduce your Sanity. When your Sanity drops, your max Health drops accordingly.</p>
<p>At launch, the world of Once Human includes five regions, five factions, and over fifty types of Deviants spread across more than one hundred Strongholds. Fans who played the previous test events will be able to continue the main storyline in the new "Blackheart" region, where players will encounter new enemies and uncover more secrets of the apocalypse, as well as a host of new open-world side quests. Lowe will also feature more Deviant challenges, including Identity V and Paper Doll from the Onmyoji series.</p>

<p>Building your own Sanctuary is a major feature of Once Human. These homes can be constructed anywhere in the wilderness and decorated to your liking. Players will be able to safeguard their hard-earned treasures behind walls and protect them with an arsenal of defensive weapons.</p>
<p>Servers support up to 4000 players, a much higher count than the average survival game, allowing players to form alliances or wage war on others. On that note, a new PvP mode called Highway Pursuit has been added to the game, offering special reward vehicles and providing attacking players with valuable loot if they seek it out. However, entering the vicinity of each vehicle will enable PvP, so players are advised to take caution when others are nearby.</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of Once Human, pre-registered fans can claim the AKM skin "The Call of the Giant Octopus," a Meta's Cap, a piece of furniture, and a pair of Dragon Fist gloves. New players can complete missions or invite friends to join in order to receive gifts including cosmetic items and accessories.</p>
