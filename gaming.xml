            <p>
At this evening's State of Play, we got another look at Bloober's upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps learning from its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-silent-hill-2-remake-gets-fresh-airing-in-combat-focused-trailer">previous combat-focused tease</a>, the Silent Hill 2 Remake team went down the more atmospheric route for this trailer. Gone were the parkouring nurses from yore, and in its place we got crumbling gravestones, creaking floorboards and plenty of fog. After all, this is Silent Hill! 
</p>
<p>
The trailer gave us all a closer look at James, the game's protagonist. He is trying to get to Silent Hill, having received a letter from his deceased wife. "James heads to where they shared so many memories, in the hope of seeing her one more time," the trailer description reads. You can check it out below.

<p>
In addition to setting the tone, we also got a release date for the upcoming remake. Silent Hill 2 is set to launch on 8th October, across PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam. It is available to pre-order now. 
</p>
<p>Following on from Sony's State of Play, we got a further look at Silent Hill 2's remake during the Silent Hill Transmission broadcast. Here, we got a much better idea of the gameplay, with James investigating the titular setting. </p>
<p>It is all suitably ominous, as you can see in the video below.

			<p><em>Note: This is a developing story. More info about Concord will be added shortly. </em></p>
<p>While we’ve known about the existence of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord</a> for over a year now, Sony’s new PvP multiplayer shooter has remained quite mysterious. The game is the work of <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-destiny-vets-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firewalk Studios</a>, a new startup headed up by a team of Destiny vets, and teasers have hinted at a colorful, character-driven approach to the genre. Beyond that, details have been scant.</p>
<p>Well, today during Sony’s latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play</a> showcase, we finally got a real look at Concord, as well as a rough August release window for the game. The game is a Overwatch-style 5v5 arena hero shooter, featuring a cast of “Freegunners,” very clearly inspired by Guardians of the Galaxy. Overall, gameplay looks polished, with visuals well beyond most multiplayer shooters (certainly far beyond what Overwatch is doing these days). Interestingly, Sony also hints that story elements and missions will be woven directly into the game, rather than just on the side. You can check out the first cinematic trailer for Concord for yourself, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Reveal Cinematic Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mBnStS9d2xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And here’s a meaty look at actual Concord gameplay…</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jqQJhjf_3o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Concord is slated to launch on PC and PS5 on August 23. What do you think? Does Sony’s latest venture into the realm of live service games look promising?</p>

It’s definitely giving some witty banter, sci-fi, Marvel-esque vibes to my ears and eyes. <em>Concord </em>comes out on August 23, 2024.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h11172"><a id=""></a><em>God of War Ragnarok </em>comes to PC on September 19, 2024<br></h2><p><em>God of War Ragnarok</em> is coming to PC! I’m sure you already suspected that, but we got a look at daddy Kratos smashing up baddies with some previews of its PC features, such as ultrawide support and all the major super sampling tech, and it comes with the game’s great <em>Valhalla </em>DLC too! Kratos’ latest adventure arrives on PC on September 19, 2024.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h11173"><a id=""></a><em>Dynasty Warriors Origins</em><br></h2><p>With epic melee weapon skirmishes against massive amounts of foes, <em>Dynasty Warriors Origins</em> looks like it’s going all in on totally unrealistic yet fully badass combat.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h11174"><a id=""></a><em>Infinity Nikki</em><br></h2><p>Are you ready to walk the path of a stylist? That’s what <em>Infinity Nikki </em>promises, with cute outfits, fantasy vistas, platforming, and the ability to shoot little cats out of cannons! <br></p><hr><h2 id="h11175"><a id=""></a><em>Ballad of Antara</em><br></h2><p>With moody color themes, epic dark fantasy vibes, and some very satisfying melee weapon sound effects, <em>Ballad of Antara</em> is definitely worth keeping an eye on if you’re into brawls against mythic creatures in a magical realm. <em>Ballad of Antara</em> is expected to arrive in 2025.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h11176"><a id=""></a><em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em><br></h2><p>Hey, remember the PS VR2? Sorry, but hey, it’s nice to see some new games coming out for Sony’s somewhat struggling headset. With both first-person sword battles and some neat mechanics with a rope weapon you can use to pull enemies and weapons around, this could prove to be a very satisfying VR experience.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h11177"><a id=""></a><em>Alien Rogue Incursion</em><br></h2><p><em>Alien Rogue Incursion</em> aims to bring its HR Giger-inspired horror vibes to a PlayStation VR headset near you...you know, if you feel you won’t die of absolute fraking terror.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h11178"><a id=""></a><em>Marvel Rivals</em><br></h2><p>It’s like third-person <em>Overwatch</em> but you know, with a Marvel license or something! Joking aside, <em>Rivals </em>may set itself apart with its third-person action and good use of its source material.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h11179"><a id=""></a><em>Where Winds Meet</em><br></h2><p>With a trailer focusing on some tense and speedy-lookin’ one-on-one showdowns, <em>Where Winds Meet </em>is currently in development for PS5.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h11180"><a id=""></a><em>Until Dawn</em><br></h2><p>Supermassive’s 2015 interactive teen horror movie is being rebuilt and upgraded for current hardware.&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>’s PS5 and PC trailer at this month’s State of Play wasn’t short on gruesome contraptions and hellish ways to see its characters murdered.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h11181"><a id=""></a><em>Path of Exile 2</em><br></h2><p>Grinding Gear Games’ <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is set to arrive on PS5 in 2024. Cast into a dark fantasy world tortured by monsters and disease, players will have to take on the role of fearless warriors seeking victory and, of course, better and better loot. Keep this one on your radar if <em>Diablo 4</em> hasn’t been doing it for you. <em>Path of Exile</em> <em>2</em> arrives on PS5 via Early Access in late 2024.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h11182"><a id=""></a><em>Silent Hill 2</em><br></h2><p>Today we got a closer look at the upcoming remake of horror classic <em>Silent Hill 2</em>. Complete with a very <em>Resident Evil 4</em>-inspired camera set up and gruesome beasts, time will tell if this remake lives up to the hype when it launches on October 8, 2024.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h11183"><a id=""></a><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em><br></h2><p>We finally got a real look at the next entry in the beloved <em>Monster Hunter</em> franchise. Yes, there are cute Palicos as well as menacing beasts. Tonight’s trailer showed off some of the game’s world too, which sports sandstorms and plenty of open space to engage in battle with creatures while riding aboard your bird mount. The game is expected to arrive in 2025.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h11184"><a id=""></a><em>Astro Bot</em><br></h2><p>Hope you weren’t tired of our pal Astro! Looking far more ambitious and elaborate than the delightful PS5 pack-in game <em>Astro’s</em>&nbsp;<em>Playroom</em> and absolutely packed with cameos from throughout PlayStation history to trigger your brand nostalgia, this definitely looks like it’ll rise above the status of novelty to be something rather interesting. <em>Astro Bot </em>arrives on September 6.<br></p><hr><p>And that wraps everything we saw at tonight’s State of Play. It was a short but sweet showing of some neat-looking games coming to the PS5.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The trailer aired during today's PlayStation State of Play as the game is coming to PS VR2, but it's also coming to Meta Quest 3 and Steam (for other PC VR devices) this holiday season. In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we'll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnzh9Ll4i7A" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/first-look-at-alien-rogue-incursion-ps-vr2-gameplay-out-holiday-2024/">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the "high tension shooter" tasks players with exploring an "overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn't tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it'll bring some friends," the blog post reads. "While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/05/30/until-dawn-arrives-on-ps5-and-pc-this-fall<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Until Dawn, the 2015 horror adventure game from Supermassive Games, is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in remake form this fall. We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today's State of Play presentation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn's narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ownf9ZasITA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Originally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry's definition of a remaster. PlayStation's official description says it's been "rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC." Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/until_dawn/b/playstation4/archive/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review-game-informer-playstation-4.aspx">awarding it a score of 9 out of 10</a>. In the time since Until Dawn's original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.</p>

<p>The games have an unusual identity&nbsp;and are, in some ways, a genre unto themselves. They almost always feature large-scale battles in which the lead character can sweep through dozens of enemy combatants with a single swing.</p>

<p>That playstyle appears to remain intact if this new trailer is to be believed.</p>

<p>A lot has changed in action gameplay in the years since Dynasty Warriors was at its most popular, but there’s no doubt that the series once had an enthusiastic fanbase.</p>

<p>We’ll see if the series is able to update its gameplay and draw in new fans when it hits PlayStation 5 next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/astro-bots-next-big-adventure-is-coming-out-in-september/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The full game sequel to Astro’s Playroom, Astro Bot is coming out on 6th September 2024 for PS5, with a huge number of world to explore and nods to popular PlayStation games and franchises.</p>
<p><iframe title="ASTRO BOT - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHMNQzLG_Jg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>More than 50 worlds will feature in Astro Bot, and just as with Astro’s Playroom – the game bundled with every PS5 – there will be plenty of gameplay variety. We saw flying sequences, sponge abilities, space battles, punching and grappling and more, in addition to returning abilities from Playroom.</p>
<p>There’s also plenty of new PlayStation game references, such as Journey, Parappa the Rapper, Kratos and others.</p>
<p>It looks like a lot of fun, and we can’t wait.</p>

<p>Astro’s Playroom was a simple bundle of joy for pretty much every PS5 owner. “Astro cements himself as the PlayStation 5’s mascot,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/astros-playroom-review-the-first-game-you-should-play-on-playstation-5/">I said in 2020</a>, “with a celebration of all things PlayStation that also showcases the full potential of the immersive new DualSense controller. Astro’s Playroom is the first thing you should play on PlayStation 5.”</p>

		<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion was&nbsp; announced for PSVR 2, Meta Quest 3 and Steam VR earlier this year and we now have the first gameplay reveal and a release window of holiday 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien Rogue Incursion - First Gameplay | PS VR 2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnzh9Ll4i7A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Alien game project has been in development for the last two years at VR specialists Survios. The company burst on the scene with the dawn of VR with Raw Data in 2016, before bringing the rapid releases of Sprint Vector, Electonauts and Creed: Rise to Glory through 2018.</p>
<p>“As reverent fans of the franchise, we know that any Alien video game begins and ends with its deadly Xenomorphs, and those encountered within Alien: Rogue Incursion are definitely ferocious, unpredictable, and terrifying,” explains &nbsp;TQ Jefferson from Survios.</p>
<p>“Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn’t tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it’ll bring some friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage. “</p>

<p>There’s a rich pedigree for Survios and VR, in other words, but really the main reason why people will be excited for Alien: Rogue Incursion is because of 2014 game Alien: Isolation. The celebrated horror game was once shown as being playable in VR prior to release, and fans have long wanted to see a VR version of the game released – hopes that will sadly never be realised at this point. Hopefully Rogue Incursion can be the VR horror surrogate that we need.</p>
<p>“Our team at Survios are huge fans of Alien and have been building Alien: Rogue Incursion for a long time, honing our ability to pair the most technically advanced, immersive, and engaging VR experiences with best-in-class franchises,” says TQ Jefferson, Chief Product Officer at Survios. “This fully original story embraces all our favorite elements from 45 years of Alien, from kinetic action and heart-pounding exploration to our terrifyingly resourceful Xenomorphs that will truly make your skin crawl. We can’t wait for fans to get their hands on it this holiday season.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/silent-hill-2-remake-gets-a-new-trailer-as-part-of-state-of-play/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony’s State of Play broadcast has previewed the heavily anticipated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-2/">Silent Hill 2</a> remake. The new trailer shows more of the town of Silent Hill, more of the enemies and a smattering of combat, all of which looks rather like the recent Resident Evil remakes. Silent Hill 2 set to release on October 8th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sU3pyYi5hz0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Having received a letter from his deceased wife, James heads to where they shared so many memories, in the hope of seeing her one more time: Silent Hill. There, by the lake, he finds a woman eerily similar to her… “My name… is Maria,” the woman smiles. Her face, her voice… She’s just like her.”</em></p>
<p>A second extended gameplay trailer was released by Konami an hour later as part of their Silent Hill broadcast., at the time of writing it has not been published by itself but you can watch it at the start of the broadcast below.</p>
<p><iframe title="SILENT HILL Transmission (EN) | May 30, 2024 | KONAMI" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KUWjJ1zOxwo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In development by Bloober Team, Silent Hill 2 is a big step up for the studio, but one that absolutely makes sense. They’re best known for their work on psychological horror games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/15/layers-of-fear-review-2/">Layers of Fear</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/19/observer-system-redux-review-ps5-series-x/">Observer</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/27/the-medium-review-xbox-series-x-pc/">The Medium</a>. That experience will be vital when updating a game made and designed for the limitations of the PlayStation 2 hardware in 2001.</p>

<p>In terms of the core gameplay, Silent Hill 2 will most noticeably be transformed by a shift away from fixed cameras and tank controls to over-the-shoulder and a more modern control scheme, similar to the treatment that Capcom gave to their Resident Evil remakes.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s also a massive leap forward graphically, with Bloober Team tapping into Unreal Engine 5 and all the cutting edge technology that this features like Lumen for realistic lighting effects and Nanite for exceptionally detailed 3D modelling and texturing.</p>
<p>It had been a while since Silent Hill 2 was first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/20/silent-hill-2-remake-is-using-unreal-engine-5-with-lumen-and-nanite-graphics/">announced back in 2022</a> – of course, it had been heavily rumoured for a good long time before then – but true to their word, it seems that development had been progressing smoothly in the time since then. Sadly there’s no sign of a release date just yet, but this latest look at the game will certainly have horror fans champing at the bit!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/check-out-the-until-dawn-remakes-gameplay-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony shared a first look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/until-dawn">Until Dawn</a> remake coming to for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and PC, confirming that the game is still set to release in late 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Until Dawn - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ownf9ZasITA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Until Dawn is getting the full remake treatment by Ballistic Moon, taking the PS3 cult classic horror game and completely remaking it in Unreal Engine 5, as opposed to the Decima engine of the original.</p>
<p>There will be some updates to both gameplay and narrative, most notably shifting to a third person camera, instead of fixed camera angles, and trying to be more nuanced and emotional with the story. Hopefully it’s still got some of the original’s schlocky teen horror vibes, and this trailer does seem to show it echoing many of the old locations and scenes.</p>
<p>Originally released in 2015, Until Dawn really put Supermassive Games on the map as a horror game developer, and saw them then delve deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of more and more narrative horror through The Dark Pictures Anthology series, The Quarry and more.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review/">original review of Until Dawn</a> in 2015, Jim said, “With its immersive world, branching narrative, and lifelike character work, Until Dawn will have players on the edge of their seats while pounding them with jump scares and a bone-chilling soundtrack. Having previously worked on ports and smaller titles for Sony, Supermassive Games have shown that they can play with the big boys and we can’t wait to see what they come up with next.”</p>

            <p>
Sony has announced a new Astro Bot game during tonight's PlayStation State of Play. It's simply called Astro Bot, is once again developed by Sony's Team Asobi, and launches for PlayStation 5 on 6th September.
</p>
<p>
A charming-enough-looking platformer, this is Astro's first starring role since 2020's PS5 launch title Astro's Playroom. 
</p>
<p>
In the past, Astro has been used as a showcase for Sony's hardware, with Playroom designed to show off the PS5 DualSense, just as 2018's Astro Bot Rescue Mission was built for PlayStation VR. 
</p>
<p>This time, Astro Bot looks a more typical platformer - with sections where Astro can power-up and grow in size... and also dress up as other PlayStation characters such as PaRappa the Rapper, and also... a PlayStation 5 console? And wield Kratos' hammer?! It's clear there's plenty of Sony loving going on here too.</p>
<p>Here's a first look:</p>

			<p><em>Note: This is a developing story. More info about Astro Bot will be added shortly. </em></p>
<p>Among the many quality PlayStation 5 exclusives, few are more underappreciated than <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/astros-playroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro’s Playroom</a>. Sure, it was just a relatively small-scale pack-in title, but Astro’s Playroom was a ton of fun and made better use of the Dualsense controller’s unique features than any game since. In the past week, rumors emerged that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-announcement-soon-may-2024-playstation-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal of a new Astro Bot title was imminent</a>, and it turns out the leakers were right on the money.</p>
<p>During today’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play</a> showcase, we got a first peek at the next entry in Sony’s series, simply titled Astro Bot. The game looks to be an extension of what was established with Astro’s Playroom, offering larger themed platforming worlds to explore. The trailer shows Astro getting around on a rocket-powered glider of sorts shaped like a Dualsense controller, tons of different environments, some massive bosses, and more wildness. In addition to that, we see plenty of PlayStation cameos and references, with a particular focus on old Japan Studio creations like PaRappa the Rapper (although Kratos and others get a nod too).</p>
<p>Best of all, we won't be waiting too long for Astro Bot, as Sony also revealed we’ll be able to get our hands on the game in September. Check out the first Astro Bot trailer for yourself, below.</p>

<p>Astro Bot jumps onto PS5 on Setpember 6. What do you think? Excited to go on another adventure with Sony’s little robot?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168014/monster-hunter-wilds-open-world-gameplay-trailer-state-of-play<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Mi8etX">Capcom has circled back to reveal more about <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, the open-world entry in its beloved <a href="https://www.polygon.com/monster-hunter-guides">Monster Hunter</a> series, after having previously <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/23992308/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date-capcom">revealed the game at The Game Awards 2023</a>. At PlayStation State of Play on Thursday, a new gameplay trailer showed off way more of this massive upcoming title. There’s still no release date — besides just “2025” — but now we know a bit more about how the game looks.</p>
<p id="5J1LOI">The new gameplay trailer introduced what appears to be an ensemble cast of characters, trading quips amongst one another while riding a big boat that somehow is traveling over the sand dunes of a huge desert. A series of shots then depicts these characters exploring a diverse range of environments that are — you guessed it — full of monsters. The trailer then showed some classic-looking Monster Hunter battles, with over-the-shoulder shots of a character who has a vast array of weapons at their disposal.</p>
<p id="DdG4Nu">The Monster Hunter franchise, which celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2024, is comprised of dozens of wildly successful games across every platform — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22356696/monster-hunter-world-board-game-preview-kickstarter-launch-date-price">even the tabletop</a>. The bestselling entry in the franchise, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/guides/2018/1/25/16911176/monster-hunter-world-guide-walkthrough"><em>Monster Hunter: World</em> (2018)</a>, was a huge action-adventure game but didn’t actually feature an open-world — despite the “World” in its title. Its follow-up, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/monster-hunter-rise-guide/22348967/weapons-armor-wirebug-wyvern-riding-best-controller-beginners-tips-tricks"><em>Monster Hunter: Rise</em> (2021)</a>, followed the same formula. Since <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> will have a fully open world, fans can expect more freewheeling exploration through much bigger maps and biomes.</p>
<p id="Ei8YhD">We still don’t know exactly when in 2025 we’ll be exploring the world of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, but we do know the game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X.</p>

  <p id="R0L9KE"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158274/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-date-sony">Sony’s latest State of Play livestream</a> was full of new game announcements and updates for all things PlayStation 5 and PlayStation VR 2 — with a little bit of PlayStation content for PC as well. PlayStation fans got a look at a new game starring the lovable Astro Bot, a new Dynasty Warriors, a release date for the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, and confirmation of a few games making the jump from PC to PS5 (and vice versa).</p>
<p id="F9QQd4">If you couldn’t watch May’s big State of Play showcase live, here’s a recap of all the game announcements, release dates, trailers, and other highlights from Sony’s event.</p>
<h2 id="21zA7f"><strong>Concord gets first gameplay</strong></h2>

<p id="5NgGqk">When Sony <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23736345/playstation-showcase-may-2023-new-games-trailers">showed off <em>Concord</em> at last year’s PlayStation Showcase</a>, we didn’t know what to expect from Firewalk Studios’ multiplayer PvP FPS. Now we do, as Sony and Firewalk showed off a cinematic trailer and in-engine gameplay from the colorful 5v5 competitive hero shooter starring a bunch of alien misfit adventurers. <em>Concord</em> is coming to PS5 and PC on Aug. 23.</p>

  <p id="YN6OT5">Marvel and NetEase Games’ superhero team-based PVP shooter <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24112564/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-trailer-release-date-netease"><em>Marvel Rivals</em> got announced</a> last March and is already in beta on PC. At the PlayStation State of Play livestream on Thursday, fans learned that the game will also be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, with a closed beta coming to the PlayStation platform soon.</p>
<p id="JtgeqQ"><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is a free-to-play game with a huge lineup of Marvel heroes and villains, with 18 characters confirmed thus far: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/26/16898048/marvel-black-panther-movie-comics-avengers-chadwick-boseman">Black Panther</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/27/13058882/doctor-strange-explained">Doctor Strange</a>, Groot, Hulk, Iron Man, Loki, Luna Snow, Magik, Magneto, Mantis, Namor, Peni Parker, Rocket Raccoon, Scarlet Witch, Spider-Man, Storm, Star-Lord, and The Punisher. The premise revolves around converging timelines and multiple Doctor Dooms, with proceedings overseen by Galactus’ daughter Galacta, but really the point of <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is to see these popular and mega-powerful characters teaming up and using their diverse array of abilities in combat.</p>
<p id="SikeEP">In an earlier <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24112564/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-trailer-release-date-netease">interview with Polygon about <em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, game director Thaddeus Sasser — who has also worked on series like Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Ghost Recon for two decades — emphasized that all of those different superpowers are definitely the fun part. “Having magical superpowers in a multiplayer game is something that hasn’t really been done to death,” he said. “It’s still kind of relatively fresh and new, and the way we’re doing it, and some of the tricks we’ve got up our sleeves should be pretty exciting for new players.”</p>

Astro also flies around on a DualSense controller at one point, so I expect that will probably be steered through motion controls. Oh, there’s also a PlayStation 5 space ship. Wait, Kratos just gave Astro his axe? Oh, it looks like he’s teaming up with a bunch of different PlayStation characters. This shit rules. Game of the Year contender, you heard it here first. Unlike <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, it looks like <em>Astro Bot </em>will be a boxed video game you can find on store shelves on September 6.</p><p>Check out the trailer below:</p><p>Astro originates from <em>The Playroom</em>, which was another tech-demo-style experience on the PlayStation 4 that launched alongside the system in 2013. This was followed up with <em>Playroom VR</em>, which held the same purpose but for the PlayStation VR headset in 2016. The character finally got a self-titled game with the excellent <em>Astro Bot Rescue Mission </em>in 2018, a PlayStation VR exclusive. <em>Astro’s Playroom </em>was the first full-fledged game starring Astro that didn’t require a peripheral, and it was a hit, so it’s good to see the little guy get a new game.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Whenever I’ve had a long day, I always find comfort in an ARPG. My go-to right now is Diablo 4, but that’s primarily because I’m waiting for Path of Exile 2. Here is what we know about the Path of Exile 2 Early Access!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-path-of-exile-2-early-access-release-date">What is the Path of Exile 2 Early Access Release Date?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, we don’t yet know the official release date for Path of Exile 2. We don’t even know precisely when the Early Access period begins, besides sometime later this year.</p>



<p>According to the PlayStation State of Play showcase, which revealed additional gameplay, including couch co-op in Path of Exile 2, we’ll get our hands on the ARPG before the year is out.</p>



<p>However, the exact date remains unknown to everyone outside of Grinding Gear Games!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-big-is-path-of-exile-2">How Big is Path of Exile 2?</h2>



<p>From leaks and reveals, Path of Exile 2 promises to be massive, especially compared to the first game. It was so big that, while initially planned as an expansion to the first title, GGG decided to make it a standalone sequel.</p>



<p>The second game features a total of six acts, 100 unique environments, over 600 monsters, and 100 bosses to fight across the massive campaign. All the while, you can play cooperatively with up to six players in total, and there are twelve classes, so no one must double up!</p>

<p>At the State of Play showcase, an all-new trailer was revealed for Path of Exile 2, announcing an early access window kicking off towards the end of 2024. It also uncovered several key elements of the upcoming title, including couch co-op gameplay mechanics and crossplay features.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-the-path">Take the Path</h2>



<p>Fans have been waiting for Path of Exile 2 for some time. Last year, Grinding Gear Games offered a sizeable update on the game as well as a fresh trailer that showcased the work done thus far. It’s a follow-on from 2013’s Path of Exile and it’ll feature an extensive, seven-act campaign that can be played solo or with a friend either online or in a couch co-op setting – which is rarely seen these days.</p>



<p>Here’s the newest trailer for Path of Exile 2:</p>

<p>Sony has officially unveiled the new Astro Bot game, coming exclusively to PlayStation 5 (PS5) on September 6.</p>



<p>A new Astro game had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-planning-new-astro-bot-game-for-2024-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long been rumored</a> for 2024. Just last week, reliable data miner billbil-kun <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-astro-game-announcement-coming-in-next-two-weeks-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said that an announcement</a> on the new game known as Astro Bot would be coming “within 15 days”.</p>



<p>“In this brand-new game, you will explore 6 galaxies and over 80 levels in search of Astro’s scattered crew,” Team Asobi <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/astro-bot-arrives-on-ps5-september-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio director Nicolas Doucet said</a>. “Hold on tight to your Dual Speeder and dive down to each unique planet, from lush forests, sandy beaches, hot volcanoes to more surprising locations such as a gigantic hourglass or the canopy of a singing tree!</p>



<p>“To get help on his mission, Astro can use over 15 new abilities offering unique play styles. Among the many new powers, you will find Barkster, the Bulldog Booster that lets you air-dash and smash through enemies, metal and glass, the Twin-Frog Gloves that offer long-range punching and the ability to swing and the Giant Sponge that lets you suck up water from the environment to grow huge and cause massive (and slightly moist) destruction.”</p>



<p>The new game marks the third title in the franchise from PlayStation. The first, Astro Bot Rescue Mission, was released exclusively for PS VR in 2018 while Astro’s Playroom was released in 2020 and came pre-installed on all PlayStation 5 consoles. This new game isn’t a VR title like the original, instead another platformer like Astro’s Playroom.</p>



<p>In addition to the official announcement, a trailer was released for the game showcasing some gameplay and its location. The game will be exclusive to PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>Capcom has released a new trailer for Monster Hunter Wilds. The first look at the upcoming game was shown as part of the PlayStation State of Play event on Thursday evening.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In addition to the trailer, some new information was revealed about the game, including it’s environment.</p>



<p>“Dynamic, ever-changing environments,” Capcom said. “A story of monsters and humans in a world with two faces: one in which the lands are harsh and unforgiving, where monsters fight for scant resources—and another in which the lands are vibrant and brimming with life.</p>



<p>“You play as a professional monster hunter, protecting the balance of the ecosystem and hunting monsters. Use the resources you gain from hunts to craft ever more powerful weapons and armor in your quest to unravel the mysteries of the new lands.”</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first revealed back</a> at The Game Awards 2023 with a short reveal trailer.

<p>Bloober Team and Sony have released a new trailer for the Silent Hill 2 remake. The trailer debuted during the PlayStation State of Play event on Thursday, and gave a new look into the game for players.</p>

<p>“Having received a letter from his deceased wife, James heads to where they shared so many memories, in the hope of seeing her one more time: Silent Hill,” the trailer’s description reads. “There, by the lake, he finds a woman eerily similar to her…</p>



<p>“‘My name… is Maria,’ the woman smiles. Her face, her voice… She’s just like her. Experience a master-class in psychological survival horror―lauded as the best in the series―on the latest hardware with chilling visuals and visceral sounds.”</p>

<p>Developer Survios has released a new trailer for the upcoming VR game Alien: Rogue Incursion. The trailer was released as part of PlayStation’s State of Play event on Thursday evening.</p>



<p>The trailer isn’t much, but it gives a short new look into the game.</p>

<p>“As reverent fans of the franchise, we know that any Alien video game begins and ends with its deadly Xenomorphs, and those encountered within Alien: Rogue Incursion are definitely ferocious, unpredictable, and terrifying,” Survios’ <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/first-look-at-alien-rogue-incursion-ps-vr2-gameplay-out-holiday-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chief product officer TQ Jefferson said</a>. </p>



<p>“Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn’t tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it’ll bring some friends.&nbsp;“</p>



<p>He added that the game will require strategy in how to survive and that just “blasting your way” won’t always work.<a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53758793774_9d6003bbe2_b.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a></p>



<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion is a single player game launching holiday 2024 for PlayStation VR 2, Meta Quest 3, and Steam. The game, which is built in Unreal Engine, features an “original story that fully surrounds players within the terrors of the&nbsp;Alien&nbsp;universe”, Survios says.</p>

<p>Where Minds Weet was revealed during the Opening Night Live ceremony at Gamescom 2022. Since then, things have been relatively quiet, with the developer – Everstone Studio – not passing up much in the way of information regarding the ‘supernatural swordfighting’ game. In the first trailer that showcased the project, we got an extended look at a game that seemed to replicate a few games in its makeup, namely Assassin’s Creed, Ghost of Tsushima, and Sekiro.</p>



<p>It was confirmed a while ago that Where Winds Meet would be released on PC – but thanks to a new trailer dropping at the PlayStation State of Play event, we know it’s also coming to consoles.</p>

<h2 id="h-winds-meet-on-console">Winds Meet on Console</h2>



<p>In an all-new trailer for Where Winds Meet that was released today during the PlayStation State of Play showcase, we saw characters fighting acrobatically through trees while wielding weapons like umbrellas and swords. That’s all you need to know.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Where&nbsp;Winds&nbsp;Meet - Announce&nbsp;Trailer | PS5 Games" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eqEGZ5AKUwc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Where Winds Meet comes from Everstone Studio, a Chinese developer sitting under the NetEase banner. This is an untested studio, as Where Winds Meet is the team’s first game. On the company website, there’s a lot of information about what is assumed to be <strong>this game</strong>, but it’s in Chinese and translating the page doesn’t yield too much in the way of tangible results.</p>



<p>Regardless, the latest trailer is all we need to confirm the biggest piece of news regarding Where Winds Meet since 2022 – it’s coming to consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/astro-bot-announced-for-ps5<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>ASTRO BOT</em> is described as “a brand-new, supersized <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,501 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>” set across “more than 50 exciting and diverse worlds.”</p><div><p>Hi everyone! On behalf of Team Asobi, I have the immense pleasure to unveil our new game <em>ASTRO BOT</em> coming to PlayStation 5.</p><p>A video speaks a thousand words so please check out our first trailer to see the game in <a title="Genres > Action [1,862 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>.</p><p>Since making an appearance at the launch of PlayStation 5, ASTRO has introduced many players to the magic of <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [45,137 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a>. We received a ton of heart-warming comments about how much fun the game was, how it utilized the DualSense wireless controller in fun ways and how it paid tribute to 25 years of PlayStation history. From the bottom of our robotic hearts, thank you very much for all your support!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We listened to your comments and now, ASTRO  is back in a super-sized space adventure, his biggest to date.</p><p>In this brand-new game, you will explore 6 galaxies and over 80 levels in search of ASTRO’s scattered crew. Hold on tight to your Dual Speeder and dive down to each unique planet, from lush forests, sandy beaches, hot volcanoes to more surprising locations such as a gigantic hourglass or the canopy of a singing tree!</p><p>To get help on his mission, ASTRO can use over 15 new abilities offering unique play styles. As you would expect from an <em>ASTRO</em> game, these take full advantage of the DualSense controller, its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers so you can feel every little step along the journey. Among the many new powers, you will find Barkster, the Bulldog Booster that lets you air-dash and smash through enemies, metal and glass, the Twin-Frog Gloves that offer long-range punching and the ability to swing and the Giant Sponge that lets you suck up water from the environment to grow huge and cause massive (and slightly moist) destruction. Combined with improved ASTRO controls, these new powers take the ASTRO platforming experience to new heights, while remaining accessible for all. We can’t wait for you to get your hands on these and let us know how they feel.</p><p>We also cranked up the number of baddies too with over 70 new types, including massive bosses at the end of each galaxy. Special mention to the deadly cobra queen Lady Venomara who appears in the trailer, waiting for you in her golden lair. Defeating each boss will uncover a wonderful secret but we don’t want to spoil that, so our lips are sealed😊. And for the brave ones of you craving even more challenge, the game comes packed with die-and-retry levels to test your reflexes.</p><p>But that’s not all, during this epic adventure, ASTRO will reunite with many friends from the PlayStation universe. The trailer shows only a few but we double down on the cast and hope to delight every PlayStation fan out there. And who knows, maybe this time, these characters will play an even bigger part in saving the day?  (wink)</p><p>That’s all for now. Thank you for reading. At Team ASOBI, we believe in the second-to-second fun and joy of video games. And with this new <em>ASTRO BOT</em> game, we invested all our love and craft to bring a constant smile to your face, as you run, jump, bop enemies and find the many secrets and jokes we dotted around.  We will be waiting for you on September 6!</p><p>We’ll be back soon with more details about the game as well as pre-orders opening up June 7. Until then, power up your DualSense, Team ASOBI and ASTRO are taking you on a PlayStation space adventure to remember!</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>
