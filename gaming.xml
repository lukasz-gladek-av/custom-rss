            <p>If the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem is not enough newness for all you zombie-loving fans, then I have some good news. Today, a new strategy game based on Capcom's Resi series has been announced.</p>
<p>It's known as Resident Evil Survival Unit, and is set for release across mobile devices. While Survival Unit is being co-developed by Aniplex Inc and Joycity Corporation, Capcom is working in "close collaboration" with the studios to "ensure authenticity and quality".</p>

<p>Details on what the game will look like and involve for now remain somewhat mysterious, though we can look forward to finding out more later this month, with a showcase planned for 10th July. It will take place at 11pm UK time.</p>
<p>The studios have said Resident Evil Survival Unit will "appeal to both longtime fans and new players". While we don't yet have a release date, it will be available globally across Japan, South Korea, North America, Europe, and Asia whenever it does arrive.</p>
<p>Along with this info, some artwork for Resident Evil Survival Unit was shared, showing a car driving down a road as a lightning storm rages. To one side, a sign for Umbrella - yes, that rather questionable corporation - declares that "our business is life itself…". The two people on the sign smile away. Oh, what poor sweet fools.</p>
<p>In terms of the Resi timeline, Umbrella itself went defunct in 2003, following the Raccoon Trials. Given this, we can perhaps surmise from the artwork that Resident Evil Survival Unit at least takes place before that time.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the series,  we got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem last month, when Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>. The developer once considered having Leon Kennedy take on the protagonist role for Requiem, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">in the end decided he was "actually quite a bad match for horror"</a>.</p>
<p>Our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/another-new-resident-evil-game-has-been-announced]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dying Light developer Techland has confirmed there have been no staff reductions following the reported cancellation of two in-development games.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pb.pl/techland-z-potezna-strata-za-2024-r-1244492">Pulz Biznesu</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/dying-light-developer-techland-cancels-two-upcoming-games-including-its-new-fantasy-rpg-ip">GameWatcher</a>), the developer published record losses of 135m zl (£27.4m) for 2024, as per the <a href="https://ekrs.ms.gov.pl/rdf/pd/search_df">Polish National Court Register</a>. While the two projects have not been named, it's presumed one is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/techland-working-on-open-world-fantasy-action-rpg">fantasy RPG revealed in May 2022</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement to Eurogamer, a spokesperson for Techland said: "Game development is never a straight line, and sometimes fresh approaches are necessary to make great games. What's important here is that none of the reported changes have resulted in staff reductions. Developers were moved to other projects and are working on a number of games in our pipeline.</p>

<p>"Our primary focus right now is to release Dying Light: The Beast for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. After the launch of Dying Light: The Beast, we will share more about future titles in due time."</p>
<p>Little is known about the fantasy RPG, though the company recruited top talent from the likes of CD Projekt Red, Arkane, and Guerrilla Games.</p>
<p>"We're very happy with what we have accomplished with the Dying Light franchise so far," said Paweł Marchewka, Techland CEO, at the time of the game's announcement.</p>
<p>"At the same time, our ambition is to introduce a brand new IP that is vastly different from what we have been doing for the past several years. We want to create a fully next-gen experience. A new fantasy epic set in a sprawling open world, fueled by the skills and experience we have gained as a team over the years, infused with new ideas, passion, and creativity."</p>
<p>Although the record losses are significant, Techland's most recently released game was Dying Light 2 back in 2022. The first Dying Light, released in 2015, was a massive hit for the company, selling 20m copies as of 2022. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-2-has-surpassed-5m-copies-sold-since-launching-in-february">sequel sold 5m in around two months</a>.</p>
<p>The company's next release will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-coming-out-on-25-august-revealed-at-summer-game-fest">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, coming 22nd August.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/techland-teases-multiple-unannounced-dying-light-projects-including-board-games-and-a-webcomic">Techland announced it would be releasing multiple projects in the Dying Light series</a>, including board games and a webcomic. Following these new cancellations, it seems the company is focusing on its most successful franchise.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-studio-techland-cancels-two-in-development-games-clarifies-no-staff-reductions]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Stop Killing Games campaign's petition to the European Commission has hit a major milestone, surpassing a million signatures. However, the YouTuber behind this effort to stop companies from rendering games unplayable by shutting down their servers is still asking for more folks to get their pens out and sign, due to concerns about fakery.</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, Ross Scott originally launched <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">back in 2024</a>, after Ubisoft pulled racing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> offline. Cue a lot of debates about terms of service which tell folks that when you buy a game, you're not buying permanent access to it, but rather <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">a license to play it</a> for as long as it exists.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">European Citizens' Initiative</a> has crossed 1 million signatures. Except it hasn't," Scott announced in a video update uploaded to his channel Accursed Farms yesterday.</p>
<p>"This is going to kill morale, but there are two things going on here. The first we knew was coming. Every time somebody makes a mistake when they sign the Initiative, their signature gets invalidated. So that means we need more signatures to make up for everybody's mistakes."</p>
<p>"That could be a lot," he continued, "I've heard 10% minimum, 20% is better, 40% should be really safe." The second issue is that Scott says he's "received several reports of people claiming to [have spoofed] signatures on the initiative site."</p>

<p>"First off, I want to say that this is not a Change.org petition. This is a government process," Scott continues. "Spoofing signatures on it is a crime. Please do not do this."</p>
<p>It's unclear at this point whether any folks spoofing signatures on the EU petition might end up being prosecuted for doing so, but it won't invalidate the campaign as a whole. However, the fact Scott's even heard talk of such a thing has left him unsure of exactly how many real signatures he's got. He reckons there are "at least 600–700k" at current.</p>
<p>Hence him <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1940798871678210158">asking for EU citizens</a> to keep on signing legitimately. As of writing, the EU petition is at 1,091,165 signatures, with a million having been the goal that would lead the European Commission to at least look into the issue.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Stop Killing Games also has a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074/">UK petition</a>, which currently has just over 150k signatures, and looks set to receive a date when it'll be debated in parliament soon. That said, the UK Government have already issued a response to that petition back in February, which reads: "There are no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games. Those selling games must comply with existing requirements in consumer law and we will continue to monitor this issue."</p>
<p>"I would bet money on the EU initiative delivering something good if it passes, but the UK has been more about exhausting all options," Scott says in the video. He adds regarding that previous response from UK politicians: "A member of Parliament could sneeze on the petition, and that would not be a worse answer."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Stop Killing Games</u></a> initiative has reached the crucial 1 million signatures milestone in its quest to preserve video games for decades to come, but its fight isn’t over yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The self-described consumer movement soared past the goal yesterday, July 3, cementing its status as an impressive petition in gaming history and a movement that has plenty of gas left in the tank. It’s all in the name of protecting the video games players love – and even the ones they don’t – as the industry steadily marches toward a digital future.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">A lot of games we buy today are built to just stop working when the publisher pulls the plug on em. It needs to stop. If you are EU citizen please consider signing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stopkillinggames?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#stopkillinggames</a> initiative. <a href="https://t.co/vlyIEXcpnh" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/vlyIEXcpnh</a> <a href="https://t.co/nsTusFyGrL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/nsTusFyGrL</a></p>— Pat_ (@Pat8_8) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pat8_8/status/1940300022526222441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Social media feeds have since filled with reactions from supporters praising an operation that could help save multiplayer and single-player games for future generations. While gamers take to the internet to celebrate, spokesperson and organizer Ross Scott says reaching 1 million signatures is good news but far from a victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“OK, the breaking news: The European Citizens’ Initiative has crossed 1 million signatures – except it hasn’t,” Scott said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmkCQJrc9n4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a video update</u></a> uploaded yesterday. “This is going to kill morale, but there are two things going on here. The first we knew was coming. Every time somebody makes a mistake when they sign the Initiative, their signature gets invalidated. So that means we need more signatures to make up for everybody’s mistakes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an important variable in the equation on the road to 1 million legitimate Stop Killing Games endorsements, and it’s just one flaw to consider. The other involves reports Scott has received regarding fabricated signatures that could be artificially inflating the initiative’s progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First off, I want to say that this is not a Change.org petition,” Scott adds. “This is a government process. Spoofing signatures on it is a crime. Please do not do this. They’ll be checked later by the EU commission, and my guess is the fake ones will get turned over to the Europol or Interpol, and they’ll follow up on this.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">To anyone who made a mistake or isn't sure if they signed the EU initiative already, you can contact the official spokesperson (Daniel Ondruska) and he can direct you on how to reach the EU to sort it out. His contact is on the page under "more info"<a href="https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U</a></p>— Accursed Farms (@accursedfarms) <a href="https://twitter.com/accursedfarms/status/1941018169977852169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">To account for what could be a significant number of invalid Stop Killing Games signatures, the initiative has altered its ideal goal to be 1.4 million signatures. At the time of this story’s publication, Stop Killing Games has reached 1.07 million endorsements ahead of its July 31 end date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, yeah, that sucks,” Scott continued. “We’ll just keep plodding away unless we can figure out what the safe numbers are. Sorry this isn’t a big victory celebration. This is just kind of suspenseful and tense instead, and will probably hurt the morale of people signing.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save States</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Scott, who has created gaming content via his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Accursed_Farms" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Accursed Farms</u></a> YouTube channel for more than a decade, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>launched</u></a> Stop Killing Games in April 2024 as a direct response to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-crew-delisted-from-all-digital-storefronts-servers-shut-down-early-2024"><u>Ubisoft’s decision to shut down its popular open-world racing game, The Crew</u></a>. The movement aims to create a ripple effect that could shake the industry into keeping games online long after players lose interest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It means everything from The Crew to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-concords-servers-now-closed-fans-wonder-if-itll-return-as-free-to-play-at-least-one-expert-has-doubts"><u>Concord</u></a> could theoretically remain online to enjoy should the initiative amass enough public complaints to see the European Commission pass a law protecting consumer rights. Ideally, players could see live-service and multiplayer titles like BioWare’s Anthem, which was given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-will-shut-down-anthem-in-january"><u>a shutdown schedule</u></a> just yesterday, could continue on in some form should a publisher decide to sunset support. Success could also mean single-player games that rely on online components, such as Death Stranding or Dark Souls, could remain intact, too.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>WEAK</p><p>I know Anthem got panned, but it's another example of one that seems like it had a cool looking world to run around in. I was interested in trying it out and keeping my expectations low. Yet another example of why SKG is so needed.<a href="https://t.co/fDsq0ZsP8K" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/fDsq0ZsP8K</a></p></div>— Accursed Farms (@accursedfarms) <a href="https://twitter.com/accursedfarms/status/1940891094214226104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Stop Killing Games wants to save the art that developers pour their hearts into while protecting consumers who prefer to access games they’ve already paid for, and it’s a movement that hundreds of thousands of game players are already supporting. Following its promising launch last year, however, the initiative struggled to maintain the support it needed to push its way through to the eyes that needed to see it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stop Killing Games’ chances at a successful campaign became so dire that Scott went as far as to publish a video titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfRLujXtUo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The end of Stop Killing Games</u></a>” just last week. In the hour-long explainer piece, Scott listed a lack of exposure as one primary cause behind the lack of support. It was the Hail Mary the initiative needed, though, as prominent YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_5WIzkM0r8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jacksepticeye</u></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJpTCitKqw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>penquinz0/Cr1TiKaL</u></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlmulltSgWg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ludwig</u></a>, and more were quick to voice their support with their own videos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All within the weeks since Scott shared his concerns, Stop Killing Games has gained hundreds of thousands of signatures, resulting in a solid chunk of the more than 1 million names attached to the movement today. Success remains uncertain even if Scott is able to reach that magic 1.4 million number, with even more uncertainty lying on the other side of that goal post. Still, as outlined by Scott on the Stop Killing Games website, he feels optimistic about the future of game preservation if the signature goal is met.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If we can pass the signature threshold," Scott says, "there is a very strong chance that the European Commission will pass new law that will both protect consumer rights to retain video games that customers have purchased and advance preservation efforts massively."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Should the word get out to enough interested individuals, players could see somewhat of a return to the days when buying a game came with the assurance that it would remain playable regardless of post-launch interference.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the video game cancelations and studio closures that have come as a result of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">Microsoft’s devastating round of layoffs this week</a> is concern about the fate of pretty much every Xbox game without a firm release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft games canceled as part of the cuts include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox">Rare’s Everwild</a>, an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say">unannounced MMO from ZeniMax Online Studios</a>, the developer of The Elder Scrolls Online, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">the Perfect Dark Reboot</a>. The latter's developer, The Initiative, was shut down. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-says-warcraft-rumble-wont-get-any-new-content-as-microsoft-layoffs-hit-development-team">The team working on Blizzard’s mobile game Warcraft Rumble was laid off as new content ceased</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, external developers who were funded by Microsoft were also hit. Romero Games, the studio founded by Doom co-creator John Romero and Brenda Romero, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/update-romero-games-employee-says-whole-studio-subject-to-layoffs-after-microsoft-pulls-funding-for-new-shooter-from-doom-co-creator-john-romero">has suffered significant layoffs and the future of its new shooter is in doubt</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot to take in, but it begs the question: which Xbox Game Studios games remain? And which, if any, were quietly canceled?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a memo sent to all Microsoft gaming staff and viewed by IGN this week, Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, said Microsoft still has "more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, a source told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> that every game featured at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced">the Xbox Games Showcase presentation in June</a> is continuing on. So, what were those games, which we now assume are safe — at least for the time being?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was at the show, and is certain to come out later this year (despite the layoffs hitting its various developers). inXile game Clockwork Revolution starred at the show, so that’s safe. Obsidian’s Grounded 2 and The Outer Worlds 2 were at the show and we should assume are both safe. It's a similar deal for Double Fine’s Keeper, The Coalition’s Gears of War: Reloaded, Ninja Gaiden 4, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s Order of the Giants DLC. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4, and the ROG Xbox Ally, both at the show, will continue too. Despite the cancelation of Everwild, Rare’s Sea of Thieves continues with new updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the showcase, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-teases-return-of-halo-in-2026-and-its-reportedly-a-halo-combat-evolved-remaster">Xbox boss Phil Spencer teased Forza, Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, and a Halo: Combat Evolved remake for 2026</a>. We assume since those games were mentioned, they’re safe,  although it’s worth noting that the Forza mentioned by Spencer no doubt relates to the next Forza Horizon game from Playground, which is also making Fable. Turn 10, which makes the more sim-focused Forza games, was hit hard by the layoffs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we know which games Microsoft still intends to release. But, given the events of this week, it’s now impossible to think about other Xbox games in the works without a degree of concern. Everwild and Perfect Dark were conspicuous by their absence at last month's show and both were canceled. What else failed to turn up?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Minecraft — remember Microsoft owns Minecraft! — remains huge and safe as houses, you feel. But what about Contraband from Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios? Where’s Undead Labs’ State of Decay 3? Ninja Theory’s Project Mara? Microsoft has a Hideo Kojima game, OD, on its books. Is that still happening? Toys for Bob, the Crash Bandicoot 4 developer and Call of Duty support studio that left the Xbox-owned Activision in February 2024, signed an agreement with Xbox directly to publish its next game. Is that still alive?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what about Bethesda? ZOS’s MMO has fallen by the wayside, but surely Bethesda Game Studios' The Elder Scrolls VI and the next Fallout are fine. Starfield’s promised next expansion feels precarious, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-starfields-xbox-no-show-even-its-most-loyal-fans-are-starting-to-worry-bethesda-makes-it-so-hard-to-defend-this-game">given Bethesda's radio silence on the game</a>. And what about Blizzard? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm">As of last year it was reportedly hard at work on a StarCraft shooter</a>. Is that still the case?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s only when you run through what <em>wasn’t</em> at the Xbox Games Showcase last month that you realize what’s at stake here: Microsoft owns a huge number of development studios across the globe, from Bethesda to Blizzard and Activision to Halo. When Xbox suffers significant problems, a huge swathe of the video game industry and its developers do, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on August's gamescom, where Microsoft is expected to show more of what is has coming down the line. Perhaps Phil Spencer will give fans a clear idea of what’s in the works from Xbox and what isn't as Microsoft's multiplatform push soldiers on. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-first-party-next-generation-xbox-consoles-announces-deal-with-amd-and-promises-full-backwards-compatibility-with-your-existing-xbox-library">It is still planning to release a next-gen Xbox console</a>, although we don't know when. Is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-release-an-xbox-handheld-but-its-years-away">the first-party Xbox handheld Spencer teased</a> last year also still alive? Does Microsoft still plan to release its own gaming app store, despite the failure of <a href="https://in.ign.com/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile/231166/news/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-activision-shuts-down-its-battle-royale-mobile-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call of Duty Warzone Mobile</a>, Warcraft Rumble, and this week's significant cuts to Candy Crush maker King? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the short term, at least, the games we saw in June are still on the way. But the long term future of Xbox remains vague indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

			<p>AMD FSR 4 running on PlayStation 5 Pro promises to be more interesting than anticipated, judging from what a well-known insider revealed recently.</p>



<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF forums, known AMD insider KeplerL2 commented on the recent announcement that the next version of the AMD upscaler is coming to PlayStation 5 Pro next year, saying that the system cannot run the model that is being used by the upscaler to run on RDNA4 GPUs. Sony and AMD started working on the mid-generation refresh before AMD decided to move FSR to an ML model, and when the company made the switch, the PlayStation 5 Pro design was done with no FP8 support. As such, it will be very interesting to see how running the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr4-ps5-pro-2026-rdna5/">full-fat version of the upscale</a>r on the system will be achieved.</p>



<p>Those expecting to see games that support the AI-powered PSSR on PlayStation 5 Pro to automatically support AMD FSR 4 without developer intervention, however, may be disappointed. As far as KeplerL2 <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/ps5-pro-is-getting-a-big-upgrade-in-2026-%E2%80%94-i-asked-mark-cerny-what%E2%80%99s-coming-and-why-amd%E2%80%99s-future-pc-gpus-feel-more-playstation-than-ever.1685909/post-270585067">knows</a>, the current version of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler doesn't allow system-level DLL swaps, so there's a very likely chance that developers will have to update already released games if they want to take advantage of AMD FSR 4 once it becomes available for the system in 2026.</p>



<p>Besides offering the aforementioned AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, whose implementation has been hit and miss, depending on the game, the PlayStation 5 Pro offers other improvements that make it the system of choice to enjoy PS5 games at their very best. You can learn more about the system by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The studio making underwater survival game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> have promised fans that "nothing has changed" despite a recent drastic change in leadership at the company. The game is still planned to be a single player survival adventure with optional co-op.</p>
<p>"Nothing has changed with how the game is structured," said a <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">statement posted to Unknown World's website</a> yesterday. "It will remain a single-player first experience, with optional co-operative multiplayer. No subscriptions. No loot boxes. No battle pass. No microtransactions." Okay nameless statement, this still dosn't clear anything up.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We know that you have a lot of questions and concerns about the news from our publisher regarding the leadership changes at Unknown Worlds," it begins, and then spends eight paragraphs not answering those questions. "We’re also supporting Steve Papoutsis as he transitions into his role as CEO at Unknown Worlds. He’s already expressed his excitement to check out everything we’ve been working on."

</p><p>Earlier this week Krafton, the publishers who own Unknown Worlds, announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">three senior staff members were being replaced by an executive</a> from one of their other studios. Steve Papoutsis, who worked on sci-fi horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a>, is now the CEO of the studio. Those leaving include studio co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max MacGuire. </p>
<p>In the press release which made that announcement, there were some lines about a renewed commitment to "achieving regular milestones". The subtext is that Krafton believed Unknown Worlds were not working fast enough. Their new guy, they suggest, will commit to regular checks from on-high.</p>

<p>"These reviews, based on clearly defined metrics and targets, will help ensure that games meet both creative and quality standards. This process is essential to delivering the right game at the right time. Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations."</p>
<p>Fans of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> (hi) are squinting heavily at the megapublisher with untrusting eyes. Hence yesterday's damage control in the form of a "letter to our community", which is mostly a defence of incoming CEO Papoutsis and his benefactors at Krafton.</p>
<p>"We want to reassure you that KRAFTON feels strongly about supporting that vision at the studio, as we continue to navigate the game toward Early Access," the letter continues. "While we work closely with Steve and get him up to speed with all the amazing work the team has already done on Subnautica 2, we also understand that it means we’ll need to ask you to remain a little patient and support us as he comes on board."</p>
<p>They go on to promise that a new schedule and early access timeline will be coming soon, but still don't answer any obvious questions about this whole drama. Ousting the long-serving leaders of a studio and installing a former EA producer who presided over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-hardline">Battlefield Hardline</a> is a drastic assertion of control. So what happened? Why kick out those three specific people? Should more people expect to be laid off? Will the team face the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-callisto-protocol-proves-that-crunch-is-dumb">reportedly disastrous crunch conditions that affected The Callisto Protocol</a>? No answers are forthcoming.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Unknown Worlds saying "no loot boxes" is like a cereal company saying "we don't plan to add any mice to this batch of corn flakes". I, uh, never thought you were going to? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The studio promises not to fill the game with lootboxes, and okay, thanks? Lootboxes are not the real worry, and the game is reportedly so far along in development it would likely be technically unfeasible to introduce such features anyway. The real worry is that the culture, morale, and day-to-day working experience at Unknown Worlds may alter for the worse. </p>
<p>A final wrinkle in the story: former studio head Charlie Cleveland says he is "Now making some films!" on LinkedIn. This comes after he recently moved to LA and set up a movie company, the website for which is awash with <a href="https://www.abyssal.co/nutmeg-mistletoe">generative AI movie posters</a> and <a href="https://www.abyssal.co/zeroes">wonky-faced placeholder images</a>. Which I imagine might distract someone from actual game development. But unless anyone involved speaks plainly about this messy situation, all we will have is speculation.</p>

		<p>As we get to another Friday and the weekend beckons once more, I get to annoy the whole team by asking them over the same question I ask every week: what have you played? I’ve played a few different things this week, though Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma keeps taking my time while I build up all my villages and try to make all the characters my friends. Other than that, I was able to check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/01/formula-legends-preview-an-arcade-racing-love-letter-to-f1/">Formula Legends</a>, which looks like it’ll be a great arcade racer.</p>

<p>Firstly, a little note to say congratulations to Ade and Jim, whose <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playingwithhistory/playing-with-history-pixels-polygons-and-the-past">Playing With History Kickstarter project</a> achieved its funding this week! We can’t wait to read it!</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> played a little Destiny 2, lots of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/">Death Stranding 2</a>, and started Atomfall. Speaking of the latter, he says, “It’s not as shooty as I would like there’s a lot of wandering around and sneaking. Also I have a big problem with the way it gives you quests. It puts markers on the map where to go but you have to manually add a marker to track it when running about. Stupid game, either give quest locations or don’t!”</p>


<p>TC’s adventures in games continued, but he didn’t get on with Starship Troopers, telling us, “I just fired up Starship Troopers. And then turned it off again. Looking down your sights on a gun means the gun – and I’m not exaggerating here – takes up almost a quarter of the screen. Blocks out a huge area so you can’t see what your shooting at. Who on earth designed that game???” Here’s hoping he finds something he likes to play this week.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has had a very nostalgic week, continuing his Metroid series run through taking in the “excellent” fan-made AMR2, saying, “It’s a worthy alternative to Nintendo’s own Samus Returns (although the latter is probably more akin to where they went with Dread) and the seminal Super Metroid.” He continues, “The SNES game is rightfully lauded, but there are a few too many crucial paths hidden in places that seem wilfully obtuse. I also finished a run of Lost in Random: The Eternal Die and may well carry on to try and unlock all the relics etc. Finally I finished the neat Crypt Custodian, started Recore as my daily Xbox Rewards game and got deep into the world of Gex for an upcoming review.”</p>
<p><strong>Reuben</strong> has been playing pretty much only JRPGs, telling us, “They give me the happy brain chemicals that I’m not getting anywhere else! I’ve been jumping back and forth between the incredible Metaphor ReFantazio and the recent HD Remaster release of Bravely Default (one of my all-time favourite games).”</p>
<p>I think <strong>Nic</strong> is probably planning an intervention for Reu after hearing that, but maybe he’s been distracted by playing Final Fantasy MTG. He told us, “This set is sweet as hell. I’m going to be so sad when it’s not the current set in a few weeks time”.</p>

<p>Giving in and buying a Switch 2, <strong>Jason&nbsp;</strong>started off by working through the 50CC category of Mario Kart World to test out some of the new stuff and get a vibe for it all. He also showed off the free roam to his kids so they could see the dinosaurs. Besides that, he’s also been playing Cyberpunk 2077, and a bit of Atlas Fallen too.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Chaos The Game, aka Strangers of Paradise Final Fantasy Origins. He says, “The combat has been fun but this game just throws loot at you and that can be overwhelming. The story is a bit mad too but I do like how Jack has no time for long speeches and spiels. Particularly liked when a villain was introducing themselves and he just said I don’t give a fuck who you are and punched him.” Top-tier Final Fantasy dialogue right there.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> finished Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 this week, and said, “Whilst the combat never quite clicked for me, the storyline was majestic, with some stellar plot twists that compelled me to see it through to its satisfying conclusion’. That’s not all because he also indulged in som sci-fi co-op action,&nbsp; “I also completed Revenge of the Savage Planet with Laura, and we enjoyed it! The balmy plot left us totally baffled but all the co-op metroidvaniaing was top-notch entertainment.”</p>

<p>Speaking of <strong>Laura</strong>, welcome to our newest writer, who only vaguely admitted to knowing Ade. She told us, “I started playing Atomfall this week, after watching Ade play it and getting itchy fingers when he didn’t play it the way I wanted it to be played! He told me I should get a baseball bat. So in true “independent woman” style, I levelled up and got myself a spiked baseball bat instead! I also completed my first TSA review, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/rooftops-alleys-review/">Rooftops &amp; Alleys</a>, in which I spent most my time doing flips and landing on my noggin. Good times!”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been chipping away at Split/Second, saying, “It’s still proving equal parts fun and challenging. Before moving onto the next big game from my backlog I decided to finally play through Limbo – I’m super curious what the team at Playdead having been making after all these years.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> as usual, who’s been able to dip back into FBC: Firebreak and continues to find it a rather unusual riff on the co-op shooter, shared some thoughts on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/01/can-donkey-kong-bananzas-smash-happy-platforming-make-the-switch-2-sing/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and has had a sudden urge to rewatch the Stargate movie…</p>
<p><em>And finally, what about you? What have you played?</em></p>

            <p>January 12th, 2026. It's my next birthday, and also now the date that BioWare exosuit shooter Anthem will finally be taken offline. I very much assume the two things are unrelated.</p>
<p>The live-service thing that EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-are-canceling-their-anthem-overhaul-to-focus-on-mass-effect-and-dragon-age">abandoned doing live-service stuff for</a> not that long after its <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">well-documentedly difficult development</a> was followed by a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anthem-review">lukewarm release</a> is finally going the way of the dodo.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"After careful consideration, we will be sunsetting Anthem on January 12, 2026," EA wrote in <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update">a post</a> on their website, "This means that the game will still be playable online for the next 180+ days. As of today, you can no longer purchase in-game premium currency, but you can still use your remaining balance until the servers go offline."</p>
<p>"We deeply appreciate your dedication, passion and support over the years and we’d like to thank you for that," the publisher added, also letting us know that this shutdown isn't resulting in any layoffs. It might seem a strange clarification to make - Anthem hasn't been a going concern for years and EA have already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">sliced BioWare's staff</a> post-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Veilguard</a>, but I guess the company have just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">read the room</a> for once and want to make clear any potential consequences for the developers, rather than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">sliding around the subject</a> as they have in other announcements.</p>
<p>Once that plug's pulled, Anthem will cease to be playable since it's an online-only affair. That means you've got roughly 192 days to do as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oh-huh-biowares-exosuit-shooter-anthem-is-still-online">our Alice O did back in 2023</a> - suddenly remember that Anthem exists and hop in to give it a go like you're taking one last joyride in an old car that'll never get the work done to stop it imminently being resigned to the scrapyard.</p>
<p>She wrote the following of that sojourn to the abandoned kingdom of Anthem:</p>
<blockquote>Is Anthem good? No. It's a looter-shooter with boring loot and perfunctory shoot. But I like parts," "Flying my cool-looking exosuit around is pleasant, lazily swooping around the skies of an alien world. It's an involved movement too, because the suit slowly heats up and you need to regularly cool it by diving downwards or flying through waterfalls and such. I'm always happy when simply getting about involves playful little motions. And I'm kind of interested in some of the traditionally BioWare-y NPC chatter and storybits going on back at the hub base? But the rest of the game's not good enough for me to persist.</blockquote>
<p>Actually, I've just checked and assuming you don't already own it, you'll need to pay for an EA Play subscription to try <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/anthem/buy/pc">Anthem on PC</a> before its song is sung. The game's also set to be removed from that service in 43 days' time, as of writing, so your window's suddenly gotten a lot smaller.</p></div>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/54e84460ce293/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With the addition of a fan in the Switch 2's dock, we all knew that Nintendo's new console would probably kick out a bit more heat than its predecessor in order to manage the more technically demanding games.</p>
<p>According to some folks in Japan, however (thanks, <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/japanese-users-complain-about-overheating-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-and-noisy-fans/">Nintendo Soup</a>), their consoles are actually overheating. Multiple users have taken to X to relay instances in which their games have crashed, the consoles' fans have gone into overdrive, or, in one case, their system simply became too hot to hold.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xoqtwy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>User <a href="https://x.com/x1010_q" tabindex="-1">@x1010_q</a> stated (via machine translation) "Switch 2 overheating. Too intense, I couldn’t even hold the console. Without a fan, you can’t play for long". Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/JPSjxSmUMy170" tabindex="-1">@JPSjxSmUMy170</a> simply said "Switch 2 is overheating; the fan noise is annoying".</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear whether the Switch 2 consoles are definitely, irrefutably overheating in these cases, however. As demonstrated with <a href="https://x.com/p_typhoon" tabindex="-1">@p_typhoon</a>'s tweet below, they merely mention that "The fan's going nuts" after an instance of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> crashing, but we can't say for sure that this is the root cause:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First freeze on Switch 2.<br>
Talked to an old man in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, and it froze.<br>
The screen's still moving (background grass swaying in the wind), but I can't control anything.<br>
The fan's going nuts, so maybe it's overheating.<br>
Auto-save saved my butt...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also important to keep in mind the environmental conditions in which the Switch 2 is being played. <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68567/~/nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2-dock-becomes-hot-and-stops-outputting-to-tv-or-charging">Nintendo itself advises</a> that users should "not place the console near a heat source, or in a location where heat can easily build up", while also ensuring that "the air vent on the dock is not covered or obstructed".</p>
<p>So this is clearly a <em>potential</em> issue that Nintendo is very much aware of. We can certainly attest to the console getting rather warm after a certain amount of time but – touch wood – we've not yet had any instances of the Switch 2 overheating.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NetEase Games made a lot of significant <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-exceeds-230000-peak-players-since-release-devs-tease-major-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Once Human</a> announcements during yesterday's Global Annual Showcase. Annual version 2.0 is now available and every player can claim 11 Lightforge Ingots for free by participating in the new events and completing tasks. Players can earn additional rewards through in-game activities, such as playing the Dreamland Wonder mini-games, rescuing the giant Chefosaurus Rex, and checking in daily.</p>



<p>The developers also launched a new PvE scenario called Endless Dream. It's a Nightmare-themed world filled with bizarre, psychedelic elements, such as CRT TVs and abandoned amusement parks. This haunted, odd world is filled with secrets waiting to be uncovered.</p>



<p>The entire world map is available from the start in Endless Dream. This strange world is a shattered reflection of the subconscious, divided into Dream Zones and Nightmare Areas. To survive, players must face supernatural environmental hazards and be wary of the new Confusion mechanic.</p>



<p>Those who wish to purify the Dream Zones must contend with their guardians: Light Dreamers, Deep Dreamers, and the most lethal of all, Eternal Dreamers. These new Deviants include Agony, a humanoid/transformer hybrid that emits electricity; Misery, a statue with flowers growing within its body that attacks by detonating itself; and Naivety, an adorable teddy bear with a haunted TV in its belly.</p>



<p>Once Human players have the power to shape the land in the Endless Dream. They can freely build offensive and defensive structures without territorial restrictions. Exploring the world and conquering its nightmares unlocks additional traits and influences the outcome through a real-time, five-stage dynamic progression based on how efficiently players purge the nightmares. This results in one of multiple endings.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>NetEase also provided updates on console ports and a spin-off. When it comes to consoles, Once Human is set to launch in 2026 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X, with the ports nearing completion.</p>



<p>As for the PvP spin-off, Once Human: RaidZone is set to launch on July 30 and it's all about combat. Players start with nothing and must gather weapons and building materials from the land. Forming alliances with other players is necessary, but only temporary. You must pick your allies carefully and be ready to turn on them when needed.</p>



<p>The entire RaidZone map is unrestricted, and players can strike each other's bases at any time. The Deviation Powers from the base game have also been reworked for the PvP experience, so players can unleash the might of Deviations on their foes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/some-switch-2-units-are-overheating-according-to-reports.1235811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to several <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/japanese-users-complain-about-overheating-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-and-noisy-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a>, most of which are coming from Japan, some Nintendo Switch 2 units may be overheating. At least, that's what users are assuming when they see sudden freezes and crashes while the console's fans run at max speed in the vain attempt to cool down the hardware.</p>



<p>This happens with all kinds of Nintendo Switch 2 games, from the most taxing ones like CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077 to way less complex titles like Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma.</p>



<p>A few reports came in from Western gamers, too. Reddit user NitroWalrus732 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l4918o/switch_2_overheating/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/nintendo-switch-2-units-allegedly-overheating-users-report-issues-while-playing-cyberpunk-2077-and-less-power-hungry-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>I've had my Switch 2 display a message saying that the system was overheating and entering sleep mode twice now, both times while playing Tears of the Kingdom Switch 2 Edition docked. I was also running at 2k resolution which probably wasn't helping but this is still worrying. Anybody else experienced this? Wondering if I could have a faulty system or maybe TotK is just that intensive.</em></p>



<p>If you're experiencing similar issues, there's not much that you can do except clean the air vents and turn off the console for a while to let it cool down. If the issues persist, you should send it to Nintendo for repair.</p>



<p>Regardless of such problems, the Nintendo Switch 2 continues to sell extremely well. According to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-likely-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest estimates</a>, the hybrid handheld/home console may have surpassed 5 million units sold in June, although these are not official figures. Nintendo's own fiscal year forecast of 15 million units should be easily beaten by March 2026.</p>

            <p>Following "careful consideration", publisher EA and developer BioWare are shutting down Anthem in January.</p>
<p>Bioware is taking the servers for the beleaguered multiplayer shooter offline on 12th January, 2026. Given that it is a fully online game, and requires an internet connection to play, this means it won't be available in any way, shape or form beyond that date.</p>
<p>As of now, Anthem players will not be able to purchase any in-game currency. Instead, players will need to use up the last of their already acquired in-game funds, as the Bioware team gets ready to sunset the servers.</p>

<p>Anthem will be removed from the EA Play playlist next month, on 15th August. Meanwhile, if Anthem has been already purchased and in libraries, users will still be able to redownload the game and play until the servers shut down next year. </p>
<p>"We deeply appreciate your dedication, passion and support over the years and we'd like to thank you for that," Anthem's team wrote in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-au/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update">post announcing the shut down</a>. It added the shut down has not resulted in any layoffs within the team. This will no doubt be a relief, given EA recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-black-panther-cancellation-ea-still-has-at-least-three-marvel-games-in-the-works">cancelled its single-player Black Panther game and closed the developer behind it</a>, Cliffhanger Studios.</p>
<p>Anthem initially released in 2019, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-very-disappointed-in-anthem-launch-issues">had a rocky start</a>. In 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-its-working-on-a-substantial-reinvention-of-anthem">Bioware then announced it was planning to overhaul its online shooter</a>, which the studio said would deliver a "substantial reinvention" of the core Anthem experience. The following year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-work-on-major-anthem-overhaul-has-officially-ceased">development on this major overhaul ceased</a>. Soon after, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-director-departs-bioware">Anthem's director Jonathan Warner announced he was leaving BioWare</a>.</p>

<p>As is good journalistic practise, I'll start with the bit I find the funniest, conceptually, especially if I imagine it as a newspaper headline. "Several towns have been moved closer to water". Rivers have also been widened, and bridges have been "reconsidered". This is all part of TaleWorld's efforts to reshape "the very veins of the continent", ostensibly to widen the maritime trade network, though I suspect it's actually just to give you more targets to boat batter.</p>
<blockquote><p>"For settlements now hugging rivers and coasts, danger sails closer — rival ports are now just a voyage away. To meet this new maritime threat, both parties and armies can now travel by water, gaining access to naval movement and combat."</p></blockquote>
<p>The world map is also being expanded with "a new rugged long strip of a south-facing coastline". Coincidentally, rugged long is also my stripper name. Here's the map:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>TaleWorlds Entertainment</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Returning to coastline plundering, TaleWorlds have also detailed the part naval warfare will play in sieges. Namely blockades, which will be automatically formed after setting up a siege camp, as long as the siege target is a naval settlement and the besiegers have ships available. As a player, you can also reinforce besieged towns from water - "either by breaking through the blockade at the cost of some troops, or by attacking the fleet directly to lift it."</p>
<p>A few other bits of interest: If you dock and then go pottering about on land, you'll be able to summon your ships again from any coastal town. Sailing itself will be aided or hindered by wind speed and currents, and you'll have to contend with attrition, from hazards like storms and regular old disrepair, while you're out there.</p>
<p>How is Bannerlord these days? I played it for about fifty very good hours when it came out and haven't touched it since. Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mount-blade-2-bannerlord-review">reviewed it back in 2022</a> and didn't reckon it was a meaningful upgrade from the previous. "I still enjoy Bannerlord because there's nothing else doing those open world battles," she wrote. "But almost everything else is a robotic, shallow grind offering no surprises, with a plethora of complaints that early access is supposed to iron out".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlords-war-sails-expansion-is-terraforming-the-land-to-encourage-maximum-boat-bastardry]]></content:encoded>

			<p>More details about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> ZeniMax Online game have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-03/microsoft-s-xbox-cancels-blackbird-an-upcoming-game-that-impressed-executives?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTU2ODYyNiwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMTczNDI2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVU2WjREV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.qsy2COuNIZabsf38JG6uvZ2JOF4hCCs1hdYhMXpS9pw&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">appeared</a> in a Bloomberg report, including that Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer had played it and loved it as recently as March. Here's the direct quote:</p>



<p><em>But Blackbird’s cancellation was particularly shocking because it had blown away executives at Xbox just a few months ago. During the demonstration in March, Spencer was enjoying the game so much that Matt Booty, the head of Xbox Game Studios, had to pull the controller away so they could keep the meeting going, according to two people who were in the room.</em></p>



<p>One of Phil Spencer's most endearing traits to gamers is that he is a well-known gamer himself. He has previously admitted to playing many online games, from Diablo IV to Fallout 76 and even ZeniMax Online's own The Elder Scrolls Online. </p>



<p>So, why was the game canceled? The report sheds no light on the specifics, leaving everything to speculation. If it's true that Phil Spencer himself had enjoyed his time with the game, it appears very likely that financial considerations - perhaps mandated from above - led to this outcome.</p>



<p>It's a shame, though, based on the details provided by Bloomberg. There were reportedly some challenges early on with the new engine, but those appeared to have been surpassed by now, and there were 300 developers on the project. They delivered the vertical slice in March to move to full production and tentatively ship the game (once codenamed Kestrel, later renamed to Blackbird) in 2028.</p>



<p>The game was reportedly a third-person online shooter not unlike Destiny (except for the different camera perspective). The setting was sci-fi with a flair of noir, and it put a big emphasis on movement, with player characters able to double jump, dash in the air, use a grappling hook, and even wall climb in superhero-like fashion.</p>



<p>Even the Bloomberg reporter, Jason Schreier, saw footage of the vertical slice and claimed to be impressed. This lends credence to the statement shared by Alex Tardif, former Lead Graphics Programmer at ZeniMax Online Studios, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the game was heading in a great direction. Needless to say, it all makes it even more weird that a company as flush as Microsoft would cancel a game that its own Gaming CEO, Phil Spencer, had appreciated, only because it would have been expensive to produce. It sounds like no project is ever truly safe from the axe at this point.</p>
