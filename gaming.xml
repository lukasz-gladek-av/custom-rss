			<p>There's no doubt that Fallout 76 <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-is-now-free-to-grab-on-prime-gaming-for-pc-and-xbox-franchise-sees-player-boost-following-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a major boost in its player base following the smashing success of Fallout's TV debut on Amazon Prime Video. While previous installments in the franchise also registered significant upticks in player activity, Fallout 76 is the only game still running and being updated, and it also received a few nifty cross-over items like the Ghoul's outfit, inspired by fan-favorite TV show character Cooper Howard (played by Walton Goggins). Now, on the heels of the Ghoul craze, the studio is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-ghoul-experience-detailed-by-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about to add playable Ghouls</a> for the first time in the franchise.</p>
<p>With all this excitement, no wonder, then, that it quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-passes-20-million-players-milestone-bethesda-is-planning-future-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> the 20 million player milestone and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-reaches-21-million-players-asks-for-labor-of-love-nominations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke</a> 21 million only a few months later. With the show's <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second season</a> now in full production, the question is, can fans expect a bigger cross-over event?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-76-lead-producer-of-fallout-show-season-two-crossovers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to VG247</a>, Fallout 76 Lead Producer Bill LaCoste replied that that's probably not going to be the case, as the team doesn't want to go all-in on fan service with the risk of overdoing it.</p>
<p><i>I would imagine it would probably be along the same lines because we have an appreciation for the TV show, the story it’s trying to tell, and the characters it's trying to portray, and we also have an appreciation for the story Fallout 76 is trying to tell.</i></p>
<p><em>So, very, very limited amounts of crossover, where it actually makes sense because, again, we're on extreme ends of the Fallout timeline as well. So, some of that crossover doesn't make sense. We just want to make sure that it's done in a way that is supportive of the TV show, but also allows us to just coexist within this story overall that's being told.</em></p>
<p><em>We probably won't go out of our way to add a whole bunch of stuff specific to the show because we don't feel like we need to. We feel like it's great to let the TV show do its thing and for people to love the TV show for what it is, but also love our game for what it is, and not just give fan service for just the sake of doing it. We'll do some things that make sense, the Vault 33 suit made sense, it's something that exists in the world and you can have it, but yeah, we'll probably keep that relatively light would be my guess.</em></p>
<p>On paper, it sounds like the right choice. While fan service is generally appreciated by gamers, it can easily backfire. For now, though, the Fallout 76 community is very excited about the future following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-gleaming-depths-update-now-available-adding-biggest-boss-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleaming Depths update</a> and the upcoming debut of playable Ghouls.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-everything-you-need-to-know-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We're only weeks away from the February 4 release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and you may still find yourself a bit lost as to what all the fuss is about. All month long, we've been covering different aspects of this medieval action RPG in detail as part of IGN First. But let's not get too ahead of ourselves. This digital treatise is here to cover all the basics, and tell you where you can go next to find out more about any given topic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What is Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put it as simply as possible, it's a first-person, open-world action RPG based on real medieval history, and the very direct sequel to 2018's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/17/kingdom-come-deliverance-review"><u>Kingdom Come: Deliverance, which I gave an 8/10</u></a>. You play as Henry, a young villager who lost his home and his parents to the ravages of war. While exploring the open countryside, you'll use stealth, persuasion, and swordplay to overcome your enemies and complete diverse side quests that generally have multiple endings.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The real highlight for me is the combat system, which is based on real European martial arts and looks to evolve and streamline the mechanics of the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance. It's highly technical and skill-centric, but it doesn't require amazing twitch reflexes. Attacking from one of four cardinal directions, timing parries and counters, and a combo system similar to fighting games that rely on a specific sequence of directional inputs, are at the heart of it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>KCD2 is making an effort to help new players get up to snuff. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It may sound intimidating, but KCD2 is making an effort to help new players get up to snuff. You can check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-developers-share-8-tips-for-survival-ign-first"><u>developer-aided survival tips</u></a>, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-evolves-its-combat"><u>an explanation of how combat has evolved from the first game</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What is the setting of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The year is 1403, right in the middle of what are often called the Late Middle Ages. The venue is central Bohemia, in the vicinity of Prague, and what is today the heart of the modern Czech Republic. It's been about 50 years since the Black Plague – recent enough that there are still people alive who remember it – and 50 years before the fall of Constantinople. Europe, including Bohemia, is watching one age coming to a close and a new one just starting to take shape.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While KCD presents a fictional and dramatized version of history – many of its characters are based on historical ones, but their actions and personalities have been tweaked and embellished – it doesn't contain any outright fantasy elements. No trolls, dragons, or magic – although the people living at the time certainly believed in them. You can do alchemy, which is the one place where this series feels the most like a fantasy RPG. I'm not aware of any herbs or nectars that can make you better at sword fighting. But even these require you to pick real plants and cook them up using period-accurate technology.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>No trolls, dragons, or magic – although the people living at the time certainly believed in them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To be more specific, KCD2 picks up almost immediately where the first game left off. Which brings us to our next question…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do I need to play the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance before I play the sequel?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, not really. It's kind of a soft reset in terms of your character progression, and it will introduce you to all of its systems as if you've never touched them before. The extended intro sequence even catches you up to speed on the events of the first game, which aren't overly intricate. If you want to see for yourself and decide if you need more context, you can watch our <u>first 43 minutes of gameplay</u>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I certainly wouldn't discourage you from playing the first one, though. I replayed it earlier this year and found that it holds up really well. Some of the technical issues that were present during my original review have even been fixed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Who are the major characters in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, well, well… we happened to put together <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-meet-the-medieval-cast-ign-first"><u>a whole article about the major characters</u></a>. But to put it simply: You play as Henry, a young man who has gone from some random nobody to a trusted retainer in the service of Sir Radzig Kobyla. Kobyla and his buddies support King Wenceslaus IV, who has been kidnapped by Wenceslaus' half-brother, the pretender Sigismund. Our pal Sigismund has been riding around the country dealing harshly with anyone he sees as a supporter of Wenceslaus, including burning down Henry's hometown and killing his parents.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Henry is part of the conspiracy to free Wenceslaus and restore him to the throne. At the start of KCD2, he's off on the road with his spoiled, womanizing best "friend," Sir Hans Capon, to try and figure out who else among the nobility is willing to help the cause. The two young men frequently butt heads, since Henry was raised as a commoner and sees Hans as sort of stuck-up man-child, and Hans feels Henry doesn't treat him with the respect a noble deserves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>When is Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 coming out?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">February 4, 2024 on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 5. The original also received a Switch port earlier this year, six years after the original release, but we don't know yet whether or not the sequel might eventually be on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What about the PC system requirements?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Steam page recommends a Core i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 32 GB RAM, and a GeForce RTX 4070 or Radeon RX 7800 XT. Thankfully, from what I've played, it's <em>much</em> better optimized than the first game, which I still can't play on max settings to this day even with a rig that meets all of the recommended specs for KCD2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Can you pet the dog?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes! Your trusty Mutt can even help you out in combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Anything else I should know?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The devs were nice enough to highlight <u>8 Little Things Not to Miss in KCD2</u> for us. If you want to hear my in-depth impressions of the 12+ hours I've played so far, you can check out <u>my hands-on preview</u>. We also got <u>a guided in-game tour of Kuttenburg, the biggest city Warhorse has ever created</u>. It's mostly based on a real city that's still standing, too, and we also got to go walk around it in real life! So take a peek at our <u>comparison of in-game and real-world locations</u>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't prepare you for everything. The forests of 1403 Bohemia are vast and full of surprises. But at least now you have some idea of what you're dealing with. Thanks for riding along with us on our journey through Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 as the final IGN First of 2024!</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-creator-of-garrys-mod-to-sue-over-skibidi-toilet-in-fortnite<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Please stop telling me."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Skibidi Toilet in Fortnite. This most internet of crossovers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-true-horror-of-fortnites-skibidi-toilet-crossover-is-finally-revealed">has sparked as much confusion as it has delight</a>. But what does Garry Newman, creator of Garry’s Mod, think about it all?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some background. Why would people care what Newman thinks about Skibidi Toilet? Well, Skibidi Toilet is a series of web shorts created by Alxey Gerasimov using Source Filmmaker, Valve’s 3D computer graphics software. Some assets used in the series are taken from video games such as Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike: Source, which form the basis of Garry's Mod's physics sandbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some had wondered whether Newman himself might have taken issue with Fortnite’s Skibidi Toilet bundle. But Newman made his stance on the issue crystal clear: he really doesn’t care at all. Not only that, but he has no interest in a lawsuit, as some have said he should consider. And when you think about it, that makes a lot of sense given the 25 million-selling Garry’s Mod wouldn't exist were it not for Valve’s Half-Life 2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm 42, I don't care if Fortnite added a skibidi toilet, please stop telling me,” <a href="https://x.com/garrynewman/status/1870102165315801410" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newman tweeted</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not gonna sue," <a href="https://x.com/garrynewman/status/1870121903819526487" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he added in another tweet</a>. "Basic logic should tell you this. I don't have any basis, want or need. I don't have ownership to any of it. I didn't make hl2, I didn't make any toilet models, I didn't make sfm, I didn't make any of these videos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Plus I'm lazy af, he could be using a photo of me on the toilet and it wouldn't outweigh how much I can't be bothered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Newman has distanced himself from the issue, it does raise questions about who actually owns Skibidi Toilet. Is it Valve, creator of Half-Life 2 and the assets Gerasimov used to make the Skibidi Toilet shorts? Is it Gerasimov himself? Is it someone else?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Newman said the “Skibidi Toilet guys” had hit him with a DMCA in a wild bit of litigious irony. But soon after, an account purporting to be Gerasimov insisted he wasn’t behind the claim, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/garrys-modskibidi-toilet-dmca-claim-has-been-resolved-creator-garry-newman-says"><u>Newman then told IGN that the matter had been “resolved.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The copyright holder the DMCA letter was attributed to was <a href="https://inviz.tv/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Invisible Narratives</u></a>, the film and TV production studio that’s partnering with Michael Bay <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skibidi-toilet-film-reportedly-in-the-works-from-michael-bay"><u>on a Skibidi Toilet film</u></a>. The letter cited Skibidi Toilet characters Titan Cameraman, Titan Speakerman, and Titan TV Man, saying they were "all registered copyrights that are unique and representative of our brand." Sure enough, <a href="https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&amp;ti=1,1&amp;Search%5FArg=Titan%20Cameraman&amp;Search%5FCode=TALL&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=Gr6jPAL716R1MnV450HxzbpYaFF0b&amp;SEQ=20240730153403&amp;SID=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a public catalog search reveals</u></a> that Invisible Narratives had indeed claimed a copyright for Titan Cameraman and three other unpublished works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The letter added that “significant revenue is being generated by unauthorized Skibidi Toilet Garry's Mod games that are being advertised everywhere." The irony was not lost on Newman, who declared: “can you believe the cheek?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/garrys-mod-removing-all-nintendo-content-from-steam-workshop-after-takedown-request"><u>Facepunch removed all Nintendo-related content on Garry's Mod</u></a> - what amounted to 20 years of uploads - from Steam Workshop after receiving a takedown request from Nintendo. Newman is currently working on a successor to Garry's Mod called S&amp;box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>As sports leagues move forward, trying to find new and engaging ways to entertain viewers is one of the biggest tasks at hand. Ratings are down for most broadcasts, and people are consuming their live sports through different means. To help bring more viewers in and give them a different experience, the NFL, NBC and EA Sports are partnering up for the first ever Madden NFL Cast on December 21.</p>



<p>Airing exclusively on Peacock on Saturday, the Madden NFL Cast features the Houston Texans against the Kansas City Chiefs. While it’ll be the actual game, the broadcast will feature Madden-like graphics to give it that video game feel.</p>



<p>For Vice President of Gaming at the NFL Ed Kiang, this broadcast has been a long-time coming for the league.</p>



<p>“This is something that us and EA have really been interested in trying to pursue for a really long time,” Kiang told Insider Gaming. “I think for a variety of reasons, we weren’t able to put it together before, because I think just all the pieces that we need weren’t really in place.</p>



<p>“So as we were having deeper conversations around our alternate telecast strategy, this one bubbled back up, and it was great. NBC kind of raised their hand, like, we think Peacock is a great distribution channel for this.”</p>



<p>The Madden NFL Cast won’t be the first foray into alternative broadcasts for the NFL. The league has done broadcasts featuring characters from Toy Story and The Simpsons in the past. The big difference with this, however, is that instead of using generated characters, it’ll be the actual players and game on the field.</p>



<p>Kiang says by using the actual game for the broadcast, it allows for better breakdowns of the strategies and intricacies that go into an NFL game on the field.</p>



<p>“It gives that really interesting and immersive viewing experience that speaks to different ends of the spectrum of our fanbase that I think everyone can kind of enjoy and get something out of,” Kiang said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite using the real game, the goal of the broadcast is to make it feel like a game of Madden is happening. To do that, the Madden NFL Cast will feature route trails, player and X-Factor icons, play selection screens, player ratings, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even the broadcast camera will have a Madden feel as it will use the All-22 camera angle that is default in Madden games as the primary angle viewers see. Pair that with the analysis of former players Chad Ochocinco and Kury Benkert, and it starts to bring what the NFL envisioned to life.</p>



<p>“That all creates this really great immersive Madden experience, which I think visually, we’re like, ‘Yeah, Madden people are really gonna understand this’,” Kiange explained. “Then, you layer in the commentators and the play call options – I think the way that kind of came together and when you look at the Madden overlays – with that kind of analysis, it’s the way it brought to life for casual gamers, or at least the degree to which it did, that I just wasn’t expecting to be as great as it was.”</p>



<p>To lead up to the broadcast on December 21, the team held two rehearsals with live games to build the chemistry, test the technology, and make sure everything can go smoothly. Seeing how everything worked during the test run left Kiang excited about what fans will see during the live show.</p>



<p>“I was blown away,” he said. “I’m not as close to how normal broadcast production comes together, but I was pretty blown away at how quickly everyone kind of came together and how smoothly everything’s gone so far. It’s a massive undertaking.”</p>



<p>While there’s nothing set in stone just yet, the hope for the league is that there will be more Madden-style NFL broadcasts in the future as the technology and abilities improve.</p>



<p>“As a league, we love the alternative broadcasts, and it just makes a ton of sense to continue to enhance them for the future,” Kiang said.</p>



<p>The Madden NFL Cast airs at 1pm ET on Peacock.</p>

		<p>In a lot of ways it’s easier than ever to make an incredible looking game, thanks in no small part to the broad accessibility of Unreal Engine 5 to developers across the whole industry, and the technical baseline that the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S console provide.</p>
<p>But visual design isn’t just about how many pixels you can throw around the screen, how many polygons you can zoom in on or how realistic everything can look. There’s absolutely a place for that – especially when you can apply it in new and unusual ways – but it’s also so important to have an individualistic streak and a real artistry to make a game stand out from the hyper realistic crowds.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor Refantazio</a> is the story of a boy who wants to build a fairytale world, but that means something rather different when he lives in a world of high fantasy. When his world already features a tribal caste system, where certain races have bat and dog physiologies, demon horns and angel wings, and institutional racism sees the more human-like tribes rising to the top, his dreams look much more mundane to our eye.</p>
<p>It all stems from a book&nbsp;that describes our modern world. Effectively, our version of a fairytale world has characters who dream of ours.</p>

<p>All of this takes a stunning visual design, with the book pages painting themselves in monochromatic watercolour as the story unfolds. This contrasts beautifully with the colourful and highly saturated overworld.&nbsp;And that’s before considering the anime sections or the ridiculous pedigree at this studio, with accolades from Persona to Neon Genesis Evangelion.</p>
<p>The mix of styles and stylisation come together beautifully in Metaphor, which has an incredible story of coming together and overthrowing a corrupt and racist regime that runs alongside it. If you’re looking for the prettiest game of the year, you won’t find one better than Metaphor.</p>
<p><em>– Nic B</em></p>
<h2>Empire of the Ants – Runner Up</h2>
<p>You know what ants look like in the real world? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/empire-of-the-ants-review/">Empire of the Ants</a> looks like that, but like, really close up. It’s pretty great… unless you have some kind of insect phobia.</p>
<p>Making use of Unreal Engine 5, it really is nearly photorealistic, but uses that to show us the world from a perspective that we very rarely have. The woods and gardens that Empire of the Ants plays out across play home to some of the most stunning ant and insect-based animations you will have ever seen. Everything is alive, everything is moving, and as the colony sets about individual tasks you can wander about as Ant 103,683rd, marvelling at just what Tower Five have created.</p>
<p><em>– Dom L</em></p>
<h2>Ultros – Runner Up</h2>
<p>If you ever wanted to know what its like to play a game that’s a 70s prog rock album cover, then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/26/ultros-review/">Ultros</a> is the answer to that. With artwork from El Huervo – of Hotline Miami cover art fame – this is more than just a step into the realms of psychadelia, the alien ship and world that you explore bombarding you with colours across its juxtaposition of organic and mechanical environments.</p>
<p>It’s an alien setting that blends into with the narrative and the gameplay, as you gradually explore this adapted metroidvania structure with a completely fresh set of eyes, needing to learn about the world, how to cultivate and nurture it through each cycle of the story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-4-is-currently-free-to-play-until-the-new-year-including-spiritborn-class/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard Entertainment is currently allowing those who are interested in playing Diablo 4 the opportunity to play it for free across all platforms on which you can get the game. At the moment, a large amount of ARPG fans are flocking to Path of Exile 2, with the game currently available in Early Access if you purchase it. Path of Exile and Diablo have been compared since the dawn of their very existence together, and Path of Exile 2 is no different. If you find that Path of Exile 2 isn't treating you quite right, or you want a new experience, Diablo 4 is currently available to play for free, thanks to Blizzard.</p>
<p>Once again, Blizzard has brought back the Diablo 4 trial, but with a significant difference. While the trial typically just involves the base campaign, this time, players will get the opportunity to try out the new Spiritborn class from the recent expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/">Vessel of Hatred</a>. Players won't be able to play the latest expansion, but you'll get to take the new class for a test run and see if it's something you enjoy.</p>
<p>The trial for Diablo 4 is currently available on PC via <a href="https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/#purchase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battle.net</a>, PlayStation, and Xbox. You'll be able to play the game for free until January 3, 2025. This gives you plenty of time to grind out the game, complete the campaign, and see if it's a game you'd be interested in playing in the future. Unfortunately, Diablo 4 isn't available as a free trial on Steam, so you won't be able to play it there if you are a PC user.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you find that you were enjoying your time during the Diablo 4 free trial, the game is on sale for up to 40% off across all platforms, which is the perfect time to get a game that will provide you with lots of value for money, especially with the addition of new content through the new seasons, as well as the ability to play the brand new expansion, Vessel of Hatred.</p>
<p>For those who don't want to purchase the game but want to play it, Diablo 4's base game is available through Game Pass on PC and Xbox, giving you the opportunity to try out the campaign for a significantly lower price than buying the game in its entirety. It does mean you won't have access to the expansion unless you purchase it, but that is a decision you can make later down the line.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/squid-game-unleashed-is-a-fun-game-and-a-terrible-adaptation.1066512/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24325810/squid-game-unleashed-netflix-mobile-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <em>Squid Game</em>, schoolyard games are turned into nightmares, as players compete to survive and — if they’re lucky — earn a massive cash prize. But in <em>Unleashed</em>, a new mobile spinoff that’s part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22772589/netflix-video-games-app-news-updates">the streamer’s fledgling gaming efforts</a>, those games are <em>fun</em>. It’s a strange experience that sands off much of the appeal of <em>Squid Game</em> in service of making a multiplayer party game.</p><p><em>Unleashed</em> is sort of like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355586/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-pc-ps4-game"><em>Fall Guys</em></a> but in a <em>Squid Game</em> wrapper. You compete against 31 other players across three random games pulled from the show, like “red light, green light” or racing across a bridge made of glass. Slowly other players die off, and by the end one wins a whole bunch of money.</p><p>Aesthetically, the game mostly follows the show. There are a bunch of characters to play as — some pulled from the show, others new for the game — and even though there’s a cartoon aesthetic, things still get bloody, with players being shot for breaking the rules or crushed under some obstacle. There are the familiar green track suits and masked guards.</p><p>But the connections to the show are really only surface level. There’s no story element, so if you haven’t watched the show, you’d have no idea the kind of personal anguish many of the characters are going through.</p><p>In fact, many of the elements that make <em>Unleashed</em> a pretty fun mobile game are also what keep it from being a good adaptation of what <em>Squid Game</em> is all about. In order to reduce frustration, most of the games have respawning. So even if you fail at “red light, green light” and get shot by a guard, it’s not game over. It simply slows you down in a race to be one of a pre-determined number of players to cross the finish line and move on.</p><p>Similarly, the games can all be completed in a few minutes. This is great for playing short sessions on the go; being stuck in a 30 minute multiplayer match on your phone typically sucks. But when you put elements like the short run time and respawning together it, completely erases any of the tension that’s so core to <em>Squid Game</em>’s appeal.</p><p>And despite having no in-app purchases — <em>Unleashed</em> is completely free for Netflix subscribers and, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319725/squid-game-for-everyone">for a limited time, non-subscribers</a> — it’s still structured like a typical free-to-play game. You earn cash from winning matches and completing various goals, which is used to unlock new characters, costumes, and emotes. Every time I log on I’m greeted with a jarring number of pop-ups and notifications letting me know I just unlocked a zombie costume or that there’s a Christmas-themed event going on. Just this morning I was gifted a twerking emote.</p><p>Yes, now I can make Kang Sae-byeok, whose death was one of the most tragic moments of season 1, twerk in the middle of a deadly obstacle course.</p><p><em>Unleashed</em> isn’t a bad game. In many ways, it’s a clever reinterpretation of online party games for mobile. But, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23971416/squid-game-the-challenge-review-netflix">like most of Netflix’s expansions of the <em>Squid Game</em> universe</a>, it also completely misses the point of the show. It’s sort of like what <em>Fortnite</em> is to the original movie <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23851408/battle-royale-revisited-hunger-games-fortnite-squid-game-criterion"><em>Battle Royale</em></a>: a playful, colorful take on a brutal, piercing story.</p><p><em>Fortnite</em> largely avoided the tonal dissonance by creating a cartoon-ish, multiversal world that is far away from an island full of kids killing their classmates. <em>Unleashed</em>, on the other hand, is another part of S<em>quid Game</em> — one that doesn’t seem to understand why the series exists.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So, it’s incredibly fitting that he makes the cut as the runner up for the best Strategist in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. His healing grenade launcher can quickly heal multiple allies at once. And his ultimate ability can help damage boost any surrounding allies, which can be a great boon in team fights.</p><p>Rocket’s best asset, though, is his revival ability: the Battle Revival Beacon. The B.R.B. can revive a single fallen ally, and it also produces armor packs. The beacon has a 45-second cooldown, but negating even one death is a huge boon. It can also help a costly mistake become nothing more than a small inconvenience. Adam Warlock has similar strengths in this department–especially with his Team-Up Ability–but Rocket’s ease of use and flexible healing output gives him a slight edge over the golden guy.</p><h2 id="h79811"><a id="jeff"></a>Jeff the Land Shark keeps your team healed better than anyone</h2><figure id="" data-id="870fa64a012f742f93c10b5e5258e3c7" data-recommend-id="image://870fa64a012f742f93c10b5e5258e3c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character selection screen shows Jeff the Land Shark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character selection screen shows Jeff the Land Shark." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="870fa64a012f742f93c10b5e5258e3c7" data-recommend-id="image://870fa64a012f742f93c10b5e5258e3c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character selection screen shows Jeff the Land Shark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s incredibly difficult to recommend <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">anyone but Jeff</a></span> as the best healer in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.

Other healers like Loki and Cloak and Dagger also heal with their primary fire, but they all have much less ammo. On the other hand, Jeff just has a sustained beam that needs to be reloaded much less. Because of this, he can focus on a strong tank and let them wreak havoc. This is in addition to his fast movement speed, aided by his movement skill that lets him swim underwater while self-healing.</p><p>And to top it all off, there’s his ultimate. There’s no way to make this sound fancy or formal. Frankly, it’s absolutely wild that this is in a hero shooter. Jeff can swallow up both enemies and allies (in a <em>very generously large </em>area), and spit them wherever he’d like. nine times out of 10, this results in enemies being spit off of a cliff and the deaths of quite a few teammates. It sure can change the tide of a team battle in a flash. Don’t let his cute face fool you. Jeff is an absolute menace.</p><p><br><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is available for free on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PC.  </p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/towers-of-aghasba-gets-five-major-patches-in-one-month-of-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Towers of Aghasba has officially been in Early Access for one month. Dreamlit Games has been talking about the experience thus far and the work they've been doing on the game to improve it during the<a href="https://wccftech.com/towers-of-aghasba-enters-early-access-on-november-19-bringing-a-world-of-cozy-exploration/"> Early Access</a> period. Since its release a month ago, the team has delivered five major patches in the span of four weeks, which added a significant amount of quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and some extra features for players to dive into. While looking back at the month they've had, they have also remarked on what they plan on adding to the game to help it continue to grow and provide players with the fun, cozy experience that they've been longing for with this title. If you've yet to pick up Towers of Aghasba, the game is currently 20% off until January 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178070/Towers_of_Aghasba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> and 20% off on the PlayStation Store until January 6.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towers of Aghasba - A Journey of Growth" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ra_mdW1P87k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking back at some of the updates this game has seen already, it includes an Arachnophobia mode, which changes all spiders in the game to become crabs instead. Although crabs are relatively spider-adjacent. There has also been inventory expansion, allowing players to have an increased number of storage boxes, with more plans for inventory to come in the future.</p>
<p>One of the most favored changes that has been made to Towers of Aghasba is the need to make an Epic Games account. It is no longer necessary to create an Epic Games account to play this title, especially as the game is available on Steam.</p>
<p>There are plenty more changes in the works, with the team at Dreamlit Games currently working on a new major patch that would bring multiplayer co-op questing to the game, which is a feature that has been highly requested by those who are already dedicated players of the game.</p>
<p>Dreamlit Games has also outlined the content that they plan to bring to the game for the full launch. This includes six regions to explore, including forests, ruins, and more, allowing for a ton of discoveries to be made with new flora and fauna in each area. There will be three types of settlement to build, design, and decorate, as well as three types of ecosystems to grow to ensure that your town flourishes. Additionally, Towers of Aghasba will have both single-player and co-op gameplay, allowing you to play with up to three other people to help build and expand your island.</p>

"A tactically rich turn-based game with some meaty role-playing elements", was how Staff Sergeant James Archer characterised his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/menaces-turn-based-battles-are-the-galaxys-deadliest-teambuilding-exercises">Menace hands-on</a>, back in September. The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.</p>
<p>And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.
</p><!--more-->

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/starmap_JS1IFGS.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>
Honestly, it all <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2432860/view/515196772511907866?l=english">sounds</a> pretty straightforward next to the difficulties of avoiding injury on the surface. Between missions, you'll return to a starmap of the Wayback solar system, on which you can see planets and the factions that own them, together with any requests for aid. There's a reputation management element - leave a faction request hanging and they might sour on you.
</p><p>
Faction distress calls aside, the starmap is where you'll spend the game's main resources. Promotion points are for levelling up squads, OCI components (that's "Operational Capability Improvements" - you're impressing nobody with this wanton jargon, Overhype) are for embiggening your ship, the Impetus, while authority points are for keeping a lid on your crew's morale and mood.</p>
<p>Your crew are described as "motley", which here means "a massive liability". You might have to intervene in a bar fight, or deal with the problem of a moonshine distillery, or resolve an accident in the hangarbay. It sounds like the usual <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> rhythm of having to decide between fixing a problem now, or letting it slide to save resources and getting into hot water later.
</p>
<p>
As for ship upgrades, these have both active and passive benefits during missions. You can equip the Impetus with facilities that let you call in a dropship strafing run or a bunker-buster missile. Other enhancements restore unit health during missions, but the must-have is probably the one that gives you sharper intelligence on enemies and their position during briefings. Menace definitely feels like a game where reconnaissance trumps firepower.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/squadpromotion.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Last but not least, there's the armory screen, where you can choose from various weapons, armour, accessories and vehicles, and dole out promotions. Each squad leader has a unique perk tree, though some of the individual perks are shared between characters, and each squad leader starts with a trademark personal trait. Everybody is their own special snowflake. At least till they get stepped on by the mechs.</p>
<p>And that's it for the strategy stuff. Forthcoming in a future blogpost: details of the black market, where you can barter for gear, squad leaders and pilots, and of operations, which are a series of connected missions. 
</p>
<p>
I was vaguely hoping for a transformative gimmick of some kind, but it sounds like the strategy aspect of Menace is rather by the numbers. Still, that's the thing about bread, isn't it? If it's too exciting, the filling loses its potency. A sandwich in which the bread is the star component is no sandwich at all but a breadstick you've accidentally dropped in the stew - and whoops, now Lance Corporal Vicarus has clobbered you with a ladle because he's absolutely blotto after sampling the hooch they've been brewing behind the main reactor. Captain to the messhall, please! Menace is out later next year.

Was it the dark days where every single big blockbuster movie got a shitty tie-in video game crunched out by some poor dev team in six months to launch alongside the film? Or is it the present, where new movies rarely get tie-in games at all outside of the occasional throwaway mobile game? Yes, of course there are exceptions, but for every <em>Goldeneye 007</em>, <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>, or <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, there are a dozen <em>E.T.</em>s, <em>Rambo</em>s, or <em>Fight Club</em>s. Meanwhile, we’ve finally got kind of a good thing going in the other direction, with enough quality movie/TV adaptations of games that an outright shitburger like <em>Borderlands</em> feels like a rare exception and not the rule. </p><div><p>I get it, games take longer and more effort to make, especially the kind of quadruple-A thing most film studios would prefer their cash-ins to look like. But here’s the secret sauce, kids: Most of the best movie-to-video-game adaptations aren’t even direct adaptations of a specific movie, but are instead parallel stories, spinoffs, off-brand prequels and sequels, and weird anthology tales existing in the same universe. <em>Star Wars </em>has been proving that theory right for decades now, but even ambitious-yet-average one-offs like <em>Mad Max</em> and <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> have the right idea. </p><p>And that’s the sweet spot we’d like to look at, especially in the wake of the rather excellent <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>: The games that took a film’s ball and ran with it. There’s quite a few of them, but here’s 10 that are especially worth your time. </p></div></div></div><div><p>Probably the indisputable winner of this entire list, if we’re honest. Creative Assembly took a good hard look at everything<em> Aliens: Colonial Marines</em> did and made the exact opposite of that. The extent to which <em>Isolation</em> applies pressure to the player and <em>dares</em> them to make a wrong move or make the wrong noise is breathtaking. Quite literally, too, if you turned on that option on select platforms where the alien can hear you through your controller, laptop, or camera microphone. And how gloriously sadistic is the fact that they even included that option?</p></div><div><p>There are elements of <em>The Thing</em> that show its age, especially the gunplay that becomes a drag once you start getting fewer alien monstrosities and more generic humans in your way. But wrapped around a fairly bog-standard survival horror game is a suite of brilliant mechanics that truly makes it feel harmonious with the Carpenter film of the same name. Once you start rescuing survivors, any one of them could be infected at any time, and deciding just how much to trust them–or not–with resources and tasks still feels tense and unique. Nightdive Studios just shadow-dropped a very pretty remaster of the game. It’s still very much worth a look today as it was back in 2002 when it first arrived. </p></div><div><p>Here we have the rarest of rare scenarios: <em>Escape From Butcher Bay </em>is a game that is an outright triumph in every way the film it was meant to tie-in with is not. Yes, there’s still a goofy charm to <em>Chronicles of Riddick</em>: The Film, the kind of bro-ey nerd charm you can only get from one Vincent Diesel, Esq. It actually feels more like a one-shot <em>D&amp;D/Warhammer</em> campaign than anything else, and nobody was even attempting that in 2004. </p><p><br><em>Escape from Butcher Bay</em>, however, is every inch the sequel to <em>Pitch Black</em> the world needed and wanted. The game is a down and dirty, stealthy prison escape scenario with an excellent “see-in-the-dark” mechanic, awash in character actors, and <em>a lot </em>of Riddick shanking people in the spine. And the game pulled all this off while still serving some satisfying Furyan lore expansion. For some reason, we haven’t gotten 10 sequels to this yet.   </p></div><div><p>Oh sure, there’s an argument to be made that <em>Shadow of Mordor/Shadow of War</em> are the better games to include here, considering how much of their presentation is lifted from the Peter Jackson films. However, I’d argue for a more unique experience, look no further than <em>The Third Age.</em> As literally anyone who plays it for five minutes can tell you, the game is basically just <em>Final Fantasy X</em> in Middle Earth. Thing is, what seemed like a derivative choice in 2004 feels far more novel in 2024. The story, with a kind of parallel Fellowship ensuring the A-team gets to Mount Doom, runs roughshod over the established canon, but the group’s backstories are all solid enough to maintain interest for the entire play time, and hey, least they don’t do anything too stupid like, say, oh, idk, for instance, make Shelob a goth baddie, or make the last thicc female Ent fight a Balrog. </p></div><div><p>Every once in a while, somebody threatens to try and do a new <em>Back to the Future</em>, or maybe turn that Broadway musical into a film. Meanwhile, Telltale got there first, with the help of series screenwriter Bob Gale, and a smattering of the original cast in tow, all putting in work. The first two episodes are a little on the sillier side, with a jaunt to Prohibition-era Hill Valley. But once the busybody ancestor of Principal Strickland gets involved with Doc Brown, resulting in Hill Valley being turned into a techno-dystopia, things are drastically more interesting. It’s a damn shame the ending–which managed to rope in Michael J. Fox while introducing some multiverse shenanigans back when that was still cool–never went anywhere. What we’ve got instead is still the one and only time this series has ever been expanded upon in a meaningful way. </p></div><div><p>Look, I love <em>GTA V</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption II</em>, but every damn day, I mourn that the Rockstar Games that had time to pump out games that weren’t <em>GTA</em> appears to be in a coma. Don’t even get me started on how much I miss <em>Midnight Club</em>, we’ll be here all day. But above all, we don’t talk enough about the one time Rockstar decided to play in someone else’s cinematic sandbox to give us not just one of the best takes on a 3D beat-’em-up we’d get (until the <em>Yakuza</em> games finally started to gain traction in the West), but also one of the best movie adaptations all around. <em>The Warriors</em> takes a cult classic film literally nobody was even paying attention to in 2005, and breathes new life into it. The game isn’t just an adaptation, but is an expansive prequel starring most of the same cast. This thing has been long overdue for a remaster, but alas, Rockstar would have to pull people off of lovingly modeling every strand of a meth head’s chest hair in <em>GTA Online</em> to do it. </p></div><div><p>It’s always a mistake whenever someone says <em>Bond </em>films are all just dumb action flicks, especially the Daniel Craig era. But to be fair, the Pierce Brosnan flicks weren’t shy about being exactly what they were, until they parasurfed way too close to the sun with <em>Die Another Day</em>. Quality of the films notwithstanding, it made total sense that Brosnan would end up getting the best Bond game ever made (<em>Goldeneye 007</em>’s aged, and you know it. Why are you booing me? I’m right). <em>Everything or Nothing</em> is just a wild-ass ride from beginning to end, with enormous action set pieces no film would be able to budget for without bankrupting England. It’s frankly shocking it didn’t, considering the staggering amount of star power EA managed to rope into this. The game features Brosnan himself, as well as Judi Dench, John Cleese, and even Willem Dafoe as the baddie.Shannon Elizabeth and Heidi Klum star as Bond girls, and Mya does the theme song (which is still a bop). This is just straight up, spared-no-expense AAA shit right here, a game that actually feels like a later <em>Uncharted</em> sequel long before anyone even heard the name Nathan Drake. </p></div><div><p>Ask virtually anyone about what they think a <em>John Wick</em> video game should be, chances are good the answer is something that resembles <em>Max Payne</em> or <em>Hotline Miami</em>. Nobody’s first answer would’ve been <em>John Wick Hex</em>, and yet after playing it, one will find themselves wondering “Why wasn’t it?” <em>John Wick Hex</em> is a strategy game that puts you in the head of the Baba Yaga, where every little consideration of the killzones he finds himself in must be accounted for to escape without taking a bullet, and it’s only after you’ve done the legwork that you actually get to see the dope, bone-crushing, headshotting glory. It’s also working with a really cool cel-shaded art style, and really, though, it’s just cool to see John <em>as</em> the Baba Yaga, the guy still building his legend instead of the legend. </p></div><div><p>Out of everything else in this list, <em>Terminator: Resistance</em> is shocking in the fact that nothing about its pedigree gives the indication that it might be playable let alone often good. Look at developer Teyon’s resume prior to this, and it is a long, depressing list of straight up shovelware for the Wii and 3DS. Hell, their last licensed game is the dreadful PS3 <em>Rambo</em> rail shooter I mentioned at the start. Somehow, those guys managed to pull off <em>Fallout</em>-but-with-<em>Terminators</em>, and did it in a way that doesn’t outstay its welcome the way too many of the <em>Fallout </em>games do. We used to get stuff like this all the time in the PS2 era. Now, a AA game taking a road-less-traveled with a big property is one of those swings nobody makes. But when they do, it often winds up being a delightfully wonky treat. </p></div><div><p>It’s not exactly a surprise when WayForward manages to make a pretty passable game out of a tie-in property nobody cares about, let alone a legitimately fun, cool Metroidvania, but in <em>The Mummy Demastered</em>’s case, the team found themselves in the wild position of crafting the only shining positive about an absolute shitshow of a project. <em>The Dark Universe</em> is still a punchline in the annals of recent film history (though we did get that great Elisabeth Moss <em>Invisible Man</em> out of it), but the game is surprisingly pretty forward thinking in a few ways. Specifically, it’s got more of a <em>Souls</em>-like approach to the way it handles death, in that, as a nameless grunt, completing the mission means heading into darkened tombs, having to take down your predecessor if you want any of your inventory back. All it really needed was a trailer with a pixel-art Tom Cruise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/imax-the-mummy-trailer-sound-effects-missing-youtube-1201761023/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/imax-the-mummy-trailer-sound-effects-missing-youtube-1201761023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screaming in the center sound channel of your TV</a></span>. </p><hr></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A company you may previously have only ever thought of when shopping for an SD card for your Switch, but which <a href="https://shop.sandisk.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/2024/the-new-sandisk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this week is in the spotlight</a> for one of the most impressive--and unlikely--rebrands of our age.</p><p>First though, for reference, here's the old logo, which looks exactly like a logo should for something you'd find on an SD card that you're buying for a 2013 DSLR camera:</p><figure></figure><p>And here's the new one:</p><figure></figure><p>Oh yeah, <em>that's the shit</em>. That doesn't look like a Sandisk logo. That looks like the logo of a company that sells machine gun arms in the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> universe. Or luxury starships to the more discerning members of the Coruscant elite. Both things that are infinitely cooler than SD cards.</p><p>Like, look at this video they made! This is something that should be playing on a holo screen in a sci-fi subway station, not a YouTube embed on a Wordpress page:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="This is the new Sandisk." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uPYErkgHLzk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Sandisk themselves <a href="https://shop.sandisk.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/2024/the-new-sandisk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">describe </a>the rebrand as:</p><blockquote><p>Defined by a ‘Mindset of Motion’, Sandisk’s new creative direction represents a future forward philosophy where by creating paths and possibilities for people to go without limits, the company unites the current moment and their aspirations. This mindset brings people closer to their ambitions and creates a circle of collaboration for progress and future growth.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Which OK, isn't as <em>specific </em>as what it makes me think of, but we're on the same page. Technology should always be about the future, the future is cool, looking to the future is cool, this is great, well done Sandisk!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silo-apple-tv-architecture-politics-world"><h3>I Want To Live In The Silo</h3></a><p>You can plot the entire course of a human life in this universe</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A sequel to the original Space Distant, developer PixelMouse aptly describes the game as "an indirect continuation of the first part" that features "more dynamic gameplay."</p><p dir="ltr">Distant Space 2 challenges players to pilot a spaceship through 26 levels of enemies, including three special boss ships, which PixelMouse says are especially challenging. On the bright side, players can find unique weapons by destroying and looting enemy ships, which will make those boss fights a little less daunting.</p><p dir="ltr">"Your task is to destroy enemy ships on each level to go to the next of 26 available [levels]," the game's Steam page reads. "In addition to conventional ships, you will have to wait for the boss ships, the battle with which will not be easy."</p><p>Distant Space 2 is currently available to play for free on Steam (download it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/729460/Distant_Space_2/" rel="nofollow ">here</a>), but this no-strings-attached gift won't be around forever, so players will want to add this title to their library before the 100% discount expires on December 24 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. If you prefer to play its predecessor first, you can get your hands on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/5251/Distant_Space_Pack/" rel="nofollow ">Space Distant and Distant Space 2</a> for only $0.73 USD.</p><p>For even more Steam-powered savings, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-winter-sale-2024-game-deals/2900-6097/" data-ref-id="2900-6097">the best deals featured in this year's Steam Winter Sale</a>.</p>

            <p>NetEase's PvPvE sandbox action horror, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">Once Human, started testing its mobile port back in September</a>, and now we <em>finally</em> have a mobile release window: April 2025.</p>
<p>In an end-of-year <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc00VaAEgfM">livestream</a>, NetEase also revealed what new features Meta-Humans can expect when the mobile version drops, including three new scenarios: Code: Purification, Code: Deviation, and Code: Broken. The latter is a 10-day PvP scenario, whilst the first two are PvE.</p>

<p>We'll also get to experience the all-new Visional Wheel from 16th January, which introduces new wrinkles to gameplay courtesy of new weapons, powers, and rules, as well as making enemies stronger and adversely impacting player sanity. Oh, and there'll be a holiday event running across Christmas and the new year, too.</p>
<p>Once Human is also expected to come to console - complete with cross-platform support - as well. There's still no date on that, though. Sorry.</p>
<p>Interested? Head on over to the <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/">official website</a> to pre-register your interest now. Right now, over 26 million Meta-Humans have signed up, unlocking a slew of free gifts including cosmetics, skins, decorative items, and crafting resources.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-human-review">Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it for Eurogamer</a>, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter hold it back. Since launch, however, NetEase has ramped up its premium in-game offerings, including cosmetic loot crates.</p><p>"Not for one moment did I expect a F2P live service offering to be anything other than an unmitigated slog stuffed with the pitfalls and unforced errors of every other game I started and stopped playing, so wildly over-saturated is this genre. But here I am, late at night again, fashioning myself a Slippery When Wet sign to put beside my water tank."</p>
<p>The developer behind NetEase's survival free-to-play horror, Once Human, recently said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">feedback it's received about the game's second season has been "quite demoralising"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
