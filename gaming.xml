			<p>There's a new generative AI startup in town called <a href="https://tales.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tales</a>, and its goal is to empower gamers and creators to essentially make whatever they want with mere text prompts. According to the press release, the technology is based on a Large World Model (LWM) called Sia. This LWM is allegedly capable of generating all the components of a video game, from environments, 3D models, and gameplay to NPC (non-player character) behavior - along with detailed metadata.</p>
<p>This Large World Model trains on gameplay data, video content, 3D assets, descriptive metadata and feedback over time. It's how the LWM understands how games are structured, thereby improving its ability to understand complex game elements and mechanics. With it, Tales can output fully functional games using 3D engines, spatial reasoning algorithms, and NPC behavior systems.</p>
<p>Following a simple text prompt such as "make a first-person shooter in space", the LWM can generate the requested game, which is instantly playable and can be subsequently customized. While conceived primarily for games, the technology could also be utilized to create virtual reality worlds, interactive experiences, and immersive educational tools.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Tales plans to involve the community in the training process of its LWM. They are launching a rewards-based incentive system where users can submit anything from gameplay footage to in-game assets and extensive environment descriptions. Tales also clarifies that it will be a 'fully transparent dataset,' tracked and documented to ensure provenance and preserve privacy.</p>

<p>Head of Product Jason Krupat says:</p>
<p><em>Tales truly feels like something out of a sci-fi film, and we can’t wait to make it a reality. The gaming industry is in desperate need of a revolution, and putting the power to create in the hands of gamers could be the start of a new era of entertainment that extends far beyond games. A lack of resources should never get in the way of a creative spark, and empowering creators in this way means so much to us.</em></p>
<p>While there are many possible applications of generative AI to gaming, there are several downsides and limitations to such an ambitious project as this one. To start with, there are the legal implications—the trailer already shows 'copies' of Horizon Zero Dawn, Death Stranding, Ghost of Tsushima, Detroit: Become Human, and The Last of Us, to name a few. How long will it be until Sony or others come knocking at Tales' door?</p>
<p>Moreover, while the games generated could look similar to an actual game on a surface level, they will inevitably be much more shallow in terms of gameplay mechanics and features, not to mention storylines or missions. Tales said the games would be 'customizable,' but to what extent? We don't know yet. Anyway, Tales promises to launch its generative Ai technology in early access next month, so we'll learn soon enough.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-3/news/soft-launch-announcement-15-oct?isLocalized=true" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement post on its website</a>, EA says that starting from October 15th (which is yesterday), in-app purchases won't be available anymore, and the game will also no longer be available to download, although you'll still be able to play it if you have it installed.</p>
<p>From November 15th,&nbsp;<em>Plants vs. Zombies 3</em>'s servers will go down, and you'll no longer be able to play the game across Android or iOS. That counts for all territories, too.</p>

<p>However, in the name of making the game "truly special", EA says it intends to put a "major overhaul" into effect, although it doesn't go into detail regarding exactly what that overhaul might entail.</p>
<p>EA thanks players for its "enthusiasm and feedback", which, given the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/1aljvmm/pvz_3_review/">volume</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/199hdmu/plants_vs_zombies_3_is_atrocious/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">negative</a> responses to&nbsp;<em>Plants vs. Zombies 3</em>'s aforementioned soft launch from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/19abigc/i_am_thoroughly_disappointed_with_pvz3_and_it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">disgruntled players</a>, is certainly one way to put it.</p>
<p>Reading between the lines, that's probably the reason for this decision, although of course, EA and PopCap aren't going to admit that the game hasn't connected with people. Well, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/19aqd00/pvz3_soft_launch_an_update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">not again</a>, anyway.</p>

<p>They have, however, confirmed that your coin balances will be saved "as long as you've connected your account through Google Play, Apple ID, or your EA account". Game progress, however, will be reset when the game does eventually relaunch.</p>

        <p>Asmongold slapped down for racist tirade</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Twitch have temporarily banned an account run by streamer Asmongold, otherwise known as Zack Hoyt, after he expressed genocidal sentiments about Israel's killing of Palestinian people in Gaza. <a href="https://x.com/Slasher/status/1846268530880118852">According to the eSports journalist Rod Breslau</a>, he's been sent to the naughty step for a grand total of two weeks, which I'm sure will be a huge inconvenience and will really teach him the error of his ways. Assuming Breslau's sources are accurate, it's a great demonstration of Twitch's tolerance for streamers with big audiences, the kind of slap on the wrist you'd expect from a platform that recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reinstates-donald-trumps-account-following-permanent-ban-in-2021">reinstated Donald Trump's account</a> after banning him in 2021 for the charge of inciting an insurrection.</p>
<p><em>Content warning for hate speech in the paragraphs ahead.</em></p>
<p>You will almost certainly know the context, but in case you don't: in October 2023, several Palestinian armed groups led by Hamas, who govern the Gaza strip, broke through the border into Israel and carried out a massacre, killing over a thousand people including civilians and children. Israel's government and military have responded by mounting a year-long invasion of Gaza that has killed over 42,000 Palestinians and reduced the region to ruin. </p>
<p>All this builds on decades of Israeli containment of and intervention within Gaza, which a United Nations special rapporteur has <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/03/israels-55-year-occupation-palestinian-territory-apartheid-un-human-rights">argued is a form of apartheid</a>. The UN have repeatedly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y5zy1vvmlo">condemned Israel's killing of civilians</a>, together with the atrocities carried out by Hamas, who are still <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/hamas-took-hundreds-of-hostages-from-israel-where-are-they-now/jqe2346zk">holding a number of Israelis hostage</a>. Back in March this year, another UN special rapporteur <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147976">argued</a> that there are "reasonable grounds" for defining Israel's current operations in Gaza as genocide.</p>
<p>Asmongold appears to agree that Israel's actions are genocide, but he seemingly thinks the Palestinians deserve it, based on his own, sweepingly racist assessments of Islam and of Palestinian culture. </p>
<p>"If you want to consider it genocide as a systematic killing of a group of people, they have genocide built into Sharia law right now," Asmongold said during the stream, as preserved by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/streaming/asmongold-suspended-from-twitch-following-racist-tirade-about-palestinians/">PCGamer</a>. "So no, I'm not going to cry a fucking river when people who have genocide that's baked into their laws are getting genocided. I don't give a fuck. They're terrible people. It's not even a question. It's crazy that people don't see it that way. They'd be doing the same thing.</p><p>"These people are not your allies," he went on. "They're not the same as us. They come from an inferior culture that is horrible. It kills people for their identity, and it is directly antithetical to everything Western values stand for, and it is an inferior culture in all ways. It is that simple. No, I don't feel bad for them, I don't feel sorry for them, I don't care."</p>
<p>All of this is a clear infringement of Twitch's ban on hate speech. Here's an excerpt from their <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines">community guidelines</a>: "Twitch does not permit behaviour that is motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance, including behaviour that promotes or encourages discrimination, denigration, harassment, or violence based on the following protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, colour, caste, national origin, immigration status, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, serious medical condition, and veteran status."</p>
<p>Naturally, a number of people have lodged complaints about Asmongold's tirade. And of course, he has now apologised. "Looking back on it, I was way too much of an asshole about the Palestine thing," he wrote on <a href="https://x.com/Asmongold/status/1845982422275367189">Xitter</a>, adding "my bad" and "of course no one deserves to have their life destroyed even if they do things or have views I find regressive". In conclusion, "you guys deserve more than me saying stupid shit like that, I'll do better".</p>
<p>Twitch's ban only applies to Asmongold's secondary "Zackrawrr" account, but it also means he can't stream via his primary account either. However, he's still free to publish videos on Youtube, where he has about 4.85 million combined subscribers. Asmongold himself has <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/twitch-leak-reveals-the-sites-highest-paid-streamers/">reportedly earned many millions from Twitch</a>, more than enough on paper to ride out any temporary suspension of service.</p><p>All this is of broader relevance because Twitch, a streaming service that focuses on video games, is absolutely huge. It's one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-visited_websites">the most visited websites in the world</a>. As such, it's a prominent internet "town square" where the most-subscribed streamers can potentially shape the views of millions of people - as the management themselves acknowledged back in 2021, when they shut down Trump's account to avoid any further incitement to violence.</p>
<p>As Asmongold's colleague TipsOutBaby <a href="https://x.com/TipsOut/status/1846302400988303489">has discussed on Twitter</a>, referencing his own experience as a Muslim and child of Syrian immigrants, Asmongold's comments reflect long-established patterns of "calculated dehumanization" that create the conditions for bloodshed, consisting of the same language that is "used to justify wanton violence, genocide, and the destruction of our universal brotherhood". You'd think all that would warrant more than two weeks in the wilds. We asked Twitch for comment about all this yesterday - they haven't responded.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But  it would almost certainly have brought in <em>vast</em> numbers of new customers who’d want to keep playing the live-service multiplayer game after the first fortnight, and would either then buy it outright, or maintain a full-price subscription. Let alone the droves who’d just forget to cancel, which—and sorry to break your sweet, naive heart—is the main reason you put have to put your credit card details in for any of these super-cheap/free short-term offers.</p><p>It’s yet another kick in the ribs to the already down-and-bleeding Game Pass, that has fallen from celebratory “Netflix for games” champion to a confusing mess of mind-boggling tiers and structures.</p><p>Some might even go so far as to wonder if it’s actually a <em>good</em> thing to let massive corporations buy each other for the GDP of small nations until all competition is removed from the market.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As announced during PlayStation’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-new-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play event</a> in September, Astro Bot will release new content on October 17, which includes a speedrun level and some new bots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new Astro Bot speedrun level, Building Speed, will test players’ platforming skills and allow them to compete on an online leaderboard with their PlayStation friends. In Building Speed, players will have Barkster, the Bulldog Booster, on their back, which helps them zip around the sky city. You will encounter obstacles like cranes, find crates to smash, and encounter a flying car with your stranded crew on this level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Team Asobi will release new Astro Bot levels every week from October 17 to November 14, starting with Building Speed. Each new level will be available every Thursday at 6:00 AM PT, 2:00 PM BST and 10:00 PM JST. Check out the complete list of upcoming Astrobot speedrun levels and their dates below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>October 17: Building Speed &nbsp;</li>



<li>October 24: Let it Slide&nbsp;</li>



<li>October 31: Spring-loaded Run&nbsp;</li>



<li>November 7: Helium Heights&nbsp;</li>



<li>November 14: Rising Heat</li>
</ul>



<p>Moreover, along with the Astro Bot speedrun levels, a pair of Special Bots will also arrive each week. 2 Special bots will be released with each level, allowing players to gather another 10. Of these 10, Eve from Stellar Blade and Helldivers have been revealed; players should keep an eye out for the next ones.&nbsp;</p>

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 follows the characters Gustave, Maelle, and their fellow Expeditioners as they embark upon a desperate quest to break a cycle of violence, and they'll be brought to life by Charlie Cox (Daredevil), Ben Starr (Final Fantasy 16), Jennifer English (Baldur's Gate 3), and Venom 2 director Andy Serkis.

Growing up in the city of Lumière, Gustave is described as being hellbent on defeating the Paintress so that the residents of his beloved city will have a future free of her terror. In contrast, English's character Maelle is a shy loner eager to escape the city, and she's the youngest member of the expeditionary force. Starr's character Verso is a dangerous stranger tracking the team's every move, while Serkis plays the role of Renoir, a man relentlessly driven to save his family and ready to make the ultimate sacrifice.</p>

      </div>
<p>Other notable names in the game's cast include Kirsty Rider (Sandman) as Lune and Shala Nyx (The Old Guard) as Sciel. "Developing the characters was a multi-part process, which included charting a detailed history of Lumière and each character’s family history and thinking through how prior generations responded to the Paintress," lead writer and voice producer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen explained in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/introducing-the-cast-of-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog post</a>. "These factors all played a role in who each character is and what they are trying to overcome."</p><p>The new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 trailer also had a glimpse of several new gameplay features in the action-RPG, like traversal elements, new locations, and a quick look at the Golgra and The Tisseur enemies that will test the reflexes of players when they encounter them.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/this-unreal-engine-5-rpg-looks-stunning-gamescom-2024/2300-6465005/">First revealed during the June Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is scheduled to launch in 2025 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. The game has a striking art direction inspired by the Belle Époque art period of 20th-Century France, and its gameplay mixes real-time actions like dodges, parries, and counters with traditional turn-based combat.</p>

                <p>A developer at Halo Infinite support studio Certain Affinity has listed a "canceled battle royale mode" for the game on their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-clopper-9300811/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn resume</a>. This person said they were in charge of a "large team of designers" making this unannounced mode that "could have been a game-changer for the franchise."</p><p>The developer, Mike Clopper, said, "We loved playing it and working on it was a fantastic experience in spite of its cancellation."</p><p>Clopper now works at Call of Duty studio Raven Software as studio design director, having joined the team just this month ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Black Ops 6</a>'s launch on October 25.</p><p>A battle royale mode for Halo Infinite had been rumored for years. It was reportedly in the works under the codename Project Tatanka before being rebranded to Project Ekhert in 2023 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-halo-battle-royale-project-seemingly-canceled/1100-6520335/" data-ref-id="1100-6520335">later canceled</a>. A <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1841149602625356083" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from Rebs Gaming</a> said the game was tied into the Halo Infinite narrative and was playtested on a weekly basis. The report said the game took place on a sprawling map featuring unique biomes. It was ultimately canceled, the report said, in part due to a shift toward working on the next Halo projects instead.</p><p>Halo Infinite never got an official battle royale mode like what was reportedly in the works, but the game did introduce a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinites-battle-royale-like-last-spartan-standing-mode-revealed/1100-6502683/" data-ref-id="1100-6502683">battle-royale-like mode called Last Spartan Standing in 2022.</a></p><p dir="ltr">With games like Fortnite, Apex Legends, PUBG, Call of Duty: Warzone, and others dominating the headlines and sparking conversations about battle royale, it was only logical that attention would eventually turn to Halo. In July 2018, Halo franchise writer Jeff Easterling poured cold water on the idea of Halo Infinite featuring a battle royale mode by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22I%27ll+tell+you+right+now%2C+the+only+BR+we%27re+interested+in+is+Battle+Rifle.%22&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS940US940&amp;oq=%22I%27ll+tell+you+right+now%2C+the+only+BR+we%27re+interested+in+is+Battle+Rifle.%22&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying</a>, "I'll tell you right now, the only BR we're interested in is Battle Rifle."</p><p dir="ltr">In April 2019, noted Microsoft insider Brad Sams <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1l2OLHse1M"><ins>reported</ins></a> that 343 was <em>considering </em>the possibility of adding a battle royale mode to Halo Infinite in some form. Sams reported that Halo Infinite's take on battle royale would offer something different compared to Fortnite and Apex, but we never learned any specifics.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spencer-halo-infinite-is-not-a-make-or-break-moment-for-the-series-doesnt-need-battle-royale/1100-6493415/" data-ref-id="1100-6493415">said in an interview</a> that Halo Infinite never <em>needed </em>a battle royale mode in the first place.</p><p dir="ltr">"With a lot of the innovations and evolutions that have happened in FPS multiplayer over the years, there was something very pure about coming back to a Halo arena experience and how clean it was and how tight the gameplay loop was," he said. "Right now on our platform there are not a lot of games that are going back to that tried and true formula and perfecting what they have, and I think that's what the goal of this team is."</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Infinite launched in 2021 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-becomes-biggest-halo-launch-of-all-time/1100-6499962/" data-ref-id="1100-6499962">found quick success out of the gate</a>, but it failed to break through like Microsoft wanted it to. Recently, Microsoft said Halo Infinite represented the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">"last remnant" of how Halo games are made</a>, with the team significantly changing its development processes going forward. Xbox boss Matt Booty said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-launch-was-like-a-runner-tripping-and-falling-at-the-finish-line-xbox-boss-says/1100-6508915/" data-ref-id="1100-6508915">Halo Infinite's launch was like a runner who trips and falls at the finish line.</a></p><p>343 Industries recently changed names to Halo Studios and is now developing multiple new Halo games using Unreal Engine 5.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/it-sure-seems-like-xsolla-wants-to-take-a-bite-out-platform-cuts-from-steam-other-platform-owners<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On a train ride out of Gamescom, I chanced on a pair of junior developers scrutinizing their own lanyards, which sported Xsolla's branding. "Who even IS Xsolla?" one of them asked, as they commented on how they'd seen the branding at all kinds of events over the last year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ever the eavesdropper, I leaned in to answer the question. I'm not just familiar with the firm because we've covered them </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xsolla-names-cathleen-nilson-as-new-chief-financial-officer">a fair few times</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Game Developer, but because just a few hours earlier I'd been chatting with a pair of their executives at their trade area booth. I wasn't surprised at their confusion. Most people don't get into game development to multiply conversions or build digital rewards programs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Xsolla has, and it's done so aggressively across the globe. Its biggest win might be its ability to act as a monetization bridge between major game studios and territories they don't traditionally operate in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'd hopped into my conversation with Chief strategy officer Chris Hewish and senior VP of EMEA Chris Meredith intending to ask about those territories—but our conversation took a turn that surprised me. We'd been discussing the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-the-heck-is-happening-with-live-service-games-">struggles of live service games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> when Meredith took a verbal swipe at the "gatekeepers" keeping developers from selling directly to players.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xsolla-and-savvy-games-set-to-launch-development-academy-in-saudi-arabia" target="_self">Xsolla and Savvy Games set to launch development academy in Saudi Arabia</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That jolted me out of my jet lag—and helped me reframe something the pair had said earlier. They'd spoken repeatedly about the idea of "democratizing the business of gaming," to allow developers to sell digitally to players directly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, it sure sounded like they were saying they'd like to take a chunk out of the platform business.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Xsolla isn't a fan of &quot;the gatekeepers&quot;">Xsolla isn't a fan of "the gatekeepers"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meredith's response to my question about live service games began with a typical analysis of how saturated the market had become, particularly in Europe, one of the territories under "EMEA" he supervises Xsolla's business in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's an awfully congested market," he said, in reference to the high number of games releasing every year. "We still have the gatekeepers doing what they're doing in that respect as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Wait, which gatekeepers was he talking about? Government regulators? The App Store? Steam?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He didn't say. And it sure sounded like he was scrambling to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> drop any proper nouns as our conversation moved forward. "I mean all of the ones that are still operating in their way in regards to the operation of how they bring their products to market," he said. He pivoted to an explanation of how advertisers are looking to advertise directly to players. "For us, with the relationship with the advertisers bringing their products to market, we are very much aware of trying to put them on the track of the [direct-to-consumer] roadmap, and if you're a small three man developer, that's quite challenging."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He alluded generally to how hard it is for smaller developers to obtain market share when there are so many games with high "brand loyalty," but kept pivoting back to the idea that helping those developers go direct to players (and consequentially, any advertisers on their games go direct to players too), was a big part of Xsolla's plans.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meredith agreed, noting the live service market is still a "very healthy business," saying they are seeing more developers go direct-to-consumer. He also implied that analyses of the video game market may not have access to any data from those companies, warping what the overall state of the video game economy looks like.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's factors like that that made Meredith call the overwhelming layoffs of 2023-2024 a "defensive, reactionary" move by companies, rather than a reflection of the health of the market itself.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Which companies should be standing at the gate?">Which companies should be standing at the gate?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All this talk of "democratization" and helping devs sell directly to players through their own websites or marketplaces is pretty ambitious talk. But it's not happening in isolation. Epic Games' legal assaults on Apple's iOS App Store and the Google Play Store, as well as its aggressive attempts to compete with Steam paint a picture of corporations frustrated by how platform holders shape the markets they control.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Xsolla's pitch isn't exactly "down with the App Store/Play Store/Steam," but it sure sounds like "devs should be allowed to sell to players without anyone else taking a cut."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Well, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>almost</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> anybody. I'm sure Xsolla itself would love to have just the teeniest nibble of the transactions that cross its platforms, and pick up a bit of the revenue previously bound for the "gatekeepers" described by Hewish.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>, the developer of Hitman, has announced it is taking on publishing duties for MindsEye, the big-budget action adventure in the works from former Rockstar exec Leslie Benzies. 
</p>
<p>
The development of MindsEye, at Benzies' own Build A Rocket Boy studio, has been shrouded in secrecy ever since it was announced as a component of Everywhere - the company's attempt at a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> or Roblox game creation platform. 
</p>
<p>
Today's announcement curiously makes no reference to Everywhere, other than a line at the very bottom of IO's press release which states "MindsEye is an Everywhere world", suggesting some connection between the two remains. Everywhere's website suggests the platform remains beta. Eurogamer has contacted Build A Rocket Boy for an update.

<p>
For now, at least, it looks like MindsEye is being pushed centre stage. It is described by IO as a "highly anticipated cinematic AAA, story-driven action-adventure thriller" created by Benzies, who held a key role at GTA maker Rockstar before his fractious departure in 2016.
</p>
<p>
"From day one, Build A Rocket Boy Studios has been focused on creating the next generation of compelling gaming and quality entertainment experiences," Benzies said in a statement today.
</p>
<p>
"We can't wait to share our first AAA premium game and ever-evolving universe, MindsEye, with the world. There is no finer partner than IO Interactive to publish our first title, with their strong understanding of community culture, premium action-adventure games, and a best-in-class publishing team, we really look forward to partnering with them on our new blockbuster journey."
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-producers-not-crypto-project-everywhere-is-part-episodic-blockbuster-part-roblox-rival">Eurogamer visited Build A Rocket Boy's flagship Edinburgh studio early last year</a>, when Everywhere was being seen as the studio's major focus. A game-creation platform built using Unreal Engine, it looked ambitious, if well funded by money from investor NetEase. 
</p>
<p>
Benzies' description today of MindsEye being an ever-evolving universe may refer to what he discussed with me previously of the game being episodic, with different chapters adding further forms of gameplay. (The connection to Everywhere, here, was that the game's assets and gameplay would then become available to players to create their own experiences using these parts.)
</p>
<p>
Build A Rocket Boy was originally founded in 2016 and has a network of studios globally in Edinburgh, Budapest, Montpellier and in China. While there's no mention today of when we'll see MindsEye arrive, a launch in 2025 would see the studio finally release its first project after nine years. (The launch would also align with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, amusingly.)
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-hit-gta-producers-everywhere-studio">the studio confirmed it had suffered job losses globally</a>, a month after completing a fresh $110m funding round.

            <p>Andy Serkis, Ben Starr, Jennifer English and more will star in forthcoming turn-based RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, as revealed in a brand new trailer.</p>
<p>While Starr (Clive in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>) and English (Shadowheart in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>) were known to be voicing characters, the rest of the cast was until now unknown. Serkis is, of course, best known for playing Gollum in the Lord of the Rings films and is no stranger to video games following his work at Ninja Theory.</p>
<p>English will be joined by other Baldur's Gate 3 cast mates Devora Wilde and Tracy Wiles, while the likes of Charlie Cox (Stardust), Kirsty Rider (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>), Shala Nyx (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</a>), and Rich Keeble (Good Omens) will all feature.</p>

<p>Alongside the cast reveal, the new trailer (above) shows off more gameplay and its surreal world. Further details have also been provided in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/introducing-the-cast-of-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Cox, English and Rider will play Gustave, Maelle, and Lune respectively, characters seen in previous trailers.</p>
<p>Serkis will play Renoir, a "forceful and passionate man" who "knows that victory demands sacrifice"; while Starr will play the "dangerous stranger" Verso. It's unknown exactly what roles these characters will play in the story.</p>
<p>While Eurogamer is yet to go hands-on with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, I was very impressed with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">hands-off preview prior to Gamescom</a>, thanks to its inspiration from classic RPGs from the Final Fantasy and Persona series.</p>
<p>The game has also been praised for its action-focused turn-based combat. "I was expecting turn-based fans to stand up and say 'oh this looks cool', but I wasn't expecting this community to be that excited actually," creative director Guillaume Broche told me. "It's like we awakened a sleeping dragon."</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is set for release in Spring next year across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Epic), and will be available on Game Pass day one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insensitive-assassins-creed-shadows-figurine-controversy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has found itself in yet more trouble, this time over a collector's figurine depicting protagonists Yasuke and Naoe alongside a one-legged Torii gate.</p>
<p>As reported <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by IGN</a>, collectible company PureArts <a href="https://x.com/PureArtsLimited/status/1846193318742434183" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said yesterday</a>&nbsp;that it is "reworking the design" of its Qlectors Yasuke &amp; Naoe figurine, which it says had an "insensitive design" that caused "concerns" from which it has subsequently learned.</p>
<p>The figurine in question was <a href="https://x.com/PureArtsLimited/status/1836873014085914794" rel="noopener" target="_blank">originally revealed back in September</a>&nbsp;and depicted the two protagonists of <i>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</i>next to (or atop, in Naoe's case) a Torii gate with one pillar instead of the standard two.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/purearts-assassins-creed-shadows-figurine-offensive.jpg?itok=Zb30fbjO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/purearts-assassins-creed-shadows-figurine-offensive.jpg?itok=Zb0JXuXX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some took exception to this PureArts figurine of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>protagonists Yasuke and Naoe.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with Torii gates, they can be found near Japanese religious shrines, and they traditionally represent the boundary between the human and divine realms.</p>
<p>The one-legged Torii gate, however, has specific significance; as IGN points out, perhaps the most famous one-legged Torii gate in the world <a href="https://www.discover-nagasaki.com/en/sightseeing/117" rel="noopener" target="_blank">can be found at Nagasaki's Sanno shrine</a>, and it stands as a memorial to the devastation caused by the atomic bomb being dropped on the city in 1945.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that Ubisoft or PureArts intended to cause any offense by depicting a one-legged Torii gate in the figurine, but this is just the latest blunder in a series of misfortunes that have surrounded&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date">its announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as the game was revealed, some began to take exception to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy">depiction of protagonist Yasuke</a> (a real-life historical figure) as a samurai, a point about which those taking offense say there is some contention.</p>

<p>This isn't even the first time an ancillary piece of media or art relating to&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has caused controversy.</p>
<p>Back in July, Ubisoft found itself in trouble when a piece of art in the game's Collector's Edition artbook was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-concept-art-apology">found to use the flag of a Sekigahara re-enactment group</a> without its permission.</p>
<p>Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>was also recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">delayed to February next year</a>&nbsp;as part of what appears to be a company-wide strategy rethink at Ubisoft, triggered by the underperformance of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>.</p>
<p>This is all against the backdrop of some of Ubisoft's investors&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">urgently suggesting a change in management</a>, with bosses the Guillemots and Tencent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report">reportedly considering taking the company private</a> in response.</p>

            <p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> publisher Ubisoft put out a 3-days-weekly return to office mandate for their entire staff worldwide - a decision that French Video Game Workers Union (STJV) <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/09/call-for-strike-for-all-french-ubisoft-entities-on-october-15-16-and-17-2024/">said was</a> "made without any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers’ representatives". In response, the STJV called on staff in France to hold a three-day strike beginning yesterday, which the union reports to be underway with the participation of more than 700 workers, via <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/10/15/ubisoft-staff-in-france-strike-over-home-working_6729463_4.html">Le Monde</a>.</p>
<p>"This decision is announced immediately after the failure of the profit-sharing negotiations," STJV wrote at the time. “Exactly like previous salary negociations: management’s proposals were inacceptable, the negotiations’ timetable was appalling, and management was deaf to the proposals of the various Employee representatives."</p>

<p>"After more than five years of working efficiently in the current remote-work context, many of our colleagues have built or rebuilt their lives (family life, housing, parenthood, etc.) and simply cannot return to the previous working conditions," the union wrote. "Our employer knows this perfectly well. The consequence of its decision will be the loss of our colleagues’ jobs, the disorganisation of many game projects, and the drastic increase in psychosocial risks for those who remain."</p><p>The tactic that the STJV refer to here, sometimes called ‘soft layoffs’, is the argument that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/12/why-rto-mandates-are-layoffs-in-disguise-according-to-workplace-experts.html">RTO mandates </a>are a deliberate ploy on the part of an employer to restructure a workforce without firing workers outright - an approach that disproportionately affects clinically vulnerable people and others who can't work in the office without reasonable adjustments. Back in July, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> developer Cloud Imperium were fined for discrimination after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-citizen-devs-cloud-imperium-fined-for-discriminating-against-autistic-programmer-over-work-from-home-request">dismissing an autistic senior programmer</a>, following his requests to work from home being denied.</p>
<p>"Unions said they had received no response to the grievances aired in February," write Le Monde. "The September message was ‘the straw that broke the camel's back'". Clement Montigny of the STJV union told Agence France-Presse (AFP) the move to in-person working broke promises made to staff and "calls into question the way they organise their lives."</p>
<p>The STJV’s demands include a formal agreement on remote work ("not an arbitrary decision taken several months in advance"), an increase in all salaries "to compensate for the drop in our living standards,” and “actually listening to employees opinion. Management seems indeed to confuse monologue with dialogue."</p>
<p>Speaking to AFB and Le Monde at the strikes, a designer at Ubisoft described the atmosphere as "gloomy", and said staff were disillusioned and feeling as though they weren’t being listened to.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a Bloomberg report suggested that Ubisoft owners Tencent and the Guillemot family <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">were considering a buyout</a>. Regarding affairs mildly stabtastic, Ubisoft announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> will be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-due-to-ubisoft-finally-listening-to-developers-pushing-for-a-delay-for-some-time-says-report">coming to Steam day one</a>, following delays.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’ve used some supers that land very consistently, and others that can feel like a gamble during a match. Flying at high speeds with a wonky camera certainly doesn’t help either.<br></p><p>An additional reason that compounds the issue is your opponent responding with an appropriate move. It’s easy for these attacks to connect in training mode against a lifeless CPU, but a real opponent who knows how to quickly recover might be able to dodge or even block it in time. That’s why we’re going to go over the best scenarios for these kinds of supers, so you don’t have to keep seeing your favorite version of Goku fly toward the camera at Mach 10.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eb77e8f45705dfce3b182816949be316" data-recommend-id="image://eb77e8f45705dfce3b182816949be316" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frieza doubles over after taking a Heavy Finish from Gogeta." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Frieza doubles over after taking a Heavy Finish from Gogeta." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eb77e8f45705dfce3b182816949be316" data-recommend-id="image://eb77e8f45705dfce3b182816949be316" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frieza doubles over after taking a Heavy Finish from Gogeta." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>The best way to land these attacks is to deliver one after a heavy finish.</strong> You’ll know it’s performed correctly if your opponent bends forward while holding their stomachs. While these commonly have combo extensions for more damage, they’re also a great moment to show off with a flashy super.<br></p><p>A majority of characters have one or two Rush Chain combos that can result in a heavy finish, but some don’t have any at all. The inputs aren’t universal across characters either, so I recommend taking your fighters into training and then checking the Rush Chain Actions page. It isn’t explicitly stated, but this page is unique to every character.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="beb8ac3d1825215b626f59428eb28397" data-recommend-id="image://beb8ac3d1825215b626f59428eb28397" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gogeta watches as Frieza launches into the air after a launcher." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gogeta watches as Frieza launches into the air after a launcher." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="beb8ac3d1825215b626f59428eb28397" data-recommend-id="image://beb8ac3d1825215b626f59428eb28397" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gogeta watches as Frieza launches into the air after a launcher." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Another common method is to input the super after using a launcher or Vanishing Attack. Many Rush Supers start fast, meaning you can follow and catch up to the opponent as they’re still being knocked back. The big caveat here is that it can be ruined if they recover fast enough. Be wise about which launchers, as well as which supers, you use.<br></p><p>Taking the above into consideration, another idea is to launch them towards the ground and use a super as they make contact. These attacks can hit a grounded opponent, albeit at reduced damage. The other possibility is that they recover from the ground hit but don’t have enough time to dodge or counter.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9e301b61b36f94573b6944c5fefe9049" data-recommend-id="image://9e301b61b36f94573b6944c5fefe9049" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Majin Buu stands in front of a paralyzed Frieza, with purple sparks surrounding them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Majin Buu stands in front of a paralyzed Frieza, with purple sparks surrounding them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9e301b61b36f94573b6944c5fefe9049" data-recommend-id="image://9e301b61b36f94573b6944c5fefe9049" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Majin Buu stands in front of a paralyzed Frieza, with purple sparks surrounding them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A useful condition in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is Paralyze. <strong>Landing an attack with this condition will leave the opponent in a defenseless state and stop their movement for three seconds.</strong> That’s more than enough time to throw out a rush super.<br></p><p>You can find quite a few characters with unique moves that paralyze the enemy.

<p>There’s seemingly never a shortage of lengthy role-playing games that demand tens or hundreds of hours of your free time to complete, and BioWare is perhaps the reigning king of offering such massive titles. You can spend significant time exploring, completing side quests, and unearthing companion stories in its games. We’re all about to lose ourselves to the studio’s newest title. Here’s everything we know about Dragon Age: The Veilguard!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-dragon-age-the-veilguard">What is Dragon Age: The Veilguard?</h2>



<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is an epic RPG from developer BioWare, the renowned studio behind Dragon Age: Origins and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. The Veilguard sees players return to Thedas, a land full of magnificent vistas and dangerous dungeons, as a corrupt god aims to take over and dominate its people.</p>



<p>You play as Rook, an all-new hero in the franchise, with choices that alter how you play and how the story unfolds, along with a party of seven unique companions. Your task, as Rook, is to unite The Veilguard, restoring the ancient order to fight demons and, worse, the aforementioned corrupt gods.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date">Do We Know the Dragon Age: The Veilguard Release Date?</h2>



<p>It’s been a long time coming, especially since many of us have eagerly anticipated another RPG from developer BioWare for years now, but Dragon Age: The Veilguard officially releases on <strong>October 31, 2024</strong>. There is no advanced access period, so if you pre-order the game or buy it on<strong> </strong>day one, you’ll receive access like everyone else.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-dragon-age-the-veilguard-system-requirements">What Are the Dragon Age: The Veilguard System Requirements?</h2>

<p>Besides the massive storage requirements, the overall PC system requirements for Dragon Age: The Veilguard don’t appear overwhelmingly tricky to run. Do you think your gaming rig can handle the upcoming RPG from BioWare?</p>

<h2 id="h-does-dragon-age-the-veilguard-have-character-creation">Does Dragon Age: The Veilguard Have Character Creation?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Yes! Dragon Age: The Veilguard features a full-fledged character creation suite, allowing players to alter their race, faction, class, and appearance heavily at the start of the game. There’s some controversy surrounding the Dragon Age: The Veilguard character creation mechanics, with a loud minority calling it “woke” for including certain customization options. But hey, you don’t need to use those options!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-dragon-age-the-veilguard-factions">What Are the Dragon Age: The Veilguard Factions?</h2>



<p>The RPG features six factions, which you’ll work with throughout the game to influence the story. They include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Antivan Crows</strong></li>



<li><strong>Grey Wardens</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lords of Fortune</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mourn Watch</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shadow Dragons</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veil Jumpers</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-is-dragon-age-the-veilguard-a-direct-sequel-to-dragon-age-inquisition">Is Dragon Age: The Veilguard a Direct Sequel to Dragon Age: Inquisition?</h2>



<p>Yes! Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a direct sequel to Dragon Age: Inquisition. The RPG heavily focuses on Solas, a party member from the latter, who becomes the primary antagonist in The Veilguard. You’ll fight across Thedas to stop Solas from gaining any more power and altering the course of history.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-any-returning-characters-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Are There Any Returning Characters in Dragon Age: The Veilguard?</h2>



<p>Alongside Solas, we’ll also see the return of Varric Tethras, Lace Harding, Leliana, and Morrigan, and rumors are pointing toward Dorian returning for, at the very least, a quick cameo.</p>



<p>Despite the number of returning characters, you don’t need to play any previous games to enjoy The Veilguard, though it may help you acclimate to the lore and story!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-main-character-voiced-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Is The Main Character Voiced in Dragon Age: The Veilguard?</h2>



<p>The main protagonist in Dragon Age: The Veilguard is fully voiced and will speak in cutscenes throughout the game. You can choose one of four voices during character creation: two male and two female.</p>



<p>While I, like many of you, would prefer a silent protagonist for greater immersion, allowing us to choose a voice is a small concession.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fairy-tail-2-hands-on-preview-all-out-magical-war/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The original&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fairy-tail-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairy Tail,</a> released back in 2020, ended up being one of the best JRPGs based on a manga and anime series ever made. Japanese studio Gust, known for being the developer of the Atelier series, managed to masterfully capture the spirit of the franchise, creating a game that can be enjoyed by both fans of Hiro Mashima's work and complete newcomers, despite some small shortcomings that do not detract from the experience in any major way. Four years later, Gust will bring players back to Earth-land with Fairy Tail 2, which is setting out to outdo its predecessor in a lot of different ways.</p>
<p>Following my short hands-on session during this year's Gamescom, where I also had the chance to <a href="https://wccftech.com/fairy-tail-2-interview-with-producer-hiroshi-kataoka-discussing-the-series-new-combat-system-additional-content/">speak with producer Hiroshi Kitaoka</a>, I was recently able to try out the first five or so hours of Fairy Tail 2. This allowed me to get a better idea of the game's overall progression flow and, most importantly, the new battle system, which I feel will be one of the highlights of the experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241007174217_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As previously confirmed, Fairy Tail 2 will adapt the Alvarez Empire Arc, where Natsu and the entire Fairy Tail guild take on emperor Spriggan Zeref Dragneel and the powerful members of the Spriggan 12. Right from the Prologue, the game wastes no time throwing players into the thick of the action, providing a first tutorial battle that teaches players the basics while introducing some of the major players of the new story arc. Those with no knowledge of the manga may find themselves a little confused, but the game does a very good job providing all the background information needed to understand the story, the world, and the characters themselves, with the Check Terminology feature, which allows the player to quickly learn more about terms highlighted during dialogue sequences.</p>
<p>Still, unsurprisingly, those with knowledge of the story arc Fairy Tail 2 is adapting will have a much better time right from the get-go, as there's a lot the game throws at the player during the first couple of hours. The characters that appear in the first few chapters are already well-established as well, so a little research in the in-game Database is expected. This feature provides information on characters and story events that happened before the Alvarez Empire arc, which definitely helps, although reading the manga or watching the anime remains a way better option to learn more about the world and characters created by Hiro Mashima.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241007175221_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though the first few hours of Fairy Tail 2 proceed mostly on rails, they give the chance to explore a few locations and fight quite a few battles. Exploration is mostly in line with what other modern JRPGs offer, featuring some medium-sized fields filled with items and enemies, which can be attacked beforehand to start a battle with an advantage, and little else, although things could be different in later chapters.</p>
<p>Combat, on the other hand, really stands out from traditional JRPGs. Doing away with the straightforward turn-based system used in the first entry in the series, Fairy Tail 2 uses a system that mixes together real-time and turn-based features. During the battle, players can only control a single character, and the two other party members will fight on their own, unleashing skills as needed. A circular bar indicates when the controlled character can act, and once they can, it is possible to use regular attacks to gain SP that can be used to unleash skills with different properties and area of effects. Skills can combo together or even be used repeatedly to increase power for increased SP. Once all SP has been depleted, the turn will end.</p>
<p>Adding more complexity to this combat system are the Break mechanics. Every enemy in Fairy Tail 2 has a Break gauge that is depleted with every attack. By depleting one bar, it is possible to command any of the characters controlled by the AI to unleash a skill that can also buff the party. Depleting the Break gauge completely permits the party members to unleash Duo Raids, combination skills that deal a lot of damage and have more diverse properties than regular skills, such as healing and debuffing. All this, in conjunction with the ability to guard at any time to reduce incoming damage, switch characters on the fly, and different elemental properties, promise to make combat in Fairy Tail 2 extremely dynamic and fun. The system also has some decent depth to it, as there are ways to extend attacks per single turn, so I'm really looking forward to delving deeper into it.</p>

<p>Fairy Tail 2 may be, on the surface, a game for fans of the manga and anime series, but the excellent work Gust seems to have done to make the experience welcoming to newcomers and its combat system will offer a lot even to those who have little knowledge of the original material. To learn if the game will have what it takes to stay toe-to-toe with more established franchises, we won't have to wait much longer, as Fairy Tail 2 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch on<a href="https://wccftech.com/fairy-tail-2-december/"> December 11th, 2024.</a></p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/astro-bot-new-speedrun-level-and-special-bots-out-tomorrow/?sf275076782=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a PlayStation Blog post</a>, Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet says that the first speedrun level, Building Speed, will arrive tomorrow, October 17th. It'll come alongside an online leaderboard to allow you to compare your skills with the rest of the&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>community.</p>
<p>Building Speed will equip you with bulldog dash boost powerup Barkster, alongside whom you'll need to "blast your way through a sky-high city", dodging obstacles like cranes and "a flying car wash" on your way to the goal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-speedrun-stage-new-bots-building-speed.jpg?itok=ihYjDKBh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-speedrun-stage-new-bots-building-speed.jpg?itok=7mKypcas 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is getting a brand new speedrun stage tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>From this point on, you'll be getting a new speedrun level in&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>every week, so you'll have something to keep you busy if you're looking for an excuse to keep playing Team Asobi's delightful platformer.</p>
<p>Next week's level is called Let it Slide, followed by Spring-loaded Run on Halloween, Helium Heights on November 7th, and Rising Heat on November 14th. It's not clear if the weekly speedrun levels will continue after that.</p>
<p>Naturally, this update also brings ten new bots for you to rescue, some of whom we already know about; last month's State of Play gave us a look at the Helldivers from Arrowhead's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/helldivers-2"><i>Helldivers 2</i></a>, as well as Eve from Shift Up's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million">hugely popular</a> hack-and-slash action-RPG&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>.</p>
<p>There will, however, also be other bots to rescue, and Team Asobi is being relatively cagey regarding who those bots will be, so you'll have to play the new level to find out. Exciting times!</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, it's a 3D platformer created by Team Asobi that celebrates PlayStation's legacy.</p>
<p>Protagonist and lil' robo-mascot Astro platforms his way across a series of classic-style 3D platformer stages, rescuing a host of bots based on famous PlayStation properties like&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>along the way.</p>
<p><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is available right now <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/astro-bot/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusively on PlayStation 5</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/guild-esports-acquired-by-dcb-sports-for-just-130000/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For a couple of months, a full buyout of Guild Esports was being touted, with many believing it would serve as a last-ditch effort to rescue the brand that has undergone financial issues in recent years. Now, that acquisition has been completed, with US-based firm, DCB Sports LLC, securing Guild Esports in full for a one-off cash payment of just $130,000.</p>



<p>DCB now owns 100% of Guild’s assets – but that also includes outstanding liabilities and debts.</p>



<p>What does this mean for Guild Esports?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-times-are-changing">Times Are Changing</h2>



<p>Per a report, DCB Sports will assume ownership of Guild and set up a new brand identity dubbed ‘Guild Esports and Gaming Ltd’. The $130,000 that DCB paid to secure the brand will be soaked up by the remnants of Guild Esports PLC. It was subsequently revealed that the original company will be renamed to ‘Cassel Capital PLC’ to avoid confusion post-transaction.</p>



<p>As news of the acquisition broke, Guild’s CEO, Jasmine Skee, announced her decision to resign from the company, vacating the position she’d held for almost two years.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.investegate.co.uk/announcement/rns/guild-esports--gild/completion-of-the-asset-acquisition-by-dcb-sports/8488426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a full release</a> published by Guild Esports PLC, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Guild’s Chief Executive, Jasmine Skee, has taken the decision to resign from the Company and step down from the Board of Directors with immediate effect to pursue new opportunities. The Board sincerely thanks Ms Skee for her significant contributions and strategic leadership of the Company under difficult conditions, and in particular, her efforts in completing the Transaction. Following Ms Skee’s resignation, the board will comprise Derek Lew and Brian Stockbridge, the Company’s non-executive directors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To date, Guild Esports has invested time and effort into various competitive ecosystems, such as Apex Legends, FIFA, PUBG, Fortnite, VALORANT, FGC games, Rocket League, EA Sports FC, and more. Presently, the brand is preparing to host The Women’s Esports Finals, a tournament taking place to drive awareness into the low numbers of female gamers in the esports industry.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Official 35 Minute Developer Deep Dive</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I recently played a little more than three hours of Stalker 2 that covered the beginning of the game and its opening few missions. My experience in the Zone could sometimes get frustrating, especially after trying to take down the same group of bandits four or five times, only to get overwhelmed and shot to death or blown up by one guy's extremely well-placed grenade. But once I started to get the hang of keeping myself alive by moving cautiously, exploring, and identifying threats at a distance, I found that Stalker 2 felt harrowing and invigorating in equal measure. It requires players to be on their guard and rewards them with strange, exciting experiences in the Zone.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 starts by immediately introducing you to the weirdnesses of the Zone. After both the historical Chornobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 and a fictional one in 2006, the Exclusion Zone is filled with strange, almost supernatural goings-on. Whirlwinds will toss people into the air and then implode their bodies; there are spherical gravitational anomalies that look like near-invisible bubbles that suck you into them; sometimes, jets of flame or bursts of electricity erupt from the ground if you wander too close.</p><p dir="ltr">Anomalies range from dangerous to deadly, but they can also be incredibly valuable. If you can make your way into the center of some anomalies, carefully picking a path based on the loud beeping of a detector that tells you just how close to danger you are, you can find an artifact--a strange object with unexplainable properties that you can equip on your character. That's what Stalkers--scavengers who make their livelihood in the Zone--are after.</p><p dir="ltr">After a betrayal during your trip into the Zone, you wind up becoming a Stalker too, mostly out of necessity as you try to find the person who turned on you and get back a special artifact they stole. Much like in the original Stalker, you're hunting a single person down and interacting with other people who live their life in the Zone. That means heading to Stalker settlements and taking on jobs to trade for information.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385008-s2_hoc_toxic_night.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385008" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385008-s2_hoc_toxic_night.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385008"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385008-s2_hoc_toxic_night.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 throws you in the deep end almost immediately. After the tutorial--where you're left for dead--another Stalker rescues you and introduces you to the mechanic of chucking metal bolts at anomalies to trigger them, which sometimes gives you the opportunity to run through them while they reset, and otherwise can let you probe their edges to see their size and distance. He points you in the direction of a town where Stalkers hang out, and along the way, you can pick up side missions and mix it up with random adversaries.</p><p dir="ltr">One of those side missions involved finding a Stalker trapped in a destroyed post office, engaged in a gun battle with some of the lawless bandits who also inhabit the Zone. Kill them, and he'll offer you the job of heading up the street to the bandits' stronghold to help his pal, this one being held because of gambling debts incurred by the guy in the post office. Here's where I died several times, because fighting human enemies can be extremely tough.</p><p>Combat feels a lot like in the original Stalker, where you're relying on weapons that aren't especially well-maintained or accurate. You can sneak up on the enemies in blasted-out buildings up the road from the post office, a few of whom are patrolling around and having conversations, to get the drop on them, but actually shooting them can be tough. A headshot is generally lethal against any human enemy, but body shots are way less predictable, and getting accurate aim under pressure was tough in any case. Part of it is definitely due to elements of Stalker 2 that are meant to make the game difficult and to make every fight feel intense and dangerous.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a jankiness to fighting overall, though, that can get a little irritating. It's not uncommon to be peeking out of cover, blasting away at your foes, only to have another guy walk right up behind you and shoot you in the back of the head, with no way of knowing he was there. And as mentioned, it can be tough to land accurate shots; at times I felt like I was dumping a whole magazine of bullets into one guy to little effect, while others went down immediately after one well-placed shot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385010-s2_hoc_dusk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385010" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385010-s2_hoc_dusk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385010"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385010-s2_hoc_dusk.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Reloading the same small firefight four or five times was a little bit galling, and it may be that in situations like this, you'll find yourself playing a fight over and over, getting to know exactly where each enemy is, and then using your knowledge to finally overcome the situation. On the other hand, though, getting walloped a few times in what was essentially my first battle impressed a key piece of information on me about Stalker 2: Fighting is extremely dangerous, and you should avoid it wherever possible.</p><p>The unreliability of combat feels intentional--the developers want you to be careful about taking on people you find out in the world, and staying on guard to avoid bumbling into firefights. It also had me thinking twice about future side quests. Did I really want to walk into some meat grinder of a bandit camp just for a few coupons? Was the Stalker who gave me the job setting me up? Those elements put a different spin on Stalker 2's open world that works well for making the place feel dangerous at all times.</p><p dir="ltr">Even cooler were my chances just to explore the Zone and encounter strange things. Walking to any given place means watching for and avoiding anomalies and mutants, as well as humans. I found two Stalkers running from twisted pigs called Fleshes at a farm, and watched as one barricaded himself inside the farmhouse while the other was killed by the creatures. Killing them all showed that combat can be as clunky against mutants as it is against humans. As I circle-strafed the pigs, they leapt at me over and over again, while I dumped a bunch of bullets into each one. Moments like this, again, gave Stalker 2 a more awkward feel than most modern games tend to have. There's a degree to which Stalker 2 seems like it's right out of 2008, which gives it both a unique feel in keeping with its setting and ideas, and sometimes makes it cumbersome to actually play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385011-s2_hoc_toxic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385011" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385011-s2_hoc_toxic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385011"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385011-s2_hoc_toxic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I saved the survivor, who thanked me before letting me go on my way. Later, I noticed another group of those same mutated pigs out in a field, with an anomaly floating nearby. This time, I drew their attention with a few gunshots and then stood with the anomaly between me and them, letting them charge right into it and implode in midair. It was as satisfying a solution as it was efficient, and played into the idea that paying attention and using your knowledge of the Zone might be more interesting for gameplay experiences than relying on more run-of-the-mill video game elements like shooting. The combat feeling a little clunky and creaky, just like your fragility as a character, encourages that approach.</p><p dir="ltr">One side mission took me to a particularly cool location: a field of deadly anomalous poppy flowers. Like in The Wizard of Oz, the poppies make anyone who strays into the field uncontrollably sleepy, but if you fall asleep here, you never wake up. What's more, you hear strange whispers and echoes of the dead who've been lost in the field. Running around, searching for a lost religious icon belonging to someone who used to live in the area before the accident, I had to keep chugging energy drinks to stay awake. The screen would darken as I started to drift off, signifying heavy eyelids. At the same time, a wisp of petals--some kind of anomaly, seemingly alive--would whip through the field, bringing with it a stronger, deadlier dose of drowsiness. I finally found the icon and got the hell out of there after the screen went dark for so long I was sure I'd succumbed to an endless slumber among the flowers.</p><p dir="ltr">The time spent in the settlement and advancing Stalker 2's main story presented a different kind of tension. In the first town I ventured into, I found locals in conflict with the Wardens, a military group working within the Zone, who were hunting a Stalker they believed had murdered some of their men. To get information about your betrayer, you can choose to work either with some of the locals, who want to protect the accused, or with the Wardens, taking on jobs for either one. If you talk to the Wardens, they'll send you to a location where they think the murderer is hiding out, given to them by a local informant. It was pretty obvious to me the informant had lied, hoping the Wardens would bumble into a trap, especially as he gave me a stern warning to be careful.</p><p dir="ltr">I chose to work with the other group and discovered the man was actually hiding in a windmill full of boobytraps--located in the complete opposite direction--where I helped him escape by venturing into a cave, killing an invisible mutant, and navigating a deadly anomaly in order to get him an artifact he needed. Though the preview ended before I learned about the fallout of my actions, it was clear the occupying Wardens weren't going anywhere, and wouldn't be happy if they never found their suspect.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385012-s2_hoc_campfire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385012" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385012-s2_hoc_campfire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385012"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385012-s2_hoc_campfire.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Navigating anomalies, navigating the open world and its mysteries, and navigating the politics of different competing factions all have me excited for Stalker 2. Its atmosphere of deadly, mysterious strangeness makes wandering its open world both alluring and frightening. Stalker 2 perfectly balances the desire to discover what's hidden out there, like a field full of whispering poppies, with the unnerving knowledge that the Zone is also full of things that can and likely will kill you. Though it can sometimes feel like a throwback to older games, especially in elements like its combat, it's that feeling that also helps make Stalker 2 both frightening and compelling.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-league-of-legends-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced a wave of layoffs that will impact the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>development team, although co-founder Marc Merrill says the team will "eventually be even larger than it is today".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/status/1846243708100091985" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Merrill says the "tough decision" to lay off "some roles" among the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>team was made in order to make "sure we have the right expertise so that&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond".</p>
<p>Merrill doesn't specify how many team members are being laid off, nor does he say which departments will be most affected by the layoffs, but he does say that those being laid off will be supported by "a minimum of six months' pay, annual bonus, job placement assistance, health coverage, and more".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/status/1846243939843821748" rel="noopener" target="_blank">followup message</a>, he says that team size and budget "aren't the right way to measure whether a team will be successful", and that "having the right team, right priorities, and a sustainable approach" is more important than simply having a large team.</p>
<p>I'm sure that won't come as much consolation to the folks who are being laid off today, and the comments about the team eventually being bigger are a little strange in light of said layoffs, but we'll have to wait and see what happens next.</p>

Back in January, Riot announced it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-developer-riot-games-laying-off-530-employees-riot-forge-will-cease">laying off over 500 employees</a> and shutting down its Riot Forge division, which was responsible for publishing the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ruined-king-league-of-legends-story">Ruined King</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Song of Nunu</em>.</p>
<p>Despite these layoffs, there's still plenty in the works for&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and Riot Games as a whole. A new&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>fighting game spinoff,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is"><em>2XKO</em></a>, is currently in the works, and&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>itself is still getting new champions, including&nbsp;<em>Arcane</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-ambessa-revealed">Ambessa</a>, who's on the way sometime soon.</p>
