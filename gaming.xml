The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/autobattle-your-past-self-in-fool-king-a-promising-strategy-roguelite-in-which-dice-are-soldiers">Fool King</a> is dead, long live the Deckbuilder King. The Decking, if you will. Publishers Yogscast Games have announced that festive card-based roguelite The Royal Writ will launch on 7th August.</p>
<p>The Royal Writ seems pretty spesh, and yet, we have never covered it before, because we are blundering philistines. Sorry about that. In our defence, this is yet another cousin of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> on some level, and there's only so many of those I can process in one year before my thumbs and eyes swell up in protest. But based on a quick snort of the Steam demo, The Royal Writ stands apart thanks to 1) immensely jovial animated storybook visuals 2) an interesting set of card sacrifice mechanics. Here is a trailer.

<p>
The Royal Writ might look like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKYEKhxWy6o">the opening number for Disney's Robin Hood</a>, but it's actually rather grisly. Each lane-based battle is a sort of slaughterhouse line. As the king implied by the title, you place unit cards on the left who advance from turn to turn, column to column towards the enemy outpost on the right, dishing damage as they go. As regards the early battles, at least, columns nearer the enemy give your cards a boost. All fine and dandy, but if those cards actually reach the final column and make contact with the opposing fortifications, they'll be obliterated instantly and vanish from your hand forever. 
</p>
<p>
As such, you'll want to arrange cards so that you build a multiplier and overcome your adversary's health pool before your forces advance too far. Except. Except that sometimes letting your merry minions perforate themselves on the defences is beneficial. For example: there's an affluent Widow card who racks up a fat pile of cash as she advances along her lane. You'll be able to 'inherit' that coin if she dies. So maybe don't win too early, eh? I like the pervasive evilness of The Royal Writ, which elsewhere comes across in resourcing opportunities such as the ability to trade a soldier's teeth for upgrades. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3333700/The_Royal_Writ/">Find the Royal Writ demo on Steam</a>. The game is the work of Save Sloth Studios, who are also working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2876100/Sixth_Sun/">Sixth Sun</a> - an action game set in alternate 1500s Mexico, with similarly luxuriant visuals. Incidentally, if anybody knows of any other upcoming or new-ish games featuring kings (not 9 Kings or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-king-is-watching">The King Is Watching</a>, which we've covered already), please sing out in the comments. I've done three king-themed games today and I need a fourth to finish the poker hand or I won't be able to sleep tonight.

But nine months later, the Vtuber says the talent agency that reps her, VShojo, has failed to pay more than half a million dollars to the charity. “This entire situation has broken me,” she said in a new YouTube video posted on Tuesday.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Titled “Why I left VShojo,” the video (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitchs-biggest-vtuber-quits-agency-alleging-missing-charity-funds-of-over-500000/1100-6533329/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitchs-biggest-vtuber-quits-agency-alleging-missing-charity-funds-of-over-500000/1100-6533329/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GameSpot</em></a></span>) details how the Vtuber came to be represented by VShojo and the events since last October that led her to now cut ties with the agency. Signing up in 2020, she said the relationship was ideal since it allowed her to maintain her privacy and focus on streaming as Ironmouse while the agency handled the business side of things. That seemed to go fine until recently, when VShojo allegedly stopped paying out funds it owed to the Vtuber and the charities she had supported. </p><p>“I believe that I am owed a significant amount of funds which I have not been paid,” Ironmouse said. “And most importantly, the Immune Deficiency Foundation is owed over half a million dollars from VShojo. I really wish that I could tell you more, but right now I have been advised to wait for legal proceedings. As of right now, I am an independent VTuber.”</p><p>The Vtuber suffers from an immunodeficiency disorder called CVID (Common Variable Immunodeficiency) and has frequently spoken about the importance of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twitch-ironmouse-streamer-most-popular-female-vtuber-vs-1848576685&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-ironmouse-streamer-most-popular-female-vtuber-vs-1848576685">the support provided by the  Immune Deficiency Foundation</a></span>. Ironmouse said she’s helped raise over $4 million for the organization over the years, with last year’s subathon expected to donate an additional $515,000 in money paid directly by fans through Twitch. While that money has allegedly never been paid out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new Tiltify campaign</a></span> with a goal of $1 million for the foundation has already raised over $850,000. </p><p>VShojo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>Ironmouse isn’t the only Vtuber currently speaking out against the agency. “I have been lied to from the company a lot about the situation,” Vtuber Kson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/cBxw80mZoWI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/cBxw80mZoWI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently said</a></span>. “My payments stopped last September. I was asking what’s going on for a long time, multiple times. All they said was, ‘It’s going to be paid,’ and it was never paid, and I think it will never be.”</p><p>Vtuber Kuro also announced she’s leaving VShojo yesterday. “I didn’t want to say anything until its finalized but since people keep making assumptions, no I am not staying here I’ve already submitted a leave contract and had that meeting 11 days ago,” she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/K9_KURO/status/1947656711524798886&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/K9_KURO/status/1947656711524798886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X</a></span>. “The only reason I still have the VShojo brand logo on here still is because they have to remove it themselves, as an associate u can not remove it yourself (same with everyone other member) in any case I’m just waiting for the contract to be all fulfilled and done but I guess I’m an indie now LOL.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vshojo.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vshojo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Of the 13 Vtubers listed on VShojo’s website</a></span>, the majority have all posted messages announcing they’re taking breaks from streaming or explaining that they are cutting ties with the talent agency. It’s unclear how much of it is a show of solidarity with Ironmouse or is happening because of widespread payment issues.

                <p>After a lengthy stretch of rumors, reports and leaks, the next major installment in the Battlefield franchise is finally being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reveal-trailer-coming-very-soon-see-a-teaser-now/1100-6533340/" data-ref-id="1100-6533340">unveiled on July 24</a>. Before then though, we've received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>'s first teaser, and things are looking pretty chaotic out there. </p><p>The scattered teaser primarily cuts between several news clips providing a lot of context for the game's inevitable conflict. Of significant note is the trailer's emphasis on the collapse of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is an alliance of existing world militaries. In the broadest sense, this alliance is meant to act as a form of deterrence, both to prevent members from fighting and to prevent outside states from attacking a member.</p><p>Battlefield 6 seems to kick off with an attack on NATO though, with much of the teaser focusing on news reports from all around the world about an attack on a NATO base in Mukhrovani, Georgia. Interspersed between these reports is other alarming news stemming from the fallout of this attack, including the assassination of a secretary general at NATO HQ, a frenzied social media response, and the US president's mobilization of armed forces.</p><p>Throughout, repeated mentions are made to Pax Armata, who appear to be the villainous faction of Battlefield 6 and the perpetrators of the attacks, which can be seen spreading to Belgium and then Gibraltar. The Battlefield X account also makes mention of the organization in the teaser announcement, which reads, "Pax Armata rises as NATO cracks. Their motto? 'Our protection, your peace.' But who’s pulling the strings and to what end?"</p><p>The teaser stresses the modern setting of the latest Battlefield game, which was recently confirmed by leakers and eventually EA. The series has been all over the timeline recently, with Battlefield 2042 taking place in the near future while the game before it, Battlefield V, took place during World War 2.</p><p>It won't be long before we learn more about Battlefield 6's gameplay and setting, seeing as the reveal is set for July 24. Additionally, EA and Battlefield Studios have shared that there will be an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-confirmed-will-include-this-key-change/1100-6533303/" data-ref-id="1100-6533303">open beta</a> ahead of the game's release where it is expected to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

<p>Former Bethesda dev had battled cancer</p>

<figure><a title="Julian LeFay Passes away" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/203374220c1e6/julian-lefay-passes-away.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: OnceLost</em></figcaption></figure><p>Julian LeFay, the man often referred to as "the father of the <strong>Elder Scrolls</strong>" and co-founder of the indie developer OnceLost Studio, has passed away after a years-long battle with cancer. The announcement was made by his studio earlier today on social media. He was 59 years old.</p>
<p>LeFay was instrumental in the early days of Bethesda's RPG history, back when the likes of <strong>Daggerfall</strong> was laying the foundations for what was to come from the studio in the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/is-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">Oblivion</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_anniversary_edition">Skyrim.</a></p>
<p>In the post, OnceLost said that he was "not just a colleague, he was a visionary who fundamentally shaped the gaming industry as we know it today."</p>

<p>LeFay numerous credits include programming lead on <strong>Arena</strong> and <strong>Battlespire</strong>, project lead on <strong>Daggerfall</strong>, as well as having credits on The Elder Scrolls Redguard and Morrowind.</p>
<p>He also worked as a composer and designer on games such as <strong>Wayne Gretzky Hockey</strong> (which came to NES) and music on the DOS <strong>Where's Wally?</strong> game.</p>
<p>LeFay's daughter also <a href="https://x.com/OnceLostGames/status/1948048790986051982">shared a poignant statement</a>, saying "Thank you for supporting his vision and giving him hope and strength until the end".</p>
<p>The studio addressed how this tragedy will affect work on its upcoming RPG, The Wayward Realms, and it's quite emotional reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He touched the lives of millions of players worldwide and inspired countless developers to push creative boundaries. Julian's legacy will live on in every realm, every quest, and every moment of wonder that players will experience in The Wayward Realms."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our thoughts are with LeFay's friends and family, and he will be missed by many in the industry.</p></section>

			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is the next game coming from Silent Hill 2 Remake and Layers of Fear developer Bloober Team, and though we don't have a solid release date for it beyond a <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/">Fall 2025 release window</a>, we do have a new look at gameplay with a new 10-minute gameplay showcase.</p>



<p>The video shows the protagonist digging through Sector A-0, showing off how you'll manipulate gravity and your environment in order to move towards your objective. It also shows more layers to the horror gameplay that the sci-fi adventure will feature, as you carefully and slowly creep around each corner, finger on the trigger of your weapon, ready to defend yourself against whatever monstrosity awaits.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>First revealed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-bloober-teams-next-survival-horror-game/">October 2024</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn looks to be the most confident and the most terrifying work from Bloober Team yet. While the studio's history as a horror game developer began strong with Layers of Fear, it faltered with back-to-back lacklustre releases that <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bloober-team-claims-its-finished-making-shitty-games/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwityLnytNOOAxVY2MkDHRPGLksQFnoECBUQAw&amp;usg=AOvVaw1q6lWprVE2HpS_CCCQT0qJ">the studio even admitted were poor</a>.</p>



<p>It has since turned things around following its success with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, which has led to the studio also taking on a remake of the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">Silent Hill</a> game.</p>



<p>We've seen plenty of Cronos: The New Dawn gameplay at this point, with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-dev-diary-outlines-combat-mechanics/">recent deep-dive just weeks ago</a>. The only thing we're really missing from Cronos: The New Dawn, is a release date. Hopefully, we'll hear about one soon. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wheel-world-is-the-feel-good-game-of-the-summer.1251288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Momentum is what <em>Wheel World</em> does best. It is the feeling of reaching a downhill section of road, a pristine Sega-blue sea stretching out in the far distance, and letting gravity, the weight of your bicycle, and slope do all the work. Release the right trigger, the button used to peddle, and simply careen down the gently curving asphalt. It’s as if you’re flying — the wind in your hair and shirt fluttering on your back, coasting to wherever the road takes you.</p><p><em>Wheel World</em> is an undeniably feel-good video game. But this wasn’t always the case. It started life with the title “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-annapurna-published-cycling-adventure-ghost-bike-is-now-wheel-world-173009766.html">Ghost Bike</a>,” casting you as a deceased cyclist making their way to bicycle Valhalla. One name change later (and probably a lot of behind-the-scenes wrangling), it arrives as a game about the unmitigated joy of riding a bicycle through a Mediterranean island.</p><p>The roads here are lined with cypress trees, the beaches are white and sandy, and you’ll come across many chic cyclists lounging in cafes. The atmosphere is so vividly rendered that I can practically taste the vacation Coca-Cola as I play. Summer itself seems strewn across the screen.</p><p>You play as Kat, a rider chosen by a cycling spirit named Skully to enact an ancient ritual. This is achieved by accruing parts of a so-called legendary bicycle: frame, wheels, chain, and more, which have fallen into the hands of rival cycling gangs. So you race these teams (which have superbly off-beat names like the “Nude Dudes” and “Shimmy Squad”), moving across a mix of dirt and road tracks. You encounter other cycling spirits residing in gigantic sculpted bike bells along the way. Ringing your bell at one of them causes the stonework to crack, thus revealing said spirit. You chat and gain an extra few bars on your boost gauge, before a portion of the map is revealed with tiny little icons indicating where you should pootle to next.</p><p>That’s right: <em>Wheel World</em>, from California-based studio Messhof, maker of the excellent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/22/4547420/nidhogg-indie-fencing-game-coming-out-this-year"><em>Nidhogg</em></a> sword-dueling games, is structured like an open-world behemoth from Ubisoft. But expectations should be kept in check. There isn’t a blockbuster’s worth of content here. Rather, across the roughly seven hours of playtime, you’ll take part in races, duke it out with lone cyclists, and meet cute little dudes with boxes on their heads who point you in the direction of new gear. Oh, and there are strange hovering drones which dole out rewards for classic checklist completion stuff (like finding hidden jumps and lost members of cycling crews).</p><p>You could argue the game is a little slight in its array of things to do. But that’s not quite right. Rather, <em>Wheel World</em> requires you to rethink traditional definitions of content — to move beyond markers on a map. Content, for example, is every highway and path whose varying terrains cause your bicycle to handle differently. It is the shaky, unstable feeling that is channeled from screen to hand to brain via the controller when you veer onto the little slip of gravel next to the road. Content is also watching Kat as she strains to surmount a hill with a gradient that would cause a heart attack in most. Our hero remains stoic: I marvel at her thighs of steel!</p><p><em>Wheel World </em>is filled with many more beautifully animated details. You’re able to hop off your bicycle and push it around on foot. Maneuvering in a tight space, Kat does a kind of swivel trick with her handlebars, essentially spinning the bike frame around in one effortless motion. Another deftly rendered moment: when Kat dismounts, lifting her right leg over the bike, resting it next to her left, and then freewheeling to a gentle stop while standing upright. If you’re a cyclist, this move will likely already be familiar to you: it means every journey ends with nonchalant cool (or so you likely imagine). I’ve never seen it reproduced in a video game before.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Annapurna Interactive</cite></p></div><p>All this serves to make ambling around the island an exquisitely elegant thing. It’s a shame, then, that the racing is a little more chaotic, a little less refined. Showdowns on wide open roads are, for the most part, a joy. Those that take place in tight city streets can be finicky, Kat bouncing awkwardly off AI cyclists, world geometry, and oncoming traffic. The difficulty also feels a touch wonky: races are too easy for much of the game before an unexpected spike arrives in the last hour or so (exacerbated by a chugging frame rate on the PlayStation 5).</p><p>Still, these moments of frustration only made me pine all the more for the relative serenity of the open (world) road. Upon rolling credits, I dived back in to check off remaining objectives while soaking up the picture-postcard vibe again. This, I think, is the true mark of a game like <em>Wheel World</em>: the extent to which the core mechanics might cajole you back.</p><p>Galavanting during my post-credits session, I thought about another notable racing title with light open-world design: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>. The latest in Nintendo’s flagship kart racer is a cascading stream of serotonin hits induced by cotton-candy skies, soaring backflips, and delightful <em>wahoos</em>. It is a pure pleasure machine. <em>Wheel World</em>, on the other hand, doles out joy with a little less machine-like efficiency. It is more languid, massaging your eyeballs, ears, and brain with great blocks of warm, cel-shaded color, nostalgia-tinted electropop, and, of course, beautifully tactile cycling.</p><p>What mileage there is in simply ebbing and flowing across the gorgeous sun-kissed land, carried along by both cool breeze and smooth tarmac. Freewheeling, it is practically impossible not to break out in a smile. With every descent, those smiles only widen.</p><p><sub>Wheel World <em>launches July 23rd on PC, PS5, and Xbox.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NTQzMA=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Lewis Gordon</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/711680/wheel-world-review-ps5-xbox-steam]]></content:encoded>

Users will be notified of their involvement via email and can opt in or out of the beta. One big feature being added in the update is the ability to have your PS5 controller sync up to multiple devices and switch between them quickly, no resyncing needed. It’s a nifty feature present on current-gen Xbox controllers and will make it easy to use your PS5 gamepad wirelessly on both your PC and console. But the more interesting news is an upcoming PS5 feature Sony is calling “Power Saver.” </p><p>Power Saver won’t be active in the beta, but will go live for everyone in the future. If users turn the optional feature on, the PS5 console will “scale back performance” while playing certain games in order to lower its power consumption. If games don’t support the feature, it won’t kick in. </p><p>Sony doesn’t go into great detail about what “scale back performance” means, but it does mention in some small print text at the bottom of the post that Power Saver won’t support VR games and that some “gameplay features may be limited.” To me, that seems to imply that you won’t be able to run some games at higher framerates when using Power Saver. And because VR demands high framerates to work, that would make Power Saver unusable. I also wonder if we might see some games turn off raytracing or other intense visual options when Power Saver is activated. </p><p>“At [Sony Interactive Entertainment], we are committed to Sony’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Road to Zero’ environmental plan</a></span>, launched in 2010, which includes achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040,” said Sony in the blog post. “We are always exploring how we can contribute to these goals through our products and services.”</p><p>Sony says it will share more details in the near future about Power Saver mode and how it will impact games as we get closer to the option going live. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-feature-power-saver-limit-performance-beta-update-1851786790]]></content:encoded>

Now, the studio has held a livestream to talk about the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://persona5x.com/news/details/000170xtpbmman.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://persona5x.com/news/details/000170xtpbmman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.2 update</a></span> that goes live tomorrow, and players are saying the team hasn’t actually fixed anything, and in some cases, is only making things worse.</p><p>Some changes the patch brings about do acknowledge issues players have complained about; it adds more login rewards and gifts in response to players getting fewer rewards during their play time, for instance. However, while some rewards were rebalanced to be more in-line with the Chinese version, the patch doesn’t do anything on top of that to compensate for the accelerated schedule, nor does it implement higher chances to pull rare characters in the game’s gacha systems. A major point of contention is that characters are not being added to standard banner (basically the baseline pool of characters you can get when rolling for new Phantom Thieves to add to your party) until they have been in the game for six months. According to the stream, this is because the team wants to “act out of consideration for players” who use premium currency to acquire highly sought after characters, which fans have interpreted as the team saying they want to continue to incentivize players to pay up if they want a better chance of getting those characters.</p><p>“Straight up ‘we only care about people who spend money,’” nightoftheghouls <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m78qnk/truly_a_do_you_not_have_phonesor_surprise/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m78qnk/truly_a_do_you_not_have_phonesor_surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Reddit</a></span>. “You aren’t supposed to say the quiet part out loud guys.”</p><p>What remains to be seen is if this will be standard procedure for the game moving forward, or if it’s just being applied to some characters released in the game’s first month while the devs continue to adjust its monetization and release roadmap. Fans worry this might make the game a bigger money and time investment while the accelerated rollout is still in place, and create a grindier game with less payoff.</p><p>“So now not only do we have an insane release pace of new characters, we will not be able to get any of the ‘Standard’ characters going forward until at least 5 months from now?” N0tZekken <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m783mr/the_12_livestream_didnt_tackle_any_real_problem/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m783mr/the_12_livestream_didnt_tackle_any_real_problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in another Reddit thread</a></span>. “Keep in mind that they can actually pull it off for every new character, and they could actually make it worse. What’s preventing them from increasing this to a year if sales are not satisfactory? Wouldn’t be the first time we’ve been lied to in the face by Sega/Atlus.”</p><p>The comments on the live stream VOD are filled with similar disappointment, with several viewers expressing the idea that if the game were to just roll out exactly as it did in China, many of their issues would be fixed. But for now, non-Chinese players are dealing with an accelerated, FOMO-driven game that’s been changed in ways that offer no real benefit. Well, none for players, at least. Atlus stands to gain a lot by forcing players into situations where spending real-world money is the easiest fix. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/persona-5-phantom-x-livestream-marian-review-bomb-gacha-1851786799]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo's Switch successor - the aptly named <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> - has become the fastest selling video game hardware device in US history, knocking the PS4 off the top spot.</p>
<p>That's according to the latest data from Circana, with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37i6gok2k">analyst Mat Piscatella</a> revealing 1.6m Switch 2 units were sold in the US during the console's launch month. The previous record holder was Sony's PlayStation 4, with 1.1m units sold during November 2013.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly given what I have just told you, the Switch 2 was the best-selling console of the month in terms of both physical unit sales and dollar sales. </p>

<p>Piscatella said 82 percent of US Switch 2 owners who purchased their console in June also plumped for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-launch-games-everything-you-can-play-on-day-one">launch title Mario Kart World</a>. This was either via a physical new game sale or as part of the Nintendo Switch 2 + <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> Bundle.</p>
<p>These figures come despite the tariff situation in US around the Switch 2's launch. As a reminder, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">Nintendo delayed pre-orders in the US back in April</a>. It additionally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">raised the cost of Switch 2 accessories in US due to tariffs</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-us-preorders-reportedly-cancelled-by-major-retailers">some US retailers were reportedly cancelling pre-orders ahead of the console's launch</a>. </p>
<p>All in all, the launch of the Switch 2 boosted the gaming market more generally. Consumer spending in the US - for both hardware and accessories - reached new all-time records. Last month, hardware spending in the US rose by 249 percent compared to this time last year, to $978 million. The previous high for June was $608m, which was recorded in 2008.</p>
<p>June accessories spending in the US, meanwhile, reached $293m. The previous record was $247m, which happened in June 2021.</p>
<p>"What the launch sales of Switch 2 primarily tell us is that they made a lot of Switch 2 to sell at launch," Piscatella said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-the-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-in-us-history">IGN</a>, when asked if this record breaking launch means that the Switch 2 is now set to surpass the original Switch's lifetime sales. In February of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-sales-below-expectations-as-wait-for-switch-2-continues">Nintendo had sold 150.86m Switch consoles</a>.</p>
<p>"Lifetime sales and launch sales of a console often do not correlate, meaning that some consoles with small launches ended up doing incredibly well," Piscatella continued, noting that the PlayStation 2 only sold 400k in its launch month.</p>
<p>"Since launch month demand is rarely satiated by available supply (and it is certainly not a great sign when it is, historically) all we can really get a read on at launch is the confidence of the manufacturer to make so many units available, and the ability of the supply chain to get those units into the market," the analyst closed.</p>
<p>"But having the biggest launch month sales for any new video game hardware platform is a helluva good start."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wheel-world-loves-bikes-and-the-people-who-love-them.1251261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wheel World</em> is out today, a ride-your-bike-around game by <em>Nidhogg</em> developer Messhof. Its <a href="https://aftermath.site/wheel-world-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> back in February covered most of the mechanics I’ve seen so far in the full game, though it did not make clear that there would be <em>cars</em>. I will forgive it for this, because it is <em>mostly</em> bikes and those bikes are very cool and fun to ride, but as is the grand moral duty of every cyclist, and in the allegiance to bikes the game revels in, I reserve the right to huff indignantly.</p><p><em><a href="https://annapurnainteractive.com/en/games/wheel-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wheel World</a></em> takes place in a magical world dominated by bikes, and at its start you’re tasked with helping a burning skull spirit recover their stolen bike parts so they can perform the “Great Shift” and move the “Chain of Life.” (These are bike references, you see.) It’s as good an excuse as any to send you out into the game’s world, where once you cross a bridge off the tutorial island you’re set loose in a lovely landscape that begs to be <a href="https://aftermath.site/bike-road-davis-comic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explored</a> by bike. Areas feel different from each other–forested mountains, rolling farmland, <a href="https://aftermath.site/parcel-corps-bike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">busy cities</a>–and all of it is delightful to discover and speed around on, with changing terrain that constantly brings your attention back to your bike. Everywhere you go you meet cyclists, either alone or in groups, many of whom you can challenge to races. The goal here is to earn enough “Rep,” or reputation points, to take on the riders who stole the bike parts and win them back.</p><p>I’m just at what happens in the game’s narrative after you recover all those bike parts, which you can, like all the parts you find in the game, slap on your bike. Bike parts are scattered around the world, or they can be purchased from shops with tickets you earn from floating corporate drones for doing challenges. The bike parts change how your bike handles, how fast it goes up or downhill, or how tightly you can turn. Charmingly, when you swap a part in, it shows up on your bike itself, letting you build and then admire some kind of Frankenstein’s monster that reminds me of one of my own bikes, a small vintage racing bike I slapped mortifyingly gigantic pedals on because they were the cheapest ones at the shop.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Messhof</figcaption></figure><p>I appreciate the way this isn’t overly technical, demonstrating a breadth of bike knowledge without requiring you to have that knowledge too. <em>Wheel World</em> is obsessed with bike lingo and subculture; the groups you can race all fit into rider archetypes like gravel riders, gearheads, elite racers, or people just out for a spin to the pub or coffee shop. Being a bike guy, they often gave me a chuckle, but they didn’t require any specialized insight to get the core joke. Similarly, the racing feels just the right amount of technical: beyond managing a boost meter via drafting, or riding closely behind other racers, there isn’t the high-fidelity fiddling or drift control you sometimes see in other racing games, and the gameplay is easy to pick up. (An exception: you can find drive trains around the world with gears you can shift; managing your gearing during a race would present more strategic challenge, but <em>Wheel World </em>makes it clear these parts are optional, and I haven’t spent much time with them.)&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, the races feel about speed and stakes, jockeying for position or trying not to fly off the turns in a velodrome. The courses are clearly marked and easy to follow, something sometimes lacking in other racing games, which lets you enjoy the speed and drama rather than frantically having to scan for the next checkpoint. I appreciated how different courses felt in different areas and even from each other, with some being laps or loops and others an end-to-end sprint. In some races I dominated easily, while in others I was dropped almost instantly or when I careened off a turn, or I lost in the final stretch by not saving enough boost. I’m not the biggest fan of racing games due to the aforementioned technicality featured in many of them, but I really enjoyed <em>Wheel World</em>’s take on them, and especially the sensation of biking around with others in a big, lovely world. Races have various goals that earn you rep, so there’s incentive to replay them with those in mind.</p><p>But then there are the <em>cars</em>. Just look at the bastards.</p><figure><figcaption>Messhof</figcaption></figure><p>Cars are clearly present in the above press screenshot that's been sitting on <em>Wheel World</em>’s Steam page for a while, so I wasn’t hoodwinked here, but the first time I biked over the bridge from the tutorial area to the main world, I gasped with <a href="https://aftermath.site/loser-lane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cyclist fury</a> when I arrived at a roundabout full of cars. One of the reasons <em>Wheel World</em> changed its name from <em>Ghost Bike </em>is, as the developer explained in a press release last October, that it was originally about being hit by a car and ending up in a cycling afterlife. “<a href="https://www.psreader.com/ghost-bikes-part-1-a-history-of-greif-and-activism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost bikes</a>” are worldwide memorials to cyclists killed in accidents, and the developer says they were aware of the association but felt that it fit. Such a solemn reference would be out of place in the lighthearted game <em>Wheel World</em> ended up being, so I think it was a good choice to change the name. But the idea of a world of bikes remains in the final game, and this made me shocked to see cars on the road. There aren’t nearly as many of them as there are in my urban bike commutes, and I understand why they’re here: They present challenges that spice up your rides and races, and drafting them or zipping through them refills your boost meter. <em>I get it</em>. But still, their intrusion into my biking paradise made me as furious at them as real-world cars do. A character in one race even agrees, griping about having to share the road with them.</p><p>My reaction, however, does further highlight the vibe of <em>Wheel World</em> inducting you into a special two-wheeled world, one set in opposition to the four-wheeled world of cars, so I’m not going to demand all the virtual cars get off the road the way I used to do in my younger, more confrontational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mass_(cycling)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Critical Mass</a> days. The fact that the game puts you so firmly into the cycling headspace that this emotion comes up feels like a point in its favor. It’s a game that has a lot of love for bikes and the people who ride them, even when it’s sending some of those people up. It reminds me of what I love about bikes, and it makes me want to get out and ride, though its races are also a <a href="https://aftermath.site/failing-on-a-bike-trip-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tragic</a> reminder of how I am the world’s slowest cyclist. At least I can live my hopeless dreams for speed as I keep playing the game.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ridge-racer-4-zine-magazine"><h3>Riiiiidddgggeeee Raaaaccceerrrr Ziiiinnnneeeee</h3></a><p>'A tribute to Namco's Ridge Racer Type 4, the vibiest racing game of all time'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/vice-waypoint-stories-resignations-editor"><h3>This Was Inevitable</h3></a><p>Waypoint 2.0's ordeal is the story of games media in 2025</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tyler-the-creator-dont-tap-the-glass-hip-hop-rap-kendrick"><h3>We Should All Outgrow Our Heroes Like Tyler, The Creator</h3></a><p>Turns out all it takes to shake hip-hop’s foundations was “Don’t Tap The Glass” daring its rap listeners to put the keyboard down and dance

			<p>Out of Time is a new multiplayer roguelike third-person action game from developer <a href="https://www.manticoregames.com/">Manticore Games</a> that will launch this coming September 25, 2025, on PC, and will initially be exclusively available on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vi-all-dlc-free-on-epic-games-store/">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>



<p>Out of Time puts players in a world where an event called "<em>The Shattering</em>" has ruptured space and time, leaving a final safe haven for people across all timelines called Infinitopia. Outside of Infinitopia's safety, however, you'll be charged with trying to save the remaining members of mankind from threats like dinosaurs, giant mechs, dragons, evil humanoids, mutant crabs, killer robots, and practically everything else that can exist across the entire timeline of the universe. </p>

<p>"<em>With </em><em>Out of Time</em>, we wanted to create a wholly unique and original experience that combines my favourite gameplay mechanics: the best aspects of roguelike, real time multiplayer, and MMO raids," said Jordan Maynard, chief creative officer at Manticore Games, in a press release. "<em>The result is an explosive cocktail of epic combat, infinite replayability, and deep social features, set in the unique context of a universe where time itself has shattered, and past, present, and future collide!</em>"</p>

<p>Out of Time is available to pre-purchase on the Epic Games Store on PC for $24.99 USD, and while Manticore Games is clear on it only initially being an EGS exclusive, it does not say when the game will be heading to Steam. Chief executive officer at Manticore Games, Frederic Descamps, does add that there are plans to bring it to other platforms, he just doesn't specify which ones.</p>



<p>"<em>Manticore’s mission is to create complex immersive multiplayer experiences. We’ve built </em><em>Out of Time</em> as a massively expandable dynamic universe using the Core UGC platform and Unreal. <em>We’re already planning more eras and PvP modes, plus additional platforms."</em></p>

We’ve built <em>Out of Time</em> as a massively expandable dynamic universe using the Core [user-generated content] platform and Unreal.

The good news: You and your friends will have an endless supply of gear and weapon combinations to choose from to build your own unique group of survivors. The bad news: All of mankind is trapped and needing to be saved from a gauntlet of dragons, mutant crabs, evil humanoids, warped beasts, killer robots, and everything in between—often all at once. Not to mention the biggest threat of them all—time.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In <em>Out of Time</em>, the catalyst to the chaos came from an event known as The Shattering, fusing the past, present, and future together into an unpredictable, ever-changing dynamic battleground. Survivors from all eras gather in Infinitopia, the last bastion of civilization, venturing into dangerous, corrupted regions in fast-paced solo or cooperative missions in a fight to reclaim reality.</p><p>Before you give up, don’t fear! The Shattering can taketh, but also giveth! Armed with gear and weaponry from the medieval times to futuristic cyberpunk utopias to prehistoric antediluvian times to post-apocalyptic wastelands and beyond, players will have over 190 million gear combinations to choose from, allowing them to truly create their own custom loadouts for each run. Classes? Where we’re going we don’t need classes. Every player chooses the gear set that best suits the play style they want to embark on every run. If you want to stack a rocket launcher on top of healing powers and tank armor—you do you.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <p>
Microsoft has walked back on its previous decision to hike the price of its new first-party Xbox games up to $80 USD this 'holiday season', saying it's sticking to a lower price point "in line with current market conditions".
</p>
<p>
Hints of a pricing rethink first emerged earlier today, when Microsoft first-party studio Obsidian Entertainment revealed its upcoming sci-fi action-RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2, which had previously been given an $79.99 price tag, would now cost $69.99.
</p>
<p>
"We have received your SOS via skip drone about the pricing," the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/obsidian.net/post/3lun6okl2us2q">wrote</a>. "As an organisation devoted to making sure that corporations do not go unfettered, we at the Earth Directorate have worked with [REDACTED] to revise the price of The Outer Worlds 2."
</p>
<p>
In a follow-up statement <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-concedes-that-the-outer-worlds-2-retail-price-was-too-high">to Windows Central</a>, Microsoft confirmed the pricing adjustment wasn't unique to The Outer Worlds 2. "We're focused on bringing players incredible worlds to explore," an Xbox spokesperson told the publication, "and will keep our full-priced holiday releases, including The Outer Worlds 2, at $69.99." It didn't provide a precise reason for its strategic U-turn, only saying the move was "in line with current market conditions."
</p>
<p>
Xbox was, of course, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">first major publisher to announced a price increase to $80</a> for "some" of its new first-party games earlier this year, and Nintendo swiftly followed suit, slapping an $80 price tag on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. At the time, however, the company stressed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">would be adopting a "variable pricing" system</a> for its new console and, to date, Mario Kart World is the only Switch 2 game to sport that bumper price tag.
</p>
<p>
And no other publisher has yet followed Xbox's bullish lead. Even Take-Two, which has long been rumoured to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">considering an $80 price tag for GTA 6</a>, has remained firm on its variable pricing stance, pointing to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-focused-experience-that-doesnt-require-massive-time-commitments-for-45">upcoming $50 Mafia: The Old Country</a>.
</p>
<p>
While some in the industry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rising-game-prices-would-happen-sooner-or-later-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">see rising game prices as inevitable</a>, Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-games-soaring-prices-have-a-cost-beyond-your-wallet-the-concept-of-ownership-itself">took at look at the phenomenon earlier this year</a>, noting that soaring prices have a cost beyond buyers' wallet - the concept of ownership itself.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mouse-work-gets-second-trailer-but-cant-release-until-creators-get-switch-2-dev-kit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mouse-work-gets-second-trailer-but-cant-release-until-creators-get-switch-2-dev-kit.1251204/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Nitrome's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mouse-work">Mouse Work</a> made a bit of a splash when it was revealed back around the Switch 2's launch, looking very much, as it does, a sort of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/snipperclips_plus_cut_it_out_together">Snipperclips</a> for Switch 2 that utilises the console's neat mouse mode function.</p>
<p>Now, Nitrome has released a second trailer for their mouse-mode-centric effort, alongside a bunch of new info about the ins and outs of what you'll be doing as you play- when you do actually get to play, that is.</p>
<p>The new trailer takes us through three job types, and shows off the game's Job Centre. The jobs detailed are Hairdresser, Archer and Tour Guide, so this is definitely already a much more interesting job centre than the ones this writer remembers being harrowed by during the late 1990s.</p>

<p>We'll let Nitrome's press release fill you in on a little more of the finer points:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In Hairdresser, you’ll work against the clock to give your hirsute customers the trim of their dreams. Click with your scissors to cut away at their hair, or use the razor to give them a close shave - and we couldn’t not add tweezers, right?</p><p>

Next up is Archer, where your aim will be put to the test. Hit all the targets as they fly past (quack), and don’t miss any, or else you’ll lose a life! Be sure not to hit your coworkers, too...</p></div>
<p>Tour Guide takes a fresh spin on a Nitrome classic - Hot Air! Propel your tourist through the stage to reach the goal, but be sure to visit landmarks along the way to take in the view and earn your tip. We’ve worked hard to ensure Tour Guide stays true to its roots (it was even programmed by one of the Hot Air series’ developers!)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
You can check out the trailer above for yourself, it's certainly looking like a whole bunch of fun, and this new glimpse also makes sure to highlight some important changes to the game's multiplayer.</p>
<p>"In Cargo Hauler, some crates will simply be too heavy to lift by a single mouse, or in IT Support, some popups will trap a player inside them - you’ll need a colleague to come over and close that popup before you can escape!"</p>
<p>Now, and on a slightly frustrating note, Nitrome, whilst fully ready to release by the looks and sounds of it, will have to wait to announce a release date for all this mouse-drive mayhem, as they have yet to receive a Switch 2 dev kit from the Big N.</p>
<div><p>As we reported on a while back, it seems that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-prioritising-switch-2-dev-kits-for-indies-needing-extra-oomph-say-devs">this is par for the course at this stage of a new console launch</a>, with indies that require extra grunt perhaps getting kits first. It still feels a bit odd that Nintendo aren't keen to make sure these sorts of titles, which big-up the new features of a new console, are first in line for kits, mind.</p><p>

As Nitrome puts it:</p></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Mouse Work’s release is dependant on Nitrome acquiring dev kits for Switch 2 which we do not yet have. That being said, we are working away to get Mouse Work as ready as possible so that when we do have one, we can release as soon as we can!<em><br></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll leave you with some fresh screenshots!</p>


<hr>
<p><em>Looking forward to getting some new job experience when Mouse Work manages to release? Like the look of what you've seen of the game thus far? Make sure to let us know in the comments!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has announced that&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, along with other Xbox holiday releases, will, in fact, cost the standard price of $70 rather than the $80 the studio previously announced.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/OuterWorlds/status/1948020672502137257" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, Xbox and developer Obsidian say that as part of "making sure that corporations do not go unfettered" (a tongue-in-cheek reference to the game's satirical anti-corporate message), the price of&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>will be lowered from $80 to $70.</p>

<p>Additionally, Xbox confirmed to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>&nbsp;that this pricing change applies not only to&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, but also to all Xbox holiday releases, so that includes the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>. Xbox is also releasing&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>this holiday, but that game was already set at $70.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-70-xbox.jpg?itok=IQJV6pAY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-70-xbox.jpg?itok=rLvqptb- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7&nbsp;</em>will also cost you "just" $70 when it launches this holiday.</figcaption></figure><p>In its statement to IGN, Microsoft says it's keeping the prices at $70 "in line with current market conditions", so although this may be true for 2025's holiday season, it may not hold for next year.</p>

<p>If you missed it, Xbox made the announcement that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-prices-raised-hardware-software" rel="nofollow">raise hardware and software prices back in May</a>, with its two major holiday releases (<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</i>) serving as the first $80 games from Microsoft.</p>

<p>That announcement was, of course, met with exactly the same hostility and criticism with which Nintendo was met when it announced that&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>would cost the same, although Nintendo hasn't climbed down on its pricing structure.</p>

<p>Xbox is, however, in a different position to Nintendo. Thanks to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">recent massive wave of layoffs</a> at Microsoft, which saw in-development projects like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Everwild</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">Perfect Dark</a>&nbsp;</em>canceled (as well as the latter shutting its doors for good), Xbox is arguably in need of some goodwill right now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-everwild-canceled-xbox-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=xfYxg1Do 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-everwild-canceled-xbox-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=n_Im1s8v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is arguably hurting for goodwill given its recent wave of layoffs and cancellations.</figcaption></figure><p>For now, though, we can take solace in the fact that we won't be paying $80 for&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;this holiday season. It's worth bearing in mind that both games are also available on Game Pass on day one, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">if you're a PC- or Ultimate-tier member</a>.</p>

According to market research firm Circana, Nintendo’s new console “debuted as the fastest selling video game hardware device in US history,” selling 1.6 million units in June. That topped the previous launch month record held by the PS4, which moved 1.1 million units in November of 2023.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Circana says that the Switch 2 was the best-selling console in the US in June overall, in terms of both units sold and dollars raked in. And overall the launch buoyed what the firm says is “a record high for hardware spending” in the month of June at $978 million. The previous record was $608 million in 2008.</p><p>As for games, it should come as no surprise that most Switch 2 owners also picked up a copy of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>, which was the only major first-party exclusive for the console until <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em> launched earlier this month. According to Circana, a whopping 82 percent of those who bought a Switch 2 also got a copy of <em>World</em>, either via a console bundle or buying a physical copy of the game.

            <p>Microsoft have done a U-turn and decided they don't fancy making a series that at least tries to satirise capitalism the face of a price hike. In the US, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> will no longer cost $79.99, but the low, low sum of $69.99 instead.</p>
<p>For UK folks, that means a tenner's been knocked off what you'll pay to pre order the standard version of the RPG, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gets-a-release-date">comes out on October 29th</a>. Xbox and co will be doing the same with their other holiday period games this year, rather than pushing up how much folks are paying to £70/$80.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yep, <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/the-outer-worlds-2-price-change">this about face</a> has seen The Outer Worlds 2's pre order price <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449110/The_Outer_Worlds_2/">on Steam</a> knocked down from £69.99 to £59.99, the same price as fellow Obsidian role-playing thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>. The premium edition'll still cost you £89.99, though.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers">IGN</a> reports folks who've already pre-ordered the game for the higher price will be able to claim refunds from whichever storefront or location they bought it from, and Xbox says these might take a few days to come through.</p> <div>

<p>In their continued efforts to make me feel mildly embarrassed about having liked the first Outer Worlds and being at least curious to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-11-thoroughly-whelming-minutes-of-the-outer-worlds-2">give the sequel a go</a>, Microsoft announced this price change with not one but two meme posts to the series' official Musk platform account.</p>
<p>"We have received your SOS via skip drone about the pricing," read the first one. "As an organisation devoted to making sure that corporations do not go unfettered, we at the Earth Directorate have worked with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redacted">[REDACTED]</a> to revise the price of The Outer Worlds 2. While this will not bring peace to the galaxy, or even your local colony, we assure you all that we are here to fight for all colonies in every way that we can."</p>
<p>Ok, bit cringe maybe, but I can deal with it and...oh no. They almost immediately posted a <a href="https://x.com/OuterWorlds/status/1948025734888599847">second highly-edited corporate meme clip</a> of someone punching a Spacers' Choice moon mascot with the price plastered over its face. Look, I get that the devs probably weren't fans of the price increase either, given it might well have meant fewer folks buying their game, but maybe don't try to play this off as some grand victory. It's some execs going 'harrummph' and putting their tails between their legs for now.</p>
<p>Some execs, I have to point out, who oversaw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a> earlier this month.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-u-turn-on-charging-80-for-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-xbox-games-cue-memes-and-pre-order-refunds]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows may come to more platforms beyond PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft is backtracking on a shift to charging $80 for their games, with Obsidian confirming that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> will now be priced at $70 – alright,&nbsp;<em>fine,</em> it’s technically $69.99 – when it launches this October.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/obsidian.net/post/3lun6okl2us2q">Obsidian got to make the announcement</a> in suitably silly fashion, given the franchise:</p>


<p>We have received your SOS via skip drone about the pricing. As an organization devoted to making sure that corporations do not go unfettered, we at the Earth Directorate have worked with [REDACTED] to revise the price of The Outer Worlds 2.</p>
<p>While this will not bring peace to the galaxy, or even your local colony, we assure you all that we are here to fight for all colonies in every way that we can.</p>
<p>From the Office of the Director of the Earth Directorate</p>

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-concedes-that-the-outer-worlds-2-retail-price-was-too-high">Windows Central</a>, an Xbox spokesperson said, “We’re focused on bringing players incredible worlds to explore, and will keep our full priced holiday releases, including The Outer Worlds 2, at $69.99 – in line with current market conditions.”</p>
<p>Refunds for pre-orders will have to be requested manually, depending on the retailer, and the new pricing is rolling out today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Those market conditions were probably everybody telling them that $80 for a new game sucks, both in the form of comments across social media and forums, and most likely in the form of the number of pre-orders that Microsoft were seeing. While The Outer Worlds 2 will launch on Game Pass for Xbox and PC, which naturally affects the number of people paying full price on console in particular, the higher price would be felt when looking at pre-orders across Steam and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Of course, this is bigger than just The Outer Worlds 2, and it was expected that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> would follow suit this year, before Fable, Gears of War E-Day and other major launches in 2026. Black Ops 7 pre-orders aren’t live yet, but if The Outer Worlds 2’s pre-orders were bad enough, there would have been some execs and accountants with a case of the nervous bouncy leg, especially when they already sacrificed a huge amount of day one revenue last year by putting Black Ops 6 on Game Pass.</p>
<p>We’ll have to wait and see if Microsoft is just delaying the price bump until January, or if they hold off a while longer.</p>
