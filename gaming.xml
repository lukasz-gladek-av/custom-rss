			<p>A new stunning demo of the Zelda: Ocarina of Time fanmade remake powered by Unreal Engine 5 in development by <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-ocarina-of-time-unreal-engine-5-5-remake-download/">CryZENx</a> is now available for download, allowing fans of the game to experience a small portion of the classic game like they never did before.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the first 3D entry in the series and is considered, still to this day, as one of the best entries in the series. As such, there's high demand for a modern remake of the game, but Nintendo seems more focused on working on new entries in the series rather than remaking older 3D games that would require way more work than the remasters released so far. Still, the remake released on Nintendo 3DS is a solid upgrade to the game, so it is definitely a game that's worth playing to experience a slightly modernized take on the classic N64 game.</p>

That’s part of the reason why every show from <em>The Sopranos </em>and <em>Lost </em>(in the PS2 era) to<em> M*A*S*H </em>(way back on the Atari 2600) have been turned into (mostly pretty lousy) video games. (Of course, it also helps that studios want to milk successful IPs for all they’re worth). <em>The Last of Us </em>is that rare example of a property that is finding great success in both forms: the original games are widely beloved and have millions of fans around the world, and the HBO series is only pulling even more people into the fold. Given the success of the video game adaptation of <em>The Last Of Us </em>(and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-trailer-dina-ellie-dance-1851768672&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-trailer-dina-ellie-dance-1851768672">the impending arrival of its second season</a></span>)<em>, </em>we decided to flip the script and take a deeper look at the TV shows we wish we could play as video games. </p></div><div><p>Over the last 14 years, whenever we hear that an AI chatbot influenced a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/30/tech/teen-suicide-character-ai-lawsuit/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/30/tech/teen-suicide-character-ai-lawsuit/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">child to commit suicide</a></span>, or a reality TV star becomes President of the United States, or a global pandemic breaks out, at some point many of us think, <em>“</em>Man, this feels like a <em>Black Mirror</em> episode.” The dystopian anthology series has complicated the human experience by placing people in deadly moral quandaries with a level of creativity that would be a thrill to explore further in a video game. There have been episodes in which people are dog-like robotic killers (“Metalhead”), a museum of unethical technological experiments like a brain implant allowing a doctor to feel his patient’s pain is explored (“Black Museum), and the British Prime Minister is blackmailed into having sex with a pig on national television (“The National Anthem”). They’ve also already ventured into the dark world of video games in an episode in which two friends fall in love in a <em>Mortal Kombat</em>-esque VR game (“Striking Vipers”) and one in which a guy tests an augmented reality game implanted in his head where he experiences his worst nightmares (“Playtest”).</p><p>This show would make an excellent video game in which a character is banished to a purgatorial void for some moral infraction, and they can only escape by going through a series of mirrors that are portals into wild scenarios that test their willingness to live. </p></div><div><p>Espionage has been the basis of some of the greatest video game franchises ever, like <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, <em>Splinter Cell</em>, and <em>Watch Dogs</em>. The cutscene dialogue is usually rich with dramatic doublespeak and societal commentary that excites the inner conspiracy theorist in us. Few shows over the last 25 years have all that and the benefit of two dynamic leads, but <em>The Americans </em>does. The show is centered around two Russian spies posing as a suburban American family in the early 1980s, leaking intel back to their motherland. They and their network of spies have to intercept valuable assets in broad daylight through choreographed distractions, infiltrate a U.S. military project to steal defense communication codes, and bug the FBI office by placing a listening device in a mail robot. </p><p>Even when the series ended, there were  nuances of the show that fans wanted to delve back into, which a video game could help with. Since the show is more about stealth than murder (though there’s a fair amount of that too), it could be a great two-player game in which you and a partner extract intel to send back to Mother Russia, but it presents you both with different paths you must choose from that could ultimately lead you two to hate each other. The world will never get enough of spy games.</p></div><div><p>If guns, drugs, and the occasional wrestler-turned-gangster are what you are into, <em>Snowfall </em>is your show. The final piece of art the late John Singleton gave us is a gripping drama about a young man named Franklin Saint (Damson Idris) who starts selling drugs to get him and his mother out of the ‘hood. That is, until it turns into an empire and he becomes a power addict who destroys everything he loves. Watching Franklin devolve into a prisoner of his power by killing one of his best friends to prevent a gang war and then killing the father of the love of his life to prevent being arrested is truly heartbreaking. There’s also enough drive-by shootings, cocaine smuggling, and sex to make this a great <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>-style<em>&nbsp;</em>video game in which you can either play as Franklin or one of the numerous members of his empire to see where this gangster life will lead you.</p></div><div><p>The show that took <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sterling-k-brown-paradise-season-finale-hulu-season-2-1851767682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sterling-k-brown-paradise-season-finale-hulu-season-2-1851767682">Sterling K. Brown’s badass levels</a></span> up to 100 has scenes  that I wanted to leap into my TV screen to participate in. Certain members of the U.S. government and private sector build a city inside of a Colorado mountain to escape an extinction-level event they knew was coming. The first season’s penultimate episode is already being hailed as the best TV episode of 2025 so far and contains a tense scene in which the President of the United States needs armed guards to make it out of the White House after he told America that the world is ending, and the government knew about it. In a video game, you could play as Secret Service agent Xavier Collins (Brown) and be tasked with getting the president through a mob of angry government officials without him being shot or assaulted.  Ratcheting up the stakes further, you also have to make sure you don’t lose the “nuclear football,” the briefcase device that allows the president to launch nuclear attacks. That’s just one of the exhilarating and video-game-ready scenarios from a show that has  survivors being killed by mercenaries, the sky itself getting hacked to flash messages, and some of the most emotional scriptwriting of any show this year.</p></div><div><p>Yes, we’re getting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-gameplay-showcase-survival-mmo-1851630351&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-gameplay-showcase-survival-mmo-1851630351"><em>Dune: Awakening</em></a></span> game later this year, but that game won’t be focused on the strongest group of people in the <em>Dune </em>universe: The Bene Gesserit<em>. </em>The sensational HBO series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-finale-recap-desmond-hart-valya-harkonnen-1851727517&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-finale-recap-desmond-hart-valya-harkonnen-1851727517"><em>Dune: Prophecy</em></a></span><em> </em>is mostly told from the perspective of this ancient sisterhood that acts as confidants and advisors to royal families while surreptitiously influencing powerful people in a way that keeps their secretive group close to power. We’ve seen them tap their fingers and peer into someone’s soul to see if they’re lying and use a powerful voice technique that can make almost anyone who hears it do what they say. The only person proven capable of withstanding the Voice is a man who was swallowed by a sandworm, operated on by thinking machines, and had devices implanted in his eyeballs that allow him to infect people with an airborne virus that burns them alive. </p><p>This would be the perfect basis for a game in which you choose your member of the Bene Gesserit, each with their unique skillset, and have to make nuanced interpersonal decisions with the intent of finding the messiah. Imagine using your voice to make the prince of the Atreides family marry the princess of the Harkonnen family simply because of their family names, and seeing it result in one of them killing the other because you didn’t spend enough time with them to know that their families have had a secret war going on for generations. This game would be like <em>The Sims </em>in space but with a lot more murder.</p></div><div><p>It’s a bit baffling that Amazon’s violent spin on superheroes isn’t on its third PlayStation game by now. <em>The Boys</em> is a fever dream of a series in which a ragtag anti-superhero militia known as the Boys works to stop the reign of the superhero consortium The Seven. The central appeal of the show is that, even while it’s focused on genetically modified super freaks who can do things no ordinary human being can do, it’s also grounded in human imperfections like jealousy, carnal temptations, and greed. It doesn’t let that humanity get in the way of over-the-top action, though. We’ve seen a protestor get his head lasered off, a man’s body ripped apart by a miniature person who crawled inside of him and then expanded, and a superhero orgy too graphic to even try to describe. With superhero video games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-game-director-layoffs-season-2-1851765290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-game-director-layoffs-season-2-1851765290"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>popping up every two seconds and making a gazillion dollars, there’s no reason a similar type of game can’t be made within <em>The Boys</em> universe.</p></div><div><p>This should’ve happened a long time ago. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-the-batman-part-ii-questions-connections-1851693100&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-the-batman-part-ii-questions-connections-1851693100"><em>The Penguin</em></a></span> was one of the best TV shows of 2024 and a true testament to the wealth of possibilities contained within the <em>Batman</em> universe. Set after the events of Matt Reeves’ <em>The Batman</em> film, <em>The Penguin</em> focuses on how people like “Oz” Cobb (Colin Farrell) and Sofia Falcone (Cristin Milioti) try to fill the power gap in Gotham’s underworld left by the death of Carmine Falcone. The show’s titular character is the main star of the action, and we get to see how he’s as strategic as he is ruthless, willing to kill his closest partner so his enemies can’t exploit his love as a weakness. Thus far, whenever video games have let us travel through the seedy underbelly of Gotham it’s been as the Caped Crusader dishing out bone-breaking justice, but it would be just as fun to do so as the nefarious Penguin, trying to take out the crime families standing in his way as he’s determined to be somebody in this world. </p></div><div><p>When I realized the first season of <em>Creature Commandos </em>was done after only seven episodes that were under 30 minutes each, I was legitimately upset. You don’t want to leave a world in which a black ops team composed of non-human inmates from Belle Reve Penitentiary is assembled in an attempt to protect Princess Ilana Rostovic (Maria Bakalova), the rightful heir to the throne of Pokolistan. This ragtag team of misfits includes a radioactive walking skeleton, an undead Bride of Frankenstein, and a Nazi-hating killer robot, and that’s just the start. They’ve torn someone’s head off by punching through their headrest, had their limbs magically turned into balloon animals mid-fight, and had a rabid weasel tear through someone’s flesh. How could we not have fun running through the world with these agents of mayhem in a video game, violently ending more lives than we save?</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We never thought it would return. But get ready, because Verdansk is coming to Warzone 2. Long-time fans are worried it won’t feature Superstore or other famous POIs, so we’re here today to answer any questions regarding its hotspots.</p>



<p>Call of Duty Warzone 2 is the successor to Warzone Caldera. It’s kept the CoD battle royale boat afloat for a couple of years now, but it’s taken some damage in recent times. Some have even labeled it as a sinking ship. Warzone’s lessening impact is getting so concerning that a potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone 3 is in danger</a>, as is the potential future of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-warzone-being-shut-down-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone shutting down</a> altogether.</p>



<p>Warzone was once arguably the battle royale powerhouse of the world. It needs a serious injection of players to kickstart the excitement again, and a fully-loaded Verdansk armed with classic POIs could be what it needs.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-confirmed-verdansk-poi-in-warzone-2">Every Confirmed Verdansk POI in Warzone 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It stores goods and campers. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Warzone 2’s Verdansk map will feature most POIs from the original including Atlas Superstore, Storage Town, Prison, and many more.</strong></p>



<p>We learned a little while back we’re getting “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pretty Much the OG March 2020 Version</a>” of Verdansk. I couldn’t imagine Activision dropping a version of Verdansk no one wants, or even Verdansk ’84. So, get ready for what appears to be the complete, classic Verdansk experience.</p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/WZStatsGG/status/1895902878293692854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warzone Meta</a>, here’s every POI leaked so far, with more presumably to come:</p>



<ul>
<li>Atlas Superstore</li>



<li>Block 17</li>



<li>Block 23</li>



<li>Boneyard</li>



<li>Coast</li>



<li>Gora Bridge</li>



<li>Gora Tunnel</li>



<li>Gora Village</li>



<li>Grazna Bridge</li>



<li>Great Bridge</li>



<li>Jarvdinsk Spomenik</li>



<li>Karst Bridge</li>



<li>Krovnik Farmland</li>



<li>Lozoff Pass</li>



<li>Novi Grazna Hills</li>



<li>Prison</li>



<li>Storage Town</li>



<li>Styor Memorial</li>



<li>Zhokov Boneyard</li>
</ul>



<p>Some notable favorites are missing for the time being. Dam is absent, as is Airport and many others, but Verdansk is gigantic, so this is likely an incomplete inventory. We expect more details to leak ahead of its much-hyped return to Call of Duty and Warzone.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-verdansk-returning-to-warzone">When is Verdansk Returning to Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>Verdansk returns to Call of Duty courtesy of Warzone 2 Season 3 on April 3.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-officially-returning-to-call-of-duty-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk is returning to Call of Duty Warzone next month</a>. The official Call of Duty X account had a message for everyone on March 10: “As we celebrate Call of Duty: Warzone’s 5 Year Anniversary, it’s time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories. Verdansk returns to Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>As we celebrate Call of Duty: Warzone’s 5 Year Anniversary, it’s time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories 🪂

Verdansk returns to Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3 💥 </span></p></article></div>



<p>Whatever your thoughts on Verdansk or how it will be received, this is no doubt a special time for CoD Warzone users. Expect a huge influx of players looking to lap up the initial nostalgia.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-people-are-playing-warzone-right-now-player-count-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Warzone player count</a> drops off as the days and weeks pass.</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege X’s changes to UI, map reworks, and new skins have appeared online due to a new leak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-leak-first-look-seasons-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, new details about Rainbow Six Seige X have leaked ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcase planned for March 13</a>. The leaks arrived from the Rainbow Six Leaks Discord server, giving players an idea of how the upcoming game could look. Moreover, these leaked images appear to be from an early game build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding UI, Siege X has added a new label for ‘Operation Prep Phase’ at the right-hand corner of the screen. Players will also find additions of a ‘battle pass progression tracker’ and a ‘challenge system’. Players should know that all these elements are subject to change with the game’s final build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following leaked image for Siege X provides players with a look at the type of skins we might see. The skin showcased is Valkyrie’s Paragon Elite skin, which also has a matching Black Eye camera skin. Lastly, Chalet and Border Maps appear revamped, and the leaked images show enhancements towards the lighting in these environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that none of the information revealed through the leaks has been confirmed officially by Ubisoft and is subject to change with the final game build. Players will receive more concrete information during the dedicated Siege X showcase on March 13.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Siege X might feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-will-feature-a-6v6-mode-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 6v6 mode</a>. Also, Rainbow Six Siege remains <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-rainbow-six-siege-top-esports-game-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a top esports title</a> after being in the market for a decade. What are your thoughts on Siege X leaked skins, UI and other elements?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

Playdead, the developer behind indie darlings <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/limbo">Limbo</a> and Inside, has responded amidst an increasingly ugly spat between the company's co-founders.
</p>
<p>
Reports of a rift between Playdead's Dino Patti and Arnt Jensen are nothing new, and first circulated around the time Patti left Playdead following the launch of Inside in 2016. 
</p>
<p>
This month, however, the friction between the two men has become public - following a claim by Patti that he was the subject of "bullying", and that Jensen had "repeatedly" sent legal threats to him since his departure from the company. 
</p>
<p>
The latest of these legal claims, Patti says, involves a now-deleted LinkedIn post in which he discussed Limbo's development and shared a photo of an "unauthorised" photo taken by Jensen. Patti says he has now been asked to cough up the equivalent of £56k in compensation.
</p>
<p>
In response to Patti's claim being made public, Playdead has issued a statement confirming it has "submitted demands" based on a claim of "infringement and unauthorised use of Playdead's trademarks and copyrighted works in a commercial and marketing context" (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdead-co-founder-dino-patti-claims-fellow-co-founder-keeps-legally-threatening-him">Game Developer</a>).
</p>
<p>
"We have found it necessary to take this action to protect our trademarks and copyrights," the company said, "which are essential to Playdead's business and reputation".
</p>
<p>
In a legal document shared by Patti, Playdead wrote that "by providing recipients with core insights to the process of developing Limbo, you are falsely giving the impression that you played a significant role, including a creative role, in the development of the game".
</p>
<p>
Sharing the document online, Patti said he was a "significant part of building Playdead from the ground up" and that without him, "Playdead wouldn't have existed". 
</p>
<p>
"Arnt, please stop the bullying," Patti concluded. "I will not stop being who I am. I will never erase my own history. You can't rewrite the past just because of a bad breakup." 
</p>
<p>
Playdead is currently working on its third game, which it began teasing in 2017. In 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-announces-publishing-deal-with-control-inside-and-the-last-guardian-devs">Epic Games confirmed it would handle publishing duties on the game</a>.
</p>
<p>
Patti launched Somerville, his first game at new studio Jumpship, in 2022. An adventure platform game with physics-based puzzles, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/somerville-review-a-tasteful-apocalypse-with-a-little-light-puzzling">received decent reviews, amidst comparisons to Playdead's work</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-is-working-on-ai-powered-versions-of-their-characters-parts-of-the-technology-can-run-on-playstation-5-with-little-overhead.1130862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-ai-characters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony is working on AI-powered versions of PlayStation characters that can respond to voice input from the player during gameplay, a new leaked video revealed.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> by an anonymous tipster before it got taken down on YouTube, shows an AI-powered version of the Horizon series protagonist Aloy that can respond to queries using synthesized voice and facial movements both in a demo setting and during Horizon Forbidden West gameplay, as highlighted by SIE director of software engineering Sharwin Raghoebardajal who demonstrated the technology in the removed video. The technology, powered by OpenAI’s whisper for speech-to-text and both GPT-4 and Llama 3 for conversations, is augmented by Sony's internal Emotional Voice Synthesis system and by Mockingbird technology that handles audio-to-face animation.</p>
<p>While this AI-powered version of Aloy was developed to show the technology internally, there's a very good chance that we will eventually see it implemented even on consoles, as parts of the technology can run directly on PlayStation 5 with little overhead. This glimpse of what the technology is capable of achieving doesn't exactly provide hints at how it could be implemented to enhance gaming experiences, but there's little doubt that it will impact future games considerably, considering the direction the industry is taking and how the PlayStation 6, in particular, is said will go <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-most-powerful-generation-amd/">all-out on AI.</a></p>
<p>Sony isn't the only major console manufacturer investing heavily in AI. Last week, Microsoft unveiled its&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xboxs-muse-ai-model-is-a-one-of-a-kind-model-that-can-generate-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muse AI model</a> capable of generating gameplay. This&nbsp;should help developers, especially in the early stages of development, although the contrary is more likely, given the current state of the industry.</p>

It’s positively massive, and you cannot man the entire vessel solo: even as the coolest yakuza in Hawaii you require a crew. In <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, your ship crew is split into two groups: Cannon Squad and Boarding Squad.</p><p>Your Cannon Squad is relatively self-explanatory. It’s the crew working the various cannons and weapons on your ship. However, the Boarding Squad is where running a pirate crew becomes slightly more complex. You see, it’s not a single squad: you have four. Each Boarding Squad consists of four members and a Squad Leader. As a Squad Leader, the assigned crew member has access to a unique ability that enhances their skills and, occasionally, yours.</p><h2 id="h2549276"><a id=""></a><strong>The best Boarding Squad Leader Traits in Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-recommend-id="image://0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The mini-boss fight against Jason Rich in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The mini-boss fight against Jason Rich in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-recommend-id="image://0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The mini-boss fight against Jason Rich in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a touch of strategy to the over-the-top beat ‘em up <em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, especially regarding your pirate crew. When assigning Squad Leaders to your Boarding Squad, picking wisely from the roster means the difference between overtaking the competition and succumbing to Davy Jones’ Locker.</p><h3 id="h2549277"><a id=""></a><strong>Nishida: Indomitable Will Bonded</strong></h3><p>You’ll meet Nishida on Nele Island relatively early in the campaign, where he’s actively searching for Majima. Well, he finds the man. As it turns out, Nishida is one of the best healers in the game, thanks to his ability, Indomitable Will. It’s a Squad Leader trait that boosts healing, plus includes Shock Resistance. You’ll deal with Shock frequently during combat, making Nishida a staple for any pirate crew!</p><h3 id="h2549278"><a id=""></a><strong>Misaki: Succession of Will Bonded</strong></h3><p>Misaki, the daughter of Namioka, will join your pirate crew deeper into the game and, as expected, provides a nice buff to your Boarding Squad when assigned as a Squad Leader. Her ability, Succession of Will, boosts Attack Damage and increases the charge rate of the Voltage Gauge, which allows your support units to utilize powerful abilities mid-combat.</p><h3 id="h2549279"><a id=""></a><strong>Masaru Fujita: Marine Cuisine Bonded</strong></h3><p>The first crewmember you’ll recruit in <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, Masaru Fujita, is another of the most powerful to assign to your Boarding Squad. His ability, Marine Cuisine, boosts attack power for everyone in his squad and increases Poison Resistance. Now, you won’t deal with Poison frequently, but when you do, it’s a painful, annoying experience that will make you beg for higher resistance!</p><h3 id="h2549280"><a id=""></a><strong>Jason Rich: Hunter’s Knowledge Bonded</strong></h3><p>As one of the first crewmates you’ll unlock, alongside Masaru Fujita, Jason Rich also offers one of the strongest Squad Leader Traits in the game. As you level Jason and his abilities become more powerful, you’ll note that his Squad Leader Trait, Hunter’s Knowledge, is genuinely one of the best in the game. It provides a significant buff to attack and defense, while also boosting firearms resistance to the entire squad.</p><hr><p><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em> is easily one of the wildest experiences on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025 so far, so long as you don’t mind the lengthy story and side content!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-30th-anniversary-projects/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Square Enix is planning to celebrate Chrono Trigger's 30th anniversary with various projects, according to a new post shared on social media today.</p>
<p>On the publisher's official Japanese <a href="https://x.com/squareenix_jp/status/1899298993613791338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1899298993613791338%7Ctwgr%5E28ba345c8804a38a6acfe4646e646ed32e8e603c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fsquare-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> profile, Square Enix highlighted how today, March 11th, marks the 30th anniversary of the release of Chrono Trigger, a dream project that brought together the creator of the Final Fantasy series Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of the Dragon Quest series Yuji Horii and the creator of Dragon Ball Akira Toriyama. To celebrate the game's 30th anniversary, the Japanese publisher is planning to launch various projects this year that will go beyond the world of the game to thank all those who have played the game.</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger is among the few 16-bit-era JRPGs released by Square Enix that have yet to be properly remade. While the game was released with additional content on the Nintendo DS, which is also available in the Steam release, it was never effectively remade. Hopefully, in light of the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-has-already-sold-2-million-copies/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D remake</a> released last year, the Japanese publisher will consider at least an HD-2D remake of Chrono Trigger to introduce what is, in my opinion, one of the best JRPGs ever released, if not the very best, to a wider audience.</p>
<p>As of now, the only way to play Chrono Trigger on modern gaming hardware is on PC with the aforementioned Steam release. The game launched in a rather poor state back in 2018 but has since been improved with <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-update-3/">new features and enhancements</a>, making this version one of the best ways to enjoy the classic game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-officially-extraction-shooter-evolving/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare-is-officially-an-extraction-shooter-and-it%E2%80%99s-evolving-in-2025.1130835/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-officially-extraction-shooter-evolving/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When Gray Zone Warfare was released in April 2024, it was penned as being ‘an intense tactical FPS’ with some extraction elements mixed in. In the months that followed, changes were deployed, and updates were rolled out, evolving the game immeasurably in its first year on the market.</p>



<p>I’ve caught up with the developers at MADFINGER Games on multiple occasions, and during my most recent chat with the team, I learned that they’re now perfectly happy to call Gray Zone Warfare an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>But it’s more than that – it’s the <strong>world’s first open-world extraction shooter</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-evolutionary-year">An Evolutionary Year</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare has <strong>stacks </strong>planned for the year ahead. The developers have worked tirelessly with the community to introduce a long line of changes and upgrades to improve the senses of immersion, challenge, and engagement in the fictional world of Lamang.</p>



<p>It might have blown by the average fan, but Gray Zone Warfare’s core description on Steam was updated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-whats-next/">at the end of 2024</a> to reflect the new attitude towards the game. It went from being described as an intense tactical FPS to being dubbed an open-world extraction shooter emphasising realism.</p>



<p>That was the first indication of MADFINGER’s pivot, but my recent chat with Rick Lagnese, the PR and Communications Director at the firm, set the story straight. The developer is now on board with being branded an extraction shooter, and it’s now striving to redefine what that tag means.</p>



<p>That’s something that I learned first-hand <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when I spoke to Marek Rabas</a>, MADFINGER’s CEO, at Gamescom 2024. </p>



<p>In recent years, we’ve seen plenty of extraction shooters emerge and then fall flat. Some have been extinguished after mere weeks on the market, but Gray Zone Warfare has continued to innovate and exceed expectations after almost a year. There’s a dedicated community supporting the ongoing evolution of the game, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-roadmap-revealed/">the roadmap</a> is looking <strong>tasty</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’ve not played Gray Zone Warfare and you’re a fan of extraction shooters, now is the time to get on board. There are major changes lined up that are set to challenge the existing paradigm and alter the gameplay loop.</p>



<p>I’ll have all the latest for you in the coming days.</p>

We all know what's coming up in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last of Us</a> season 2, right? I mean, everyone knows what happens quite early on in the game, because it was a pretty controversial narrative choice so everyone and their mum has spoiled it. I haven't played it myself and I know what happens, but it seems like streaming service Max is happy to pretend that everything is peaches and cream (more or less) in their adaptation.
</p>
<p>
A new trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a> season 2 dropped over the weekend that is full of drama and light on spoilers, which is why I'm staying quiet too, but it has been funny watching all of these trailers knowing that they're lying just a little bit.

<p>
For the most part, season 2 look like more of the same; it's dark, it's depressing, everyone's angry all the time, and, yes, there are still not-quite-zombies to be worried about. It's not too long until you can watch the show, as it's set to premiere on Max this coming April 13th, with a weekly release every Sunday for a total of seven episodes. UK viewers will be able to check out the first episode the day after, April 14th, where it'll be shown on Sky and its streaming service NOW.
</p>
<p>
April will be a big month for The Last of Us: Part Two in general, as the remastered version of the sequel is also set to arrive on PC April 3rd. Originally the PC release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-will-require-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-making-it-unplayable-in-over-100-countries">would have required you to sign in with a PSN account</a>, despite that causing so many issues with previous PlayStation releases on PC. PlayStation has since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">dropped that requirement</a> for The Last of Us: Part Two, alongside a few other games, so that at least knocks off one reason for the review bombs. Here's hoping it also avoids <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-last-of-us-part-1s-pc-port-is-being-ripped-apart-by-steam-reviewers">the bugs and performances issues that plagued the PC release of Part One</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-finals-current-player-count%E2%80%94how-many-people-are-playing-the-finals-in-2025.1130817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-current-player-count/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Finals burst onto the scene with its unique blend of map destruction, arcade-like gameplay, and blaring sounds and visuals, but let’s look at The Finals’ player count in 2025.</p>



<p>It’s so hard for new shooters in the live-service online multiplayer sphere to stand out. Call of Duty rules the roost, and the likes of Marvel Rivals, Fortnite, and Overwatch own large market share segments. So it was quite the feat for The Finals when it arrived in 2023 to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge acclaim and hefty player numbers</a>. This was despite reservations and emerging details of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-use-of-ai-isnt-going-away-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI use in The Finals</a>.</p>



<p>The first few weeks of a hyped multiplayer title are usually the best. Everyone checks in to see what it’s about, how it plays, and numbers eventually dwindle. So we’re here to analyze The Finals’ player count numbers to see how it’s faring.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-finals-player-count-in-2025">The Finals Player Count in 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a scene. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Using Steam Charts, we can see February 2025 had an average of 11,760 players in The Finals—reaching a peak of 19,499 users.</strong></p>



<p>The first thing to note about The Finals player count numbers is <strong>this doesn’t factor in PlayStation or Xbox users</strong>. There’s no reliable piece of software capable of telling us this data, and it’s been this way for years. It’s baffling—given this age of technology—but this is the reality.</p>



<p>Any official figures come from <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/2073850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Finals’ Steam Charts page</a>, and this has the game’s monthly figures going back to its December 2023 launch. The Finals achieved its <strong>all-time peak of 242,399 players</strong> during its debut month. Compared to its most recent month (as of writing), its <strong>recent monthly peaks are nearly 90% down since launch</strong>.</p>



<p>It took just two months for The Finals player count numbers to see a huge drop-off. From December 2023 to February 2024, the shooter went from <strong>120,211 players on averag</strong>e to <strong>24,848</strong>. </p>



<p>March 2024 saw an average of <strong>21,712</strong> in-game users, and the monthly average has <strong>never gotten back over 20K</strong>.</p>



<p>This makes it all sound negative, but for a relatively new shooter in a feisty market, it’s doing well. The last few months have seen a <strong>peak</strong> of nearly 20,00 players or more, and it continues to tick along. Remember, this doesn’t include PlayStation or Xbox figures, meaning there’s still a fair few thousands logging in each month.</p>



<p>The start of 2025 has been slightly worrying though. <strong>The Finals has dipped below 12K</strong>, and continues to dwindle month by month. With more seasons and content on the way, these figures should receive a new boost every so often.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-finals-worth-playing-in-2025">Is The Finals Worth Playing in 2025?</h2>



<p><strong>The Finals’ gameplay and nuances make it worth playing in 2025, but it could depend on Battlefield 6’s success.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a> showed no matter how tight your game is, if there’s not enough content, players don’t like it, or other games are doing it better, people won’t play. I think The Finals has a terrific niche in its <strong>level destructibility</strong>—a unique selling point mastered only by the Battlefield series.</p>



<p>EA’s Battlefield has been absent and fairly anonymous for several years, due to the failings of Battlefield 2042. But Battlefield 6 AKA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2025</a> is currently testing the waters with its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-first-playtest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> program. Pre-release footage has already shown destruction is the name of the game, and EA and DICE want their crown back.</p>



<p>The Finals is free-to-play, which always makes it a great bargain. However, with more games coming out, and Battlefield on the way, Embark might have to do something special if The Finals’ player count monthly numbers continue to diminish, and Battlefield 6 makes a huge splash. </p>



<p><strong>I recommend playing The Finals while you can, because it might not be around forever given today’s toxic and volatile climate.</strong></p>



<hr>



<p>We have the 2025 player count figures for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-people-are-playing-warzone-right-now-player-count-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Warzone</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-player-count-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite’s numbers</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-player-count-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> players this year too.</p>



<p>I’ve been quite surprised by The Finals’ success and longevity so far. Do you think it has the potential to reach the next level? Or is it solid enough to maintain The Finals player count enough to help it stay in a crowded online scene? Drop a comment and share your thoughts.</p>

<p>At the end of the first season, we all saw disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean in his pinched Brotherhood of Steel Power Armour, fleeing towards the post-apocalyptic locale.</p>
<p>Soon after this episode aired, showrunners Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-showrunners-discuss-season-two-location-and-why-the-series-doesnt-need-to-follow-a-canon-ending">confirmed the next season will head to New Vegas</a>, and said its now-ruined state was designed to show the audience that "things have happened" to the location since the events of New Vegas the game. The duo then added <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-showrunners-confirm-new-vegas-character-involved-with-season-two">New Vegas' enigmatic leader Mr House will be "involved in season two"</a>, although they held back from telling us any more. Oh, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-fallout-set-photo-teases-a-familiar-new-vegas-face-of-jurassic-proportions">Dinky will be around for season two, as well</a>.</p>
<p>Now, we have a pretty decent look at the Fallout show's take on New Vegas, thanks to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@onzo1313/video/7479259030754495787">TikTok user Onzo1313</a>. Onzo1313 has shared several videos showing off the set, including the iconic strip along with - of course - a Lucky 38 casino sign. Lucky 38 is Mr House's citadel from which he reigns over the New Vegas Strip and its various casinos.</p>
<p>One particular video showing off the strip is shaky, but the location itself seems to be in relatively good condition, leading to some speculation this area will feature as part of a flashback sequence.</p>

</span></p><p>Another video, meanwhile, offers a look at New Vegas boards that are showing signs of age and rust, clearly from the 'present'.</p>
<p>There is also a sign for Micheal Angelo's shown off in this video. Michael Angelo's workshop is a location in New Vegas, which is found on the strip.</p>

</span></p><p>Earlier this year, Fallout's Ghoul Walton Goggins provided us all with a little update on the upcoming season, promising that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says">while season one was certainly good, the next one is going to be even better</a>.</p>
<p>"This blows it out of the water, what these writers have done and the artisans that have come together to tell this story," the actor said in February. "It's really gonna be something. I can't wait for people to see it."</p>
<p>New cast members reported to be joining Goggins for Fallout season two include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-reportedly-adds-marvel-actor-kumail-nanjiani-to-its-cast">Kumail Nanjiani as "a high-ranking official within the Brotherhood of Steel"</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-series-second-season-lands-home-alone-star">Macaulay Culkin as "a crazy genius-type character"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Turtle Beach Stealth 500 is one of our favourite sub-£100 headsets, earning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/19/turtle-beach-stealth-500-gaming-headset-review/">8/10 in our review</a> last year. Praising its looks and comfort, we said, ” The first thing you’ll notice about the new Stealth 500 is how sleek and modern it looks, fashioned wholly out of black materials, it is almost as stealthy as its name implies. The build is mostly plastic, with a rigid plastic headband, but it has the added benefit of making this one very light headset. I’ve worn this thing for whole days and never had a moment of weariness, and that’s a huge boon if you live with your headset on.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k25/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5</span>
						</p></div></div>			
			<p>The WWE 2K franchise has been in a rebuilding phase for the past few years, culminating in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year’s WWE 2K24</a>, which was one of the best pro grappling games 2K and developer Visual Concepts had delivered in years. But as most seasoned wrestling fans know, it’s one thing to prove you’re championship material; it’s another challenge altogether to stay at that elite level. That’s the test <a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k25-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WWE 2K25</a> now faces.</p>
<p>Does WWE 2K25 continue the series’ upward momentum? Or does it make some unfortunate high-risk moves? It’s time to lace ‘em up again and find out.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2520.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Over the past few years, the WWE 2K games have taken steps to refine their in-ring action, adding offensive maneuvers and new ways the change the momentum of matches beyond standard reversals, such as blocks, dodges, and “breakers.” In some respects, WWE 2K25 further polishes the between-the-ropes product – animations feel a bit smoother and some minor features, like being able to launch attacks from the ringside barriers, have been added. I’m also a fan of the new “Giant” fighting style, which grants those playing as one of the big boys (or girls) an extra bar of “armor.” Once the giant’s armor is worn down, they play more like a regular wrestler, and their limited invulnerability is balanced by them not being able to do certain more acrobatic moves. I wouldn’t mind seeing other WWE 2K wrestler archetypes updated to stand apart more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k259.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>That said, WWE 2K25’s action also regresses in some ways. Blocking has been removed from the game, and while it was never something I used that much, it’s always disappointing to have something removed from your toolbox. The Chain Wrestling minigame has also been brought back, which I’m somewhat ambivalent about. Sure, the mechanic works well enough, but it isn’t particularly engaging, as it forces you to keep your attention on minigame meters instead of what your wrestler is actually doing for a significant amount of time. Overall, I still enjoyed the action in WWE 2K25, but I was left with a lingering feeling the series is taking a turn back toward gimmicks instead of faster action and fighting-game-style versatility.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k2519.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>WWE 2K25’s two new match types are also largely duds. The Underground match is an odd addition, as the COVID-19 era “Raw Underground” experiment it’s based on isn’t particularly well-remembered by anyone. The match itself isn’t anything special, essentially just removing the ring ropes and darkening the arena for your standard hardcore match. There isn’t even a dedicated Underground arena (the unique presentation of Raw Underground was one of the few memorable things about it).</p>
<p>The new Bloodline Rules match sounds promising in theory but is pretty underwhelming in practice. Basically, players have the ability to call in up to three run-ins per match, which can be countered by your opponent with their own run-ins. These allies don’t just run in and disappear, they stick around and often start fighting each other, resulting in an increasingly disorderly schmozz. The end result is quite the opposite of the carefully orchestrated “cinematic” matches that Roman Reigns has made his trademark.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFwwe2k255.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On the plus side, while the new match types aren’t terribly inspired, almost every type of match in the game can now be played with any mix of men and women as intergender wrestling makes its return. Of course, intergender wrestling is a divisive topic -- I’m not always a great fan of it in real life, but I’m also all for letting people have their fun within the largely consequence-free world of video games, and it can be switched off in the options.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2521.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Visually, WWE 2K25 receives the standard minor glow-up the series gets every year. Lighting has been improved and the often Medusa-like hair physics of years past have finally been tamed. As usual, some Superstars look almost uncannily realistic, others not so much (even after Bayley herself directed some shade at last year’s game, she <em>still</em> doesn’t look quite right).</p>
<p>Moving beyond the core in-ring action, WWE 2K25 offers the usual array of ways to play and an all-new one – The Island. Similar to NBA 2K’s The City hub, The Island allows you to explore themed areas with other players, climb the rankings in online matches, make your way through a series of single-player “quests,” and, of course, spend money on cosmetics.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2522.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I won’t sugarcoat it: The Island is a drag. While it looks nice enough, with references to various WWE Superstars – a Kairi Sane Pirate Princess restaurant here, a very random Damage CTRL computer repair shop there – almost none of it is interactive in any meaningful way. The quests you can engage with are as basic as they get – find a WWE wrestler somewhere on The Island, get treated to a very underwhelming static, text-based “cutscene,” have a match, then go find another wrestler, read more inane text, and have another match. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>The stories laid out in The Island’s quests are purely Saturday morning cartoon fare. You’ll find yourself doing things like constructing special “video game armor” for Xavier Woods so he can do battle with his gaming alter-ego, who has somehow come to life, or going on a time-traveling escapade with Rey Mysterio thanks to a magical lucha mask. Maybe this stuff actually sounds kinda kooky and fun to you, but trust me, it’s all presented in the dullest way possible.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2523.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>And yes, of course, everything about The Island is tuned to maximize extra spending. In addition to the numerous in-game shops selling overpriced cosmetics (most things cost between 6,000 and 18,000 “VC,” meaning a single 32,500 VC pack costing $10 may only buy you two or three items) progressing your OVR is a slog, requiring <em>hours</em> of play to add a single point to your rating. Of course, when I tried to jump into some online matches mere minutes after The Island went live, I was almost exclusively matched up with guys with paid-for 100 OVRs. If you want to be competitive at all, you need to fork over for either an expensive special edition or VC packs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the effort Visual Concepts sunk into The Island seems to have had a knock-on effect on the rest of WWE 2K25, as the MyRise career mode is notably diminished this year. Rather than two individual stories for the men and women, they’re smushed into a single story, and instead of a more intricate system of missions and side missions, you simply get a main story and the ability to engage in filler “Live Event” matches.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2524.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The MyRise story, entitled “Mutiny,” is mostly nonsense. After your created character debuts in WWE, the very unlikely duo of Kevin Owens and Bayley stage a mutiny of NXT veterans, despite both of them having left the brand ages ago. The mutiny makes no sense, as 90 percent of WWE superstars from the past decade or more have come through NXT, so what, exactly, are they rebelling against? Today’s WWE star is the NXT star of a few years ago. The whole thing just feels random, with none of the alliances or characters making any sense if you watch WWE even casually. It's disappointing, because MyRise storytelling had really improved in recent years, with plots that actually played off WWE history and personalities in interesting ways, sometimes even cautiously challenging WWE narratives. That's nowhere to be found this year.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2525.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>It's not all bad news, though, as some modes do offer improvements. “The Bloodline’s Dynasty” 2K Showcase builds nicely on the positive upgrades the mode received last year, adding matches that let you change history and “dream” showdowns that never happened in the real world. This adds some much-needed variety to the Showcase experience, which sometimes felt like a bit of a grind in years past. New timed objectives during matches are somewhat less successful, but overall, this may be the best Showcase we’ve got to date.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2526.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>MyGM is largely the same as last year, and still suffers from not allowing you to pre-determine outcomes, but the addition of online play is unquestionably a big boost for those who do enjoy the mode. Universe mode offers the usual handful of annual updates, including the return of promos, and remains a solid, if dry, tool for fantasy bookers. The Ultimate-Team-style MyFaction mode also returns and continues to be an odd fit for a game with a roster of only a few hundred names to draw on. A new single-player mode and a few more match options for online play freshen things up a bit but don’t fundamentally change the MyFaction experience.</p>
<p>While WWE 2K games have always had their share of glitches, I encountered more than usual this year, and they weren’t just minor graphical bugs – full-on crashes on PS5 were fairly common. Some of these issues may have already been patched, but it’s hard to escape the feeling that WWE 2K25 is arriving in a messier state than its predecessor. Even with this lack of polish and some skippable modes, it still feels like WWE 2K25 offers a solid amount of content worth exploring. That said, if you opt to stick with a dependable veteran like WWE 2K24, you won’t be missing out on as much as in some past years.</p>

						<section>
				<p>WWE 2K25 doesn’t manage to build on the momentum created by the last few entries in the series. For every step forward, such as online MyGM or the varied Bloodline 2K Showcase, there’s a step back, like the lifeless MyRise career mode and some questionable changes to core gameplay. The biggest blemish is The Island hub, which excels at separating players from their money and not much else. There’s certainly still fun to be had with WWE 2K25, but the series risks dropping back to the midcard if it continues on this new trajectory.</p>

This suggests the video is legitimate. IGN has asked Sony for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the video, as reported by The Verge, Sony Interactive Entertainment director of software engineering, Sharwin Raghoebardajal, has a conversation with an AI-powered Aloy via voice prompts and AI-generated speech and facial animations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The speech recognition is via OpenAI’s Whisper for speech-to-text, the conversational AI via GPT-4 and Llama 3 for dialogue and decision-making, the speech synthesis via Sony’s Emotional Voice Synthesis (EVS) system, and the facial animation via Sony’s Mockingbird technology.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the tech demo, Raghoebardajal asks Aloy how she's doing, to which she responds: "Hello, I'm managing alright. Just dealing with a sore throat. How have you been?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The voice heard coming from Aloy's mouth is not that of voice actor Ashly Burch, who famously plays the character in the video games. Rather, it is a robotic voice similar to the kind you get from any of the thousands of text-to-speech voice generators used to narrate social media posts. AI Aloy's facial movements are stiff and her eyes appear lifeless as she converses with Raghoebardajal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked how Aloy's search for her mother is going, she replies: "I discovered I'm a clone of Dr. Elizabeth Sobeck, which led me to understand my purpose and origins."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How does it feel to be a clone? "Being a clone feels unique, connecting me to the past while allowing me to create my own path and future," Aloy replies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo then transitions into the actual Horizon Forbidden West game world, and Raghoebardajal continues the conversation while playing the game. It's slightly jarring to see the player converse with a character they're in control of, and the irony of using Aloy as an AI-powered PlayStation character given the plot of the Horizon games is obvious.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo is described as a prototype developed with the help of Horizon studio Guerrilla Games to show off the tech internally at Sony. “This is just a glimpse of what is possible,” Raghoebardajal says in the video. And while the video shows an investment from Sony in the exploration of AI-powered PlayStation characters, it’s worth noting the company has yet to confirm plans to incorporate the tech into any public-facing PlayStation product, and there is no suggestion it would even be possible with PS5 games at this stage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it perhaps comes as little surprise to see Sony’s work behind the scenes here, given pretty much all its competitors in the video game space are working on AI tech of some description. Indeed, Xbox maker Microsoft is all-in on AI, and recently announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-and-hellblade-developer-ninja-theory-built-an-ai-called-muse-designed-to-generate-ideas-for-a-games-design-and-its-already-making-complex-gameplay-sequences">an AI called Muse designed to generate ideas for a game's design</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA said in September that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>AI was "the very core" of its business</u></a>, and more recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-create-hundreds-of-thousands-of-unique-ideas-needed-to-build-in-game-environments"><u>Capcom said it was experimenting with generative AI</u></a> to create the "hundreds of thousands" of ideas needed for in-game environments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios Asad Qizilbash <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-exec-says-ai-is-important-to-gen-z-and-gen-alpha-gamers-who-want-personalization-across-everything"><u>weighed in on AI to say its use in video games is important to Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamers</u></a> who seek "personalization across everything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For instance, non-player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal,” Qizilbash said. “This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">Activision recently admitted the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assets</a> amid a backlash to an "AI slop" zombie Santa loading screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

        <p>"Being a clone feels unique"</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sony are experimenting with AI-powered characters who'll speak to the player directly using OpenAI and Chat-GPT to hold a conversation, according to leaked footage seen by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype">the Verge</a>. The video shows familiar robot whacker Aloy from the Horizon games "responding to queries with an AI-powered synthesized voice and facial movements". Sony's copyright patrolmen showed up with a "'ello 'ello what have we 'ere" and got the video taken down from YouTube. But, shhh, there are other ways to see it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The footage is still <a href="https://streamable.com/eygm5f?src=player-page-share">posted on Streamable</a>, for example. Skip to the three minute mark if you just want to see the Aloybot in action. It shows her answering some questions about herself and her origins, then entering the game world and responding to other questions as she moves around, like whether or not she can see enemies nearby, what time it is, what weapons she's using, and so on. After that, they return to an "interview" setting and she summarises the past few moments.</p>
<p>The presentation is given by Sharwin Raghoebardajal, a software engineer who works on AI and face technology for an internal Sony body called the PlayStation Studios Advanced Technology Group. Raghoebardajal points out that this is just a prototype but confirms it is also operating within a specialised build of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>. Guerilla Games worked with the group to develop the demonstration, he says.</p>
<p>As for the technology behind it all, it's a melange of different AI, sound, and animation tools. OpenAI's Whisper is used to generate the speech-to-text, then language models GPT-4 and Llama 3 do their wibbly wobbly thing, before Sony's own voice synthesis and face animation technology wraps it all up. The result is a number of robotic if somewhat accurate face movements, and an unsettling voice from the depths of tech bro hell. I don't want it near me or my pets.</p>
<p>"We'll not go into whether this is fun for games," says Raghoebardajal, "whether it even makes sense to talk to Aloy when you're her while playing the game... or where we're going to get the memory from to run this all on a consumer console. This is just a glimpse of what is possible."</p>
<p>After the Verge published their story on AI-loy, the video they posted was taken down via a claim from Muso, a copyright enforcement company who have Sony as a client. Hey, Sony, relax. It could have been worse. Remember when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/catholic-priest-ai-chatbot-is-defrocked-within-a-week-after-taking-confession-and-okaying-gatorade-baptisms">the Vatican's AI chatbot was defrocked for telling people you could baptise children in Gatorade</a>? That was fun.</p>
<p>If you haven't played the Horizon games, they are open world action adventures about human tribes trying to survive in a world where humanity was almost wiped out. The collapse of civilisation was caused by artificial intelligence.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/11/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date-in-april-leaks/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> on PS5 has seemingly been leaked by the very reliable Bilibil-kun, who claims that the acclaimed Indy game will launch on Sony’s console on 17th April.</p>
<p>Writing on French deals site <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-les-dates-de-sortie-de-indiana-jones-et-le-cercle-ancien-sur-ps5-60055">Deallabs</a>, Billbil-kun is best known for their string of accurate leaks and reveals of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games, but has since made plenty more accurate predictions for pretty much anything video game related.</p>


<p>Per their “recent investigations”, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will launch for PS5 on 17th April, though a Premium version will feature two days early access from 15th April, in addition to a Temple of Doom outfit, digital art book and an upcoming The Order of Giants DLC. Both Standard and Premium editions will be available as a physical release, matching the Xbox pricing at £69.99 / €79.99 / $69.99 for the Standard edition and £99.99 / €109.99 / $99.99 for the Premium edition, with pre-orders for both versions expected to go live on 25th March.</p>
<h2>Further Reading: <a title="Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is best experienced as a serial, just like the films that inspired it" href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-best-experienced-as-a-serial-just-like-the-films-that-inspired-it/">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is best experienced as a serial</a></h2>
<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft proudly proclaimed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/30/indiana-jones-hits-4-million-players-but-xbox-revenue-and-hardware-sales-fall/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has brought in over 4 million players</a> across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PC and through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscribers. We never get actual sales figures for Microsoft games anymore, but this was an encouraging amount of reach, and we’ll certainly see a big bump when the game arrives on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>It will also be fascinating to see how the game is catering to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> hardware, which will be significantly more powerful than the Xbox Series X. Full path tracing is likely off the table even with this spec bump – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launch-day-update-adds-full-ray-tracing-on-pc/">though it is supported on PC</a> – but with the recent announcement of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-date-set-for-april-22nd-launching-alongside-horizon-realms-update/">Forza Horizon 5 for PS5</a>, Playground Games is able to feature ray-traced car reflections during races and free roam, which was not possible on Series X. Some kind of visual uplift could certainly be on the cards for Indy.</p>

<p>Either way, this game should be on many a PS5-owner’s wish list. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a great adaptation that defies the expectations of gun-heavy Uncharted-alike in favour of something more considered and true to the films. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">our review</a> I said, “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own, distinctive path as an archeological adventure, excellently capturing the feel of the films with its visuals and performances. There’s a fun new story here as well, wrapped around its blend of exploration, puzzles and pugilism.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-narrative-driven-game-where-you-decide-how-much-you-want-to-know/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>MercurySteam continues to share new details about Blades of Fire. In the span of a couple of weeks, we got the <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-will-focus-strictly-on-weapons-and-your-skills-instead-of-magic-and-rpg-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new info</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-detailed-requirements-upscaled-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed PC system requirements</a>,&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-gets-lots-of-new-gameplay-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and new gameplay footage</a>, and now there's a fresh interview with Gamereactor in which studio co-founder and game director Enric Alvarez <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/video/724323/Forging+a+New+World+-+Blades+of+Fire+Interview+with+Enric+Alvarez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> the narrative structure. While a very narrative-driven game, Blades of Fire also provides the player with agency over</span>&nbsp;how much they really want to know about this world and its characters.</p>
<p><em>It might not look like it because of the freedom the game gives you, but it's a strongly narrative-driven game, and characters are the most important thing. Because you don't have a good story without good characters. So, when writing the story, we wanted to have a certain exposed narrative through cutscenes, other characters, etc., but we also wanted to have a kind of organic narrative, depending on how proactive you are. </em></p>
<p><em>The curiosity will drive you through important bits of the story. For example, there's two mechanics that you can talk to Adso anytime. One mechanic is, okay, tell me what you know about the mission you're accomplishing. And they will tell you vague stuff because they don't know everything about that. So, you, as a player, will know what they know.</em></p>
<p><em>And there's a second layer, which is, I want to talk about specific topics to Adso. You can stop at any time and say, hey, Adso, tell me about the forgers. Tell me about the hammers. Tell me about the master forgers, or about this castle, or about this new character we just found. All this requires your curiosity and active participation. There's a lot of narrative delivered in this way. I think between both, we have something quite cohesive and interesting.</em></p>
<p><em>In Blades of Fire, most of the story doesn't come for you. You have to go for it. You have to actively pursue wanting to know more. You'll find quite crazy characters in this game that will give you a different perspective on what's going on in the game and many surprises.</em></p>
<p>This new fantasy action/adventure game by MercurySteam is slated to launch in two months and a half, going live on May 22 for PC (only on the Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p>Konami is hosting a dedicated Silent Hill showcase later this week.</p>
<p>Silent Hill Transmission, as it is known, will take place in two days time, on 13th March at 10pm UK time.</p>
<p>"This Transmission will uncover <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>," Konami wrote on social media. "Excited to finally be able to share what we've been cooking," added the game's director <a href="https://x.com/QQBert/status/1899287454160716275">Al Yang</a>. </p>

<p>Silent Hill f, you may recall, will be the first new mainline game for the series in over a decade. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-announced-from-resident-evil-reverse-developer">It was initially announced back in 2022</a>, with a haunting trailer which will trigger anyone who lives with trypophobia (that's the aversion to the sight of repetitive patterns or clusters of small holes or bumps).</p>
<p>This trailer showed a young girl in what appeared to be rural Japan. As the trailer progressed, she gradually became overcome by flowers, before her face peeled away (shivers and debates delaying breakfast for a little while yet).</p>
<p>As per that initial reveal, Silent Hill f's story will be by Ryukishi07 (who created the When They Cry visual novel series), while its characters and creatures are designed by Kera. The game's producer is Motoi Okamoto, whose name you may recognise from Nintendo. Neobards, meanwhile, is handling the development side of things.</p>

			<p>The Diablo IV <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24179278/the-2-2-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.2.0 Public Test Realm (PTR)</a> goes live today for a week, allowing players to test the features that will be available in the next season. By far the most interesting is the fact that after defeating certain bosses, adventurers will be able to claim some of their powers for their own.</p>
<p>Blizzard said this is an attempt to increase build variety. In total, the current plan is that 24 of Sanctuary's bosses will be supported by the feature. Various world bosses, new Apparition Incursion event bosses (see the article for more information), and even Lilith herself are among the diabolical titans offering Boss Powers.</p>
<p>Each of their powers has two effects, a main effect and a modifier effect, that can be activated depending on the Power Slot you equip it to. Players can have up to one primary and three modifier powers active at any one time. The primary boss power you equip will be the star of the show, while the modifiers are designed to enhance your chosen Main Boss Power and take it to new heights.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of the supported Diablo IV bosses and their powers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wandering Death's Chest Beam (obtained after defeating the World Boss Wandering Death)</li>
<li>Ashava's Poison Breath (obtained after defeating the World Boss Ashava)</li>

<li>Harbinger of Hatred's Volley (obtained after defeating the Greater Lair Boss Harbinger of Hatred; must be acquired with difficulty set to Torment I or higher. Requires the Vessel of Hatred expansion)</li>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> head Neil Druckmann has shared more details of the studio's all-new next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet was announced at the end of last year</a>, with a trailer which featured a retro futuristic energy and introduced us to Tati Gabrielle's bounty hunter, Jordan A Mun. Other than that, details remained relatively slim on what this game would really be about.</p>
<p>Now, however, Druckmann has shed more light on the studio's sci-fi title, and joked it was a game about religion that will surely get less hate than the divisive The Last of Us Part 2 did on its debut.</p>

</figure>
<p>"With The Last of Us 2, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game," Druckman said during a chat with 28 Days Later writer Alex Garland, to which Garland replied: "Who gives a shit."</p>
<p>"Exactly. But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about. Let's make a game about faith and religion," Druckmann quipped.</p>
<p>The Naughty Dog head revealed he has been working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet for four years now, and confirmed the upcoming release won't be set on Earth. "It takes place 2000 years in an alternate future that deviates in the late 80s," he shared.</p>
<p>"So there is not only in this alternate history timeline, we've made this -  where the where the timeline deviates - this new religion becomes pretty prominent and then we spend years just building out this religion like from the original prophet all the way [to] how it gets like changed and sometimes bastardised and evolves over all these years."</p>

</figure>
<p>Druckmann stated "this whole religion takes place on this one planet", which in December was revealed to be called Sempiria. "And then at one point all communication stops from this planet and you're playing a bounty hunter that's chasing her bounty and she crash lands on this planet," he continued, noting that while he "wanted to make a game about faith and religion" he also wanted to tackle themes of isolation and loneliness.</p>
<p>"So many of the previous games we've done there's always like an ally with you," he said. "I really want you to be lost in a place that you're really confused about what happened here, [about] who are the people here, what was their history and in order to get off this planet like - again no one has been heard from this planet for 600 years - so if you ever have hoped to have a chance to get off you have to figure out what happened here."</p>
