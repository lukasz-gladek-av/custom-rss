<p>Well that's... unexpected</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="def3cfcd30d27"><a title="Mario Kart World Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/def3cfcd30d27/mario-kart-world-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, you read that headline correctly, rather than pushing the prices up to match what we've seen everywhere else in the industry of late, select EU retailers appear to be <em>cutting</em> the cost of Switch 2 consoles and bundles (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/10/10/amazon-france-reduces-price-of-nintendo-switch-2-and-bundles/">My Nintendo News</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Nintendo-10015151-Switch-2/dp/B0F2JCL3NZ?th=1&amp;tag=nintlife09-21" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon France</a> was the first retailer brought to our attention to be implementing such a cut, with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> Switch 2 bundle and pre-orders for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> option now down to <strong>€469</strong> (a 6% drop from the previous €499,99). Standard Switch 2 purchases are currently sold out on the online storefront, but French outlet <a href="https://www.nintendo-town.fr/2025/10/10/france-amazon-et-e-leclerc-baissent-le-prix-de-la-nintendo-switch-2-et-de-ses-bundles/">Nintendo Town</a> reports that it has seen the same discount and is now listed at €419.</p>
<p>It's currently unclear whether this is a temporary or permanent discount, though it follows the same price cut seen at French retailer <a href="https://www.e.leclerc/fp/pack-console-nintendo-switch-2-le-jeu-mario-kart-world-sur-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-2-0045496321529">E.Leclerc</a>, where the console and bundles can now be found with the 6% reduction.</p>
<p>Now yes, €30 might not be the most drastic of price shifts, but it's a notable discount all the same — that's a decent chunk of money towards a new game or accessory, let's not forget.</p>
<p>It's a similar trend for the region as what we initially saw with game listings. Mere days after the Switch 2 was revealed, a handful of French retailers were already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/select-eu-retailers-are-abandoning-nintendos-suggested-retail-price-for-switch-2-games">abandoning Nintendo's suggested €80 price tag</a> for titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">TOTK</a>, and were listing each for closer to €60 instead.</p>
<p>From a global perspective, it'll be all eyes on Black Friday next month where we'd <em>assume</em> Switch 2 discounts will be available.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-is-launching-in-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-according-to-amd-leaker.1321657/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned AMD leaker Kepler has <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/from-project-amethyst-to-the-future-of-play-amd-and-sony-interactive-entertainment%E2%80%99s-shared-vision.1688947/post-270885018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed on the NeoGAF board</a> that Sony is planning to launch the PlayStation 6 console in 2027, with the caveat that 'unexpected delays' could still happen.</p>



<p>This would be right on time for a 7-year lifecycle, just like its predecessor, the PlayStation 4. The main difference would be with regards to the PlayStation 5 Pro, which was released four years after the PS5 (and therefore only three years before the alleged PS6 launch window), whereas the PlayStation 4 Pro appeared on the market three years after the PS4 and four years before the launch of the PS5.</p>



<p>Rumors about the specifications of the PlayStation 6 have been circulating for a while, mainly due to YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> an estimated computing power of 34 to 40 Teraflops with a massive ray tracing performance uplift of 6x to 12x compared to the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, AMD and Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-unveils-radiance-cores-neural-arrays-universal-compression-next-gen-rdna-gpu-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have divulged new details on their ongoing Project Amethyst collaboration</a> to improve hardware and software in future GPUs and consoles. Three technologies were singled out at this time: Radiance Cores, Neural Arrays, and Universal Compression. </p>



<ul>
<li>The first one is specifically designed to deliver that rumored ray tracing performance boost: the Radiance Cores hardware blocks will accelerate the computationally intensive ray tracing traversal calculations, freeing shader cores to work on the rest of the rendered scene. </li>



<li>Neural Arrays, on the other hand, are dedicated AI accelerator units integrated into the GPU architecture. They are designed to handle machine learning inference tasks natively on the console hardware, achieving much greater efficiency compared to current methods.</li>



<li>Finally, Universal Compression is a new device-agnostic compression technology that reduces the data footprint across textures, geometry, and other game assets without significantly reducing quality. It optimizes memory bandwidth and storage, allowing games to load faster and operate more efficiently. This should also translate into improved streaming performance, possibly reducing stuttering during gameplay.</li>
</ul>



<p>Interestingly, in that video, PlayStation System Architect Mark Cerny also <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-amd-mark-cerny-jack-huynh-project-amethyst-ps6-playstation-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased that these technologies would appear on a new console (the PlayStation 6) in a few years' time</a>. If the rumor is true, that just means two years, possibly a bit sooner than most expected. Indeed, it feels like we only started getting 'next-generation' games in the past couple of years, whereas most titles previously supported cross-generation releases. Still, this generation has a few aces left, like The Witcher IV and The Elder Scrolls VI.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-little-nightmares-3-connected-to-1-and-2-do-you-need-to-play-little-nightmares-1-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-little-nightmares-3-connected-to-1-and-2-do-you-need-to-play-little-nightmares-1-2-first.1321654/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Little Nightmares 3 offers a new world with new characters. As this is the third game in the series, onlookers finally peeking into the franchise are curious as to whether this is a direct sequel, if the worlds are reconnected, and also if you need to play either of the first two games before hopping into Little Nightmares 3 for the first time.</p>



<p>This might surprise you, but the Little Nightmares franchise has sold over 20 million units worldwide! This is a phenomenal achievement for an indie title. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-little-nightmares-3-have-crossplay-cross-platform-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> is moving closer to AA territory with the introduction of Supermassive Games—a renowned horror expert.</p>



<p>But today, we’re seeing if there’s a disconnect between Little Nightmares 3 and the titles that came before it, and tell you everything you need to know if you’re on the fence about buying.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-to-play-little-nightmares-1-or-2-before-playing-little-nightmares-3">Do You Need To Play Little Nightmares 1 or 2 Before Playing Little Nightmares 3?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A lot to explore, but you’re not Alone. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You do not need to play Little Nightmares 1 or Little Nightmares 2 before playing Little Nightmares 3, as this is a new adventure independent of the first two games.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a> features two brand-new characters—Low and Alone. The side-scrolling puzzle-platformer also takes place in a fresh location—The Nowhere. None of these properties has featured in previous Little Nightmares games. </p>



<p>So if you’re worried about missing out on crucial story lore or not understanding the game due to missing a piece of the puzzle, we can assure you that everything is learned and uncovered as you play.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-little-nightmares-3-connected-to-the-first-two-games">Is Little Nightmares 3 Connected To The First Two Games?</h2>



<p><strong>The short is no, we don’t think Little Nightmares 3 is directly connected to either of the first two games.</strong></p>



<p>At best, there’s a loose sense that Low and Alone share the same world, although it’s not directly implied. Whereas Little Nightmares 1 and 2 are more overt, as Six—the main character in Little Nightmares 1—also appears alongside Mono in Little Nightmares 2.</p>



<p>The second game is a prequel to the first, which is why they tie together so nicely and fittingly. But Little Nightmare 2 is its own entity. Everything about it is fresh, and we think it symbolizes the new beginning as the series’ development shifts away from Tarsier Games to Supermassive Games.</p>



<p>There could be some subtle clues we’ve missed throughout our playthrough—which we discussed in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3 review</a>—otherwise, you should be fine if this is your first LN experience!</p>



<hr>



<p>To recap, you don’t need to play either of the first two games before playing Little Nightmares 3. The world may be faintly connected, but this is a new adventure, and a new story.

            <p>Forthcoming extraction shooter ARC Raiders will make progression wipes voluntary, through its newly revealed Expedition Project.</p>
<p>Progression wipes essentially reset a player's progress in a game and are a blunt method of putting all players on an even field. These are used in plenty of shooters, particularly at the start of a new season, but can be controversial. While Escape from Tarkov has had regular wipes, for instance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer Bungie <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1975305060574732357">recently u-turned</a> on a decision to reset power in its forthcoming Renegades expansion due to player backlash.</p>
<p>ARC Raiders will include voluntary progression wipes, <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/">Embark Studios has now explained</a>, but the developer has its own method of implementing them.</p>

<p>"Just to make it clear, we absolutely see the benefits a global wipe provides," the studio wrote in a blog post. "Veteran players can experience the game fresh, the economy is reset to the baseline, and all players have about the same level of capabilities. At least for a little while.</p>
<p>"However, one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall."</p>
<p>The system in ARC Raiders is called the Expedition Project. The explanation is a little complicated, at least until we go hands-on and try it ourselves, but the full game will introduce the Expedition Project at level 20.</p>
<p>This ongoing project (or mission, really) operates on a repeating cycle of roughly eight weeks, with players gradually contributing towards its progression. Once complete, a progression reset will be available. If progress is not complete, players will be able to carry it over to the next finalisation window.</p>
<p>A progression reset will wipe character levels, skills, inventory, crafting capabilities, and everything else associated with progress. Cosmetics (both earned and purchased), awards, achievements and the like will remain.</p>
<p>To incentivise completing the Expedition Project, players will be rewarded with permanent account unlocks, unique cosmetic rewards, and buffs for the following Expedition cycle.</p>
<p>"One point to drive home is that we are being very careful about the nature of these benefits," the blog post reads. "Completing a reset should never give a player a power or combat advantage over anyone who has not completed a reset.</p>
<p>"Initially, these benefits will centre around cosmetics and bragging rights, quality-of-life, and smoothing out some aspects of progression for those who have gone through a reset."</p>
<p>Essentially, this system gives players the power to reset their game in their own time, prolonging the game's longevity through repetition with less pressure on endgame activities.</p>
<p>"It's not a silver bullet," the studio admitted, "and won't achieve the clean break that a mandatory global reset does, but it does aim to be more equitable to all players. Wherever possible, we want to value your time spent in the game as much as you do.</p>
<p>"Of course, this is a complex topic, so we'll be keeping an eye on the discussion around this message and follow up as necessary."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/play-online-shooter-arc-raiders-free-next-month-in-final-test-weekend-before-release">ARC Raiders will have a free public network test later this month</a>, to test out the game ahead of its full release on 30th October.</p>
<p>It's releasing, therefore, between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> as something of an underdog of the three. Still, you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-censor-arc-raiders">can't type "ARC Raiders" into the Call of Duty chat</a> as it's been censored.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Discord has confirmed that a data breach of their customer support platform has leaked at least 70,000 government IDs that were being used for age verification, something required in the UK since July to satisfy the Online Security Act.</p>
<p>I think you’ll agree that this is pretty much the exact opposite of online security.</p>


<p>Amongst the leaked information was personal information, including partial credit card details, messages to customer support agents and, with the need to diagnose and manually verify disputed age checks, government ID images. No full payment details or user login details were affected.</p>
<p>The attack on Discord didn’t affect the company’s main servers and infrastructure, but instead targeted a third-party customer support service. This is a particularly common avenue that bad actors use to gain access to company data, by obtaining logins for external services used for internal communication and customer support.</p>
<p>The extent of the cyber-attack is in dispute, with Discord admitting to 70,000 government IDs being leaked, but the hacker group that has claimed responsibility say that they had access for 58 hours by compromising the account of a support agent at an outsourced provider. This let them download 1.5TB of sensitive data that includes over 2.1 million government IDs. Discord disputes these figures, telling the BBC that these numbers were inflated and “part of an attempt to extort payment”.</p>

<p>While Discord did not name the third party service, the hackers said that it was the Zendesk portal that was affected. Speaking to the BBC, Zendesk said that its systems were not compromised through a vulnerability within its platform.</p>
<p>Discord is still in the process of investigating the attack and working with law enforcement, and they are getting in touch with affected users.</p>
<p>They state:</p>
<p>“If you were impacted, you will receive an email from <em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="6c02031e091c00152c08051f0f031e08420f0301">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em>. We will not contact you about this incident via phone – official Discord communications channels are limited to emails from <em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="e38d8c9186938f9aa3878a90808c9187cd808c8e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em>.”</p>
<p>So…. remind me again why successive UK governments decided to not only pass online age verification laws, but also not take a hands on approach to securely implement an anonymised form of this?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has insisted players won’t see anything made by generative AI in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The use of generative AI is one of the hottest topics in the video game industry, with the pressure on publishers to cut costs and speed up development in order to boost profits despite the risk of backlash from some fans. Indeed, according to a report by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Financial Times</a>, EA’s new prospective owners (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-andrew-wilson-to-remain-as-ceo">the ones who just spent $55 billion to take the company private</a>) are betting on the use of generative AI to do just that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And EA itself, even before it was bought out, had signalled that it was all-in on generative AI, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">CEO Andrew Wilson insisting AI is “the very core of its business.”</a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For now though, at least when it comes to Battlefield 6, generative AI is taking a backseat. Rebecka Coutaz, general manager of original series developer DICE in Sweden, and Criterion, the UK studio now also a part of what’s collectively called Battlefield Studios, told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a> that while generative AI “is very seducing,” currently there is no way to work it into the developers’ daily work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Coutaz clarified that generative AI is used in preparatory stages "to allow more time and more space to be creative.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA’s approach here for Battlefield 6 is in contrast to Activision’s for Call of Duty. Call of Duty has suffered a number of generative AI controversies in recent years, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash"><u>now-infamous six-fingered zombie Santa bundle</u></a>. Earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">Activision was forced to add an ‘AI generated content disclosure’ to the Steam page for Black Ops 6</a> after Valve changed its storefront rules.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/santa-claus-1733746080205-1760086374302.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Black Ops 6's 'Necroclaus' loading screen. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on Coutaz’s comments, and the current lack of an AI generated content disclosure on the Battlefield 6 Steam page, we won’t see something similar in EA’s rival first-person shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In August, Treyarch associate creative director, Miles Leslie, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-responds-to-generative-ai-backlash-not-replace-but-streamline">suggested generative AI images had made their way into Black Ops 6 by mistake</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We live in a world now, where there are AI tools,” Leslie told IGN ahead of Black Ops 7's reveal at Opening Night Live 2025. “I think our official statement we said last year, around Black Ops 6, is that everything that goes into the game is touched by the team a hundred percent. We have generative AI tools to help us, but none of that goes in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And then you're going to say, ‘Yeah, but it has.' I'll say it has by accident. And that was never the intention. We've come out and been very clear that we use these as tools to help the team, but they do not replace any of the fantastic team members we have that are doing the final touches and building that content to put it in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So everything you play: human-created and touched. AI tools in the world we live in: it's, how do we streamline it? That's really the goal. Not replace, but streamline.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting the Black Ops 7 Steam page <em>does</em> include the AI disclosure.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But will Battlefield Studios' stance on generative AI hold for much longer, especially with EA's new owners breathing down its neck? In the interview with the BBC, Coutaz sounded optimistic about the use of the tech going forward. "If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative," she said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The debate over generative AI is bigger than in-game assets. Earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-issues-official-statement-in-response-to-generative-ai-claim-as-openai-ceo-sam-altman-calls-sora-2-copyrighted-character-videos-interactive-fan-fiction">Nintendo issued a statement in response to claims around generative AI</a>, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman calling Sora 2 copyrighted character videos “interactive fan fiction.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, the famously litigious The Pokémon Company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this"><u>formally responded to the use of Pokémon TV hero Ash Ketchum and the series' theme tune by the Department of Homeland Security</u></a>, as part of a video showing people being arrested and handcuffed by law enforcement agents.

    <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Bloober, the on-a-good-run Polish developer of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">the Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-review">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> still has a surprising amount of other games nearly ready to release.</p>
<p>First among them is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a>, the suspenseful, painter-themed creep-a-thon that began the studio's horror specialisation nearly 10 years ago. This is called Layers of Fear: The Masterpiece Edition, it's described as a "complete edition", which presumably means it bundles all additional content released for the game, and it will apparently be released this year. There's no more specific date than "2025", which is odd given how close to the end of the year we are, but perhaps it's being held for a sudden shadow-drop during a Nintendo Direct or The Game Awards.</p>
<p>The rest of the games come from Bloober's subsidiary studio Broken Mirror Games, which was set up in 2024, and appear to be making smaller-scale projects. The first of them is I Hate This Place, an isometric open-world horror game, which has been pushed back slightly from a launch this year to 29th January next year. This is the 80s, comic-book styled adventure inspired by a comic of the same name, written by Kyle Starks and Artyom Topilin.</p>

<p>Broken Mirror has two further games that both still carry codenames. Project M is a Switch exclusive, intriguingly - and both Switch 1 and 2 are mentioned - and it will release next year. A teaser trailer for the game shows live-action footage of a man climbing a ruined internal staircase in a block of flats and then making a shocking discovery. Meanwhile, a girl in a white dress approaches the camera in a garden outside.</p>

<p>The other game is Project F, which has no platforms assigned to it or any apparent marketing material.</p>
<p>But that's not all! Broken Mirror has a creepy virtual reality game very close at hand, called Star Trek: Infection. It was revealed a couple of months ago at Gamescom and will be released 11th December this year, on Meta Quest 3S, Meta Quest 3, and SteamVR.</p>

<p>Bloober, meanwhile, recently confirmed it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-confirms-silent-hill-1-remake-in-production-and-wont-rule-out-a-cronos-sequel-just-yet">a remake of Silent Hill 1</a> in production. The studio also hasn't ruled out a follow-up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, though nothing is in development yet.</p>

            <p>Altruism is a funny concept. Most of us can agree that bestowing a generous gift of greening shelf-stable bread-like product on the local park pigeons is a nice thing to do, but what of the knowledge that moulders in the back of our minds all the while, telling us: keep this up long enough, and you'll definitely end up with a loyal army of skyborne scavengers willing to enact your every destructive whim at a mere flick of your wrist? Feed them the really good bread, they might even let you throw them at things. From super seeded, to superceding god. Here's the trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-bench">The Bench</a>.</p>

<p>"Find hidden objects, solve quirky puzzles, and command pesky pigeons in this charming, interactive adventure," coos the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183410/The_Bench">Steam page</a>. Charming interactive adventure, it says, while gleefully showing off several possible instances of bird-related grievous bodily harm, including but not limited to: knocking someone out by throwing a pigeon at a precarious stack of boxes, knocking someone out by cutting out the middle bird and just lobbing a stale piece of bread directly at their forehead, throwing a pigeon right at a fat iron padlock, blowing up a balloon seller's cart by hurling a pigeon at the helium tank, and at one point, just straight up drowning someone. There are also some nice puzzles. From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote><p>In The Bench, you’ll step into the shoes of a wise, seasoned senior enjoying his day in a lively, interactive world. But don’t get too comfortable, your mission is to find the hidden objects scattered around you, as you escape the clutches of the retirement home, for a life in the real world, all with the help of your trusted pigeon army.</p>
<p>Explore beautifully designed, colorful maps, each with its own quirks, and dive into fun mini-games, such as solving newspaper puzzles, playing chess, bowls, or going fishing! There’s plenty to do to keep your mind sharp and stop you from dozing off.</p></blockquote>
<p>This one's out October 24th. Not strictly a Halloween game, but I suppose that depends how you feel about pigeons.</p>

            <p>Halo art director Glenn Israel has left Halo Studios after 17 years working on the franchise.</p>
<p>Israel worked on the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-3-odst">Halo 3: ODST</a> and the most recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a>, across both Bungie and 343 Industries (now known as Halo Studios).</p>

<p>"As of today and after seventeen long years, I am officially no longer contributing to the Halo universe," wrote Israel. "There is little more I can say for the moment, though I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year."</p>
<p>Israel continued, with a message for those working in the games industry.</p>
<p>"I know that the state of our industry seems dire, but never forget that you are *free to choose*," he wrote. "No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics or values - and no one can force you to. Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong."</p>
<p>Of course, people leave their jobs all the time, but this is certainly an alarming message that seems to suggest Israel's ethics and values have been compromised in some way.</p>
<p>Further, as YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmqrY8ng2GI">Rebs Gaming</a> has reported, all but one of the nine-strong art team credited in Halo Infinite have now left the studio, while chief of staff Melissa Boone also recently left.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for comment on Israel's departure.</p>
<p>All of this is ahead of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-studios-revealing-more-on-next-projects-yes-plural-at-next-months-world-championship-event">reveal of the studio's next projects at the Halo World Championships</a> later this month.</p>
<p>The last Halo game released was 2021's Halo Infinite, which has seen multiplayer numbers plummet. And following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">mass layoffs at Microsoft</a> this year, the departure now of a veteran developer is a worrying sign for its flagship franchise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<hr>
<p>Few sounds are as deeply ingrained in our household as the merry chant of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/patapon">Patapon</a>. A PSP favourite, and with three games in the bag, Sony then seemed to forget about the little one-eyed weirdos, occasionally <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/10/patapon-12-replay-review-rhythm-action-repeat/">dusting the first two games off for remasters</a>. The team at TVT and Ratata Arts haven’t forgotten, though. Made up of various team members from the original games, they’ve set sail on an all new, rhythm-action extravaganza in the shape of Ratatan. For all the changes and modernity that they’ve brought, it’s still of game of tiny weirdos, impressive footwork and merry chants. I wouldn’t want it any other way.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ratatan Animation: Welcome to Rataport" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANtXCPQ7eD0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Expansive. That’s the word that you’ll associate with Ratatan if you’ve played previous Patapon games. There’s simply more here, and that starts with choosing your Ratatan. There’s eight incredibly cool, but equally cute, leading characters to choose from, all of whom have different abilities and weapon selections.</p>


<p>Mashuma is clad in a mushroom – or maybe is a mushroom? – and plays a toadstool bagpipe. That’s very cool. Pyokorappa looks like a cyberpunk rabbit, plays a trombone, and sounds suspiciously like a Patapon. That’s all very cool too. Frogs, owls, ninja cats, whichever of the lovingly created characters you go for, you’ll find you now have direct control over them, functioning as lead instrumentalist and general, so not only do you have to command your diminuitive single-eyed army, you have to think about where you’re standing too. At first, this feels like more than the tiny human mind can cope with, but you soon start to understand how it all works.</p>


<p>Ratata looks stunning. The artwork here is beautiful, taking the stripped back visual design of Patapon and laying on a massive palette of colour, detail and vibrancy. Everything feels alive, and that sense of life carries through from the characters and different enemies you come across, all the way to the hub world that you visit in-between each run.</p>
<p>Each run sees you taking your army of Ratatan, which are one eyed fish people as opposed to one eyed… actually, what were Patapon? Presumably, they’re the same species as Mike Wazowski? Some sort of cyclops? Anyway, you set out int the overworld with your army, fighting your way through small skirmishes until you meet the huge boss at the end. That starts out with a huge dinosaur-esque badnik, before moving things onto giant armoured crabs and shark/bull hybrids.</p>
<p>Whatever awesome-looking form they take, you’ll need to be prepared, and you do that through repeated runs. Patapon was fundamentally always roguelite adjacent, rewarding repeated runs through the same areas, building your armoury and levelling up your army. That’s just more obvious here, and as you beat all those evil little one eyed armies with your good one eyed army, you’ll pick up weaponry and materials that you’ll need to advance further.</p>

<p>Besides that, there’s a run of Ratakurata cards that you collect, enhancing your attacks with different effects. The two main card types add an elemental attack to either your standard move or your special, while others may prolong certain effects or give you higher damage or better defense. Each run can be completely different, between choosing alternate lead characters, who then use different Cubon types, with access to alternate weaponry, and then the random factor and decisions of selecting your Ratakurata cards. It really helps to avoid some of the grind, when everything can be changed up run by run as you seek out your favourite setup. It throws a lot at you, but manages to maintain a distinct sense of self and direction in the process</p>
<p>It all comes down to the music though. Rhythm-action games live and die by their soundtrack, and Ratatan serves up bop after bop. I don’t remember a rhythm action game in recent memory that has had me bopping along as consistently as Ratatan does, with each world shifting through clearer genres and musical composition than Patapon ever did. It will make you smile, and it will make you happy, and that kind of unburdened joy is in short supply these days.</p>

<p>As you progress, your hub town swells to include various different townspeople and merchants, all of whom want to help you out, or charge you a suspiciously high amount of materials in exchange for something else. Levelling up and crafting weapons for your army is a highlight, and some of the designs for the special weaponry is Monster Hunter-level good. They definitely need to make more of these, because what’s better than a one-eyed army setting off into battle with an array of sick weaponry?</p>
<p>Ratatan is exactly what I wanted it to be. In Early Access this is a fresh, modern take on Patapon’s iconic action with an invigorating visual design and awesome soundtrack. All I want now from the journey to 1.0 is even more of this.</p>

						<h5>Little Nightmares III</h5><p><span>October 10, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2</span>

						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>The Little Nightmares franchise has been a bit of a surprise hit, moving over 20 million units to date, so it’s <em>not </em>surprising that publisher Bandai Namco has opted to continue on with a third entry even though series creators Tarsier Studios has decided to move on. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/little-nightmares-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares III</a> instead comes to us from the horror specialists at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/supermassive-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Supermassive Games</a>, who have made a clear effort to recreate the look and feel of previous entries in the series. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Is Little Nightmares III a successful continuation of the franchise? Or is it time to wake from this recurring dream? Rub that sleep from your eyes and read on to find out...</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While the Little Nightmares series has always taken a wordless enigmatic approach to storytelling, the first two games offered more character development and hinted-at lore than you might expect. Supermassive at least partially resets the universe in Little Nightmares III, introducing two new mysterious protagonists, "Low" and "Alone," and some changes to the series' narrative structure that turns the "Little Nightmares" title into more of a literal statement. Overall, our new protagonists are likable enough, but some of the sense of intrigue and mystery that surrounded the first two Little Nightmares games is missing here.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In terms of gameplay, Supermassive doesn’t stray far from Tarsier’s blueprint. Little Nightmares III is a 2.5D platformer, with players having a relatively limited moveset, including the ability to jump, grab onto ledges and items, run, and crouch to sneak and fit through tight spaces. New to this game, each playable character now has a specific tool they carry with them at all times — Low has a bow that they can use to shoot things from afar, and Alone wields a wrench they can use to smash stuff and turn some cranks.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For the most part, Supermassive have very accurately replicated the feel of past Little Nightmares games, for better and worse. Character movement is very deliberate, which isn't a bad thing in a horror game, but platforming in particular can feel very inconsistent and "canned." There are times when the game's fixed camera angles and perspectives make it very difficult to properly judge jumps, with certain trouble spots causing me to die dozens of times (and I’ve been playing difficult platformers since the '80s). Thankfully, Supermassive<em> has </em>addressed Little Nightmares II's excruciatingly bad combat. It's still not <em>great </em>here, but both Low and Alone having their own dedicated weapons greatly reduces frustration.</p>



<p>Speaking of our dual protagonists, the other big thing Supermassive has added to Little Nightmares III is online co-op. Little Nightmares II took a The-Last-of-Us-like approach, with players relying on an AI-controlled partner to get past some obstacles, and you can still play that way in Little Nightmares III, but you can also now team up with an actual human. Due to the new co-op focus, Supermassive have included some puzzles and challenges that require some slightly more involved teamwork. Nothing too crazy — this isn't a Hazelight game — but you will need some coordination when playing with another person, which can be fun.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, these moments aren’t as satisfying when playing solo. Players pick Low or Alone at the beginning of a singleplayer run, and there’s no ability to switch back and forth between them. During some of the more complex team tasks, you simply do your side of the challenge and the AI will automatically do their side. Strictly speaking, this works, but it almost feels like cheating as your AI partner flawlessly completes their half of a puzzle. When your AI companion isn’t being overly competent, they’re often the opposite, getting lost behind or failing to zero in and do a simple thing you need to proceed. The AI always came around in the end for me, but not before some moments of irritation and wasted time.</p>



<p>Supermassive could also have done more to make co-op accessible to more people. Little Nightmares III can only be played online with folks on your friends list; there is no couch co-op, and your ability to communicate with your partner is very limited. That said, Little Nightmares III does include a Hazelight-style Friend Pass, allowing you to play with an online pal even if they don't own a copy of the game, so kudos for that.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Beyond the addition of co-op, Little Nightmares III feels very much like its predecessors, with its various sequences and set pieces sometimes feeling almost copy-pasted. Platform over rickety structures, crawl through various vents and tunnels, find skittery hiding nomes, tote around batteries to power devices, observe and sneak by various shambling monstrosities, run from those monstrosities in tense chase scenes, etc. If you’ve played past Little Nightmares games, you’ve done all this before. Little Nightmares III only summons up a couple of genuinely original sequences, which are saved for the game's final chapter. This finale hints at what Little Nightmares III <em>could </em>have been, but for most of the game's runtime, the game is merely fine. Arguably more fun and refined than the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/little-nightmares-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often-frustrating Little Nightmares II</a>, but rarely surprising.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game is also rarely all that scary. Earlier Little Nightmares titles were far from perfect, but they had a special <em>something</em>. The leathery Muppet-ey freaks that populated Tarsier's Little Nightmares games were uniquely off-putting, and while Supermassive tries their best to dream up their own atrocities, their creations don't quite measure up with many treading too close to generic creepy doll territory. Visually, Little Nightmares III also lacks some of the ambiance of the first two games, and even on PS5, it doesn't run quite as well as I'd like.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, despite the relatively negative tone of this review, Little Nightmares III does have its moments and can be fun with another human player. The game just doesn’t stand out in any particular way and with a relatively brief 4-hour runtime, this will likely be one of those dreams that fades from your mind not long after you wake up.</p>

					<h2>Little Nightmares III</h2>

						<section>
				<p>Little Nightmares III does a solid job of emulating the gameplay of earlier entries in the series, sometimes to a fault, but it doesn’t bring a whole lot else to the table and new developer Supermassive Games can’t quite pin down the eerie tone and creeping tension that made these games popular. While the ability to play online with others will appeal to some, it’s hard to escape the feeling that this series has officially gone from sleeper hit to just plain sleepy.</p>

            <p>This week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> patch has arrived, firing some gear balancing tweaks into the looter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s innards, then probably dropping a cringey catchphrase. Developers Gearbox have also revealed some of what's in store for the larger patch that's set to arrive next week, with performance fixes back on the menu alongside some more in-depth balancing that'll touch "those unintended interactions" folks have been relying on for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/psst-borderlands-4-has-a-pretty-broken-infinite-damage-build-and-it-may-soon-go-the-way-of-the-dodo">overpowered builds</a>.</p>
<p>It's all in the line with the nice rhythm the studio have settled into following an initial flurry of activity in response to the game running not goodly on PC out of the gate. Last week brought <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4s-first-major-balancing-patch-is-out-now-delivering-beefy-vault-hunter-buffage-across-the-board">a big patch featuring the first round of vault hunter balancing tweaks</a>, so this week sees a chaser precede the next shot.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We’re continuing to monitor feedback to the vault hunter changes and identifying areas to make further improvements," Gearbox wrote in <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">the notes for this chaser patch</a>, before listily outlining the following gear adjustage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby's Grasp damage increased by 50%</li>
<li>Ruby's Grasp fire rate increased by 25%</li>
<li>Bully drone damage increased by 50%</li>
<li>Bully base damage increased by 50%</li>
<li>Rangefinder base damage increase by 30%</li>
<li>Queen's Rest spawn chance increased from 30% to 50%</li>
<li>Queen's Rest fire rate increased by 50%</li>
<li>Seventh Sense orb damage increased by 250%</li>
<li>Hellwalker base damage increase 30%</li>
<li>Convergence base damage increase by 25%</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of other tweaks. The legendary tediore shotgun anarchy will now properly award stacks of mutualism when auto-reloading or netting kills, every single pet now gets the appropriate chance of a critical hit from passives and gear, and Vex's bleed now counts as status effect damage. That last one sounds like it could be bad news for those exploity Vex knife builds, but even if it isn't, overpowered Vexers likely won't sleep well for the next seven days.</p><p>I say that because Gearbox have made clear next week's patch will "address unintended interactions in certain vault hunter skills, and make adjustments to overperforming gear", with Borderlands 4 director Graeme Timmins going as far as to phrase <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1976321473041322127">a tweet about it</a> as a warning to those with overpowered builds. He's gotten some pushback from anti-nerfage campaigners, and responded by writing: "We have future content like the upcoming Invincible that we want players to find challenge/accomplishment in. If we balanced that content around bad gear, it would remove build diversity, forcing players into specific builds using said gear."</p>
<p>Also teased for next week's patch were "another round of adjustments that will focus on class mods, repkits, shields, and firmware being tuned to provide greater viability for melee builds, and account for deficiencies in other specific vault hunter builds", and more stabs at improving the game's performance. In the meantime, maybe pen a poetic eulogy for Vex's boss-destroying knifeage, lest the heady days of its max bleeding be forgotten.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> players have discovered that a fan-favourite aerial manoeuvre has been given its own dedicated dog tag, for those willing to leap from the safety of their aerial vehicle.</p>
<p>The Rendezook dog tag is awarded to players who manage to leap from the pilot seat of their jet, shoot down an enemy jet with a bazooka, then climb back into the safety of their own jet. The term is a blend of the words rendezvous and bazooka, describing the safe return of a player after using their bazooka for some daring rocket-to-plane action.</p>
<p>The Rendezook is a feat cemented in Battlefield history by its community, specifically by a player called Stun_Gravy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOaGhE_sejI">who posted a Battlefield 3 video</a> in which he performs the now-legendary Rendezook. That video went viral, and as such the challenge for other Battlefield players to reenact the move was established.</p>

<p>For those unaware, Dog Tags in Battlefield games are unlockable cosmetics, all of which require some pre-requisite achievement or challenge to be completed before you can wear them. You can steal another player's dog tags by taking them down in melee, but you can't wear these stolen tags. That means for the Rendezook dog tag - as well as all other prestigious tags - you'll have to do it yourself.</p><p>It means in your multiplayer games you could very well see some bozo try and fail over and over again to pull off a Rendezook in a public lobby, which hey, is part of the Battlefield charm. Seeing someone grab and waste a jet is about as classic a Battlefield moment as seeing a helicopter full of soldiers swan dive into the floor.</p>
<p>Speaking of Battlefield 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Eurogamer's Battlefield 6 review went live this week</a>. Reviewer Rick Lane wrote: "Battlefield 6 delivers a thrilling multiplayer reset and a decent, if derivative single-player. But it still displays nagging doubts about what makes Battlefield special."</p>

            <p>A Minecraft Movie is getting a sequel and it's due out on 23rd July 2027.</p>
<p>The news was shared on the official Minecraft social media account with an image of two pickaxes. "Building terrain," the post teased.</p>
<p>News of a sequel is no surprise, in part due to the reveal in April a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">follow-up film was already in discussion</a>. The film's director Jared Hess teased where the film series could go next, pointing to a post-credits scene for clues.</p>

<p>Hess is also due to return to the director's chair for the sequel, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/minecraft-2-release-date-1236574896/">Deadline</a> reported.</p>
<p>But more so, A Minecraft Movie has been a phenomenal hit, even if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-review">critics weren't particularly impressed</a>.</p> <div>

<p>As we reported after its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie had the biggest domestic debut of any video game film adaptation ever in the US</a>, with an opening weekend of $157m (£121.5m). Worldwide it made $301m (£233m) in that weekend.</p>
<p>Now, Deadline has reported the film has grossed almost $1bn since its release. A sequel, then, was inevitable.</p>
<p>The film became well-known for disruptive screenings thanks to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">Chicken Jockey trend</a> of throwing popcorn all over cinemas. While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-director-defends-popcorn-throwing-chicken-jockey-chaos-says-viewers-just-having-a-true-party">Hess called it "a total blast"</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">warning was retrospectively added</a> to the start of the film, along with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-is-leaning-into-the-memes-with-sing-along-screenings">specific sing-along screenings</a>.</p>
<p>Where else could the film series go? Perhaps to The Far Lands, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-far-lands-over-14-years-later-the-edge-of-a-minecraft-world-has-been-reached">one Minecraft player has spent the past 14 years walking to</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-mmo-by-fantastic-pixel-castle-is-in-danger-after-netease-pulls-the-plug.1321582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Fantastic Pixel Castle Studio Head and Game Director Greg Street <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7382143103379587072/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed via LinkedIn</a> that the company's debut game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-wow-designer-founds-new-netease-studio-making-an-aaa-fantasy-mmo-codenamed-ghost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fantasy MMORPG codenamed Ghost</a>, is in serious danger. That's because NetEase, which had provided the initial funding, has decided to pull the plug. Both NetEase and Fantastic Pixel Castle have been looking for another publisher, but with the current market conditions, it's a very challenging proposition.</p>



<p>That's why Greg Street admitted that team members are already being encouraged to 'explore future opportunities' (that means looking at new jobs):</p>



<p><em>If we're unable to find a publisher soon, the reality is that the studio would likely close, and the entire team, leadership included, would be affected. We want to thank the Ghost community, our playtesters, and the literally hundreds of people who have given us advice on how to find funding in this absurdly challenging time for our industry. I hope you all will have a chance to play Ghost. I also want to thank the FPC team who has made a game that we all should be proud of. I know it's cliche to say this, but demonstrably this is the best team I have ever worked with. </em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-mmorpg-qa-ex-wow-designer-opens-up-on-every-aspect-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We interviewed Greg Street</a> (previously, the Lead Systems Designer of World of Warcraft between 2008 and 2013) a couple of years ago, and the designer opened up on the upcoming MMO. The main twist of Ghost was supposed to be that players could hop between public 'Red' Shards, more akin to regular MMOs, and private 'Blue' Shards, which at first were supposed to offer survival elements but were then redesigned to support roguelike elements. </p>



<p>Fantastic Pixel Castle is not the only developer to suffer from NetEase pulling the plug; <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-entertainment-is-a-new-netease-studio-founded-by-bioware-bethesda-mmo-vets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it already happened with T-Minus Zero</a>, a studio formed by former BioWare and Bethesda veterans, as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other projects canceled earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>Glenn Israel, a veteran of Halo Studios (previously 343 Industries) with more than 17 years under his belt in the universe, has departed the company and shared an ominous message on LinkedIn. In the message, he warns others in the industry about ‘staying strong and taking evidence’.</p>



<p>He also mentioned that he’s not able to talk about circumstances beyond a minor post, but said that next year, when it’s ‘absolutely safe to do so’, he’ll expand on his ‘story’.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-state-of-our-industry-seems-dire">‘The State of Our Industry Seems Dire’</h2>



<p>In a post on LinkedIn, Glenn Israel, former Art Director at 343 Industries (Halo Studios) wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As of today and after seventeen long years, I am officially no longer contributing to the Halo universe. There is litle more I can say for the moment, though I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year. In the meantime, I have a message for anyone and everyone who needs to hear it.</p>



<p>I know that the state of our industry seems dire, but never forget that you are *free to choose*. No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics or values – and no one can force you to. Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong.</p>



<p>As always, I’ll be here if you need to talk.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s most likely that Israel finds himself under an NDA after leaving Halo Studios, which is common practice to ensure that, for a time, developers aren’t discussing what they were working on or why they were let go from (or left) a company.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenn-israel-19696485_as-of-today-and-after-seventeen-long-years-activity-7379767940897959936-btQc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACr_MyIB0LsPQAIci9zs45L99nTb3k_h6f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post was published</a> over a week ago at the time of writing, but recently found its way into social circulations.</p>



<p>Recently, in the Halo space, it was claimed that a Halo: Combat Evolved <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remake was in co-development</a> by a Virtuos studio and is potentially set to be revealed during a Halo showcase at the Halo World Championship later this month.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s new Portal mode is a UGC dream, featuring a full-fledged toolkit that tech-savvy individuals can use to make all manner of things from maps to immersive experiences. In a recent post on social media, it was revealed that one keen creator has rebuilt one of Call of Duty’s most iconic multiplayer maps <strong>in Battlefield 6</strong>.</p>



<p>The addition of this map to Portal means that anyone can find it and play on it, and from what has been shown, it’s a like-for-like replication of Shipment, a Call of Duty map first introduced in 2007’s Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.</p>



<h2 id="h-shipment-is-in-battlefield-6-and-people-love-it">Shipment is in Battlefield 6, and People Love It</h2>



<p>The first thing folks did when responding to Matavatar’s post on social media was <strong>request</strong> <strong>more Call of Duty maps </strong>for Battlefield 6’s Portal platform.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>From the clips and shots above, you can see that Matavatar has painstakingly recreated Shipment in Battlefield 6, adding everything down to the minute details, and has promised that the map should be playable from day one of Battlefield 6 dropping, <strong>which is today</strong>.</p>



<p>In the comments under the post, Matavatar listed the other Call of Duty and retro Battlefield maps he intends to rebuild in Battlefield 6, all of which are pretty obvious:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nuketown</li>



<li>Ziba</li>



<li>Metro</li>



<li>Bazaar</li>



<li>Noshahr</li>



<li>Firing Range</li>
</ul>



<p>If nothing else, Matavatar’s creation is a perfect representation of how fluid and accessible the UGC platform is on Portal in Battlefield 6. He assembled this map in mere hours of the function going live, and it’ll be open to all Battlefield 6 players accessing Portal.</p>



<p>Do you think you’d like to play Battlefield 6 across a range of Call of Duty maps? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will be released worldwide on October 29th, coming to Xbox Series, PC, and PlayStation 5 platforms. It’s the next iteration of the series started by Obsidian in 2019, which dropped and was dubbed ‘New Vegas in space’ by many.</p>



<p>In this ever-digital world, it’s always key to know when you can preload games, and the situation with The Outer Worlds 2 is no different. In this snapshot guide, I’ve got the information you need, including the data regarding The Outer Worlds 2’s file size on all platforms.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-can-you-preload-the-outer-worlds-2">When Can You Preload The Outer Worlds 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Preloads for The Outer Worlds 2 are available now on Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and Xbox on PC. </strong>I’m working to verify if preloads are available on PlayStation and PC via other platforms.</p>



<p>In a post published by <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/10/10/the-outer-worlds-2-preload-is-up-on-xbox-its-a-chonky-boi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a>, the preload window was confirmed, as were the file sizes for The Outer Worlds 2. Be warned, this is a very hefty game, which might come as a surprise to some.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-file-size-explained">The Outer Worlds 2 File Size Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The preload file size for The Outer Worlds 2 is 79.49 GB on Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X and 77.30 GB on Xbox on PC.</strong> It hasn’t been confirmed how much space the game will occupy on PlayStation 5, but it’s safe to assume it’s around the same mark.</p>



<p>We’ll update this guide once we’ve got that information.</p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is a single-player title with open-world elements and plenty of RPG mechanics, but it still comes as a surprise that it’s almost 80 GB on some platforms. That’s a huge installation in any world, especially for a game expected to have a 30 – 40 hour range.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-the-outer-worlds-2">How to Preload The Outer Worlds 2</h2>



<p><strong>If you want to preload The Outer Worlds 2, you can do so by heading to the Xbox Store on console or PC and clicking to preload the game. </strong>While we haven’t verified this yet, it’ll be the same process on PlayStation and other PC platforms like Steam.</p>



<p>If you don’t have Game Pass, you’ll need to purchase the game first. Those with Game Pass Ultimate can preload The Outer Worlds 2 <strong>right now</strong>.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord</a> server if you’re excited to play The Outer Worlds 2.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/youtube-dropped-to-low-point-in-years/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/youtube-has-dropped-to-a-low-point-for-the-first-time-%E2%80%98in-years%E2%80%99-as-competition-rises.1321555/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent data, it was revealed that YouTube Live is suffering a comedown amid rising competition across the streaming space. In recent years, the likes of Kick.com and TikTok have come for the crowns claimed by YouTube and Twitch, and the video-based titans are starting to feel that pinch.</p>



<p>Steamscharts recently published a report for the Q3 2025 ‘Global Livestreaming Landscape’, and it revealed that quarter-over-quarter, YouTube Live saw a drop of more than 10% in hours watched, falling below the 50% market cap spot ‘for the first time in years’.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-streaming-space-is-becoming-saturated">The Streaming Space is Becoming Saturated</h2>



<p><a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/q3-2025-global-livestreaming-landscape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Streamscharts’ report</a> included coverage of every major and growing minor streaming platform around the world:</p>



<ul>
<li>YouTube</li>



<li>TikTok</li>



<li>Twitch</li>



<li>Kick</li>



<li>SOOP Korea</li>



<li>CHZZK</li>



<li>Rumble</li>



<li>NimoTV</li>
</ul>



<p>The numbers represent a considerable drop in foothold for YouTube Live, which is crumbling under the competition represented by TikTok Live. In recent years, TikTok has become a powerhouse platform for streamers looking to make a buck, with intense monetization features that are just too lucrative for anyone to ignore.</p>



<p>That’s why TikTok Live now makes up 31.4% of the livestreaming market, 4.4% of which is dedicated to gaming, fast becoming one of the cornerstones of the platform that was once made up of teenagers dancing to popular music.</p>



<p>YouTube Live still has a 45% claim over the market, but as Streamscharts wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>YouTube Live remains the top platform but</strong>&nbsp;saw a 10.6% drop in Hours Watched (13.25B) and its share fell below 50% for the first time in years.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kick continues to grow, despite constant controversies being raised on the platform. It’s still a site under intense scrutiny, but that hasn’t stopped streamers from flocking to the site as another option for their broadcasts.</p>



<p>Are you surprised that YouTube Live has seen a drop this year? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="755c73bc78548"><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/755c73bc78548/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Following last month's release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> is now getting updated to Version 1.05 on the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Perhaps, most notably, the Switch 2 update will add "image quality and performance settings". Additionally, there is also a first-person perspective mode. Here's the translation from the official Falcom website (via Gematsu):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Added “Image Quality / Performance Settings” to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.</em></li>
<li><em>Added options to adjust text speed and text auto-advance speed.</em></li>
<li><em>Added one-key shortcuts for actions that normally require two key presses on keyboard.</em></li>
<li><em>Added a first-person mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Added the option to hide in-game user interface.</em></li>
<li><em>Corrected various text errors.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed other miscellaneous bugs.</em></li>
</ul><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ktxnig&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p><em>*Updates for Nintendo Switch™ 2/Switch will be released at a later date.</em></p>
<p>To activate this first-person mode on the Switch 2 and Switch, you'll need to press R + ZL. And to hide the user interface, you'll need to press R + ZR.</p>
<p>And in case you missed it, here are the updates for Version 1.04:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Added camera distance setting to options</em></li>
<li><em>Adjusted the Brave Attack input acceptance time in High Speed ​​Mode</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where some battles could become unprogressible.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that could occur when jumping between maps.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that could occur when operating the Orbment menu.</em></li>
<li><em>Corrected typos and omissions</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed other bugs</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In our review here on Nintendo Life, we mentioned how there were some "slight performance issues" in the Switch 2 version. Here's part of what we had to say about this particular version of the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The journey of our sibling Bracers is most impressive on Switch 2, which targets 60fps...Undocked is notably the best mode and runs with what feels like flawless stability in combat and wandering the open world. Docked is also strong, but there is the odd frame hiccup in population centres and during visually busy battles. The game isn’t a visual powerhouse by any means, but it’s nice to see the characters adventure through lovingly designed environments without any compromises on the newer console."</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-realm-verneath-opened-by-slipknot/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-realm-%E2%80%98vernearth%E2%80%99-opened-by-slipknot-member-as-%E2%80%98a-surrealist-experience%E2%80%99.1321543/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At the end of October, Vernearth will go live, bringing a Realm to Minecraft players everywhere that bends the rules of time and reality. It is composed of more than 100 million blocks and offers ‘endless opportunities for creation, combat, and exploration,’ allowing users to build, battle or ‘just lose themselves in the atmosphere.’</p>



<p>Oh, and it has been created by M. Shawn ‘Clown’ Crahan, a founding member of Slipknot and lover of Minecraft. It has been stressed that Crahan will be playing alongside fans when the Realm goes live at the end of October.</p>



<h2 id="h-enter-vernearth-powered-by-slipknot">Enter Vernearth, Powered by Slipknot</h2>



<p>In a release, Vernearth is described as something almost otherworldly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What is Vernearth? For Clown, Vernearth isn’t just a game world, it’s an extension of his creativity outside Slipknot, suitable for players of all ages. This isn’t just Minecraft. It’s Vernearth. Vernearth is a surrealist experience. Think of it as a place where time and reality don’t play by the rules. </p>



<p>Over 100 million blocks make up this ever-changing landscape, home to mysterious beings called Mind Stewards and endless opportunities for creation, combat, and exploration. Whether you want to build, battle, or just lose yourself in the atmosphere, Vernearth is designed to pull you in and never let go.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the imagery provided, Vernearth resembles a gothic underworld of sorts, teeming with dark architecture that you’d probably be comfortable linking to a brand like Slipknot.</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar, Minecraft Realms is a subscription service that allows players to set up, manage, and explore private servers that have unique rules, modifications, and shared server facilities.</p>



<p>From what we can see in the image provided by the team, Vernearth will feature some kind of daily reward system, awarding chests to players who log in every day.</p>



<p>Do you think you’d want to explore Vernearth? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3m2rzkc4lx22b">Nintendo Patents Watch on Bluesky</a>, the patent was originally filed in Japan in April last year and in the US in April 2025. The latest one was published in the US this week and reportedly describes a system in which the player can "intuitively select multiple objects in a virtual space by walking around them".</p>
<p>Here's the official abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A player character is caused to move in a three-dimensional virtual space according to a first operation input. In the three-dimensional virtual space, a first object that connects a reference point set at a position according to a second operation input, and the player character is generated. A shape of the first object is changed based on movement of the player character. Whena second object is surrounded by the first object in the three-dimensional virtual space, the second object is designated for further game processing."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ktxnig&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>As highlighted by the same source, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205e.pdf">mentioned earlier this year</a> how the playtest was "related to a new feature for the Nintendo Switch Online service", but did not elaborate on this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We plan to leverage results and other learnings gained from this intiative in future Nintendo Switch Online services, but we have not announced any details".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although details and footage about the first playtest were leaked online, Nintendo kept the same requests in place for the second playtest - asking participants to not "discuss or disclose content" about the program with others.</p>
