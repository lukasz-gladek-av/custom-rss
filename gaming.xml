<p>You didn’t read the title wrong. A new live-action reboot of Resident Evil is being made. Let that sink in. After several disastrous attempts, it looks like the franchise will finally get a respectable movie. At least that’s what the names involved in the project indicate.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/resident-evil-reboot-zach-cregger-1236117563/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the production of the movie will be handled by Constantin Film and PlayStation Productions. PlayStation’s involvement took many people by surprise, after all, this is a Capcom IP.</p>



<p>The project will be written and directed by Zach Cregger. Shay Hatten, who worked on John Wick 4 and Army of the Dead, is co-writer. Cregger is known for Barbarian, a great horror movie. His next film, Weapons, also a horror film, was very successful with test audiences, which explains all the hype surrounding the director.</p>



<p>At the moment, four companies are in a bidding war to secure the rights to the film. According to THR, Netflix and Warner Bros. are leading the bidding.</p>



<p>According to THR’s sources, Cregger already has a vision for the project. He plans to make a horror movie that takes the franchise back to the tone of the first games, released in the 90s. Back then, the games had a strong survival horror vibe. It was a very different approach, without action elements embedded in recent games.</p>

<p>We’ve reached the stage where everyone is already accepting, but an extra confirmation doesn’t hurt.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Danny Peña</a>/Gamertag Radio, Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox, talked about various topics and, among them, the brand’s strategy of launching its exclusives on more platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-xbox-games-will-become-multiplaform">More Xbox games will become multiplaform</h2>



<p>It was during this conversation that Phil confirmed that more Xbox games will be coming to PlayStation, the rival platform. If you read our articles, you already know which games are coming to PS5 in 2025.</p>



<p>Speaking about the first-party titles, Phil said (via <a href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1882965755546788339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@Shinobi602</a>): ”<em>We love our platform and our hardware but we’re not going to put walls up where people can engage with the great games our studios are building(…)our games will show up in more places, no doubt!</em>“</p>



<div><article><p><span>New Xbox Interview with </span><a href="https://twitter.com/gamertagradio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@gamertagradio</a><span> | Phil Spencer 

On Xbox first party games:

“We love our platform and our hardware but we’re not going to put walls up where people can engage with the great games our studios are building(…)our games will show up in more places, no…</span></p></article></div>



<h2 id="h-why-buy-an-xbox">Why buy an Xbox?</h2>



<p>Listening to the Xbox CEO’s justification, the hosts asked him why gamers should buy an Xbox console since the company seems to be moving away from the concept of exclusives altogether. Phil said:</p>



<p>“<em>I want people to pick hardware based on the capabilities of that hardware and the choices that they want to make about where they want to play. We want our hardware to win based on the capabilities that we have(…)hardware critical and fundamental to what Xbox is – not trying to gatekeep the games off different places</em>“</p>



<h2 id="h-a-magical-year-in-the-making">A magical year in the making</h2>



<p>Like it or not, this is a new era for Xbox. The company’s 2025 promises to be one of the best years in Xbox history, if not the best. With Avowed, DOOM: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, The Outer Worlds 2, and perhaps Fable, the players will be very busy throughout the year.</p>



<p>At the Xbox Developer Direct held this week, we discovered that Xbox Games Publishing is responsible for publishing Ninja Gaiden 4, a game that promises to put the franchise back on top.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/counter-strike-2-makes-surprise-premier-season-2-announcement.1091646/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-2-makes-surprise-premier-season-2-announcement/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Premier Season 2 of Counter-Strike 2 has been officially <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/520829437562848128" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> by Valve, bringing to an end what’s felt like the longest first season of the game’s main competitive mode. When Season 2 begins, a couple new changes to the game’s rifles might shake up the meta.</p>



<p>Full details for Season 2 below.</p>



<h2 id="h-welcome-to-cs2-season-2">Welcome to CS2 Season 2</h2>



<p>With Season 1 coming to an end, active Premier players that earned a rating will “receive a commemorative Premier Season One Medal.” This medal will feature various stats from across the season, including their map distribution, rating history, overall K/D, total multi-kills, and their win/loss record.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The major changes coming to Counter-Strike 2 in Season 2 are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-adds-train-to-map-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Train-Vertigo substitution in the map pool</a>, and changes to the M4A4 and FAMAS. The M4A4 will get a price reduction down to $2900, which matches its silenced counterpart, the M4A1-S. The FAMAS is getting buffs to its standing and crouching accuracy values, as well as a price cut, which should make it an extremely more viable option during half-buy rounds.</p>



<p>When Season 2 begins, player will need to win 10 matches in Premier in order to refresh their rating. Players will also be able to earn a Premier Season Two Medal, which will have custom colors and bars to represent peak rating and total wins. To be eligible to receive a Premier Season Two Medal, players will have to win 25 matches and have an active rating when the season ends. Season two will end after the BLAST Austin Major, which concludes on June 22.</p>



<p>The only thing missing from the CS2 Premier Season 2 announcement is a start date. Considering how long Season 1 lasted, and given that Season 2 supposedly will end in just 3 months, it has to start sooner rather than later.</p>

This includes the new Winter Tokens event, more auras for the Armored Titan raid, and the addition of Roblox chat in the central 2D lobby.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
There was a brief moment back in 2021 when it seemed like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone might finally be done with his mega-popular farm-life sim - until, that is, update 1.6 was suddenly announced and rapidly took on a life of its own. And now Barone has admitted it's unlikely he'll ever 'definitively close the book' on its development, saying (probably not entirely seriously) he might still be adding things "50 years from now".
</p>
<p>
Stardew Valley was an immediate hit when it released back in 2016, selling over 400K copies in just two weeks. Nearly nine years later, that number has reached the 41m mark, and Barone, somewhat remarkably, has continued to expand the game - most recently in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">last year's 1.6 update</a>, which was originally supposed to be relatively modest in scope when it was announced in 2022, but grew increasingly ambitious as time went on.
</p>
<p>
That's despite Barone having seemingly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-doesnt-know-if-there-will-be-another-update-focused-on-next-game">drawn a line under Stardew Valley's development</a> a year earlier, when he confirmed he'd be focusing his attention on a new game - later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">revealed to be Haunted Chocolatier</a>. But while Barone has now resumed development of his second title following a pause for Stardew Valley's 1.6 update, he's admitted he doesn't think he'll ever necessarily be done with his farming game.
</p>

<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/24/g-s1-44510/the-legacy-and-future-of-the-farming-game-stardew-valley">NPR</a>, Barone revealed that even though he's now been working on Stardew Valley for more than 12 years, "I don't want to definitively say that the book is ever closed, because I think I will always have a desire to come back and maybe add a thing or two. You know, maybe even 50 years from now, I might add something."

That doesn't mean Barone doesn't see a natural end point for the title, however. "I think a game can have too much content," he explained. "And I ultimately want Stardew Valley to be the best game it can be. So if I feel like it's starting to become kind of overwhelmed with content to the point where it's detrimental to the game's entertainment factor, I would stop."
</p>
<p>
And for the time being, at least, it does appear Barone has taken a step back from Stardew Valley following the rather lengthy two-year development of its 1.6 update. As he revealed in December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-hes-back-working-on-next-project-haunted-chocolatier">work has now resumed on Haunted Chocolatier</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Even though Haunted Chocolatier has only been revealed publicly to a tiny degree," he said at the time, "in my own private world it's a special place, and I'm very attached to the characters, themes, and ideas." It does, however, sounds like its release is still some way off, with Baron explaining, "It's going to be a lot of work still, but it's okay, I'm addicted to the grind."

          <p>Nvidia is launching the first volley of RTX 50-series GPUs based on its new Blackwell architecture, starting with the RTX 5090 and working downward from there. The company also appears to be winding down support for a few of its older GPU architectures, according to these <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html">CUDA release notes</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpu-drivers/nvidia-starts-phasing-out-maxwell-pascal-and-volta-gpus-geforce-driver-support-status-unclear">Tom's Hardware</a>.</p>
<p>The release notes say that CUDA support for the Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPU architectures "is considered feature-complete and will be frozen in an upcoming release." While all of these architectures—which collectively cover GeForce GPUs from the old GTX 700 series all the way up through 2016's GTX 1000 series, plus a couple of Quadro and Titan workstation cards—are still currently supported by Nvidia's December Game Ready driver package, the end of new CUDA feature support suggests that these GPUs will eventually be dropped from these driver packages soon.</p>
<p>It's common for Nvidia and AMD to drop support for another batch of architectures all at once every few years; Nvidia last dropped support for older cards <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-drops-kepler-windows-7-8-8.1-support/">in 2021</a>, and AMD dropped support for several prominent GPUs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/amd-pulls-back-on-drivers-for-aging-but-popular-graphics-cards-and-igpus/">in 2023</a>. Both companies maintain a separate driver branch for some of their older cards but releases usually only happen every few months, and they focus on security updates, not on providing new features or performance optimizations for new games.</p>

He dropped out in October 2024 and now Nolfi is writing the movie. </p><p>Despite all the screenwriter changes, documentary filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy is still attached to direct <em>New Jedi Order</em>.

After that, the next <em>Star Wars</em> movie to start shooting will be Shawn Levy’s project—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2023/film/news/star-wars-steven-knight-damon-lindelof-justin-britt-gibson-1235560466/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/star-wars-steven-knight-damon-lindelof-justin-britt-gibson-1235560466/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which got a big shot in the arm earlier this week</a></span> with rumors that Ryan Gosling is joining the cast. </p><p>So it’s very likely that <em>New Jedi Order </em>won’t be available in our galaxy until 2027 at the earliest. And that’s assuming George Nolfi can write a screenplay that Lucasfilm likes. If not, we might see a fifth writer hired to try and get this movie’s script finished and approved. One wonders how much longer Obaid-Chinoy and Ridley will wait around. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A lot of<em> Dragon Ball Super </em>was centered on constantly shifting power dynamics among transformations that cheapened the suspense by simply introducing a random transformation (Super Saiyan Blue Evolved? WTF?). Goku’s an idiot, Gohan is annoyingly nerfed, and Vegeta just keeps losing at everything. This is why <em>Daima</em> is shutting all of that noise up.<br></p><p>In just 15 gorgeously animated episodes, the latest series has returned the <em>Dragon Ball</em> franchise to its roots. Goku’s Super Saiyan transformation used to be a goosebump-inducing rarity that conveyed the legendary status of its power. It’s not until the fifth episode of <em>Daima </em>that Goku briefly goes through the golden transformation to dispatch King Kadan’s soldiers, and he’s only returned to that form a handful of times over the 10 episodes that follow. Instead, the series has prioritized hand-to-hand combat (with a little Power Pole action thrown in) to ground the fantastical feats in some form of reality. The anime also blew everyone’s minds when Vegeta unveiled his Super Saiyan 3 transformation in episode 12 to win the Dragon Ball from Tamagami Number Two. Not only did that one moment completely rewrite a major flaw in the <em>Dragon Ball</em> series (Vegeta really let Kakarot and Gotenks go SSJ3 but not him?), but it let it be known that the <em>Dragon Ball</em> canon was open to revision in <em>Daima</em>.</p><p>The fight choreography is also some of the best the franchise has seen since the masterclass duel Broly had with Goku and Vegeta in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-super-broly-makes-broly-the-hero-and-goku-1831964773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-super-broly-makes-broly-the-hero-and-goku-1831964773"><em>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</em></a></span> movie from 2018. Goku dodging Tamagami Number Three’s ki blasts only to land destabilizing kicks to its legs, and backflipping in midair to avoid Tamagami’s Thor-like hammer from hitting him before breaking the handle with his Power Pole in one move brought literal tears to my eyes. The fights in <em>Daima</em> feel like they have real stakes and aren’t just throwaways in order to fill time and keep people entertained with dazzling ki blasts. </p><p>The story also does a great job of expanding on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-best-episodes-anime-shounen-goku-vegeta-1850605656&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-best-episodes-anime-shounen-goku-vegeta-1850605656"><em>Dragon Ball Z</em></a></span> arcs we love without venturing into the polarizing <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> stories. Let the record show, <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> is wildly underrated, and the Tournament of Power is arguably the greatest story arc in the entire history of <em>Dragon Ball</em>. That being said, Super sometimes delved too deep into the gods controlling everything. The Fused Zamasu vs. Vegito Blue was too astounding for it to be resolved by the newly introduced Zeno, god of all, simply wiping the baddie from existence. <em>Dragon Ball Daima</em> starting right after the fan-favorite Buu saga and expanding upon that without negating what happened in it has been exceptionally done.</p><p>Sure, Goku’s still an idiot and not as stoic as he was when facing off against Cell or Frieza in <em>Dragon Ball Z.</em> Most of the episodes focus more on exploration than fighting. But with the introduction of compelling characters like Glorio, Dr. Arinsu, and Panzy, the trips around the newly explored Demon Worlds feel less like a chore and more like excavations into a <em>Dragon Ball</em> past that was right under our noses the entire time. We may only have one more month left of <em>Daima</em> before its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-daima-finale-hulu-remove/#:~:text=This%20was%20the%20first%20official,be%2020%20episodes%20in%20length.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-daima-finale-hulu-remove/#:~:text=This%20was%20the%20first%20official,be%2020%20episodes%20in%20length." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">season finale</a></span>, so I implore all of you, lovers and haters alike, to have an honest watch of this fantastic series, and then take an honest look in the mirror, because it’s time to admit <em>Daima</em> is exactly what the <em>Dragon Ball </em>franchise needed and deserved. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/quartz-ai-articles-go-media<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, several staffers at G/O Media (which previously employed all of us here at Aftermath) pointed out the proliferation of AI-generated articles on news site Quartz. Written in a style that would get a high school “introduction to writing” student a B for effort, they… I can’t even think of a good way to sum them up, the whole thing just sucks.</p><p>As of publishing, the “<a href="https://qz.com/author/quartz-intelligence-newsroom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quartz Intelligence Newsroom</a>” has written 22 articles today, running the gamut from earnings reports to Reddit communities banning Twitter posts to the Sackler settlement to, delightfully, a couple articles about how much AI sucks. Quartz has been running AI-generated articles for months, but prior to yesterday, they appear to have been limited to summaries of earnings reports rather than news articles. Boilerplate at the bottom of these articles notes that “This is the first phase of an experimental new version of reporting. While we strive for accuracy and timeliness, due to the experimental nature of this technology we cannot guarantee that we’ll always be successful in that regard.”</p><figure><figcaption>Quartz</figcaption></figure><p>The articles, to their credit, do cite where the AI is gathering its information from. But even this is surface level: the <a href="https://qz.com/elon-musk-nazi-salute-hand-gesture-reddit-x-twitter-1851746934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit </a>article, for instance, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lgj3icyeo22i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cites </a>Yahoo and the New York Post, but the Yahoo post is actually a repub from the Daytona Beach News-Journal, and the Post article cites NBC News as its own source. I cannot imagine how this game of telephone could go wrong, especially when letting a robot write news about contentious public figures and rapidly changing events.</p><p>G/O previously experimented with AI-generated articles back in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/8/23788162/gizmodo-g-o-media-ai-generated-articles-star-wars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023</a>, most memorably producing a chronological list of <em>Star Wars</em> entries that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230706053620/https://gizmodo.com/a-chronological-list-of-star-wars-movies-tv-shows-1850592566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t chronological</a>, and a bunch of <a href="https://defector.com/go-media-bot-blogs-may-be-unreadable-but-at-least-theyre-incorrect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">garbage</a> on The AV Club and Deadspin. None of these sites are owned by G/O anymore; Quartz is one of three sites that are still standing, as well as commerce site The Inventory. Of those remaining sites, Kotaku saw layoffs back in <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-layoffs-go-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November</a>, and The Root recently made the news when, following the death of a writer, the site’s deputy editor <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/01/08/2025/root-writers-pressed-to-write-more-to-offset-colleagues-death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked staffers to write more to compensate</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of which makes Quartz’s use of AI just more proof–not that you need it–of how little G/O cares about the people who work there, and how little it thinks of its audience’s intelligence. (What self-respecting reader <em>wouldn’t</em> feel their knowledge of the world had been enriched after reading a <a href="https://qz.com/google-uk-fake-reviews-1851747419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">line</a> like “By focusing on the elimination of fake reviews, both entities aim to bolster the integrity of the digital marketplace, thereby preserving consumer trust and ensuring fair competition among businesses.”?)&nbsp;</p><p>While I at first vainly attempted to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lgj3cutphs2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parse</a> the logic behind this, one interpretation is that news stories have the best potential to generate traffic, which could pave the way for G/O to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lgj3jcrhk22d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tout increased traffic numbers</a> to potential buyers and show off the power of its AI technology in the process. As long as a buyer doesn’t look too closely at the actual AI-generated articles, or pay any attention to the response to them (easy to do now that G/O sites no longer have comments), they could fall for the con. </p><p>Anyone tricked into reading this slop (which I suppose now also includes me, hate-reading it), is just helping Jim Spanfeller and his cronies continue destroying a once-beloved network in the most embarrassing way possible. But hey, to quote <a href="https://qz.com/meta-stock-price-target-analysts-mark-zuckerberg-ai-1851747648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an AI article</a> that went up as I was writing this, “The strategic focus on AI by Zuckerberg is poised to potentially influence investor sentiment and may further enhance Meta’s competitive edge.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/oscars-emilia-perez-on-cinema-tim-heidecker"><h3>Stop Watching The Oscars</h3></a><p>They're bad, and you don't have to.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s right, it’s Christmas for Tinseltown, the Academy Awards! Another dogshit year where the worst movie you’ve ever seen is likely to sweep the show, leaving you with your head in your hands as you overlook your cheese plate.</p><p>I stopped watching the Oscars a couple years ago. I used to make a <em>huge</em> deal out of it, inviting people over and making a spread of hors d'oeuvres. After many years of disappointments, I learned to stop giving a fuck. Now each year on Oscar night, I watch the <em>On Cinema, At The Cinema</em> Oscar special instead of the award ceremony. This live comedy special takes place on the same night as the Oscars every year and is the culmination of each season of <em>On Cinema, At The Cinema</em>, a comedy web show produced by and starring Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington. I’ve <a href="https://kotaku.com/on-cinema-is-funny-because-its-about-everything-but-cin-1838970609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sung the praises of this bizarre program</a> many, many times, but the main appeal is that Heidecker and Turkington express the same level of disdain for the Hollywood establishment that I also have. Their Oscar special has the same level of respect for cinema that Academy voters have, which is to say not much at all. At least Heidecker and Turkington are funny.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Oscar Medley | On Cinema 4th Annual LIVE Oscar Special | Adult Swim" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lei2iNKSeeg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>On this week’s pod, Chris and I spent a lot of time talking about this year’s Oscar frontrunner, <em>Emilia Perez</em>. Despite looking like absolute dookie, this film has been nominated for 13 awards including Best Picture. You may know the film from a bizarre excerpt that keeps going viral where Zoe Saldana sings badly about sex change operations. Yes, that’s right—this movie is about trans people, starring a trans actress, but <a href="https://glaad.org/emilia-perez-is-not-good-trans-representation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a way that feels incredibly transphobic</a>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Zoe Saldaña - La Vaginoplastia (From Emilia Pérez Oscar Nominee - Best Picture)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kaChl7eJoEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Chris and I just about lost our minds talking about this stupid fucking movie and the inevitability of it winning Best Picture. If you don’t work in media and are similarly dreading this future, just watch the On Cinema, At the Cinema Oscar Special instead. You will simply have a better time.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>,<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.

<p>Activision has just revealed that DreamHack Dallas will serve as the staging ground for the Call of Duty League Major IV tournament. This grand event will unravel between May 23 – 25 at the Kay Bailey Hutchinson Convention Center in Dallas, Texas.</p>



<p>Not only that, but the team has confirmed that DH Dallas will play host to a Challengers Open. This is great news for those competing in the tier <strong>below </strong>the Call of Duty League, as the Challengers circuit has felt a little overlooked in recent months.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-major-first">Major First</h2>



<p>In a statement posted on the Call of Duty blog, Daniel Tsay, the GM of COD Esports at Activision, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re excited to bring Major IV to DreamHack for the first time in Call of Duty League history.</p>



<p>An event at DreamHack will allow our fans to enjoy this iconic celebration of gaming and esports, and also provide new fans the experience of competitive Call of Duty live.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans are excited to see the return of Challengers Opens through 2025. Presently, three have been lined up for the year ahead, with the first one taking place at Major II in Texas. The only CDL Major this year to <strong>not </strong>have any Challengers events will be the upcoming Major I, set to take place next week in Madrid.</p>



<p>Every <a href="https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/news/2025-season-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Challengers Open event</a> will go hand-in-hand with a $100,000 prize pool, with $40,000 being reserved for the first-place team.</p>



<p>This season is one of many firsts in the CDL. Not only do we have the first EU Major in Call of Duty League history, but we now have the first CDL Major to take place at a DreamHack event.</p>



<p>If you’re not in the know, DreamHack represents one of the most well-known and prolific gaming and esports ecosystems in the world. This historic event dates back to 1994, and in the last 30 years, it has travelled the world and played host to many top-tier tournaments.</p>



<p>Last year, the Overwatch Champions Series World Finals event was held at DreamHack Stockholm.</p>

      <div><p>Steamforged Games recently launched their crowdfunding campaign for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hearts-of-iron-board-game-brings-complex-ww2-grand-strategy-to-tables" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Hearts of Iron</em> board game</a> Gamefound. The tabletop adaptation of Paradox Interactive's beloved military strategy game has completely overtaken its funding goal, reaching it 13 minutes after going live.</p>

<h2>The Hearts of Iron Board Game Gamefound Campaign</h2>

<p>As the <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/steamforged-games/hearts-of-iron-board-game?refcode=v1JUB3G5fUmqA6iMaMS28g#/section/project-story" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> states, the <em>Hearts of Iron</em> board game allows players to re-enact major events during World War II. Two to five players can take on the role of the Allies or Axis powers. Players must manage resources, make political alliances, and keep their nation stable while maintaining political and military strength.</p>

Each copy of the game contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>45 Infantry Units (8 UK, 9 German, 9 French, 9 Italian, and 10 Soviet)</li>
	<li>35 Tank Units (5 UK, 7 German, 6 French, 5, Italian, and 7 Soviet)</li>
	<li>19 Ship Units (5 UK, 3 German, 4 French, 4 Italian, and 3 Soviet)</li>
	<li>26 Plane Units (6 UK, 5 German, 5 French, 6 Italian, and 4 Soviet)</li>
	<li>15 General Standees (3 UK, 3 German, 3 French, 3 Italian, and 3 Soviet)</li>

	<li>100+ Research Cards</li>
	<li>Several Game Boards: 1 Game Board, 1 Political Board, 11 Ideology Boards, 5 Nation Boards.)</li>
</ul><p>If you want a (slightly) more compact version of the game, the standard edition only contains tokens and standees, which can be backed for $65. For those who want a more comprehensive experience with plastic miniatures, the Gamefound-exclusive Special Edition will cost you $120. Also, gameplay expansions are included at certain pledge levels, letting players add the nations of Spain and Sweden to the game.</p>

<p>At the end of 2022, VALORANT’s biggest star and hottest free agent was Jaccob “yay” Whiteaker. Arguably the best player during pro VALORANT’s Chamber meta, yay converted his electric season with OpTic Gaming, which included a trophy at Masters Reykjavík, into <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/valorant/cloud9-set-to-sign-valorant-star-yay-from-optic-gaming-report-says-1943658/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a major deal with Cloud9</a> at the start of the partnership era.</p>



<p>What followed yay’s terrific tenure with OpTic was a two year odyssey of setbacks and losing. Yay was dropped from Cloud9 after two matches, with the organization citing “role issues.” Yay played seven matches with Disguised, a tier two NA VALORANT team owned by streamer Disguised Toast, losing all seven matches. He then went across the world to BLEED Esports in the VCT Pacific league, winning just one match in eight matches played.</p>



<p>Yay now finds himself on Evil Geniuses, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eg-coach-potter-says-yay-has-to-prove-hes-not-a-chamber-main/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“a place where every player ends up not by choice,” according to the team’s world champion coach Christine “potter” Chi</a>. After EG defeated FURIA at the VCT 2025 Americas Kickoff, yay’s first win in the Americas league ever, the reborn VALORANT star spoke to Insider Gaming about his new agent pool, his “back” status, and how he’s grown during his tumultuous journey.</p>



<hr>



<p>The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</p>



<p><strong>IG: Astra isn’t really an agent that utilizes the Operator very much, but you couldn’t tell by watching your performance today. Do you feel like the best version of yourself is the one that has the Op in your hands?</strong></p>



<p>I would say…yes and no? That’s tough to be honest. I would say my rifle is almost equally as good as my Op. That’s one of my strengths as a player throughout my whole career: I’m able to do both very well. I feel like I can pick up anything to be honest with you.</p>



<p>The Operator is really strong on Abyss in general, and [using it with Astra] is something that potter recommended. Since I’m able to place smokes from anywhere on the map, it’s good to have it in my hands so we can let Icy entry, and then I can just hold anything.</p>



<p><strong>IG: This is the question that everyone has been asking: is yay back?</strong></p>



<p>[Laughs] I would say not yet, but I think as we continue to progress as a team and I continue to work on certain things, I will fully regrow that confidence. This was a big step; getting another win on the board.</p>



<p><strong>IG: What’s the highest level of “back” you think you can reach? Are we talking OpTic yay?</strong></p>



<p>That was a very unique situation in which I was on Chamber for an extended period. I like to believe I [still] have a very high ceiling that extends well beyond Chamber and that whole meta, but I think I need to build more confidence with that. You won’t see the same yay, but you’ll hopefully see something similar [with] a new style. And hopefully some championships as well.</p>

<p><strong>IG: What do you want to accomplish this year?</strong></p>



<p>I would really like to make another international event, at bare minimum. And rebuild a lot of the self confidence I used to have. I think I’m pretty much there, but now it’s about proving it to myself at this point.</p>



<p><strong>IG: You’ve mentioned getting your confidence back a few times now. How badly did those two years away mess with you, personally and on the server?</strong></p>



<p>It was a pretty rough period. It’s a very hard feeling to describe to someone, because you go from the very peak [of VALORANT] to not being able to flat out win anything. It’s something that throughout my entire pro career, even extending back to other games, I’ve never experienced before in my life. To go from such high highs to low lows in such a short time frame, it takes a toll on you, and I’m not gonna pretend that it didn’t.</p>



<p>But I think I’ve done a pretty good job of figuring out and working through that, and I’m excited for the future.</p>



<p><strong>IG: Is that experience something you’re trying to learn from, or one that rather just forget about entirely?</strong></p>



<p>You take what you can from that situation. There’s some things I learned in terms of just being a better human being. Like not relying so much on the results of what’s going on around. For a long period, what defined me was VALORANT, and when results aren’t going well, you feel very bad about yourself.</p>



<p><strong>IG: What’s the most important thing you’ve learned on this big journey?</strong></p>



<p>I’ve learned how to deal with expectations. I put a lot of stock into what the community or what other people thought of me. I’ve learned to realize that what the outside world thinks of you doesn’t really reflect who you are. It’s [more] important to realize what’s important to you and what you stand for. And if I do need to fix something or change I have people I can rely on for that.</p>

                <p>Not every player can experience video games in the same way, especially if they have impairments. That's why Ubisoft is laying out the accessibility options that are included in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which may open some doors for players who might otherwise feel excluded. </p><p>One of the key additions to Shadows is that the cinematics will have audio descriptions available, which will be a first for the series. According to UX Director <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/1Y0Q8goho9gJzCV2UBjyUJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jonathan Bedard</a>, that feature helped him realize that it could convey the depth and emotions of Shadows in an unexpected way.</p><p>"It... made me happy to see an initiative coming from the team's passion and making its way into the game," said Bedard.

<section><p>Xbox's latest Developer Direct highlights what makes the company's showcases stand out: its developers.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Long before I was a Games Journalist™ and thus required to watch just about every video game showcase, conference, and direct for my job, I was an eager video game fan doing the exact same thing but without, you know, a professional obligation. Regardless of whether these events required me to rise well before the sun (looking at you, Nintendo), for well over a decade I've been there, buzzing with excitement and ready to preorder things I certainly did not need.</p><p dir="ltr">Chances are that if you're reading this, you too enjoy watching these events. Though you'd be correct in calling what's shown at these conferences glorified commercials, I've often thought of it as us gamers getting our own little "Super Bowl commercial celebration" every month or so, which is pretty neat if you ask me.</p><p dir="ltr">Over the years of partaking in these often-solo watch parties, I've come to associate and expect certain things from certain studios and publishers. Devolver will always offer up a somewhat convoluted but high-value production that leans into the absurd, while Wholesome Direct pairs pastels with short-and-sweet sizzle reels, giving each one of the many indie games it's highlighting a brief time to shine. Of the "big three" video game companies--PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo--Nintendo was the first, in my eyes, to really cultivate a strong, public facing identity. If it ever does away with its quirky voiceovers and charming segues, I'd be heartbroken, to say the least.</p><p dir="ltr">PlayStation, I'd then argue, was the second. When PlayStation comes to play, you know you are getting far more action than talk. Though its State of Plays <em>might </em>feature someone in a suit saying a few words between trailers, the company largely does not indulge in bells and whistles. Instead, you get trailer after trailer, with the company's narrative-heavy prize jewels getting ample screentime. I get this approach and admire it: Sometimes we really should just let the games speak for themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">And that leaves us with Xbox. In more ways than one, Xbox has struggled with an identity problem for years. Is it the catalog of first-person shooters and multiplayer titles that makes it appealing? Should we see it more as a home entertainment ecosystem? Is it the fact that the console now allows you to play in a variety of ways--including not on the actual consoles--that sets it apart? Does the company's greater emphasis on accessibility make it the best way to play? <em>Is </em>Game Pass truly the best value in gaming and a major selling point?</p><p dir="ltr">To be clear, this isn't a dig at Xbox. I think it's wondrous to be ambitious, well-rounded, and ever-changing--the current media and entertainment landscape demands it. But for a while, this led to the company not having a very clear identity. However, Xbox's latest Developer Direct got me thinking about how far the company has come and how, over the past few years, it's made great strides towards establishing a much-welcomed identity.</p><p dir="ltr">For the past few years, Xbox has been all about one thing in particular: the developers. Some of this, of course, has manifested in ways that I don't particularly love, as both Xbox <em>and </em>PlayStation have been quick to identify and acquire seemingly any studio willing to sell. But whereas PlayStation outwardly focuses more on the games and franchises they are acquiring, Xbox feels quicker to highlight the studios and teams.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4433703-4399828-head.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4433703" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4433703-4399828-head.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4433703"></a><figcaption>A still of Hazel from South of Midnight</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4433703-4399828-head.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-all-the-big-announcements/2900-6159/">January 2025 Developer Direct</a>, Xbox spent close to an hour highlighting just five games: Ninja Gaiden 4, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, South of Midnight, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-an-action-packed-slick-new-turn-based-rpg-revealed-at-xbox-showcase/1100-6524081/" data-ref-id="1100-6524081">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. The company provided plenty of gameplay, allowing unfamiliar but interested audience members a chance to see what they were about, and kept the time spent on each game remarkably equal, despite certain titles having more mainstream awareness. But even more compelling to me was how they gave the studios behind these games ample time to actually talk about themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">As someone who is all about dark fantasy and gothic vibes, getting to hear the team behind South of Midnight wax poetic about these topics, and express their reverence for the American Deep South's folklore, was delightful. Though Clair Obscura's turn-based combat lends itself to JRPG comparisons, it was interesting to hear that the team's decision to structure its RPG as such was born out of a deep attachment to the genre and their longing to make something that combined it with their own sensibilities and culture. And id Software--the studio behind Doom--focused on the company's legacy and how they are incorporating the series' staples, such as fast-paced action and metal music, alongside additions like new medieval-style weapons and the ability to control a mech. Lastly, as someone who, for some wild reason, has yet to play the Ninja Gaiden series, I appreciated hearing the developers explain the game's world and what pairing up with Platinum Games means for Team Ninja.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox has said time and time again that it is focused on supporting developers it acquires, not assimilating them into its own ecosystem and way of play. Unfortunately, we have seen the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">not always stick to this</a>, as it shuttered Arkane Austin, Alpha Dog Studios, Tango Gameworks, and Roundhouse Games just last year--it would frankly be disingenuous to not point this out and express my disappointment in this. However, this showcase still means a great deal to me and makes me hopeful that these closures will happen less and less going forward: that they will learn how to properly support studios and prevent what even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-reacts-to-redfalls-bad-reviews-explained-what-went-wrong/1100-6513812/">Phil Spencer noted</a> was a failure on the company's part to properly aid developers in executing their vision.</p><p dir="ltr">Another part of why this is so important to me right now is because I firmly believe we are dealing with a large-scale dehumanization crisis. I recently saw <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alexaray.bsky.social/post/3lgbksuapq22k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a BlueSky post</a> that really resonated with me, that essentially said that, because games are becoming increasingly affiliated with the tech sector, they are being treated in a more capitalistic way rather than as art. It's plain to see, with one example of this being how many studios are instructed to follow certain trends--such as live-service games--rather than play to the strength of the developer.</p><p dir="ltr">Games are growing larger, more jam-packed, and more technologically impressive than ever before. But are we willing to sacrifice artistic vision and personality for that? This, alongside the push for greater AI usage in ways more ethically questionable than ever before, has me feeling that, in spite of certain game's grand scale and presentation, we are somewhat regressing. When developers are being laid off left and right, and when those who remain's voices feel silenced while others accept accolades off-screen, I can't help but be irked by the way the people who make games are all too often forgotten or dismissed.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox is by no means a perfect company. To be clear, none of these companies are. However, I do have admiration for the way it is tackling its showcases with more humanity and emphasis on developers. It is a trend I hope other studios, big and small, follow, lest we lose the innovation, humanity, and magic that makes my favorite hobby so incredibly special.</p>

That’s roughly eight heroes a year, and that means <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ roster could be nearly twice the size it is now in just a few short years. How does NetEase plan to do that? </p><p>Well, from the looks of it, the studio has dozens already in the pipeline. Leakers and dataminers have been reporting that file names already in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ code reference several characters who are likely in the works. Some of them are popular heroes I’m surprised aren’t in the game already, but other, more obscure characters might be making their way to the hero shooter in the coming months or even years as well. </p><p>It’s worth noting that there’s some dispute about how legitimate some of the leaks are, as some leakers are claiming a few of these names might be heroes NetEase actually has no plans to bring to the game<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Saulman11835779/status/1882506889562583539&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Saulman11835779/status/1882506889562583539" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> but instead were leaked by the company or planted in the code</a></span> to throw fans and dataminers off the scent, a claim which has other leakers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1882561140049269227&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1882561140049269227" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting the code for several heroes they claim are in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ files</a></span> to add legitimacy to their findings.

She’s a swordswoman so I imagine she’ll land in either Vanguard or Duelist.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="76df9179d75a3256939824bbee7a2659" data-recommend-id="image://76df9179d75a3256939824bbee7a2659" data-format="jpg" data-width="1421" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beast is shown wearing a lab coat and glasses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Beast is shown wearing a lab coat and glasses." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="76df9179d75a3256939824bbee7a2659" data-recommend-id="image://76df9179d75a3256939824bbee7a2659" data-format="jpg" data-width="1421" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beast is shown wearing a lab coat and glasses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Hank McCoy is one of many X-Men who have been leaked for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1882027636802646492&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1882027636802646492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roughly translated, his leaked abilities</a></span> include “Field Experiment,” “Intelligence Analysis,” and something called “Dexterity,” which, taken together, make it sound like he might be a more strategic character.

He can shoot lasers from his eyes. That’s why he’s got those cool shades on indoors and in the middle of the night. But I’m curious to see how NetEase rounds out his kit when he mostly just blows holes in the side of things by looking in their direction. This is an easy Duelist character.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d091f7fc21a60f69d689033e60e3d161" data-recommend-id="image://d091f7fc21a60f69d689033e60e3d161" data-format="jpg" data-width="1428" data-height="804" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool stands in a TVA office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Deadpool stands in a TVA office." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d091f7fc21a60f69d689033e60e3d161" data-recommend-id="image://d091f7fc21a60f69d689033e60e3d161" data-format="jpg" data-width="1428" data-height="804" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool stands in a TVA office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Wade Wilson, the foul-mouthed, fourth-wall-breaking gunslinger, was one of the more surprising omissions from <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ launch roster, but it sounds like NetEase is bringing him into the fold in a future update. While he will likely have some sustainability given one of his abilities is a healing factor so strong he can’t die, I can’t see him being anything other than a hyperviolent Duelist capable of bringing absolute chaos and destruction to the battlefield with his firearms and swords.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8b18e4cf15dceb4ec439531152d54f8f" data-recommend-id="image://8b18e4cf15dceb4ec439531152d54f8f" data-format="jpg" data-width="867" data-height="512" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emma Frost is shown in her diamond form as Sebastian Shaw stands beside her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Emma Frost is shown in her diamond form as Sebastian Shaw stands beside her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8b18e4cf15dceb4ec439531152d54f8f" data-recommend-id="image://8b18e4cf15dceb4ec439531152d54f8f" data-format="jpg" data-width="867" data-height="512" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emma Frost is shown in her diamond form as Sebastian Shaw stands beside her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The telepathic mutant Emma Frost has been long-rumored as a Vanguard due to her diamond form, which allows her to become essentially indestructible. I could see her using this to resist any incoming damage for a brief period of time, allowing her to safely disrupt the enemy team without risking herself. Her psychic powers could also give her some decent crowd control abilities that let her do some damage as she protects herself and others.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="27927f2945eb90cbc1f23d1ba2a7015c" data-recommend-id="image://27927f2945eb90cbc1f23d1ba2a7015c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2043" data-height="1147" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gambit looks at something off-screen while holding a playing card in his fingers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gambit looks at something off-screen while holding a playing card in his fingers." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="27927f2945eb90cbc1f23d1ba2a7015c" data-recommend-id="image://27927f2945eb90cbc1f23d1ba2a7015c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2043" data-height="1147" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gambit looks at something off-screen while holding a playing card in his fingers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There sure are a lot of mutants on this list, huh?

<p>Despite the continued rise of VALORANT and the post-release energy surrounding Counter-Strike 2, the most watched esport in the world is still League of Legends, and it’s not really that close. The MOBA that serves as Riot Games’ foundation nearly doubled the amount of total hours watched from the second most watched title of 2024.</p>



<hr>







<p>According to <a href="https://escharts.com/news/top-esports-games-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a> from Esports Charts, fans watched 749.6 million hours of League of Legends esports events in 2024, up 27% from the year before. The 2024 World Championships, known commonly as Worlds 2024, unsurprisingly was the biggest event of the year. Worlds 2024 accumulated over 190 million hours watched, accounting for over a quarter of League esports hours watched all year. The event peaked during its grand finals, with a record 6,856,769 viewers tuning in to watch <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-2024-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">T1 and the legendary Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok win their fifth Worlds event</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Trailing behind League of Legends is the mobile-based MOBA, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, which is wildly popular in Southeast Asia. In third place is Counter-Strike 2, followed by VALORANT, and then Dota 2 in fifth place. 2024 represents the first time that VALORANT has surpassed Dota 2 in total hours watched. While the Dota 2 scene suffered due to the discontinuing of the Dota Pro Circuit, VALORANT continued to grow internationally.</p>



<p>Esports Charts’ data doesn’t track viewership from Chinese livestreaming platforms though, due to “the unreliability of the reported statistics and lack of transparency in regards to how they are calculated.” But it’s clear that China is a massive priority for the top performing games. VALORANT expanded with the VCT China League in 2024, and also saw the first Chinese team, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/edward-gaming-wins-valorant-champions-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EDward Gaming, win its world championship</a>. For the first time in Counter-Strike’s illustrious history, a Major was held in Shanghai, where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Spirit lifted the trophy</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A few years ago, most big AAA games cost $60. Then came the price hikes, with game after game launching at $70. Now this week, we’re hearing increasing discussion of 2025’s most anticipated game, Grand Theft Auto 6, potentially costing not $70, not $80, or even $90…but $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could it really?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion of a $100 GTA 6 technically comes from Epyllion CEO and analyst Matthew Ball in a <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lengthy presentation on the state of gaming in 2025</u></a> published last week. Near <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-price-many-in-the-video-game-industry-hope-for-80-if-not-100-analyst-says"><u>the end of the presentation</u></a>, Ball says that “some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80 to $100, breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to do $70, $70 to $80 etc."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Packaged game prices have never been lower in real terms than they are today — even though budgets are at all-time highs and player growth is stalled,” Ball writes. “GTA 6 could re-establish packed video game prices after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ball’s report doesn’t make the direct claim that GTA 6 will cost $100, only that some game makers are hoping it will cost somewhere around that much. However, the mere suggestion sparked significant discussion on social media as to whether or not it was possible or advisable for GTA 6 to cost that much, and whether doing so would really help the industry…or GTA for that matter. So I reached out to some other analysts for their takes on the notion. And they had…thoughts.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Could GTA 6 Actually Cost $100?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, it could, says Mat Piscatella, analyst at Circana. Anything’s possible, especially for a game as anticipated as GTA 6. But is it a likely, or reasonable outcome? “Probably not.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's just no need,” he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lg4aoaebdc2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote in a post on Bluesky</u></a>. “You want to make the funnel as wide as possible, while also optimizing launch $. You don't do this [by] making the base price of a game so high that the funnel narrows. It just makes no sense. At all.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Joost van Dreunen, NYU Stern professor and author of the SuperJoost newsletter, agreed that a price increase would be a “mistake” for Take-Two and Rockstar, noting that it was unlikely to deviate from what made GTA 5 work out so well for them:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Their success with GTA 5 came partly from their pricing strategy — launching at a standard price point late in the console cycle, then selling another copy to those same players when they upgraded to new consoles,” he said. “They'll likely stick to this proven approach, though they'll definitely offer premium editions with extras at higher price points.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I spoke to five different analysts, all of whom largely agreed that GTA 6 wasn’t going to be priced higher than the usual $70…for the base game, at least. Because both Piscatella and MIDiA’s Rhys Elliott pointed out a critical loophole here: Publishers <em>already are</em> charging $100 for games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Most huge AAA games already charge $100 (sometimes more) in the first 3-7 days before launch, but they call it ‘early access’ and slap ‘collector's edition’ in the name,” he said. “Publishers have hijacked collector’s editions as a way to charge more for ‘early access’ – AKA delayed access for those consumers unwilling to pay the markup.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elliott named a number of publishers using this strategy already, such as WB Games (Hogwarts Legacy), Xbox (Starfield), EA (EA Sports FC 25), and Ubisoft (Star Wars: Outlaws).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But he added that the idea of charging $100 for the “base game” without these extra perks would be “a bridge too far,” even in the case of GTA.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>They’d find success either way.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“They’d find success either way,” he said. “GTA 6 is going to be a cultural phenomenon and could bear a $100 price point, but player backlash would be significant, and that would be a short-term gain at a long-term cost. Maximizing day-one premium revenues and giving mass consumers sticker shock is not the play here, especially in today’s economy. And while many gamers will play through GTA 6’s single-player, online is where the engagement – and recurring revenue spend – happens. It’s where the real revenue comes in. Rockstar would not want to limit its total addressable market there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the major challenges for GTA 6 is convincing players to jump ship from GTA 5’s online component, so creating a needlessly higher switching cost would not be wise here.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How much for GTA Online?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Elliott brings up a critical point here: GTA 5 was a massively successful game, but the thing that really gave it staying power to sell five million copies a quarter for a decade was its online multiplayer playground, GTA Online. Which begs the question: even if GTA 6 is priced at $70, what will its version of GTA Online cost? Will Rockstar and Take-Two really keep it available at no additional cost, as before?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">James McWhirter, senior games analyst at Omdia, thinks so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“GTA Online was key to GTA 5’s ongoing success, driving premium sales and subscription service licensing; a precedent Take-Two is unlikely to disrupt with GTA 6's launch,” he said. “Alternative pricing schemes will likely emerge only after establishing a strong player base for the next-gen GTA Online, which will anchor long-term engagement. The real challenge lies in managing continuity between two live-service GTA Online games. Depending on how Take-Two handles this transition, alternative business models could emerge sooner or later.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 Stills</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elliott largely agrees that the same model as before is most likely, pointing out that both GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 didn’t see the launch of their online modes until shortly after the release of the main game. But he also sees the potential for other possibilities:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While I think we will see something similar for GTA 6 and its online component, I can also see a world where Rockstar launches them completely separately,” he said. “If they did this, they would probably add some online perks into the ‘single-player version’ to nudge players to play online, too. Another possibility is having the core story play out in GTA 6, then adding subsequent story content into the online mode – best of both worlds, perhaps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As for subscriptions, Rockstar will likely continue what it set out with GTA+, perhaps adding a battle pass to complement as well.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Five Million a Quarter</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve covered Take-Two’s earnings calls for several years running now, and inevitably every single quarter in my memory, they’ve managed to sell five million more copies of GTA 5 while making piles of money off GTA Online as well despite the game being over a decade old now. It’s difficult to imagine any other game ever matching or exceeding that level of success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if any game can, it’s GTA 6, seemingly without the need to upset its players by hiking up base game prices. Assuming GTA 6’s launch cost and plan are roughly the same as GTA 5’s, van Dreunen concluded his response to me with a prediction. It’s one <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/the-joy-of-six" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>he’s made before back in December of 2023</u></a>, but which he stands by now as well: GTA 6 can and will match or exceed the success of GTA 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When GTA 5 launched in 2013, about 29% of console gamers (35 million) purchased a copy,” he said. “Assuming a similar adoption rate among an anticipated 130 million console install base in 2025, GTA 6 could sell around 38 million copies in its first twelve months. At an average selling price of $70, this would generate approximately $2.7 billion through both digital and physical channels, aligning with Take-Two's projected earnings increase for 2025.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If gamemakers are hoping and praying for a $100 GTA or even an $80 one, it sounds like they may have to keep dreaming after all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
