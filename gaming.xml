            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/longdue-hopetown-kickstarter-disco-elysium<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Longdue, a studio made up in part of former&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developers and creative personnel, has launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for its debut project&nbsp;<em>Hopetown</em>.</p>

<p>The studio describes&nbsp;<em>Hopetown&nbsp;</em>as a "psychogeographic RPG" that casts you as an ex-journalist looking to investigate "a town above, the world below, and the depths of your own psyche". So far, so very&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>

<p>As with&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, you'll have the chance to play as you see fit; you can "spark chaos as a gonzo journalist" or "twist events as a conspiracist", sure, but if you prefer to do things in a more straightforward way, you can also "reveal brutal truths as a calculated investigator".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disco-elysium-longdue-hopetown.jpg?itok=bp8U2d4_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disco-elysium-longdue-hopetown.jpg?itok=cG-UqkJJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hopetown&nbsp;</em>is the very&nbsp;<em>Disco Elsyium</em>-esque debut game from Longdue Games.</figcaption></figure><p>True to Longdue's legacy, the studio promises that&nbsp;<em>Hopetown</em>'s "psychogeography system" will replace traditional puzzles and keys with "emotions, memories, and conversations". It sounds rather like if you love&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, you'll want to keep an eye on this as well.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for&nbsp;<em>Hopetown&nbsp;</em>is live now, and at time of writing, it had raised £19,967 of its £25,000 goal (apologies for using UK currency, but I'm a Brit, so it comes with the territory). It's looking fairly likely the game will hit its goal by the end of the day.</p>

<p>Longdue is one of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">a number of studios</a> that formed after original publisher ZA/UM effectively imploded following&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s release. The studio boasts the involvement of ZA/UM co-founder Martin Luiga, who also wrote "seven characters in&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>", according to the studio's website.</p>

<p><em>Kentucky Route Zero&nbsp;</em>co-creator Ben Babbitt and&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>composer Pawel Blaszczak have also joined the team, so it's fair to say Longdue is shaping up to be a real supergroup of developers at this stage.</p>




<p>Although many of ZA/UM's principal creatives have left the studio, the company is still soldiering on. Just last week, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">announced&nbsp;<em>Project C4</em></a>, which it describes as a new "genre-defining" RPG.</p>

<p>ZA/UM also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-mobile-version-tiktok-user" rel="nofollow">unveiled a&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>mobile port</a> last week, which studio head Denis Havel says is aimed at "captivating the TikTok user" with shorter blasts of narrative and gameplay.</p>

Night Shyamalan's best characters together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I don’t blame you if you believe all M. Night Shyamalan movies are just 90-minute setups for a twist you never saw coming (and probably didn’t want to see). I wouldn’t blame you because the man has revealed a child’s closest confidant was actually dead the entire time, the old couple watching a young brother and sister are actually escaped mental patients and not their grandparents, and people are rapidly aging because they’re on an island used for a pharmaceutical experiment. Again, I wouldn’t blame you for seeing Shyamalan as a plot twist merchant, but he would.</p><p>“[A common misperception of me is]<strong>&nbsp;</strong>that all my movies have twist endings, or that they’re all scary. All my movies are spiritual and all have an emotional perspective,” Shyamalan said in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-5minute-interview-m-night-shyamalan-writer-and-director-837413.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-5minute-interview-m-night-shyamalan-writer-and-director-837413.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2008 interview</a></span> with <em>The Independent.</em></p><p>Regardless of what you or the acclaimed director thinks, his twists are his cinematic fingerprint that’s left a lasting impression on the minds of generations of moviegoers. Before he brings his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/m-night-shyamalan-starts-writing-17th-feature-1236088370/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/m-night-shyamalan-starts-writing-17th-feature-1236088370/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17th film to theaters</a></span>, let’s reflect on the twists that annoyed us, shocked us, and left us questioning what the hell we watched. </p></div></div><div><p>Shyamalan has spent his career yanking the rug out from under audiences, so you’d expect <em>Knock at the Cabin</em> to have a mind-blowing twist. A vacationing family is taken hostage by four strangers who claim the world will end unless they sacrifice one of their own, leaving everyone guessing whether it’s real or just madness. Maybe the invaders are delusional, maybe the apocalypse is a hoax, maybe Dave Bautista rips off a mask to reveal he’s been Bruce Willis all along. But no, the twist is that there is no worthwhile twist—turns out, the world really is ending, making the whole movie feel like a magician dramatically pausing for two hours before pulling a rabbit out of a hat.</p></div><div><p>Shyamalan crafts <em>Signs</em> as a slow-burn thriller about a grieving family confronting eerie crop circles and an impending alien invasion, layering suspense with his signature brand of existential dread. Throughout the film, he meticulously seeds clues—flashbacks to the dying wife of Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a seemingly random baseball anecdote, and a child’s peculiar water obsession—all hinting that these small, disconnected moments might hold a greater purpose. Then comes the big reveal: the hyper-intelligent aliens, capable of interstellar travel, are inexplicably vulnerable to water, making Earth the worst possible planet to invade. It’s the cinematic equivalent of a chess grandmaster brooding over a game for hours, only to knock over his own king and claim it was all part of the plan.</p></div><div><p>   <em>Lady in the Water</em> is a whimsical bedtime story awkwardly wedged into a supernatural thriller. Following an apartment superintendent who discovers a mysterious woman in his pool and learns she is part of an ancient prophecy, the film layers intrigue by assigning each quirky tenant a mythical role, suggesting that fate has intricately woven them into a grand, predestined purpose. But when the truth is revealed, it turns out their assigned roles were misinterpreted, forcing a last-minute reshuffling of expectations that feels more like a narrative prank than a satisfying twist. It’s as if the film spent its runtime promising an elegant magic trick, only to clumsily drop the deck of cards and insist that was the trick all along. </p></div><div><p>Alright, so <em>The Village</em> is basically a super moody thriller in which this small, old-timey community is living in constant fear of monsters lurking in the woods. Everything is all eerie warnings, weird color-coded rules, and elders acting <em>way</em> too suspicious, so you just <em>know</em> something fishy is going on. Then Shyamalan hopes you’re blown away by the reveal of it actually not being the 1800s, but rather modern day, and the “monsters” are just the elders dressing up to keep everyone from leaving. It’s a wild idea that <em>sounds</em> cool, but once you think about it for more than five minutes, it’s kind of like realizing your favorite scary story has a plot hole the size of a barn.</p></div><div><p>At one point in <em>The Happening</em>, Mark Wahlberg has a full-blown conversation with a plastic plant, trying to reason with it like they’re in a hostage situation. That’s the sort of tension-building filmmaking you can expect from a movie that’s basically a paranoid road trip thriller in which people start randomly killing themselves, and a group of survivors—including Wahlberg as a nervous science teacher—scramble to escape whatever unseen force is causing the chaos. Everything is all eerie deserted towns, cryptic warnings about nature, and people running from the wind, so you just know the twist is going to be completely bonkers. At first,  finding out it’s the plants waging war on humanity, releasing airborne toxins that hijack people’s survival instincts and turn them into their own worst enemies, was laughable. But in a world where environmental disasters keep getting weirder, the idea of nature quietly wiping us out without us even realizing it is actually kind of terrifying. </p></div><div><p><em>Old</em> sits at a middling Rotten Tomatoes score that would’ve been even worse without an all-time Shyamalan twist, a last-minute reveal that transforms a goofy, sun-soaked thriller about people aging at hyper-speed into something far more sinister. The setup is classic Shyamalan, with cryptic dialogue, eerie medical foreshadowing, and characters throwing out theories ranging from supernatural curses to government experiments, all while their bodies betray them in real time. Then comes the big reveal: the beach isn’t just some random anomaly—it’s a controlled testing ground where a pharmaceutical company fast-forwards human lives to trial experimental drugs in a single day. And sure, it’s wild, but the way Shyamalan unspools the mystery—drip-feeding clues through unnatural dialogue, disorienting time jumps, and the sheer horror of watching life slip away in fast-forward—makes the twist land with an exhilarating mix of shock and awe.</p></div><div><p><em>The Visit</em> is one of Shyamalan’s best movies ever, anchored by an all-time Shyamalan twist that transforms a seemingly lighthearted found-footage horror movie about eccentric grandparents into a full-blown nightmare. From the start, the weird old-people behavior, unsettling house rules, and eerie late-night noises make it clear that something is seriously wrong beneath the surface. I would love to once again feel the shock I felt the first time I encountered this movie’s twist: the “grandparents” aren’t grandparents at all, but escaped mental patients who killed the real couple and have been impersonating them the whole time. It’s an absolutely insane twist, but what makes it so good is how Shyamalan keeps you ever so slightly off-balance the entire movie—one minute you’re laughing at their weird quirks, the next you’re questioning if something’s really wrong, and then suddenly, everything turns horrifying in an instant. It’s Shyamalan at his best, flipping the whole movie on its head in a way that’s both shocking and completely brilliant.</p></div><div><p><em>Glass</em> is the culmination of Shyamalan’s best franchise, a grounded yet extraordinary superhero saga filled with some of his greatest twists, bringing together the unbreakable David Dunn (Bruce Willis), the fractured Horde (James McAvoy), and the mastermind Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) in an ultimate showdown. From the start, the film builds toward an epic, city-wide battle, teasing a grand superhero clash while subtly planting the seeds of something far more sinister lurking beneath the surface. When it’s finally revealed that a secret society has been working in the shadows for centuries to suppress super-powered individuals, the entire movie recontextualizes itself—not as a superhero origin story, but as a conspiracy thriller in which the real villains are the ones pulling the strings from the very beginning. It’s a bold and subversive twist, the kind that blindsides you yet feels inevitable in retrospect, proving once again that Shyamalan’s greatest trick isn’t just shocking audiences—it’s making them question everything they thought they knew.</p></div><div><p><em>Split</em> is Shyamalan’s most disturbing film, a psychological horror-thriller that traps audiences inside the fractured mind of Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), a man with 23 personalities, one of whom—the monstrous Beast—is preparing to emerge. The film subtly hints at something larger than Kevin’s disorder, using whispers of his past trauma, his seemingly superhuman resilience, and an eerie sense that his story is part of something much bigger. When Bruce Willis’ David Dunn shows up in the final scene, confirming that <em>Split</em> is secretly a sequel to <em>Unbreakable</em>, the entire film shifts from a self-contained thriller to a groundbreaking expansion of Shyamalan’s own superhero mythology. It’s a masterstroke of storytelling, a twist so unexpected yet seamlessly woven into the narrative that it doesn’t just change <em>Split</em>—it changes the way we see <em>Unbreakable</em>, proving Shyamalan’s ability to surprise is as sharp as ever.</p></div><div><p><em>Unbreakable</em> is the foundation of Shyamalan’s best franchise, a meticulously crafted deconstruction of superhero mythology disguised as a psychological thriller. With haunting precision, it follows David Dunn (Bruce Willis), the lone survivor of a catastrophic train crash, as he gradually uncovers his extraordinary abilities under the guidance of the enigmatic Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson). The film masterfully builds tension, transforming seemingly ordinary moments into revelations, all while unraveling a story about fate, power, and belief. By the time David fully embraces his role, the film delivers its stunning twist—Elijah, his supposed mentor, is in fact the orchestrator of countless tragedies, including the train crash itself, all in a desperate bid to find someone like him.</p><p>It’s a genius reversal that not only recasts Elijah as a villain but reframes the entire movie as his origin story, making the audience realize they were witnessing the rise of Mr. Glass all along.</p></div><div><p><em>The Sixth Sense</em> is the film that launched M. Night Shyamalan into the spotlight, delivering a masterfully crafted thriller with a twist that has endured in popular culture for over two decades. From the opening moments, the film builds an atmosphere of quiet sorrow, following Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) as he tries to help a boy who claims to see ghosts, all while subtly layering in clues that something is deeply wrong. Every seemingly mundane interaction, every lingering silence, and every emotional beat carefully sets the stage for the shocking revelation that Malcolm has been dead the entire time. More than just a jaw-dropping moment, the twist became a cultural touchstone, referenced and parodied endlessly, proving that Shyamalan’s ability to redefine an entire story with a single moment is what makes him one of cinema’s most unforgettable storytellers. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 0.16.2.0 patch has been released, introducing a slew of upgrades and improvements to the game’s AI across both PvP and PvE platforms. This upgrade was touted by Battlestate Games a couple of weeks ago following the publication of results from an in-game survey.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, patch 0.16.2.0 also boosts Boss spawn chances and heightens the chances of running into Cultists in both PvE and PvP. Those who were struggling with Partisan appearing in too many PvE raids (like myself) can rest easy – his spawn rate has been dropped globally with this patch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ai-evolution">AI Evolution</h2>



<p>The 0.16.2.0 patch in Escape from Tarkov brings a wide variety of changes to AI enemies, including Scavs, Rogues, Raiders, and Bosses:</p>



<ul>
<li>All Sniper Scavs and regular Scavs of any difficulty now have 30 head HP</li>



<li>Increased the chance for AI PMCs to perceive an AI Scav as hostile to 80%. Other chances of faction relationships remain the same in all locations</li>



<li>Bots now turn their head towards the presumed target to obtain better visual</li>



<li>The detection speed for Hard difficulty bots is now equal to that of Normal difficulty bots</li>



<li>Adjusted the detection speed settings for AI PMCs. Now, they detect enemies 20% faster than regular bots</li>



<li>AI PMCs now also switch to single fire at long ranges. At close ranges, they will switch to full auto if possible</li>



<li>Regular bots no longer take cover in vegetation</li>



<li>Bots can no longer see through vegetation unless an enemy is very close to them</li>



<li>Bot vision is reduced if they are inside the vegetation</li>



<li>Increased the current and maximum durability of all AI PMC weapons</li>
</ul>



<p>The team at Battlestate Games has also adjusted a few <strong>Player Scav </strong>mechanics:</p>



<ul>
<li>Adjusted the spawn time for Player Scavs: they now spawn no earlier than 17 minutes after the start of the raid on most of the locations, excluding Factory, Reserve, and low-level Ground Zero</li>



<li>Increased the chance of spawning with better Scav equipment if the player has a high standing with Fence<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Further optimisations were made to the game’s overall stability, with special attention being paid to the new iteration of Customs. In-raid memory consumption has been adjusted on all maps, and shadow quality settings have been tweaked to consider low-end PCs.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has also delivered a slew of bug fixes with the 0.16.2.0 patch, adjusting some of the most common concerns like bots teleporting through doors and rewards going missing from Cultist Circle redemptions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-announces-shut-down-just-9-months-after-launch-steam-release-appears-scrapped<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">I fear something terrible has happened.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-hunters">Star Wars Hunters</a> publisher Zynga has announced plans for the game to shut down entirely just nine months after it was released, and it appears plans to launch a PC version of Steam are scrapped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The NaturalMotion-developed, free-to-download team-based battle arena game launched on Nintendo Switch and iOS and Android in June 2024. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-review"><u>Star Wars: Hunters review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Star Wars: Hunters’ lighthearted PvP fun is like a party at the Death Star: Impressive for a bit, but probably not a place you’ll want to hang around for too long.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems the review was prescient, as <a href="https://starwarshunters.com/news/sunset-on-vespaara/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zynga announced</a> that “after careful consideration” it had decided the final content update for Star Wars: Hunters across all platforms would be released on April 15, with the game remaining playable until October 1, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We understand this news may be disappointing and want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly,” Zynga continued. “Your passion and dedication to the game and its community have meant the world to us, and we are committed to providing visibility and updates throughout the transition process.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are the logistics: on March 25, Season 5 will be extended by three weeks. Zynga will re-run events and shop bundles from the Season, and the Ranked Season will also be extended, giving players more time to hit Kyber 1 rank.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On April 15, the game’s final content update will be released for free and in-game purchases will be disabled across all platforms. New Support Hunter, Tuya, will join the game as part of the final update. Tuya will be available and playable for all users immediately at no cost, along with a slate of additional in-game content. Zynga will continue to run a final Ranked Mode leaderboard for players to compete in and run all battlefields and game modes in rotation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, on October 1, online servers will officially shut down, and Star Wars: Hunters will no longer be playable beyond this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no mention of the PC version, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-confirmed-for-pc-via-steam-early-access-in-2025">which was announced to launch on Steam in early access form this year</a>, in the shutdown notice. Its Steam page now includes a notice that the game is “no longer available on the Steam store.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two-owned Zynga is best known for mobile games FarmVille, Words with Friends, and CSR Racing, but with Star Wars: Hunters it branched out to console for the first time. Similarly, Star Wars: Hunters was meant to be the first Zynga-published game to launch on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The success of Star Wars: Hunters on mobile and Nintendo Switch devices has led to our decision to expand the game to PC,” said Yaron Leyvan, executive vice president, games, at Zynga, back in November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is something our community of fans have been asking for and we are very excited to welcome even more players to Vespaara. This moment also marks a milestone for Zynga as we bring one of our games to PC for the first time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are still a number of Star Wars video games in the works, including Respawn Entertainment's third Star Wars Jedi game and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-to-be-revealed-at-star-wars-celebration-2025">Bit Reactor's turn-based tactics game set to be revealed at Star Wars Celebration 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

You’ll also be able to send invites to your friends while you’re in a game.</p><p>As the company says, you don’t have to have a Discord account to use the in-game Discord features, but “account linking is available for those who wish to connect their in-game experience to their Discord account for an even more engaging experience.”</p><p>Currently, the SDK is “compatible with C++, both Unreal Engine and Unity, and supports Windows 11+ and macOS,” according to Discord. Console and mobile support is “coming soon.” Developers including Theorycraft Games, Facepunch Studios, 1047 Games, Scopely, Mainframe Industries, Elodie Games, and Tencent Games are already using it, Discord says.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-onexsugar-asks-what-if-nintendo-switch-could-transform-into-nintendo-ds.1136592/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/631005/qualcomm-snapdragon-g3-gen-3-onexsugar-handheld-ayaneo-pocket<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The picture above <em>does not</em> contain two different gaming handhelds. Instead, this halo device for Qualcomm’s just-announced Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 gaming chips — which I’ll tell you about in a sec — is a <em>single</em> transforming device with swing out gamepads and screens. It’s called the OneXPlayer OneXSugar, and it’s one of the most delightfully gadgety gaming gadgets I’ve seen.</p><p>Hold it horizontally like a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, flip out its secondary screen, then <em>rotate</em> its twin hinged gamepads for a more squared-off Nintendo DS-like experience:</p><div id=":R6bdber6:"><div><p><figcaption>GIF by The Verge / OneXPlayer</figcaption></p></div><div><p><cite>GIF by The Verge / OneXPlayer</cite></p></div></div><p>If you listen closely, you can almost hear the emulation community jumping for joy at the idea of two different aspect ratio screens joined at the hip. Me, I’m busy imagining the satisfying and/or horrifying sounds it might make as its triple joints swing into action!</p><p>We know little more than what you can glean from the pictures and animations, but here are the key bits:</p><div><ul><li><span>It’s from the same boutique Chinese gadget maker behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161887/onexplayer-x1-mini-handheld-gaming-pc-ssd">the three-in-one X1 and X1 Mini</a> that I told you about last spring.</span></li><li><span>OneXPlayer plans to put it on preorder this May.</span></li><li><span>It’s an Android device with Qualcomm’s just-announced Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 processor inside, rather than an AMD-toting Windows gaming handheld.</span></li></ul></div><p>Before you get your hopes up, the OneXPlayer OneXSugar is unlikely to become a Windows gaming machine. For one thing, we’re looking at nice but modest gains of 30 percent more CPU performance and 28 percent more GPU performance <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23840895/qualcomm-g3x-snapdragon-gen-2-g2-g1-gaming-handheld-chips">than the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2</a> announced in 2023. It doesn’t contain the Oryon CPU core that powers both Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite for phones or its Snapdragon X Elite for laptops, nor the Adreno X1 or Adreno 830 GPUs that respectively feature in those chips.</p><p>And while Qualcomm Snapdragon gaming lead Micah Knapp told journalists that the company might launch support for other operating systems “over time,” it’s “really focused on the Android side” as of today. That’s because China is such a huge market for Android gaming, the company hints. “The perspective that Android gaming isn’t popular is a very region-centric perspective,” Qualcomm spokesperson Sascha Segan says when I ask.</p><p>That China interest is certainly helping produce some incredible looking devices. When Qualcomm first announced its last handheld gaming chips, the best it could show off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23840895/qualcomm-g3x-snapdragon-gen-2-g2-g1-gaming-handheld-chips">was a dull batarang-shaped reference design</a>. Today, in addition to the OneXSugar, it’s got the sleek metal-bodied Ayaneo Pocket S2, an Ayaneo Gaming Pad, and additionally two new Retroid Pocket devices on its new lower-tier chips, the Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 and G1 Gen 2.</p><p>Here’s that Pocket S2:</p><p>Knapp tells me that his company doesn’t need to subsidize the development of Qualcomm handhelds, either. “To be blunt, most of them are coming to us to build platforms on their own,” he says. “People have accepted this is where things are going to happen, and now they’re just aggressively moving into the space,” he says.</p><p>Of the two lower-tier chips, the G2 Gen 2 claims significant gains of 2.3x the CPU performance and 3.8x the GPU performance of a Snapdragon G2 Gen 1, though I’m not aware of any particular handhelds shipping with that earlier chip, and neither Qualcomm nor Retroid have released images of its next horizontal handheld. The G1 Gen 2 boasts 80 percent greater CPU performance than G1 Gen 1, and a 25 percent faster GPU.</p><p>The Ayaneo Pocket S2 should be coming this month, the Retroid Pocket PR Classic should be up for preorder this month, and the Ayaneo Gaming Pad should be coming this May.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/undertale-sets-new-concurrent-player-record-almost-10-years-after-its-initial-release/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>,&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>reached a 24-hour player peak of 11,071 yesterday, which is also the game's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/391540/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all-time record</a>&nbsp;on the platform. Prior to the Steam Spring Sale's commencement,&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>was averaging around 1000-1500 players per day.</p>

<p>It's almost certainly no accident that&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>is currently on sale at a 90% discount, which means you can pick up one of the most celebrated and influential games of the past decade for one single measly dollar. Trust me, if you haven't played this one already, it's worth it.</p>

Even if you don't intend to play it for a while, it's probably going to be a long time before you can get&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>this cheap again.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Undertale</em>, it's a turn-based RPG with bullet hell elements created by solo developer Toby Fox (who also handled the excellent soundtrack).</p>

<p>I don't want to give too much away in case you're not already spoiled, and&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>is a game best experienced without knowing much about it when going in. Suffice it to say that there's more going on here than just a simple SNES-style&nbsp;<em>Earthbound</em>-influenced RPG.</p>

<p>Fox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-chapters-three-and-four-2025" rel="nofollow">has said</a>&nbsp;that the third and fourth chapters of the game will definitely be arriving sometime this year, and he's also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-update-promises-smoother-development" rel="nofollow">promised</a> that development will be "smoother" following a fairly long gestation period for the game.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/undertale/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/undertale/9pjggx9xjxpb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/undertale-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (and, of course, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S through backwards compatibility).</p>

The soundtrack has also received an orchestral upgrade, with legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu overseeing the new arrangements.

I call upon the fans of the RPG and <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,125 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> genre to back the Kickstarter to help us make the game.”</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>With the launch of the <em>Hopetown</em> Kickstarter, Longdue delves deep into the game’s mechanics, story and setting, as well as introducing players to the mix of industry veterans and upcoming talent working on the game. The campaign features a quantity and time limited (48 hours) pledge to allow early backers to have their name featured in an in-game memorial and design in-game objects. A further quantity-limited pledge will allow backers to get a copy of the game, or two copies, at a discounted price.</p><p><em>Hopetown</em> is set in a mining town decades after a coronal mass ejection wiped out electronics and global communications. Here, they found the quicksilver, a substance that’s changed everything. Since the incident five days ago, people are dead, others are missing and mining operations have screeched to a halt.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Enter you: middle child of one of the richest men on the planet (voiced by Lenval Brown, narrator of <em>Disco Elysium</em>). You’ve drifted through life knowing only luxury and power, shielded by privilege and surrounded by sycophants. You’ve just stepped off an impossibly long train ride, wheeling an overpriced suitcase across the muddy cobblestone and nursing a four-star hangover. Your mission, or punishment, seems simple enough: figure out what happened, cover it up, and spin a better story. You’re a journalist, after all.</p><p>Different schools and methods of journalism will be your RPG classes: Gonzo. Investigative. Gossip. Conspiracy. Words will be your weapons, and you’ll make your own truth. In <em>Hopetown</em>, the <a title="Genres > Action [2,567 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s you take, the friendships you make and destroy, the change you bring — these things don’t just live in your head, trapped in consciousness and fading into memory. They take shape in the physical world around you, real in every sense of the word. Just like the connection between you and your environment, which is enabled by a unique gameplay mechanic dubbed ‘psychogeography’.</p><p>The environment all around you — the town above and the mine below — will change during the game, based on the choices you make. Wasn’t that postbox at the other end of the street? Wasn’t this road uphill two days ago? Wasn’t that gambling hall a pub when you woke up this morning? Things will change under your nose and under your heel. Make surprising new connections between characters, break longstanding friendships, and see what happens.</p><p><em>Hopetown</em> is being created by a team that includes a mix of industry veterans and fresh talent, drawing expertise from the RPG-space, as well as writers with experience in games, theater and screen. Team members include ex-ZA/UM founder Martin Luiga, narrative director Grant Roberts, technical lead Piotr Sobolewski, <em>Disco Elysium</em> narrator Lenval Brown, <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em> developer Ben Babbitt, <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> composer Pawel Blaszczak and art director Astri Lohne.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Kickstarter Live Now</strong> – The first video and key details on the project are available now on the <em>Hopetown</em> Kickstarter page, along with a number of time and quantity-limited pledge types.</li><li><strong>Continuing the Legacy of Legendary <a title="Genres > RPG [17,059 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a></strong> – <em>Hopetown</em> carries forward the thoughtful, narrative-first approach of titles like <em>Disco Elysium</em> and <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em>.</li><li><strong>Psychographic Mechanics</strong> – The game explores the intricate relationship between mind and environment, offering players a story-driven experience where their choices shape both the world and its characters.</li><li><strong>Gonzo, Investigative, Gossip, or Conspiracy?</strong> – Play as a journalist with different schools of journalism being your RPG classes.</li><li><strong>A World That Burns Bright</strong> – You arrive as a spoilt nepo-baby journalist five days after an incident in a Northern English mining town.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wyrdsong">Wyrdsong</a>, the next game from a team of former Bethesda and Obsidian RPG veterans, is struggling on with a "skeleton crew" after further departures from its team and a rescoping of the game. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/talking-to-the-former-fallout-76-lead-about-their-new-studio-and-occult-rpg-wyrdsong">Wyrdsong was announced back in 2022 as the first project from Something Wicked Games</a>, a new studio helmed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> lead Jeff Gardiner and Obsidian veteran Charles Staples. However, progress on Wyrdsong has been hampered by the team struggling to find further financial backing. 
</p>
<p>
After an initial investment from NetEase, funding ran dry 12 months ago <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wyrdsong-developer-something-wicked-reportedly-impacted-by-layoffs">leading to the departure of "most of" the game's team</a>. Now, speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wyrdsong-the-rpg-from-ex-bethesda-talent-isnt-dead-but-its-no-longer-an-open-world-were-down-to-a-skeleton-crew/">PC Gamer</a>, Gardiner has revealed further departures - including that of his co-founder Staples and of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-lead-quest-designer-joins-other-ex-bethesda-developers-at-wyrdsong-studio">former Starfield lead quest designer Will Shen</a>, who quit Bethesda to join the project.
</p>
<p>Wyrdsong has been reshaped as a consequence of these departures, to try and make the game more managable to fund and be finished.</p>
<p>
"We were making a big open-world RPG," Gardiner said. "The way I have learned to do them requires a lot of people to do that, which means a lot of money that was not forthcoming in the industry."
</p>
<p>
Wyrdsong was announced as a historical fantasy game with supernatural elements set in Portugal around the forming of the Knights Templar. It was originally envisioned as being an open-world game, but this has been dropped in favour of a map with zones that are more managable to develop and explore. A roguelite system has also been added, Gardiner revealed, which fitted with the game's story of exploring what happened after death. 
</p>
<p>
For now, Gardiner is pushing on with the project, but admits that its future looks "very tough".
</p>
<p>
"We're down to a skeleton crew, and I am continuing to work hard to try to find further investment or publishing offers for the game. I'm hoping to sometime this year, but we're just trying to hang on to ride out the storm, which a lot of people thought was going to be over in 2025 and I do not see that reality at all currently."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-introduce-additional-graphics-settings-quality-of-life-gameplay-improvements.1136532/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-graphics-options/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New Monster Hunter Wilds mods, which are now available online, introduce new graphics options and quality-of-life enhancements that can improve performance and the overall experience.</p>
<p>The new graphics options are introduced by the aptly named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/816?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More Graphics Options mod</a> created by Aiyke. These include mesh level of detail bias, foliage LOD offset/bias, the ability to disable texture streaming and dynamic shadows and to change small object culling ratio. While adjusting any of these options will impact the game's visuals considerably, it can also improve the game's performance, so the mod is definitely worth a try for those who are having trouble running the game with an acceptable level of performance.</p>
<p>While not every Monster Hunter Wilds player will see some benefit from the new graphics options, the vast majority will definitely appreciate the new quality-of-life gameplay improvements introduced by the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/839?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All in One Menu</a> by Reena, which introduced new options in the main menu, such as the ability to access the Smithy, change equipment and transfer items directly from the menu, without having to return to camp. Especially during the endgame, Monster Hunter Wilds wants hunters to be out on the field constantly, so these options are extremely welcome.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched last month on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. While the experience is marred by <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/">bad performance</a> on pretty much anything that isn't a top-end machine, the game is still one of the best entries in the series, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"> review.</a></p>

With <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-adults-men-fighting-over-restock-machine-tiktok-1851768074&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-adults-men-fighting-over-restock-machine-tiktok-1851768074">embarrassing scenes of scalpers physically fighting each other</a></span>, something has to give if the card game is to maintain any viability for its wildly popular live game. To whit, Pokémon Center stores are removing the packaging from TCG products before they sell them, to make them far harder to resell.</p><p>As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemon-centers-wage-war-on-tcg-scalpers-by-removing-plastic-packaging-from-new-boxes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemon-centers-wage-war-on-tcg-scalpers-by-removing-plastic-packaging-from-new-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by <em>VGC</em></a></span>, joining Pokémon Centers in Japan, Singapore’s Pokémon Center is now also removing the plastic seals from boxed products to dissuade scalpers. As <em>VGC</em> observes, this means it’s the first time the English-language version of the TCG is being treated this way.</p><p>It’s important to note that permanent&nbsp;Pokémon Centers are unique to Japan and Singapore, which itself remains deeply peculiar given the astonishing popularity of all U.S. and UK pop-up venues—to the degree where people have to buy timed tickets, sometimes via lottery, to attend the stores. All U.S. retailers are therefore third-party, and in a more complicated position when it comes to removing packaging. However, it’s certainly doable, given it only happens at the point of purchase.</p><figure id="" data-id="8420cfdfce5ce2aa2ebfa39b207afb9b" data-recommend-id="image://8420cfdfce5ce2aa2ebfa39b207afb9b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8420cfdfce5ce2aa2ebfa39b207afb9b" data-recommend-id="image://8420cfdfce5ce2aa2ebfa39b207afb9b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course, there are those who would consider themselves legitimate collectors, wanting to buy sealed products to keep for their personal collections. And yes, for them, it sucks. Hell, I’d been buying one of every Pokémon Center ETB from the online store to keep sealed for a collection, with an eye on how much sealed products sell for once they’re over a decade old. Unsealed, they’d be worthless. But, you know what, even in my position the scalpers have made this pursuit impossible—the last three sets I’ve not been able to buy an ETB at all, as bots have demolished the stock in the opening seconds it goes online. Honestly, the situation is so bad that the fair point collectors make has become moot.</p><p>And things are only going to get worse, folks. Given that this era of the TCG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786">is now looking certain to last four years rather than three</a></span>, there are big moves to experiment with the card game’s mechanic, and with that comes only ever-more collectible cards. With this month’s Journey Together there will be the return of Trainer Pokémon, not seen since the 2000 set, Gym Heroes. Then later this year the game is to receive the return of Mega Pokémon. These will all be boosted with stunning full-art variants which will become ludicrously sought after, and only make the potential for scalpers more lucrative.</p><p>The Pokémon Company International either has to match its words and <em>massively </em>step up production to try to flood the market with so much product that the scalpers are drowned, or all stores are going to have to implement schemes like the Pokémon Centers in Japan and slice open that plastic at the checkout. </p><p>Yet again, scalpers ruin everything.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony Pictures is working on a new Starship Troopers movie with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gran-turismo-film-review-a-marketing-exercise-filled-with-contrived-drama">Gran Turismo filmmaker Neill Blomkamp</a> - and to be clear, this is completely separate from Sony Pictures' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">which was announced earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>The upcoming Starship Troopers film from Sony won't be based on the 1997 film that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> draws a lot of inspiration from. Rather, as reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/starship-troopers-neill-blomkamp-1236327071/">Deadline</a>, this Sony Starship Troopers film will instead go back to the 1959 sci-fi novel as its source material, which was written by Robert A. Heinlein.</p>
<p>"Plot details for the new incarnation [are] under wraps, but I betcha the movie is about astronauts versus bugs," reads Deadline's report. So, that sounds a lot like what I assume the Helldivers 2 film - which, again, is also in the works with Sony Pictures - will be about...</p>

</figure>
<p>Back in January, Arrowhead CCO Johan Pilestedt confirmed the Helldivers 2 developer will be involved with the upcoming film, but in a somewhat limited capacity. The exec said the game's development team "are not Hollywood people", and therefore "don't know what it takes to make a movie".</p>
<p>The studio's CEO Shams Jorjani still has some ideas for the Helldivers 2 film, though. Writing on Discord following the announcement, Jorjani quipped he wants as "many A-list actors as possible" to be part of the film, but there is a condition - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">he wants those actors to "get killed violently immediately"</a>.</p>

		<p>All-consuming audiovisual VR odyssey <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/thrasher">Thrasher</a> is getting a flatscreen release later this year, alongside the PC VR port of the game. There’s no release date just yet, but this port will let you play this successor to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/thumper">Thumper</a> across PC headsets, gaming PCs and on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="THRASHER 2D Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Kc-UKVdHG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Originally releasing last year for Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro, the game skipped out on PC or consoles to start with. We can only hope that there are plans for a PS5 and PSVR 2 release in this game’s future as well.</p>
<p>Coming from Brian Gibon, the artist and composer of Thumper, and Mike Mandel or Rock Band VR at their new studio Puddle, Thrasher looks to explore the rhythm action genre in a similarly dark and moody style. In this game you guide a space eel that is swooping through alien worlds in a race for survival, with players digging into a combo system that ties in with a chase to the top of leaderboards.</p>
<p>This was designed with VR in mind, fully immersing you into the game’s world, but it’s now being reworked to keep as much of that atmosphere when playing on a traditional flat screen platform. The visuals are being enhanced to take advantage of the power of modern gaming PCs when compared to standalone VR headsets. You’ll probably want to have a great pair of headphones plugged in, though.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/18/thumper-psvr2-review/">Returning to the 2016 classic Thumper in 2023</a>, Dom said, “Thumper remains a true VR classic, and its upgrade for PSVR2 makes it the best place to experience its violent audio charms.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-updated-patent-ai-upscaling-metroid-prime-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 patent that was updated a few days ago provides additional details on AI-powered upscaling, strongly indicating that the system will indeed support the technology in some capacity.</p>
<p>As spotted by Mike Odyssey, the patent was updated last week on March 13th with some additional details on how AI-upscaling works, taking a 520p resolution image and upscaling it to a 1080p resolution output using a neural network. The 520p and 1080p resolutions mentioned in the patent may also indicate how the tech will be used in handheld mode, confirming the console's screen resolution, but there's nothing in the updated patent that suggests a specific use case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Nintendo just released an update for Nintendo Switch 2 on AI resolution Upscaling. It's happening, folks! <a href="https://t.co/6GZUEXeBli">pic.twitter.com/6GZUEXeBli</a></p>
<p>— Mike Odyssey - Nintendo Switch 2 Experience Dallas (@MikeOdysseyYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1901107300581937596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Considering how the Nintendo Switch 2 is powered by NVIDIA technology, how DLSS itself was mentioned in a<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/"> previous patent,</a> and how Nintendo has already used AMD FSR in some of its original Switch games, there's little doubt that the console will support AI-upscaling in some form, although we will probably only get confirmation during the April 2nd Nintendo Direct. According to Kiwi Talks host Reece Reilly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-720p-resolution/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> will be the star of the show, as its true, proper unveiling will blow everything else in the Direct out of the water.</p>

<p lang="en">In less than a month in the Switch 2 direct you'll see that Nintendo &amp; Retro were keeping their cards close to their chest with Metroid Prime 4 for this exact moment. The true unveiling will blow everything else in the direct out of the water.</p>

<p>The April 2nd Direct will likely confirm the Nintendo Switch 2 release date, which, according to analysts and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">former Nintendo employees</a>, will be in early summer. The fact that<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-400000-units-shipped-north-america/"> around 400,000 units were reportedly shipped to North America in January</a> suggests that the console's release is indeed not too far off.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Warmachine</i>, a tabletop wargame that initially came to life to focus on balanced and competitive gameplay, has been around since 2003 under Privateer Press, until last year when Steamforged Games announced that they had <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-acquires-warmachine-and-whole-iron-kingdom-ip-0" rel="nofollow">bought the IP</a>. <em>Warmachine</em> had recently moved into a new edition of the rules, and SFG has continued to run with that, kicking off a <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/blogs/brands/iron-kingdoms-manifesto-part1?srsltid=AfmBOoqbPX8-yaogfTtpMsWSffAvNYYnSy0vGEqaKdAeX5njSJbqbpHm" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> of new and exciting releases. These releases started with a brand new 2-player starter set, and in this article,&nbsp;<span>we'll have a detailed look at what's inside it and see what&nbsp;<em>Warmachine</em> is all about</span>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=VCR0jFXm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=v1xFUkmj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture>

<p>Games of <em>Warmachine</em> begin with each player's selection of a Warcaster, a powerful mage that sets the tone for the rest of your army. While each faction has a distinct feel, the Warcaster you choose, each with a unique once-per-battle ability, can change how the force functions. Backing up the Warcaster are Warjacks, powerful metal constructs that pack a punch on the battlefield.&nbsp;Further supporting your Warcaster and Warjacks are Solos, individual warriors, and Units, groups of warriors, who flesh out the rest of your force</p>

<p>All of the rules and unit stats are available for free on the <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/pages/warmachine-app" rel="nofollow"><em>Warmachine</em> app</a>, so I won't go into too much detail here, but there are 2 standout mechanics for me. The first is the focus mechanic, a currency that Warcasters generate each turn. Warjacks also generate a small amount of focus, but the onus is on the Warcaster to transfer over some of their focus to the Warjack, or keep it to power their own magic and special abilities, or to boost or gain additional attacks. This adds a lot of flexibility in your turn and opens up options for how you use your Warcaster and Warjacks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-8.jpg?itok=Iw_fOlOZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-8.jpg?itok=_R0xt6eS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In <em>Warmachine</em>, when a Warjack is damaged, a dice is rolled to see which column takes the damage.</figcaption></figure><p>The second standout mechanic for me is the Warjack damage system. Rather than a simple damage stat that you subtract from as Warjacks take damage, instead there's a damage table that is rolled against. The number rolled indicates the column that takes damage, and once that column fills up, further damage is allocated to the next column. Letters are also spread across the bottom of each damage column, and once all of one type of letter has been damaged, it affects the efficiency of the Warjack. For example, once all the M letters (for Movement) have taken damage, the Warjack is automatically hit by melee attacks and has its defense reduced. This damage system on the Warjacks works very well as they can soak a lot of initial damage, but then systems will start to shut down as you damage them further. It gives a really thematic feel to the system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Warmachine</em> rules are scenario-focused, which means that you're going to be focusing a lot of getting things done and stopping your opponent from doing them, but always looming over you is that if your Warcaster is taken out, you lose immediately. And no matter what you're doing during the game, you need to be aware of how exposed your Warcaster is, whilst slyly checking if your opponent has left theirs vulnerable. In the games I've played so far, this usually led to some insane assassination attempts that were epic if they paid off and almost always cost you the game if they didn't,&nbsp; but they were always fun and cinematic.</p>

<p>Part of Steamforged Games' plan with taking over <em>Warmachine</em>, was the release of a new 2-player starter set. This new set sees the Cygnar Storm Legion clashing against the Khador Winter Korps, and we'll go into more detail of each force below. The main thing to note with this set is that it only contains the miniatures for the 2 forces and some terrain pieces; all the rules and unit cards are on the <em>Warmachine</em> app. If you want to use this set straight away, you'll also have to have some 6-sided dice, a measuring tool and some tokens. The box does make this clear, and this is similar to many other systems now, taking their rules almost entirely digital.</p>

<p>The lack of rules, accessories and stat cards in the box does make it feel less like a new player starter set, but an intro sheet in the pack points players towards the build instructions, a <em>Warmachine</em> Quick-Start guide (which is very good and takes you through everything, including the first few turns of the game) and the app itself. The app is well designed, clear, and works well, and this process does mean that new players are starting the game with the tools that they will continue to use in <em>Warmachine</em>, rather than having to make the jump to the app after their first few games.</p>

<p>The forces that are included are well-designed for a new starter set, giving both players one of each unit type (Warcaster, Warjack, Solo, and Unit). They are also both exactly 30-point forces, the smallest game of <em>Warmachine</em> you can play, and there's no variation in armaments in the builds, which means that new players can safely construct without having to worry about optimal builds before they learn the rules.</p>

<p>The included units are also Cadre units, which means that they can be used across all forces in the faction. We'll talk in detail about this when we cover the Gravediggers in an upcoming article, but all you need to know here are that the Gravediggers are a sub-faction of the Cygnar force and can also use all the&nbsp;Cygnar units in this box. This is great, as it means that as long as players choose one of the factions in the box to continue with, they'll always be able to use those units.</p>

<p>I really like the fact that the starter set is just miniatures, and isn't locking starter set components into a specific box. If players don't like the look of either of these factions, they can just pick up a different Command Starter Set and access the rules the same way. I think the inclusion of some dice, tokens, and a measuring tool would have made it a truly new player starter set, and even the other starter sets could include some thematic accessories that veteran players would love too. The digital rules mean that players are going straight into the current version, with printed rules being out of date after a rules update and the balance and player experience can be controlled by SFG, who can tweak the starter set units live.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-4_2.jpg?itok=Whw-9Biv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-4_2.jpg?itok=uy4JPl-i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Into The Storm</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;Cygnar Storm Legion troops in the <em>Warmachine</em> 2-Player Starter Set are a group known as the&nbsp;Hellslinger Cadre. The Hellsligners are led by the Warcaster,&nbsp;Major Allister Caine. Caine dual-wields Spellstorm pistols, which have 3 attack types to choose from when shooting. He boosts nearby gun mages, giving them headshot, and has access to teleport to get him out of trouble once he's laid down some fire. Caine is backed up by his Warjack, Deuce, who's armed with a powerful Spellstorm Cannon and has truesight, which lets them fire through cloud effects (which is handy for targeting the opponents of this starter set).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-5_0.jpg?itok=fWXPKq_G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-5_0.jpg?itok=Tbd9vAqh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Hellslingers' solo is&nbsp;Captain Bastian Falk, a ranged expert who can deploy further ahead than the rest of the force. Falk can also immediately return fire with his&nbsp;Magelock Scattergun if he is missed by an enemy ranged attack. He also passes that ability on to nearby gun mages, so keeping all of your units together lets them overlap buffs. The Black 13th is a 3-model unit of just those gun mages. Each is armed with a magic ranged weapon, each with 3 unique fire options to deal with most situations. They can also forward deploy with Falk and gain the benefits of both Falk and Caine's buffs to gun mages.</p>

<p>As you might have guessed, the Hellslinger Cadre likes to stand and shoot and I love the Wild West feel to the miniatures. I'm definitely going to make a hat for Deuce to match the rest of the Hellslingers.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-6.jpg?itok=SY5GNKK8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-6.jpg?itok=bfZrCJdd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Winter Is Coming</h2>

<p>The Khador Winter Korps troops in the <em>Warmachine</em> 2-Player Starter Set are known as the&nbsp;SKS-6 Cadre. And they are led by&nbsp;Kapitan Zahara Vilkul. Vilkul has a once-per-game feat that puts between 4 and 6 cloud templates on the battlefield to obscure the advance of her force (the Hellslingers Warjack, Deuce can unhelpfully still target through these clouds). More importantly, Vilkul has an incredible threat range using her Cyclone spell that lets her make a full move and attack, which can be used after a charge to let her attack an enemy up to 18 inches away. Vilkul is accompanied by her Warjack Razor, who comes armed with short-ranged weapons and excels in close combat where its ripper shield adds to Razor's durability and also gives it a powerful melee attack.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-7_0.jpg?itok=q9JkQiwL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-7_0.jpg?itok=wXaP_JZj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sergeant Goran Lazarenko, the Jackal, is the SKS-6 solo, and his miniature features a rocket leaving the launcher tube in an epicly animated sculpt. He gets to pick the column the damage goes into when a Warjack takes damage, so he can target specific columns with letters that will disrupt his target the most. The Hounds are the SKS-6 unit, and each of its 3 members comes armed with different ranged weapons to meet any situation. Where they have commonality is that they each carry a blast shield, which they can use in combat. They're already pretty durable, but their Sheild Wall ability means that whenever the models from this unit are in base-to-base contact with each other, they get an additional +2 armor on top of their already substantial armor.</p>

<p>The SKS-6 Cadre likes to get in much closer than the Hellslingers, which means running the gauntlet of ranged attacks to close the distance. Vilkul's smoke enables this, but Deuce being able to see through it is unhelpful. If Vilkul can activate within 18 inches of Caine, the Hellslingers Warcaster, then it's usually game over, but it can be tricky getting there if the Hellslingers want to play at range.</p>

<h2>Warmachine 2-Player Starter Set Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>I love both factions in this set, and while it can feel a little one-sided for the Hellslingers (who can shoot from the start and force the SKS-6 to close with them), if the SKS-6 can get close enough, they can really hammer the Hellslingers. I would have liked to have seen some themed accessories in the box, or even just the option of a Starter Set accessories pack add-on, which will still keep the cost down of the box, avoid duplication to those who have dice and tape measures, but still make it super accessible for new players. The quick-start guide (which is very good) that's linked to from the box could even be printed and thrown in with that accessory set. The digital rules work and make sure anyone picking up the box is getting the most up-to-date rules and stats, allowing SFG to tailor the starter experience if they do find that one side (the Hellsligners) has a much easier time.</p>

<p>The forces are well-designed and give a good experience for what those 2 factions are all about, along with being 30-point armies with one of each unit type, and available to all forces within that faction. There can be a lot of rules for new players to grasp for the 2 included forces, especially with the area of effect and overlapping buffs, but the quick-start going through the first few turns does help. Overall, I'm pleased to get back into <em>Warmachine</em> with this box, which I haven't played since 2019. This starter set feels fresh, and the miniatures look fantastic.</p>

            <p>People Can Fly - the developer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outriders">Outriders</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bulletstorm">Bulletstorm</a> - has signed a deal with PlayStation to work on a new project based on an existing Sony series.</p>
<p>Further details remain slim for now, though it has been confirmed the upcoming release is codenamed Project Delta, and that it is based on a franchise to which Sony holds the intellectual property rights.</p>

<p>Word of this upcoming Sony collaboration comes from <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-current-report-no-4-2025-conclusion-of-pda-with-sony-delta.pdf">a report published by People Can Fly</a> itself. Here, the studio stated it had entered into a work-for-hire agreement with the PlayStation maker.</p>
<p>So, what could it be? Well, call me optimistic, but I am thinking of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone">Killzone</a>. Sure, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/killzone-developer-done-with-series-guerrilla-says-of-switch-to-horizon">developer Guerrilla made it sound like it was done with Killzone</a>, instead now favouring its Horizon series, but that doesn't mean Sony is… right?</p> <div>

<p>In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outriders-studio-people-can-fly-working-on-new-project-based-on-microsoft-ip">People Can Fly signed a work-for-hire agreement with Microsoft</a> to develop a new project based on one of the Xbox maker's IP.</p>
<p>In the time since, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outriders-studio-people-can-fly-cuts-more-than-120-jobs-in-second-round-of-layoffs-this-year">studio has suffered a number of layoffs</a>. Meanwhile in April last year, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-studio-people-can-flys-floundering-project-dagger-officially-dead">revealed the People Can Fly had cancelled a co-op action RPG</a> - which was codenamed Project Dagger - after it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-publisher-pulls-out-of-people-can-fly-project-after-two-years">dropped by publisher Take-Two Interactive in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, People Can Fly was announced as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-e-day-dev-the-coalition-drafts-in-people-can-fly-as-partner-studio">co-developer of Gears of War: E-Day</a> alongside The Coalition. At this time, People Can Fly's CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski called the collaboration a "privilege and an exciting opportunity to build upon the intense, visceral action and rich storytelling that fans have come to love".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Resident Evil 9 is taking a long time to release because it will be a reinvention of the series, according to a well-known insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, well-known Resident Evil series insider Dusk Golem talked about the ninth main entry in the survival horror series by CAPCOM, saying that fans will realize why the new game is taking this long to release when it is revealed, as it is a big reinvention of the series as much as the fourth and seventh entries in the series were back in the day that will be very ambitious and will try new things that will make it play anything like its direct predecessors or the remakes. Dusk Golem also seems certain it will be revealed this year, so hopefully, it will be part of the usual slew of summer reveals in a few months.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">(2/2) is taking so long is because it's like a big reinvention of the series, to the same level as RE4 &amp; RE7. It's not going to play just like RE7/RE8 or the Remakes, it's trying new things &amp; very ambitious. It will almost definitely be revealed this year, so just hold tight.</p>
<p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1901499831455186984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Very little is currently known about Resident Evil 9 other than the fact that it has been in development for a while. <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/">Early rumors</a> suggested that Leon and Jill would play a big role in the game, but according to Dusk Golem, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-wont-feature-jill/">these rumors are not correct</a>. In development together with the next main entry in the series is also a Resident Evil Zero remake, which will be the next series remake to release.</p>
<p>Resident Evil 9 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>
The latest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> game did not perform well for publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, it's been claimed.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, which launched last autumn to a mixed response from fans, resulted in "large losses" for the company, <a href="https://kabutan.jp/news/marketnews/?b=n202503130535">Kabutan analyst Hideki Yasuda stated</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ffxvi-has-apparently-sold-3-5-million-copies-could-be-old-numbers-read-op.1133091/">ResetEra</a>/<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-sales-financial-report-large-loss-square-enix-sequel-unlikely/">TheGamer</a>).
</p>
<p>
Officially, Square Enix is yet to comment on Double Exposure's performance - and there's been no word on Double Exposure's sales figures pubicly at all. Deck Nine, the game's developer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-studio-deck-nine-makes-more-cuts-to-staff">previously announced layoffs at the studio in the wake of the game's launch</a>, and it's unclear what's next for the franchise - despite Double Exposure ending with a message stating that protagonist Max Caulfield would "return".

<p>
Last week, Square Enix issued its most <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/25q3earnings.pdf">recent financial results</a> - which largely focus on the sales of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake and the successful launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> expansion Dawntrail. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps tellingly, there's no notice of how Life is Strange: Double Exposure sold. Instead, Square Enix simply says that its HD gaming division's revenues had fallen due to the fact that unnamed "new titles generated lower sales"  than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster and Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince did over the same period during the previous year.
</p>
<p>
Square Enix doesn't state what the new titles that underperformed were, but does say that the launch of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D helped offset these losses, as it had performed better than initially expected.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Yasuda and Square Enix for more detail. The company is yet to release a transcript of the financial briefing that includes shareholder questions.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposures-first-two-chapters-are-mostly-good-but-making-fans-pay-extra-to-play-early-is-a-huge-mistake">Life is Strange: Double Exposure launched amidst a major backlash from fans</a> upset at how the game handled the ongoing storyline of returning protagonist Max Caulfield, and the impact of players' choice at the beginning of Life is Strange 1. 
</p>
<p>
The situation turned uglier when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-fans-upset-after-square-enix-removes-reddit-posts-featuring-leaked-content-anonymous-developer-comments">Square Enix removed leaked development material from a popular Life is Strange fan reddit</a>, including posts by several anonymous commenters who provided proof they worked at Deck Nine, and who made a number of claims regarding how Double Exposure's story had changed through development, shaped by feedback from Square Enix itself. In response, Square Enix said it had acted to remove the content based on "appropriate legal requirements" for "intellectual property violations".
</p>
<p>
"Like its own hero's dabbling with time travel, Life is Strange: Double Exposure highlights the troubles of trying to revisit old memories, while raising unanswered questions about the future," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review">Eurogamer's Life is Strange: Double Exposure review</a>.
