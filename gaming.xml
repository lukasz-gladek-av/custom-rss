		<p>We’re officially in the spookiest month of the year, so it absolutely tracks that we’ve already had a pair of fan favourite horror game remakes released. Of course, I think people were much more excited about Silent Hill 2’s remake and what Bloober Team would do, than the more… constrained remake of Until Dawn, but both games have their diehard fans. Which are you picking up?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/5/24262376/epic-unreal-engine-6-fortnite-metaverse-plans<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just over a year ago, Epic Games laid off around 16 percent of its employees. The problem, Epic said, was its own big ideas for the future and just how expensive they were to build. “For a while now, we’ve been spending way more money than we earn,” Epic CEO Tim Sweeney wrote in an email to staff.</p><p>On Tuesday, onstage at the Unreal Fest conference in Seattle, Sweeney declared that the company is now “financially sound.” The announcement kicked off a packed two-hour keynote with updates on Unreal Engine, the Unreal Editor for <em>Fortnite</em>, the Epic Games Store, and more.</p><p>In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Sweeney says that reining in Epic’s spending was part of what brought the company to this point. “Last year, before Unreal Fest, we were spending about a billion dollars a year more than we were making,” Sweeney says. “Now, we’re spending a bit more than we’re making.”</p><div><p>“The real power will come when we bring these two worlds together”</p></div><p>Sweeney says the company is well set up for the future, too, and that it has the ability to make the types of long-term bets he spent the conference describing. “We have a very, very long runway comparing our savings in the bank to our expenditure,” ​​Sweeney says. “We have a very robust amount of funding relative to pretty much any company in the industry and are making forward investments really judiciously that we could throttle up or down as our fortunes change. We feel we’re in a perfect position to execute for the rest of this decade and achieve all of our plans at our size.”</p><p>Epic has ambitious plans. Right now, Epic offers both Unreal Engine, its high-end game development tools, and Unreal Editor for <em>Fortnite</em>, which is designed to be simpler to use. What it’s building toward is a new version of Unreal Engine that can tie them together.</p><p>“The real power will come when we bring these two worlds together so we have the entire power of our high-end game engine merged with the ease of use that we put together in [Unreal Editor for <em>Fortnite</em>],” Sweeney says. “That’s going to take several years. And when that process is complete, that will be Unreal Engine 6.”</p><p>Unreal Engine 6 is meant to let developers “build an app once and then deploy it as a standalone game for any platform,” Sweeney says. Developers will be able to deploy the work that they do into <em>Fortnite</em> or other games that “choose to use this technology base,” which would allow for interoperable content.</p><p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24025596">“persistent universe”</a> Epic is building with Disney is an example of the vision. “We announced that we’re working with Disney to build a Disney ecosystem that’s theirs, but it fully interoperates with the <em>Fortnite</em> ecosystem,” Sweeney says. “And what we’re talking about with Unreal Engine 6 is the technology base that’s going to make that possible for everybody. Triple-A game developers to indie game developers to <em>Fortnite</em> creators achieving that same sort of thing.”</p><p>If you read my colleague Andrew Webster’s interview with Sweeney <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23652928/tim-sweeney-interview-epic-games-fortnite-metaverse">from March 2023</a>, the idea of interoperability to make the metaverse work will seem familiar. At Unreal Fest this week, I got a better picture of how the mechanics of that might work with things like Unreal Engine 6 and the company’s soon-to-open <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/fab-content-marketplace-launches-in-october-publishing-portal-opens-today">Fab marketplace to shop for digital assets</a>.</p><p>Fab will be able to host assets that can work in <em>Minecraft</em> or <em>Roblox</em>, Sweeney says. But the bigger goal is to let Fab creators offer “one logical asset that has different file formats that work in different contexts.” He gave an example of how a user might buy a forest mesh set that has different content optimized for Unreal Engine, Unity, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>. “Having seamless movement of content from place to place is going to be one of the critical things that makes the metaverse work without duplication.”</p><p>But for an interoperable metaverse to really be possible, companies like Epic, Roblox, and Microsoft will need to find ways for players to move between those worlds instead of keeping them siloed —&nbsp;and for the most part, that isn’t on the horizon.</p><p>Sweeney says Epic hasn’t had “those sorts of discussions” with anyone but Disney yet. “But we will, over time,” he says. He described an ideal where companies, working as peers, would use revenue sharing as a way to create incentives for item shops that people want to buy digital goods from and “sources of engagement” (like <em>Fortnite</em> experiences) that people want to spend time in.</p><p>“The whole thesis here is that players are gravitating towards games which they can play together with all their friends, and players are spending more on digital items in games that they trust they’re going to play for a long time,” Sweeney says. “If you’re just dabbling in a game, why would you spend money to buy an item that you’re never going to use again? If we have an interoperable economy, then that will increase player trust that today’s spending on buying digital goods results in things that they’re going to own for a long period of time, and it will work in all the places they go.”</p><div><p>“People are not dogmatic about where they play”</p></div><p>“There’s no reason why we couldn’t have a federated way to flow between <em>Roblox</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and <em>Fortnite</em>,” Epic EVP Saxs Persson says. “From our perspective, that would be amazing, because it keeps people together and lets the best ecosystem win.” Epic sees in its surveys that “people are not dogmatic about where they play,” Persson says.</p><p>Of course, there’s plenty of opportunity for Epic, which already makes a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259463/tim-sweeney-is-on-stage-and-says-fortnite-hit-a-monthly-active-user-peak-last-holiday">widely played game</a> and a widely used game engine and is building <em>Fortnite</em> into a game-making tool. (And I haven’t even mentioned how Unreal Engine is increasingly used <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/unreal-engine-hollywood-tv-films-epic-games-tim-miller-secret-level-1236162191/">in filmmaking</a> and <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2024/10/qualcomm-and-epic-games-partner-to-elevate-in-vehicle-user-exper">other industries</a>.) The end state sounds great for Epic, but Epic also has to make the math make sense for everyone else.</p><p>And it has to do that <em>without</em> much of a presence on mobile. The company has spent years in legal battles with Apple and Google over their mobile app store practices, and it just <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/9/30/24256395/epic-sues-google-samsung-antitrust-auto-blocker">sued Samsung</a>, too. The Epic Games Store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">recently launched</a> on Android globally and on iOS in the EU, but thanks to restrictions on third-party app stores, the company’s game store boss, Steve Allison, tells <em>The Verge</em> that reaching its end-of-year install goal is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/3/24260534/epic-games-store-pc-social-features-suck">“likely impossible.”</a> Any major change could take quite a while, according to Sweeney. “It will be a long battle, and it will likely result in a long series of battles, each of which moves a set of freedoms forward, rather than having a single worldwide moment of victory,” Sweeney says.</p><p>There’s one other battle Epic is fighting: <em>Fortnite</em> is still hugely popular, but there is waning interest — or hype, at least — in the metaverse. Sweeney and Persson, however, don’t exactly agree about the term seemingly falling out of popularity.</p><p>“It’s like there’s metaverse weather,” Sweeney says. “Some days it’s good, some days it’s bad. Depends on who’s doing the talking about it.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For one, his stardom is apparent to the millions who’ve built it, rather than something fans need to be convinced of, unlike the supposed popularity of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/noche-ufc-deserved-our-reservation-now-it-deserves-our-1851648725&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/noche-ufc-deserved-our-reservation-now-it-deserves-our-1851648725">Sphere-headlining Sean O’Malley</a></span>. Moreover, he’s maintained a McGregor-esque ascent while avoiding similar controversies, escaped the shadow of Israel Adesanya without stooping to his level of immaturity, and become the most beloved Brazilian fighter this side of José Aldo—all while making himself a two-division champion in a combat sport for the second time, having first done so in Glory Kickboxing before his move to MMA.</p><p>Granted, when fans and pundits stop talking star power and start discussing GOAT cases, arguments can be made for many other fighters ahead of Pereira. Pioneers like Anderson Silva can hang there hats on history, the Demetrius Johnsons of the world can point to their dominance, and Jon Jones has his unbeaten streak on his side (and Dana White). After duplicating his kickboxing success in a second sport, Alex Pereira has one thing left to do to before he can be included among those greats: He has to move to heavyweight and become the UFC’s first three-division champion.</p><p>As the Light Heavyweight Champion prepares to defend his gold at UFC 307 against Khalil Rountree, read on as I look past his opponent, perhaps committing a cardinal combat sport sin in the process, and plot Poatan’s potential road to heavyweight glory.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b3ace7d51088cf10f57ff9c34f2c6c1d" data-recommend-id="image://b3ace7d51088cf10f57ff9c34f2c6c1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5098" data-height="3399" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b3ace7d51088cf10f57ff9c34f2c6c1d" data-recommend-id="image://b3ace7d51088cf10f57ff9c34f2c6c1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5098" data-height="3399" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Throughout the build-up to this fight, Khalil Rountree has repeated some version of the famous last words uttered by most of Alex Pereira’s opponents. Like Sean Strickland, Jamahal Hill, and, to an extent, Jiří Procházka before him, Rountree intends to have a kickboxing match with the most dangerous kickboxer on the planet. This in combination with Rountree’s somewhat star-less resume seems like a recipe for something more reliable than a home-cooked meal at mama’s house—a devastating left hook that’ll put the contender’s lights out.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="68b152ceaac23883e97dc0fdd11789dc" data-recommend-id="image://68b152ceaac23883e97dc0fdd11789dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="5616" data-height="3744" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68b152ceaac23883e97dc0fdd11789dc" data-recommend-id="image://68b152ceaac23883e97dc0fdd11789dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="5616" data-height="3744" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>After making quick work of Rountree, the next step on Alex Pereira’s path to a third belt is ignoring Dricus Du Plesis altogether.</p><p>We get it.

But despite how confident Pereira may feel about his chances against the middleweight champ, if he aims to create an iron-clad MMA legacy, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mmafighting.com/2024/9/3/24234732/alex-pereira-go-down-one-more-time-challenge-dricus-du-plessis-after-ufc-307&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2024/9/3/24234732/alex-pereira-go-down-one-more-time-challenge-dricus-du-plessis-after-ufc-307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moving back down to 185</a></span> would literally and figuratively be a regression. He’s won that belt already. Winning it again would be mostly meaningless.</p><p>As far as retreads are concerned, Pereira should only be looking in his rearview to get a glimpse at one man.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="88f5b440e4ab595ea1f3fd823a7f4086" data-recommend-id="image://88f5b440e4ab595ea1f3fd823a7f4086" data-format="jpg" data-width="5256" data-height="3504" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="88f5b440e4ab595ea1f3fd823a7f4086" data-recommend-id="image://88f5b440e4ab595ea1f3fd823a7f4086" data-format="jpg" data-width="5256" data-height="3504" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Before getting his topknot kicked crooked at UFC 303, Jiří Procházka accused Pereira of using “magic” and “spells” to win their previous fight, which is as hilarious as it is bizarre. But on the off chance that’s it’s true, Pereira’s GOAT resume could benefit from a spell that grants Izzy the courage to give 205 a second chance.</p><p>In 2021, following a decision loss in his debut light heavyweight bout against then-champion Jan Błachowicz, Adesanya spoke one of his favorite idioms: “Dare to be great.” It’s a saying he’s repeated since, sometimes followed by an affirmation: “And I am.” He said this at a time in his career when language was his own sort of magic, a narrativizing force so powerful it’d turn the world into a manga page and bend destiny into the shape of the anime arc in his head. Somewhere along the way, though, perhaps even before getting beat up by Strickland and choked out by DDP, Adesanya stopped daring to be great and now prefers to assume he already his.</p><p>Given the “last goal wins” attitude he’s taken after finally defeating Pereira in his fourth try in two sports, it’s clear, at least to me, what’s stopping the two from completing their MMA trilogy: Adesanya wants no parts of Poatan’s full power at light heavyweight. Despite being visibly more muscular than he was the first time he moved up, having absolutely no interesting matchups left for him at middeweight, and potentially having a better chance against a striker at 205 than he did against a wrestler like Błachowicz, the former champion seems content avoiding another fight with his nemesis. In turn, this makes both of their claims to greatness seem slightly less daring.</p><p>Sure, Pereira’s move to heavyweight could and should happen with or without an MMA tie-breaker with Adesanya. But imagine how much more special it’d be if it came after an ancient Brazilian ritual granted Izzy his former spirit and compelled him to complete the greatest UFC rivalry in the modern era.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eb9b5d3339722c048fc33efdb957d7ab" data-recommend-id="image://eb9b5d3339722c048fc33efdb957d7ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1782" data-height="1260" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eb9b5d3339722c048fc33efdb957d7ab" data-recommend-id="image://eb9b5d3339722c048fc33efdb957d7ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1782" data-height="1260" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This one is pretty self-explanatory. In order for Pereira’s move to heavyweight to signify what I think it could, it must follow what’d be his most meaningful title defense at light heavyweight: Another decisive stoppage over Adesanya.</p><p>Should Izzy find the courage to once again bang with the big boys, I only see it going one way if the man who’s beaten him three out of four times is standing on the other side of the cage.</p><p>If GOAT cases are built on a combination of narrative and accomplishments, then a third belt for Alex Pereira would be slightly diminished if it came without him getting a chance at a rubber match with his greatest foe. While the former would be the more impressive accolade, the latter is essential to both men’s stories as fighters. </p><p>Ironically, it could be argued Pereira-Adesanya 3 (or 5) is far more critical to each athlete’s resume than the legacy fight fans are being force fed in November.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9fc36e7e8d88649b3dda9fa0e057319a" data-recommend-id="image://9fc36e7e8d88649b3dda9fa0e057319a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Chris Graythen/Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9fc36e7e8d88649b3dda9fa0e057319a" data-recommend-id="image://9fc36e7e8d88649b3dda9fa0e057319a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I don’t think I’m breaking any news by saying very few people are interested in seeing Jon Jones fight Stipe Miocic in what’ll likely be a retirement fight for both men. Unlike what I’m suggesting with another fight between Pereira and Adesanya, there’s no drama, no intrigue, and ultimately no meaning in the upcoming heavyweight championship bout. Miocic has effectively been retired since 2021 and hasn’t won a fight since 2020, and Jones is ducking Tom Aspinall more flagrantly than Izzy is ducking Poatan, which is saying something.</p><p>In a perfect world, this step would be called “Beat Jon Jones,” as that’d perhaps put Pereira in GOAT contention with or without a heavyweight belt around his waist. But that can’t happen because Jones is intent on ending his career facing a 42-year-old coming off a vicious knockout and an interminable layoff. So, instead, all Pereira has to do upon his arrival at heavyweight is sit back and await the next undisputed king of the division.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c87cc2d421b7082fdf2168b97764503" data-recommend-id="image://7c87cc2d421b7082fdf2168b97764503" data-format="jpg" data-width="6563" data-height="4376" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c87cc2d421b7082fdf2168b97764503" data-recommend-id="image://7c87cc2d421b7082fdf2168b97764503" data-format="jpg" data-width="6563" data-height="4376" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Part of what’s so unfortunate about Pereira not getting to fight Jones is I don’t think he can beat Tom Aspinall. The Interim Heavyweight Champion has a combination of size and athleticism that the Brazilian hasn’t had to face at 185 or 205, plus he has youth on his side. </p><p>I know what you’re thinking: “You’re saying Alex Pereira has a better chance against Jon Jones than Tom Aspinall?!” Yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying. Because despite remaining unbeaten, Jones ended his run at 205 on a visible decline and is now returning to heavyweight following a catastrophic injury. Tom Aspinall is the far more dangerous opponent today given those circumstances.</p><p>A win over Aspinall wouldn’t be impossible, especially with Pereira’s one-punch power and Tom’s subtle defensive recklessness on the feet. But if we’re plotting a path to Poatan’s third belt in the UFC, there are easier roads to get there that don’t go through the UK.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="59aeb044012f1678f1aad5753b1ee6a3" data-recommend-id="image://59aeb044012f1678f1aad5753b1ee6a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="4760" data-height="3238" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="59aeb044012f1678f1aad5753b1ee6a3" data-recommend-id="image://59aeb044012f1678f1aad5753b1ee6a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="4760" data-height="3238" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Without Jon Jones in the picture, the pickings at heavyweight will be so slim that the first fighter to challenge Aspinall’s eventual undisputed gold will likely be either a man he’s already beaten or a man who just lost a title shot two fights ago. This bodes well for Alex Pereira as far as his hopes for a belt in a third division are concerned.</p><p>Do I think either Alexander Volkov or Ciryl Gane stand a chance against Tom Aspinall? Not really, no. But let’s face it, like other greats before him, a part of what has helped Alex Pereira’s MMA resume has been accruing favorable matchups. A realistic roadmap for him to realize three-division glory would have to include a lesser heavyweight than Aspinall. So, whether the Englishman slips on a banana peel, catches a cold, or comes down with a serious case of the yips, in my mind, he must relinquish his belt to either Volkov or Gane before Pereira gets a crack at it.</p><p>Would this make a heavyweight title for Pereira less impressive? Only if you found similar reasons to diminish his championships at middelweight and light heavyweight. Luckily for me, I’m not that boring. But if you are, even after becoming the UFC’s first three-divsion champion, Alex Pereira will likely have to complete one more step before being considered a combat sports GOAT.</p><p> Which is...</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8d1ce0b6887f8ef2d43fea08e15242ea" data-recommend-id="image://8d1ce0b6887f8ef2d43fea08e15242ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="8640" data-height="5760" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d1ce0b6887f8ef2d43fea08e15242ea" data-recommend-id="image://8d1ce0b6887f8ef2d43fea08e15242ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="8640" data-height="5760" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Despite capturing belts across three different weight classes in this entirely made-up fantasy of mine, clearly, legally becoming Jon Jones is the only way Alex Pereira can cement himself as the pound-for-pound king. Though this isn’t at all the same thing as being the GOAT (no matter what Dana White says), the privilege of simply being Jon Jones seems to go along way when discussing the greatness of current competitors—inactivity, blatant ducking, and deserving challengers be damned.</p><p>Truth be told, the concept of a GOAT itself is as contrived as this scenario I’ve laid out. It’s all cherrypicked stats and storytelling. Nothing proves this more than Dana White’s unwavering devotion to Jon Jones. But to me, that’s what makes sports so compelling, the natural drama that occurs as competitors and spectators alike attempt to make narrative sense out of wins and losses. It’s a joy to witness an athlete like Pereira tap into such authentic gladiatorial theater, especially at a time when hype trains are promoted to fans so relentlessly the whole thing starts to feel like pro wrestling.</p><p>My only fear is that looking past Pereira’s current act with Rountree may interrupt the show and come back to haunt me. But only time will tell.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/halo-championship-series-2025-season-confirmed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been confirmed that the Halo Championship Series will return in 2025 with another $1 million World Championship event. This news comes amid the ongoing HCS World Championship in Seattle, and it’s joined by other tidbits, such as the third-person mode coming to Halo Infinite.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-again">Back Again</h2>



<p>Between 2018 and 2021, the Halo Championship Series went on something of a hiatus. It was a tough time for the Halo esports ecosystem, with few major tournaments taking place as the HCS was sunsetted with an uncertain future. In 2021, things were brought back to life as Halo Infinite was released.</p>



<p>Although the Halo Championship Series struggles with viewership and grandeur today, it remains relatively consistent as an esports league. With that in mind, 343 Industries and Esports Engine have just confirmed that <strong>another season </strong>of the HCS will land in 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Despite not being considered one of the premier esports titles, Halo has a legacy that cannot be denied. It was once one of the spearhead titles that caused the esports industry to evolve and expand, and it paved the way for other FPS games to surface. Typically, Halo events – even major tournaments – are smaller and less valuable to the industry, but for fans, they’re electrifying.</p>



<p>Let’s not forget that the Halo Championship Series is represented by some of the biggest names in esports – Cloud9, OpTic, FaZe, and Speacestation, to name a few organisations.</p>



<p>It’s great news that the HCS is coming back next year, but what would you like to change ahead of the 2025 season? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/05/sony-sort-of-delists-original-horizon-zero-dawn-on-pc-ahead-of-remaster-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launches-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered around the corner</a> and pre-orders going live, Sony has removed the original game from sale on PC (kind of), and increased the price of the game on PS4 as they look ahead to the game’s relaunch.</p>
<p>The original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> is no longer available for sale individually on PC via Steam and Epic, but it is still available as part of a bundle with Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered at no additional cost. This means you can still buy the game on PC and play straight away, but the price has been reset to the £45 price point that the remaster will hold. The original game is still available separately on PC via GOG.com for £40.</p>


<p>Over on PlayStation, it’s a similar story of cost bumps. The price of Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition for PS4 has been bumped up to £35, while Remastered for PS5 will be £45 and includes the un-upgraded game for PS4 – the £10 difference being the cost of upgrading to the new generation release, and you’re actually buying Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition (original version) along with the Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered upgrade.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s an awful lot of people out there who already own Horizon Zero Dawn, whether they bought the base game at launch on disc, grabbed the Complete Edition bundle, bought it on PC, or snagged it as a freebie during <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/20/free-horizon-zero-dawn-play-at-home-how-can-i-download-link-ps4-ps5/">the Play At Home initiative</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>For pretty much all players, you will be able to upgrade to Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered for £10. The only caveat is that if bought on disc, you will then need the disc to be inserted to play.</p>

<p>The added caveat for PC players is that Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered will also require a PlayStation Network account, as is now an enforced requirement for PlayStation’s PC games – it was an optional log in for Forbidden West’s PC release, but is now mandatory and a bone of contention for PC gamers.</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is coming just seven years after the game’s breakout success in 2017, with Sony and Guerrilla Games deciding that’s enough time to be able to show an appreciable step up in terms of visual fidelity and production. The graphics have been updated so that they match the fidelity found in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, and there will be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> support right from the off. Additionally,&nbsp;over ten hours of dialogue has been re-recorded with improved motion capture and facial animations.</p>
<p>We scored the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review/">a great 8/10 upon its original 2017 release</a>, enjoying the deep sci-fi tale that Guerrilla told, the precision battling against the robots that now roam the Earth, and soaking in the technical showcase that Guerrilla had cooked up on PS4. We think it still holds up very well to this day.</p>

			<p>The Bloodborne PC remaster project is being developed with great attention to detail, as showcased in a new video shared online this week.</p>
<p>The project developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a> is taking great care in the creation of the project, showcasing in a new video how much the game changes by adding point lights to candles while explaining how the game renders point lights and how much performance could be impacted by these changes. The video also showcases some of the improvements made to Yahar 'gul Unseen Village, performance concerns, and how the performance impact could be mitigated.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bloodborne PC Remaster Project is all about attention to detail" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6beXWLRYJd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Bloodborne remaster project is being made possible by the amazing improvements made to the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator. In just a few months, the emulator went from being able to only boot the game to running it with improved resolution and performance, and even managing to run it on a dated machine sporting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-fanmade-remaster-improved-models/">GTX 960 with only 2 GB of VRAM</a>. Emulation still isn't 100% perfect, but it definitely won't take long to finally be able to properly experience Bloodborne on PC, something that Sony still doesn't seem to be interested in offering.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator that is making the Bloodborne remaster project possible can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-new-model-review-seeing-red<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Blood Angels are one of the most iconic Founding Legions of the Space Marines. Decked out in deep, blood red power armor (or shimmering gold armor), they represent flawless perfection and - ever since the tragic death of their Primarch - maddening rage. Games Workshop just sent us a batch of new <em>Warhammer 40K </em>Blood Angels&nbsp;models, so follow along as I see red with my review.</p>
<h2><b>Warhammer 40K Blood Angels: Sanguinary Guard</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-sanguinary-guard.jpg?itok=XLDjV6BG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-sanguinary-guard.jpg?itok=jJmKBH1x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>What the Sanguinary Guard do best: </em>The Sanguinary Guard, clad in gold masterwork armor (giving them a nice 4+ Invulnerable Save), are particularly good at holding objectives, thanks to their two special abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>How to run them:</em> If you’re really hoping to hunker down on an objective and control it with your Sanguinary Guard, make sure you build a model with the banner (bumping up their OC to 2 per model), and I would also recommend building them with Inferno Pistols, which have Melta 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means any enemies who come within 3” of your Sanguinary Guard will have to face down pistols dishing out D3+2 damage per successful wound. So get them in there on an objective and severely punish anyone who comes too close!</p>

<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-captain.jpg?itok=N329GAEY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-captain.jpg?itok=Er6YE3oM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>What the Blood Angels Captain does best:</em> The Blood Angels Captain is much like many other Captains in your typical Space Marines army, with only slight differences between him and a traditional Space Marines Captain. For one, he comes with an Invulnerable Save 4+ built in, and has a Heavy Bolt Pistol instead of a regular Bolt Pistol. Along with that, he also has a Master-crafted Chainsword instead of a regular Chainsword (the difference there being 2 Damage on the Master-crafted, vs. 1).</p>
<p><em>How to run him:</em> You’ll want to attach him to a group that’s comfortable getting stuck in and battling in hand-to-hand combat, as his “Finest Hour” ability is really strong with the Master-crafted Chainsword, as it reads: Once per battle, at the start of the Fight phase, this model can use this ability. If it does, until the end of the phase, add 3 to the Attacks characteristic of melee weapons equipped by this model and those weapons have the [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability.</p>
<h2><b>Warhammer 40K Blood Angels: Sanguinary Priest</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-sanguinary-priest.jpg?itok=3oF33-0q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-sanguinary-priest.jpg?itok=eAnJoqs0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>What the Sanguinary Priest does best:</em> The Sanguinary Priest, looking very sharp in shock-white armor with hints of that classic crimson, is all about the unit it’s attached to. With his “Sanguinary Priest” ability, when he’s leading a unit, models in that unit have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability. Thank the good doctor here, for the wounds your unit may end up shrugging off.</p>
<p><em>How to run him:</em> The above ability, paired with his other ability “Blood Chalice,” means you’ll want to attach him to a unit that’s not afraid to peek their heads out and take their shot. The “Blood Chalice” ability reads: While this model is leading a unit, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of melee weapons equipped by models in that unit by 1.</p>
<p>Of the units you can attach the Sanguinary Priest to, the best to benefit from “Blood Chalice” is probably the Assault Intercessor Squad, Devastator Squad, or the Tactical Squad because of their Chainswords (and the ability to upgrade a Sergeant’s Chainsword with something even better).</p>
<h2><b>Warhammer 40K Blood Angels: The Sanguinor</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-sanguinor.jpg?itok=625Ioydb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-sanguinor.jpg?itok=XRrt2KzZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>What the Sanguinor does best: </em>Saving perhaps the most exciting for last (although I’m a BIG fan of that Sanguinary Guard, to be honest), is The Sanguinor. Described as a mysterious figure who only fights in the most momentous battles, the Sanguinor hits VERY hard with his Encarmine Broadsword (8 attacks, WS 2+, 6 Strength, -3 AP, 2 damage), and can pop in to surprise your opponent from reserves.</p>
<p><em>How to run him: </em>As mentioned above, his “Miraculous Saviour,” ability can truly catch your opponent off guard. It reads: Once per battle, at the end of your opponent’s Charge phase, if this model is still in Reserves, you can select one enemy unit that made a Charge move this phase. Set this model up on the battlefield within Engagement Range of that enemy unit.</p>
<p>To pop the Sanguinor in just as an enemy unit is charging, and then hit them hard and fast (this unit has Strike First), can really throw them off their game. And the threat of holding The Sanguinor in the wings will keep your opponent thinking (and hopefully over-thinking) each charge they make.</p>
<h2>Warhammer 40K Blood Angels New Models - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>These new models look (as with any Astartes that eschews the very basic army look) incredible. From solid-gold warriors to heroes and leaders that stand out from the crowd, there’s no denying the dynamic look of these units on the table. As for how the play, each of the units we’ve covered here does their job well, with The Sanguinor and the Sanguinary Guard being the two true standouts.</p>
<p>If you’re building a Blood Angels army, I think it’s worth seriously considering at least one or two Sanguinary Guard units, as their ability to hold an objective can’t be denied.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The long-rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-rumor-skull-and-bones-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of Assassin's Creed Black Flag</a> may be closer than we thought. That's what insider Tom Henderson has shared in his latest report <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published on Insider Gaming</a>.</p>
<p>Henderson admitted to having believed that this project was still some time off in the future. However, he recently got his hands on new documents that suggest the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake was actually scheduled for a November 2025 launch, around the same time as Assassin's Creed Invictus, the new multiplayer experience. That was before the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, though; Henderson also saw an internal Ubisoft email confirming that the postponement of the new installment would affect the rest of the Assassin's Creed roadmap. As such, it seems prudent to assume the remake is now coming at some point in 2026.</p>
<p>We first heard of this project <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-rumor-skull-and-bones-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in June 2023</a> through a report published by Kotaku. That report also suggested Ubisoft Singapore, the developer behind Skull &amp; Bones, would be heavily involved with the remake. Fans might balk at this, given how Skull &amp; Bones turned out, but that game was very much based on Black Flag's ship combat and as such, the studio will have certainly researched the Assassin's Creed title in great detail.</p>
<p>The sixth mainline installment in Ubisoft's most successful series launched in October 2013 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii U, and PC. Assassin's Creed Black Flag quickly garnered critical acclaim for its open world gameplay, improved naval combat, interesting side quests, amazing graphics, enticing story and characters, and of course the unique pirate theme.</p>
<p>The main story followed the historical figure of Welsh pirate Edward Kenway, who, in the series' lore, is also the grandfather of Assassin's Creed III protagonist Connor. Players can freely roam the Caribbeans, engage in ship combat, and even dive underwater to find treasures. The biggest cities featured in the game were Havana, Nassau, and Kingston.</p>
<p>In other news, Ubisoft is reportedly looking into a partnership with Tencent to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-planning-ubisoft-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy out the company and go private</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Like the 2001 original, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> is a dense game with lots to find within it if you're willing to scour its foggy and dark corners. With a greater emphasis on combat and a few areas that feel larger and more involved, and with new puzzles that often require multiple steps to complete, though, it's going to be a while before you can escape that town. If you're wondering just how long it'll take, that depends greatly on how completionist you intend to be and whether you want to leap into Silent Hill 2 Remake's depths to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/silent-hill-2-remake-endings-guide-how-to-unlock-all-eight-endings-including-new-ones/2900-5831/">find its many endings--eight in all</a>--and other secrets.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's everything you need to know about Silent Hill 2's playtime and what you can expect to uncover if you're willing to spend more time within the nightmare. Naturally, <strong>beware of some light story spoilers</strong> in this article.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How long to beat Silent Hill 2</h2><p dir="ltr">Your playtime on Silent Hill 2 will vary greatly based on how much time you spend exploring the town, searching out-of-the-way places, and gathering extra materials. This is especially true at key points like the early game, when you'll have access to a lot of the town and can check a number of spots that aren't part of the essential path forward. Among the members of GameSpot's team who played Silent Hill 2 Remake ahead of launch, <strong>we found the game to last between 17 and 19 hours on an initial playthrough</strong>, when we were pretty diligent about searching for secrets. If you're less worried about searching for secrets and extra ammo, <strong>you can probably expect Silent Hill 2 Remake to last you 15-16 hours on your first run</strong>.</p><div tabindex="0"

			<p>Surprisingly, Halo Infinite is getting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-update-march-2024-networking-overhaul-easy-anti-cheat/">new update</a>. A game that some Halo fans thought was forgotten about by 343 Industries, today announced some groundbreaking news for those who still play the game. During a Forge panel at the 2024 Halo World Championship, 343 Industries announced that they are working on a <a href="https://x.com/Halo/status/1842316353719402932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1842316353719402932%7Ctwgr%5Eea37bb3341dd1839f9adae1d399ee8faef7c42c3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fhalo-infinite-is-officially-getting-a-third-person-mode-this-november" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third-person mode in-game</a>. This is a huge deal for fans of the Halo franchise, as this is the first time ever that a third-person mode has been offered up in a Halo game. All previous iterations in the franchise have been strictly first-person. During the Forge panel at the Halo World Championship, Senior Community Manager John "Unyshek" Junyszek and Skybox Labs Senior Software Engineer Colin Cove spoke in more detail about the third-person mode and what it will entail for players in Halo: Infinite.</p>
<p><iframe title="Community Stage at Halo World Championship 2024 – Day 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jLgH0jgAhB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For starters, they will be adding the third-person mode to Firefight in a future update, "but we also have the ability to do it in PvP and control it in Forge," says Cove. They made sure to clarify that the third-person mode will be supported at the mode level, and using Forge Controls, modes can switch individual players or all players between first and third-person modes whenever they want.</p>
<p>At the moment, it hasn't been specified whether this groundbreaking third-person mode will be restricted to multiplayer, or whether it will be offered to those who prefer to play the game solely as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-campaign-dlc-isnt-in-active-development-community-director-confirms-focus-on-multiplayer/">campaign</a>. Over the years, Halo Infinite has seen many mods, with a number of these mods being used to add a third-person perspective to the game. While this is a monumental occasion for Halo: Infinite fans, it is unlikely that any of the previous Halo games will receive the same treatment despite getting a remaster.</p>
<p>Halo has a huge modding community, with a number of mods being made for the original Halo games as well as Halo Infinite. While there are mods out there that can add a third-person perspective, it will now be much easier for players to switch between the two perspectives as it will be fully built-in to the game. However, if it isn't brought over to the campaign, it may be something that people will still need to mod in.</p>
<p>Halo Infinite was first launched in 2021 and has received plenty of updates over the years to keep the game fresh. Despite this, some fans felt that there was still a lack of content, especially in 2024. However, the Halo World Championship is currently taking place, and this would be the perfect time for 343 Industries and Xbox to announce more Halo content. It's entirely possible that there will be more announcements to come through the weekend of the Halo Championship.</p>

For those who aren't at the event, the announcement was also posted on X/Twitter, including a bit of work-in-progress footage of third-person mode in action: </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Halo (@Halo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Halo/status/1842316353719402932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>As fans will know, this marks the first time a third-person mode has ever been officially offered in a Halo game. Senior community manager John "Unyshek" Junyszek and Skybox Labs senior software engineer Colin Cove offered a bit more information at the Halo World Championship panel, saying they'll be starting with third-person Firefight mode in a future update, "but we also have the ability to do in PvP and control it in Forge," per Cove.</p><p>They clarified that third-person will be supported at the mode level and that, with Forge controls, modes can switch individual players (or all players) between first- and third-person perspective whenever desired. It's currently unclear if it will be available in campaign mode or restricted to multiplayer. </p><p>While this is the first time third-person mode has been available on an official level, a number of mods have added it to the game over the years and have been largely well-received by the community. </p><p>Halo Infinite first launched in 2021, receiving a number of new maps, modes, quality-of-life improvements, and other additions over the years. <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1804917503845368176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some fans, however, had started</a> to note a general lack of developer-made additional content for this year. With the Halo World Championship well underway, we wouldn't be surprised if more Halo-related announcements were made through the weekend.</p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

Designed by the video game's original creator, Edmund McMillen, The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls is a strategy card game with cooperative and competitive elements. You and up to three friends will join forces to collect souls--four of them, naturally--from the game's monstrous bosses. During your journey, you'll find loot, upgrade your abilities, and fight a wide variety of creatures pulled from the video game. If you're feeling diabolical, you can deliberately sabotage your own teammates. That said, if you're playing solo, you probably won't want to sabotage yourself. Each run lasts around 30 minutes.</p><p>The Ultimate Collector's Edition comes with the revised, 2nd Edition base set and both expansions, Requiem and Four Souls+. All told, you're getting 707 cards across the three sets. That's <em>a lot </em>of cards to keep track of, but the 12 included dividers should help you keep the collector's box organized. You also get two dice, one of which is Binding of Isaac-themed, two different types of tokens, and everything else needed for the complete Foul Souls experience. </p><p>Here's everything you'll find inside the Ultimate Collector's Box:</p><ul><li>340 Binding of Isaac 2nd Edition Cards (Base Set)</li><li>269 Requiem Expansion Cards</li><li>98 Four Souls+ Expansion Cards</li><li>Instruction Booklet</li><li>12 Card Dividers</li><li>15 Heart Tokens</li><li>15 Tear Tokens</li><li>100 Plastic Pennies</li><li>10 Plastic Nickels</li><li>Coin Bag</li><li>Dice: D6 with Isaac graphic on one side and D8</li></ul><hr><h2>The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls Base Set</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4379299-bindingofisaacstandard.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4379299" data-ratio="0.573" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4379299-bindingofisaacstandard.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4379299"></a><figcaption>The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls Base Set</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4379299-bindingofisaacstandard.jpg"></figure><p>The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls Base Set comes with 340 cards, plastic pennies, two dice (D6 and D8), and instructions.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/halo-infinite-third-person-mode-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been announced by 343 Industries that Halo Infinite is getting a third-person mode in November. Dubbed a ‘new way to play’, the third-person mode in Halo Infinite has been branded nothing more than ‘Fortnite-ification’ by some users, and at first glimpse, the gameplay shown from that perspective certainly is reminiscent of the popular battle royale.</p>



<p>It’s not a groundbreaking update, but it’s <strong>something </strong>that should bring people back to Halo Infinite, even if they’ll only hang around for a game or two to test out the new third-person perspective.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-halo-infinite-isn-t-forever">Halo Infinite Isn’t Forever</h2>



<p>Halo Infinite has struggled with maintaining an active player base more or less since it was released in December 2021. It has ebbed and flowed, but over time, the player count has dropped at a steady pace. Once upon a time, it was because updates weren’t coming fast enough, and now it tends to be that updates applied to the game just aren’t meaningful enough.</p>



<p>As the Halo World Championship unravels in Seattle, 343 Industries has revealed the next evolution of Halo Infinite with a fresh third-person mode.</p>



<p>It was unveiled on social media along with a work-in-progress gameplay clip:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It doesn’t look terrible, but I’m bad enough at Halo Infinite when I play from a first-person perspective, so third-person might just bamboozle me more than ever. Unfortunately, the community is mostly against this update, with many suggesting it’s a waste of time and resources at 343 Industries to be pushing content like this instead of anything a bit meatier.</p>



<p>What do you think? Are you going to give third-person mode a try in Halo Infinite? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

And they've gradually been discovering a pretty cool secret about its map: it "links" up almost perfectly with the map from <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past">A Link to the Past</a>.</p><p>More and more players have been sharing posts on social media comparing the maps of Echoes of Wisdom and A Link to the Past, and have figured out that Echoes of Wisdom basically uses the same map from A Link to the Past... <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/echoesofwisdom/comments/1fqmyqu/the_eow_map_is_basically_a_very_expanded_alttp_map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just expanded</a>. A number of major landmarks can still be found in the same spots as in Link to the Past, though they've changed or aged seemingly with the passage of time. </p><p>What's more, most of Echoes of Wisdom's brand new locations exist outside the boundaries where Link to the Past's map stopped, implying that civilizations like the Goron and Gerudo could have always existed in Link to the Past, they just weren't accessible in that particular game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s truly amazing how Grezzo made the Echoes of Wisdom map with such care. It lines up with A Link to the Past’s Hyrule in a way that maybe the Gorons, Gerudo, Zora, and Dekus DID live there, just outside where we could explore. And it explains why they don’t know Zelda/Hyrule. <a href="https://t.co/MANVHl5S97" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/MANVHl5S97</a></p>— Rebecca Stone (Taylor’s Version) (@forestminish) <a href="https://twitter.com/forestminish/status/1842239724464849034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review">We chatted with our own reviewer, Tom Marks</a>, about this phenomenon, who agreed with the parallels. He pointed out to us that landmarks especially around Hyrule Castle will be familiar to Zelda veterans. The graveyard and church are in the right spots, and the hill where Link's house was in Link to the Past is still there too, even though the Echoes of Wisdom Link lives in Suthorn Village.</p><p>There are other comparison points fans are finding. Eastern Palace, for instance, is still present in the same spot and even includes a sidequest. Where Kakariko Village used to be, Echoes of Wisdom has ruins, implying it was moved at some point. There are also Desert Palace ruins, Swamp Ruins is in the right place, and so much more. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There’s A Link to the Past DNA scattered throughout the overworld in Echoes of Wisdom and it makes me feel warm inside. Let’s take a quick tour, starting with the destroyed ruins of the Desert Palace. <a href="https://t.co/CCP1eifuRF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/CCP1eifuRF</a></p>— Metroid Mike 64 (@MetroidMike64) <a href="https://twitter.com/MetroidMike64/status/1842032665052021200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Echoes of Wisdom is far from the first Zelda game that's involved clever, if subtle, map tricks. A Link to the Past itself famously included both a Light and Dark variation on the same world. And when Tears of the Kingdom came out, we wrote about how its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tears-of-the-kingdoms-depths-hides-one-of-the-biggest-zelda-secrets-ever">Depths was essentially an underground mirror of the surface</a>.</p><p>What's most curious for Zelda lore buffs will be whether or not this answers meaningful questions about Echoes of Wisdom's place on the Zelda timeline. Could this in fact put Echoes of Wisdom in the timeline post-Link to the Past and Link Between Worlds? Or is this some alternate universe situation? We'll need Zelda scholars to sort this one out.</p><p>As you look for these parallels in your own playthrough, check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">wiki guides</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-interactive-map">our own interactive map</a> whether you're exploring the similarities yourself, or just looking for more heart containers.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Some like hunting for incredibly rare loot and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/diablo-ii-streamer-finds-1-in-3-million-item-drop-instantly-sells-it-for-laughs/">maybe selling it on a livestream</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, you dive into high-level <em>Diablo</em> just for a chance to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsNx0DGrSW8">kill a screen full of monsters really quickly</a>.</p>
<p>If that kind of high-density enemy killing is what you're looking for, <em>Halls of Torment</em>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdQweTEsOUE">recent Version 1.0 release</a> is a near-perfect take on the concept. Despite the decidedly old-school presentation, the game takes very modern inspiration from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> and its quick-hit bursts of leveling up through overwhelming enemy hordes. In doing so, it has become my absolute favorite way to wipe out enemies at rates approaching and exceeding 50,000/hour, at some points.</p>
<h2><em>Survivors</em> of the fittest</h2>
<p>If you've played <em>Vampire Survivors</em> you'll be intimately familiar with the basic gameplay loop in <em>Halls of Torment</em>. You start as <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=smol%20bean">just a smol bean</a> with a weak weapon and slowly pick at a trickle of grunts that march toward you from the edges of the screen. Each defeated enemy drops gems that contribute to a leveling system for better stats and more efficient killing, which is crucial because the enemy hordes quickly increase in both density and relentlessness.</p>
<p>Eventually, the grunts get joined by bosses that absorb more attacks and lob tougher-to-dodge projectiles. Taking these down lets you customize your builds with new attack options ranging from auras of protection to semi-autonomous ghostly fighters to giant mace balls that swing in huge circles.</p>


<p>By the end of each timed, 30-minute dungeon-crawling session, the screen is utterly filled with all sorts of fantasy trope beasts, rushing your position and (hopefully) falling to the epilepsy-inducing flurry of powerful abilities you've built up over time. They also make some god-awful&nbsp;racket as they pass—the din of overlapping skeleton bone-rattles has been haunting my dreams after <em>Halls of Torment</em> sessions.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Your first <em>Halls of Torment</em> run starts with a basic warrior, but new classes quickly unlock, each with their own distinct weapons and gameplay rhythms. My favorite ended up being the exterminator class, which uses a flamethrower to simply turn everything around him into a wall of flame. If that's not your speed, you can choose from defensive shieldbearers with extremely slow attacks, melee axe-wielders that swing quickly with wild abandon, ranged archers that can deal damage from afar, magic-users that make heavy use of area-of-effect spells, a class with a semi-autonomous dog that goes after nearby enemies, and more.</p>
<h2><em>Diablo</em>, but also not <em>Diablo</em></h2>
<p>Just from glancing at <em>Halls of Torment</em> screenshots, it's easy to glean the heavy visual influence the game owes to the grainy, isometric sprites of old-school <em>Diablo</em>. That throwback, nostalgic appeal extends to little touches like the menu system and low-fi voiceovers for NPCs as well, which comes across as a deliberate if cheesy design choice.</p>
<p>The game's old-school sprites also make it easier for your graphics card to handle literally hundreds of moving objects and flashy attack effects on screen at once, too. Despite this, my relatively high-end system started struggling to maintain a consistent frame rate by the end of the more difficult dungeons.</p>


<p>The visual frenzy of all these old-school sprites can get a bit overwhelming, especially when some of your own summon attacks end up difficult to distinguish at a glance from enemy threats. Overall, though, the use of distinct colors makes it easy enough to quickly evaluate a screen full of information and extrapolate what it will look like over the coming seconds. I especially appreciated the big, purple lines and circles that telegraph where projectile attacks are going to appear just moments before they do.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Looks aside, the sheer density of enemies means <em>Halls of Torment</em> sometimes feels less like <em>Diablo</em> and more like playing an old-school bullet-hell shooter. It becomes a game of exploiting small gaps in the enemy lines to stay safe, carefully managing your relative position to manage the movements of the (relatively dumb) enemy groups. There's a subtle push and pull inherent in staying close enough to do maximum damage (and collect the crucial gem drops) while keeping enough distance so the hordes collapse your exit route and quickly overwhelm you.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, which automatically focuses most attacks on the nearest enemy, <em>Halls of Torment</em> offers you the ability to actually aim your attacks with either the right analog stick or the mouse. That might sound like a small difference, but it makes a large impact when you're trying to carve your way through a seemingly impassable wall of enemies or trying to protect a flank that's threatening to close up as you run in the opposite direction. You can also toggle auto-aim and fire options, though, if you're looking for a one-handed play option.</p>
<p><em>Halls of Torment</em> also leans heavily on an inherent character regeneration stat, which lets most characters recover health over time, sometimes rather quickly. This makes the game rather forgiving of small mistakes—if you need to squeeze past a grunt, the damage they do can be fully erased with a minute or so of careful play.</p>

<h2>Number goes up</h2>


<p>My biggest complaint with <em>Halls of Torment</em> so far is the overwhelmingly similar feeling of all six of the game's main dungeon areas—they mostly stick to tired tropes like "the fire pit" and "the frozen tundra." Cosmetics aside, most of the areas feel like the same big, open space with occasional walls or other barriers to get in your way. The one exception is a long bridge with two dueling armies that encroach from either side, which mixed things up just enough to be interesting.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
        
        
        
        <div>
          
          
<p>My first few runs through these areas didn't feel all that challenging, maybe because of my dozens of hours of experience with <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. After unlocking the basics, though, the endgame opens up with an "Agony" mode that scales up the difficulty as you level up and lets you activate enemy-enhancing artifacts for even more challenge. The extra difficulty here tends to ride that thin line between "impossible" and "boring" well and provides a good excuse to keep purchasing new, permanent stat upgrades and equipment in between runs.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JdQweTEsOUE?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>Completionists will also be enamored with <em>Halls of Torment</em>'s ridiculous stack of 500 (Five. Hundred.) different tracked achievements. Most of these simply require hitting certain inexorable numbers—killing X enemies, doing Y amount of damage with Z effect—but a few ask you to focus on a particular class and/or leveling structure, giving you some meta-goal to focus on in a particular run. Completing more achievements also increases your leveling rate for future runs, leading to a satisfying "number gets bigger" loop from run to run.</p>
<p>And getting those big numbers—both in terms of damage and kill count—is a large part of the point. Sometimes you only have a half hour of gaming to spare and need to let off some steam by killing tens of thousands of on-screen beasts with as little complex thought as possible. These moments are what <em>Halls of Torment</em> was made for.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-review">Sea of Thieves</a>' 14th season is almost upon us; Rare has confirmed it'll be bringing a whole bunch of new stealthy treats to its multiplayer pirate adventure on 17th October.
</p>
<p>
When last we heard hints of Season 14, it was all the way back in March, when Rare <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-bumper-2024-bringing-windy-horns-grapple-guns-a-roaming-warship-and-loads-more">laid out its content plans for 2024</a>. And while today's release date announcement was a little light on specifics - a proper season breakdown video is scheduled to arrive soon - we do at least have some idea of what it'll bring thanks to that early showing.
</p>
<p>
As per March's roadmap, Season 14 is all about introducing a stealthier, more mischievous style of play to Sea of Thieves, with new additions - assuming plans haven't dramatically changed - set to include a crouch ability, plus the power to hang off the side of ships, even stuff yourself into a chest and scuttle around undetected.

<p>
That's on top of a new multi-purpose blow dart that's able to lure skeletons to specific positions, trigger bamboozling sound effects, and more, as well as the ability to place spring traps in the world. Most excitingly of all, though, pirates will be able to whizz about the place (or reel stuff in) using the new grappling gun tool.
</p><p>
The grappling gun is the one of the few parts of Season 14 that <em>did</em> get a proper mention during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhWZt2oQrvU">Rare's latest news showcase</a>, with production director Drew Stevens outlining some of the limitations Rare has put in place to make it fairer for smaller crews. 
</p>
<p>
Essentially, pirates won't be able to use the grappling gun to bypass sideladders and gain easy entry to the sloop or brigantine - that is, grapple directly onboard from the sea or grapple onboard from above - but it <em>can</em> still be used to reach sideladders and to reposition alongside ships during a chase. These limitations don't, however, apply to the galleon, with grappling guns now giving those larger crews new vulnerability points.
</p>
<p>
An additional combat-related tweak PvP crews will need to keep in mind is that, as of Season 14, a ship's armoury can only be used by its own crew. That means invading crews will need to plan tactically before heading into combat.
</p>
<p>
And finally for the Season 14 tidbits Rare is currently willing to share, Outposts are getting new items for pirates to spend their hard-earned gold on: wrap-style shirts, the casino-themed Lucky Hand ship set and weapons, plus the Rusted Skulls clothing, makeup, accessories, and tattoos.
</p><p>
Ahead of Season 14's PlayStation 5, Xbox, and PC arrival on 17th October, Sea of Thieves will host another Gilded Voyages event, running from 10th to 17th October, giving players the opportunity to score "boatloads" of valuable loot on behalf of the Gold Hoarders, Merchant Alliance, Order of Souls, and Athena's Fortune. Additionally, a weekend of Sea of Thieves <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> Drops is scheduled from 17th-21st October, with the Season Sailor Pistols, plus Sage Sea Dog Shovel and Drum, all up for grabs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-science-saru-netflix<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you ever been watching <em>X-Files</em> and thought, wow, I love this, but it would be even better if it was an anime set in high school, and also if all the aliens were obsessed with stealing Mulder’s cock and balls? <em>DanDaDan</em> is here to answer your prayers.</p><p>The anime, which premiered on Netflix, Hulu and Crunchyroll this week, is a perfect blend of slapstick action comedy and sweet high school romance. The series revolves around characters Momo Ayase, a no-nonsense teenage girl who believes in spirits, and Ken Takakura, a nerdy loner who is obsessed with UFOs. After meeting in high school and wanting to prove the other wrong about the existence of their hyperfixation, they instead learn that they’re <em>both</em> right: aliens and spirits are real. And for some reason, they’re obsessed with Ken Takakura’s dick.</p><p>The manga, which is illustrated and written by Yokinobu Tatsu and currently running in Shonen Jump, shows just how twisty and turny this zany concept can get. As Momo and Ken inevitably start to fall for each other, they also meet alien sumo wrestlers, ancient snake spirits, and a hair metal band that performs exorcisms. I was lucky enough to catch the first three episodes of the anime adaptation when it premiered in theaters last month, and it translates the mile-a-minute genre changes perfectly. If you’ve seen other anime produced by Science Saru, like <em>Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!</em>, this shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. They have a knack for mixing down to earth human moments with fluid and inventive animation. I especially love the opening theme, which I think captures both the lighthearted and action-oriented parts of the series.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="DAN DA DAN - Opening | Otonoke by Creepy Nuts" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a4na2opArGY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Right now the series is releasing weekly, so I have a bit of a head start. If the entire show is as good as those first three episodes, then <em>DanDaDan</em> is going to be a lot of people’s new favorite show. And don’t worry, Takakura will get his penis back—eventually.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What if you aren’t? What does taking responsibility mean in a lawless place? <em>Mouthwashing </em>is an abrasive psychological horror game about jobs, leadership, responsibility, mental illness, and what happens when those things careen into each other with violence. It is often disgusting, occasionally touching, and one of the tightest narratives I have played all year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spoiler alert: </strong><strong><em>Mouthwashing </em></strong><strong>is about 3 hours long, most of which is narrative. This article discusses elements of the plot, some of which might be more impactful as a surprise.&nbsp; If you wanna go in blind, you have been warned.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475490/Mouthwashing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mouthwashing</em></a><em> </em>is a first person horror game by Swedish developer Wrong Organ. Four months have passed since the space freighter Tulpar was driven into a head-on collision with an asteroid. In the process the captain, Curly, was left with severe burns. The crew has four months of food left on the ship. Resentment and mental illness that were already present are starting to get worse. The situation is made worse by two revelations: that after this job the entire crew is going to be laid off by their employer Pony Express (implicitly in favor of automation), and that the entire reason for the voyage that stranded them was a cargo hold full of Dragonbreath X brand mouthwash.</p><figure><figcaption>Glitching, data-moshing transitions are shockingly original. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p>The structure of <em>Mouthwashing </em>is nonlinear, jumping back and forth between the perspectives of Captain Curly and his co-pilot Jimmy before and after the crash. These jumps take the form of sudden data moshing transitions and complex interactive dream sequences that serve as metaphors for the plot and collapsing mental state of the crew. Before the crash, we see the web of relationships that led to the ship being driven off course – Curly knows he is a good captain who can do better than this job but sticks with it because it is safe. Jimmy, his long time friend, slightly envies him for that.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The captain must be fed his painkillers. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p>After the crash, Jimmy takes over for Curly’s duties as the de-facto leader. Curly was heavily burned in the cockpit when the ship crashed. He is now unable to speak and heavily bandaged; only force-feeding him a slowly dwindling supply of painkillers will silence his cries. Other members of the crew are not taking it well either: The discovery of a mountain of mouthwash and impending mass layoffs prompts Swansea, an older man with a family and not much work left in him to break a 15 year sober streak and bully Daisuke, the gullible intern, into a dangerous and toxic drinking binge. Anya, the ship’s nurse, buckles under feelings of inadequacy and other severe health and interpersonal issues. Jimmy, now in the role of captain, convinces himself he can fix a situation that may not be fixable.</p><figure><figcaption>Happy (single work-allotted) birthday. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p>There are brief moments of hope in that despair, fleeting glances of interpersonal joy between the crew members. Swansea as a cantankerous grease monkey and Daisuke as the green intern have good chemistry early on. Jimmy and Curly clearly have built up a legitimate, albeit strained, friendship over the years. The Tulpar is filled with the bare minimum amenities for the mental health of the crew, which they still manage to enjoy. Pony Express has rationed a single birthday party for the crew which is joyous before it isn’t. In one flashback prior to the crash, Anya and Captain Curly stare at the wraparound OLED that imitates the night sky in the lounge, and she points to a dead pixel on the screen that she cannot unsee. “I have to believe that our worst moments don’t make us monsters,”&nbsp; Anya repeats often. The game allots you tiny rations of joy, so much to make starving to death feel worse.</p><figure><figcaption>The crew discusses matters in the foamed-up cockpit. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p><em>Mouthwashing </em>is of a piece with a lot of art I enjoy. It shares a currently in-vogue chunky PS1 style like the recent <a href="https://aftermath.site/arctic-eggs-cooking-eggs-retro-egg-flipping-simulator-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Artic Eggs</em></a><em> </em>and<em> </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/crow-country-review-indie-survival-horror-game-lowfi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Crow Country</em></a>, both of which I enjoyed. It is in the same tonal neighborhood as many of Kojima’s freakier stylistic touches in games like <em>P.T.</em>, <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> and <em>Death Stranding</em>. I was also reminded of the 2018 Swedish science fiction movie <em>Aniaria </em>and Claire Denis’ <em>High Life </em>from the same year, both of which deal with the violent and psychological consequences of being marooned in space.</p><figure><figcaption>Images flash on the screen often. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p>But above all <em>Silent Hill </em>looms heaviest in my mind, appropriately timed given the upcoming remake of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloober_Team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloober Team</a>. <em>Mouthwashing </em>is a game about longtime coworkers and friends pushed to their breaking point, about the things we do to each other and what we think we owe each other. The people here are damned, like James Sunderland and everyone he meets in <em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>Nightmare sequences become extended visual metaphor. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p><em>Mouthwashing </em>is meant to leave a queasy feeling in the pit of your stomach, and it succeeds at that. Sometimes it touches its subjects with the subtlety of a sledgehammer – extended torturous sequences of cruelty that may be too abject for some to handle (although even an obvious metaphor rendered maximally can be effective). Other times it deploys itself with shocking nuance and humanity, gorgeous, layered storytelling that stays with you. But even when the experience gets too much to bear, it does so in a way that is narratively taut and stylistically jaw-dropping. You do not linger, and there is little fat in this narrative.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Moments of calm. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p>In many ways the experience is similar in size and shape to this year’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/silent-hill-the-short-message-pt-konami" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Silent Hill: The Short Message</em></a>. Both games can be finished in one sitting, and technically do have puzzles, but only in a way to provide a slight interactive resistance to the player. But <em>The Short Message</em>, for all its faults, is fundamentally a far more compassionate narrative. There is beauty and hope at the core of <em>The Short Message, </em>particularly near the end. <em>Mouthwashing</em> is pure hell. I am sure that it will leave a foul taste in some people’s mouths, although that is precisely what it sets out to do.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I don't get paid enough for this! Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p>There are severe depictions, both literal and metaphorical, of interpersonal abuse and self-harm, and while it could be argued that those should be signposted a bit better, I don’t think the game makers have a responsibility to pull their punches when engineering The Void. To quote Claire Dennis at a Q&amp;A for <em>High Life, </em>“<a href="https://www.avclub.com/we-were-afraid-of-the-void-claire-denis-on-working-w-1834092997" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I am not a social worker</a>.” <em>Mouthwashing </em>is a game about ambition, capitalism, and the delusions that people in power create for themselves to justify gaining and exercising that power. What does being a manager do to your soul, particularly when a role in management is often an economic lifeboat? And how many horrors stem from working within a system built on a foundation of exploitation and cruelty?</p><figure><figcaption>Safety first. Credit: Wrong Organ</figcaption></figure><p>There is another recurring character in <em>Mouthwashing </em>outside of the crew, a garish generic pony mascot for the Pony Express company named Polle. His goofy face is plastered all over the ship’s safety posters, and a lifesize statue of him stands in the common area caterwauling to passersby, his eyes locked in a <em>Five Nights At Freddy’s</em> style rictus. During one of the many metaphorical dream sequences, you must slowly creep through a warehouse of crates of mouthwash to avoid being caught by a dragon-like horse monster. Though you can see him thrash, and indentations where his serpentine neck have crushed the catwalk, his body and face are invisible except briefly when viewed through a special blacklight given only to the captains of the ship. Your only hint in beating him is a single note at the beginning, but it also sums up the game quite nicely.</p><p>&nbsp;“A blind beast, aimless and restless. You can’t run from it.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, rather than once again talking up the collection as a whole for this week’s entry, I’m going to focus on the one game I’ve been playing most within <em>UFO 50 </em>of late: <em>Grimstone, </em>the collection’s epic JRPG.</p><p>In many ways, <em>Grimstone </em>feels like a traditional early JRPG. It’s more <em>Final Fantasy I </em>than <em>Final Fantasy IV </em>or <em>VI</em>, with its blank-slate characters who never speak or have any personality beyond what you can glean from their expressive sprites and their natural tendencies toward sharpshootin’, shotgunnin’, or whatever their particular specialty might be. However, as those weapons may have indicated, <em>Grimstone </em>does differ from most early JRPGs in one crucial way: it eschews the traditional fantasy setting most of them employed for a really terrific “weird west” world, one in which gunslingers and ghost towns coexist alongside angels, demons, and all manner of strange and unsettling creatures and happenings. And even if the characters in your party don’t have much depth, the world itself does. What at first seems like a landscape against which a simplistic battle of good and evil is playing out reveals itself to be more complex and intriguing as you persevere through <em>Grimstone</em>’s surprisingly lengthy quest.</p><p>I think I’m finally nearing the end of that quest after playing <em>Grimstone </em>pretty obsessively in recent days, though I still have no idea quite what I’ll find at the end of the mysterious late-game dungeon that now awaits me. One thing I do know, however, is that no matter what I find, finishing <em>Grimstone </em>will hardly mark the end of my time with <em>UFO 50</em>, as it still has so many wonderful games whose surfaces I have yet to really scratch. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fallout 76 is almost six years old, and since it has been on the market, it has undergone a tumultuous journey. This year, the game skyrocketed in popularity thanks to the success of the Fallout live-action series, and that growth continues to climb several months later.</p>



<p>If you’re on the Public Test Server for Fallout 76, you’ll be able to download and start interacting with the new update <strong>today</strong>.</p>



<p>At the heart of the update is The Gleaming Depths raid, a first-of-its-kind event that serves as a fresh endgame activity. In The Gleaming Depths, players must use teamwork to survive against intense bosses and armies of enemies. In a multiplayer-focused twist that’s not typical for Fallout 76, The Gleaming Depths will almost <strong>require </strong>players to join forces and use a multitude of builds to succeed.</p>



<p>There are special rewards in store, though. Along with the various item drops, you’ll be able to ‘farm’ new four-star legendary weapons by taking part in raids. That also means that four-star enemies are coming to Fallout 76. </p>



<p>Also coming in the new update are ‘player titles’ that can be used to identity the type of Fallout gamer that you are, as well as C.A.M.P. pets and a whole slew of tweaks to mutated public events, perks, weapons, and other items and mechanics.</p>



<p>If you check out the full patch notes for this upcoming update, you’ll note that this is one of the largest patches to hit Fallout 76 in years.</p>

We’ve known for some time now, thanks to dataminers and rumors, that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteLeaks/comments/v6xxbs/epic_is_working_on_a_firstperson_mode_via_hypex/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteLeaks/comments/v6xxbs/epic_is_working_on_a_firstperson_mode_via_hypex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Epic has been working on a first-person mode for its popular battle royale game</a></span>. But this is the first official look at what the studio has been developing. Before this, the only way to get an FPS option in fan-made <em>Fortnite </em>maps was to use <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/gbUlhuPUzWQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/gbUlhuPUzWQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crude workarounds or camera hacks</a></span> that never felt great and were prone to bugs and glitches. Epic even acknowledged these workarounds in the blog post, opening it with: “Workarounds, begone.”</p><p>While an official FPS-like mode isn’t in the game <em>yet</em>, Epic’s new experimental tool lets us see what might be possible in the future. The module is now a part of the <em>Fortnite</em>-powered Unreal Engine editor known as UEFN. And the results look pretty good! I think most people would be fooled into thinking this was anything but <em>Fortnite</em>. </p><p>Now, this new module is still being built and tested, so Epic isn’t letting people publish maps with the FPS module included just yet. And not all weapons work perfectly with it and there are some graphical issues, too. But even in this rough state, it looks solid. </p><p>I bet it won’t be too long from now that Epic is offering up an FPS battle royale mode in <em>Fortnite</em>. And I’m excited to see what UEFN devs can whip up with the module once Epic improves it and lets players publish FPS games and maps. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-lego-pieces-worlds-uefn-creative-update-1851353810?_gl=1*18w56ps*_ga*MjAxMTA0MDE1Ny4xNzI1Njc1NzAy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyODA2OTA5MC42Mi4xLjE3MjgwNzM3NTIuNDcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-lego-pieces-worlds-uefn-creative-update-1851353810?_gl=1*18w56ps*_ga*MjAxMTA0MDE1Ny4xNzI1Njc1NzAy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyODA2OTA5MC42Mi4xLjE3MjgwNzM3NTIuNDcuMC4w"><em>Fortnite </em>is already like 200 different games</a></span>.
