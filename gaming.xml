                <p>There are few unmade video games more famous than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hills/" data-ref-id="5000-306236">Silent Hills</a> and its beloved Playable Trailer. Although P.T. is now very hard to find since Konami took it offline, an instructor in Japan is using it as a tool to teach students how to speak English.</p><p>Tsunan Secondary School in Niigata Prefecture <a href="https://tsunan-ss-edu.note.jp/n/n831cfb652bdc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared a blog entry</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-secondary-school-students-learn-english-by-playing-hideo-kojimas-p-t-demo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>) that demonstrated how an assistant language teacher utilized P.T. in class as a learning tool. Students were invited to play through P.T. in English, while other members of the class would get to weigh in on what the player should do next by using English phrases.</p><p>The blog noted that alarmingly loud ringing telephone from P.T. startled the fifth-year students, who are roughly the same age as high school sophomores. But this is one of the most novel ways to learn another language. It's impressive they have the game at all considering that the only easy way to play it is with PlayStation 4 consoles that downloaded it before P.T. was taken down.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima, director Guillermo del Toro, and actor Norman Reedus were lined up to collaborate on Silent Hills before Konami pulled the plug on the project. Kojima subsequently left the company and released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding/" data-ref-id="5000-451575">Death Stranding</a>, which featured Reedus in a leading role and del Toro in a cameo appearance. The sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" data-ref-id="5000-577622">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, was released earlier this year.</p><p>Kojima is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a>, an upcoming horror game with director Jordan Peele. One of the first trailers for OD appeared to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/od-trailer-seems-to-contain-silent-hills-reference/1100-6519914/" data-ref-id="1100-6519914">feature a Silent Hills callback</a>. A more recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-od-gives-us-p-t-vibes-in-new-preview/1100-6534933/" data-ref-id="1100-6534933">OD teaser trailer</a> was also very reminiscent of P.T., and Kojima subsequently stated that he had to make sure that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-had-to-make-sure-that-od-wasnt-haunted-by-a-real-ghost/1100-6534991/" data-ref-id="1100-6534991">he hadn't captured a real ghost</a> while he was visiting locations for the game. OD doesn't currently have a release date, but it's being produced by Xbox Game Studio in conjunction with Kojima Productions. Actors Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier are lending their likenesses and voices to the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Slot machines are, to put it lightly, just a tiny bit addictive. There’s that compulsion to go for just one more spin because that next one will <em>definitely</em> be the one to get you a jackpot. It’s almost devilish that Friedemann has taken the workings of a slot machine and wrapped a highly engrossing dungeon crawler around them. Slots &amp; Daggers mixes gambling with fighting monsters and attempting to overthrow an evil Lord. It is very entertaining.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slots &amp; Daggers Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jzvvhfs0VYY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The set up of Slots &amp; Daggers is simple. You are on a quest to overthrow the evil Lord Slother, but to do that you have to traverse through different places like swamps, sewers, and citadels. Luckily you can do that from the comfort of a seat at a table with a slot machine in front of you. You start your journey by picking three items to populate the rollers, with the initial offerings being a rusty sword and shield, but as you progress you will unlock better and more powerful items. Once you have picked the items, you begin the adventure.</p>


<p>The slot machine screen shows you the enemy you are facing, with their health and attack power also displayed. Below the screen are the slots, with a tray of coins to the left, for spending in the upgrade shop, and your health and shield bars to the right. Both you and enemies have melee and magic attacks to use, with magic being especially powerful as it bypasses shields altogether.</p>


<p>While the set up of Slots &amp; Daggers is simple, it is a game with a lot of depth to it. As you make your way through the game, you will be able to pick new weapons, skills, and power ups to take on stronger foes. There is a major tactical element to it too when deciding on which items to upgrade, add to your inventory, or even remove. You can pick as many items as you want, as long as you can afford them, but overloading the rollers with too many items can see you missing out on critical attacks or getting things you do not want. For example, if your shield is maxed out but you have a few shield items equipped, there is a big chance they will appear in a slot doing nothing when you would rather a weapon appear to attack. Some weapons and items have bonuses like dealing poison damage, or getting more powerful the more times they appear on screen.</p>
<p>You need to plan out what you think will get you through each enemy, but you cannot continuously rely on the same tactics as each enemy has their own tactics, strengths, and weaknesses to consider. The further you go, the stronger they get, so you need to be prepared. And in roguelite fashion, all your items, weapons and their upgrades are lost whenever you die.</p>

<p>Modifiers are available to unlock to help give you an advantage as permanent upgrades. These can be bought with the chips earned form defeating enemies, and&nbsp;I advise spending the earlier part of the game repeating levels to get chips quickly so you can boost things like critical chance, get a revive option, and lower prices in the upgrade store. Doing so will make the later runs against the stronger enemies much easier to deal with. It was only after a couple of attempts at the same level around the halfway mark that I settled on this approach, and it helped a lot. It is also nice to see enemies that once caused major issues fall within a couple of hits.</p>
<p>The presentation of Slots &amp; Daggers is really good. The enemies are quite simple in design but each has its own look, and the subtle changes in lighting as you move through levels is well done too. The coins falling into the tray to your left make a satisfying clinking sound as they fall, and the music is atmospheric too. The sounds and looks combined with the slot gameplay really make the time pass quickly as you try to beat the enemies.</p>

<p>It took around seven hours for me to overcome the main campaign, but there’s then an arena mode to tackle, which introduces enemies that are not present in the story. It is a good way to keep things going, and allows you to experiment with new ways to take on challenges while chasing a high score.</p>
<p>My one gripe with Slots &amp; Daggers would be the upgrade store, specifically the power ups that cost additional money to use in combat. I do get what the developer is trying to do by forcing a tactical decision like using one of your slots to get coins, but some of the prices did seem a bit steep to use the items. Fortunately, you can complete the campaign without using power ups that need additional in game currency to utilise.</p>

<p>This marks the first occasion that Mario has joined in on the celebrations, and his balloon will feature the character's iconic flying pose from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>. It'll also be a big boy, too, coming in at 51-feet and 2-inches long, 37-feet wide and 43-feet and 8-inches tall.</p>
<p>Devin Pritchard, EVP of Revenue, Marketing &amp; Consumer Experience and soon to be President at Nintendo of America, said the following:</p><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890smgvyn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>“Having Mario join this iconic holiday tradition is an incredible way to honor the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. Since he first emerged from a Warp Pipe, Mario has embodied our goal of bringing smiles to faces all over the world. We are excited for Mario fans of all ages to see his new balloon’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade debut.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To coincide with this, the Nintendo New York store will also feature festive decor and will feature "plenty of Nintendo-themed holiday magic". Bowser in a Santa costume, anyone?</p>
<p>Now, here's a little peek at what the balloon itself will actually look like:</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-battlefield-6-update-tweaks-custom-search-player-movement-and-progression-updates-still-to-come.1334107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Now that Battlefield 6 has been out and in players' hands for a full two weeks at the time of this writing, EA and Battlefield Studios have begun updating, tweaking, and refining the experience to squash bugs and address player feedback. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-latest-changes-and-preparing-for-season-1">The latest update, which went live today in preparation for Season 1,</a> includes tweaks to the Custom Search queue option and a fix for a vehicle spawn bug.</p>



<p>What's more intriguing about the update is what's still to come, as Battlefield Studios lists changes and refinements to player movement and continued changes to player progression <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-clamping-down-battlefield-6-xp-farms-portal-increasing-xp-gained-in-matches/">that Battlefield Studios began implementing last week</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>We are actively refining player movement to address areas that previously felt inconsistent, while staying true to the gameplay pace and maintaining the core feel of the launch experience</em>," Battlefield Studios writes. "<em>In parallel, we are enhancing sight stability by minimizing reticle movement during specific animations. These adjustments aim to deliver a smoother and more precise aiming experience, all while preserving an immersive first-person feel.</em>"</p>



<p>Beyond player movement, the player progression changes and tweaks continue to be a point of issue for players, since a large chunk of the community was looking to custom servers in Portal <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-players-advantage-xp-farms-portal-ea-tries-to-stop-them/">to farm XP in bot-filled PvE matches</a>. </p>



<p>Battlefield Studios is "<em>continuing to monitor</em>" the changes it made and the conversations around player progression within the community, with a specific focus on XP received in Escalation and King of the Hill matches not properly registering for players, and how players feel about the challenges offered in daily and weekly challenges, and the challenges for classes and weapon unlocks. </p>



<p>"<em>We've seen all your feedback about the challenges and their criteria, the team's working on a series of improvements to make challenges more straightforward to understand and faster to complete. Given the scale of these challenges, these changes will roll out over at least two updates.</em>"</p>



<p>Hopefully EA and Battlefield Studios can find a better balance for player progression compared to the current state of it, specifically around how challenges work for unlocking weapons and attachments. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">an aspect I commented on in my Battlefield 6 review</a>, and would like to see improved sooner than later.</p>



<p>More updates to come include changes to weapon dispersion, which will arrive with Season 1 on October 28, and changes to visibility when it comes to exposure and brightness in matches.</p>



<p>Lastly, it's worth noting that Battlefield Studios comments on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/">battle royale mode that it has been testing in Battlefield Labs</a>, with changes made to close-range time-to-kill, armor changes, world improvements and vehicle balances. Even if you're not a part of the Battlefield Labs playtesting, it's worth going over these changes since it seems extremely likely that the battle royale mode will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-shadow-drop-next-week-rumour/">shadow-dropped into the game next week on October 28.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there a disturbance in the force when it comes to <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>‘s week-one sales? Will Steam Deck compatibility help aid the Switch 2 on its road to becoming a handheld port machine? And why are <em>Sims 4</em> creators abandoning EA’s official affiliate program? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>People <a href="https://x.com/SuperSavajin/status/1981324284493443583">are once again</a> debating whether Nintendo should bring back Virtual Console instead of forcing fans to rent all of its games in perpetuity. While it’s true that people had been wanting Nintendo to do a low-cost Netflix-like retro service for a while, much of that was due to constantly needing to <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-virtual-console-switch-online-classic-retro-1851760770">re-purchase the games across non-backwards-compatible devices</a>. With the Switch 2, that’s no longer an issue. Personally, I’d prefer to just buy the original <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> again instead of pay $50 a year to play it.</p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> is selling less than other recent games in the series</h2> <p>The Pokémon Company announced the latest entry sold 5.8 million copies in its first week, split roughly evenly between Switch and Switch 2. Sounds impressive, but it’s slightly behind other recent Pokémon games:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Pokémon Sword</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Shield</strong></em>: 6 million copies in its first three days</li> <li><strong><em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</em></strong>: 6 million copies in its first week</li> <li><em><strong>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</strong>: </em>6.5 million copies in its first week</li> <li><em><strong>Pokémon Scarlet </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>Violet</strong>: </em>10 million copies in its first three days</li> </ul> <p>That’s a little surprising given the hype around a new console launch and the fact that it’s been three years since fans received a mainline Pokémon game. Are those viral videos about the bad graphics and how lifeless Lumiose City looks putting a damper on things? Are some fans aging out all these years later? Or is this just a momentary slip on the way to <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> still becoming one of the top-20 best-selling Nintendo console games ever?</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is secretly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-npc-dialogue-funny-moments-lines-2000638295"><span>one of the funniest games of the year</span></a><span>, as I was reminded last night when I experienced something that was as annoying as it was hilarious.. I’ve finished the main story, and so I’ve been chipping away at all the remaining side quests, filling up my Pokedex, and trying to get everything in a place where I’m okay with putting the game down until the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>. So I’m spending most of my time chatting up citizens, battling wild Pokémon, and checking off research assignments without a care in the world. But last night, something happened that now has me putting my guard up. I was trapped in a conversation with a child about their special interest, and it was one of the funniest scenes I’ve encountered in the game.</span></p> <p><span>In Lumiose City’s Rouge Sector, you’ll find a school called Académie Étoile. There are a few quests here, including one really cute one where you teach a group of curious kids about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>Mega Evolution</span></a><span>, but there’s one student who’s just hanging out in a corner by herself. This nameless child’s speech bubble exclaims, “I’ve memorized a bunch of people’s names!” As someone who has become terrible with names in his 30s, that’s impressive to me. If someone doesn’t have a name tag on, I </span><i><span>will</span></i><span> forget what they’re called when they tell me. That happens with anyone, and it’s nothing personal. I used to have a mind like a steel trap, and then everything started sliding right out of my skull once I got old enough to rent a car. So I talk to this kid, and she tells me she has a “super amazing memory” and can remember every name she’s ever seen, even if she only saw it once.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>She asks if I want her to show me, and I’m like, “Hell yeah, queen. Pop off!” because who wants to shoot down a child telling you about something they’re excited about? Then she asks me again if I’m sure because it’ll take her about six minutes to rattle off every Bob, Jan, and Jimbo she’s ever known. I fully expected the game to make me skip through a bunch of text boxes before we were interrupted by a teacher or parent who had been looking for this girl, but no, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>did something even funnier: it started playing the game’s credits and would not let me skip or opt out of them.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>For six minutes, I watched the credits roll a second time, and just laughed at how good of a fucking bit this is. Anyone who’s interacted with children knows they love to talk your ear off about whatever they’re hyperfixating on. If you don’t know anything about it, you just gotta kinda smile, nod, and say “oh, wow!” now and then so they know it’s okay to be excited about things. Game Freak emulating this by making you watch the credits is such an efficient gag that I couldn’t help but giggle at the mess I’d gotten myself into. The kid told me exactly what she was going to do, and for some reason, it didn’t occur to me that she might actually deliver. Hopefully, she gets a job in comms because never forgetting a face or a name is an invaluable skill in that field.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The developers of Steal A Brainrot, a popular game within Roblox, are suing the developer of a copycat game in Fortnite called “Steal The Brainrot”.</p>



<p>According to the complaint, which was first reported on by <a href="https://aftermath.site/brainrot-roblox-court" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicole Carpenter at Aftermath</a>, Spyder Games and Speedy Simulator Gaming are suing Thomas Van Der Voort for copyright infringement. They say that Van Der Voort’s game, which was released two months after theres, within the Fortnite Island Creator Program <strong>“copies the Game’s [Steal A Brainrot] protectable expressions, including user interface elements, in-game objects, artwork, level design, animations, design aesthetics, game pieces, and the selection and coordination of game elements, colors, and shapes.”</strong></p>



<p>They <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/937410050/Brainrot-Goes-To-Court#content=query:defendant,pageNum:2,indexOnPage:0,bestMatch:false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">continue to say</a> that similarities in Van Der Voort’s game are “not merely the result of the games existing in the same genre or dictated by function”. It’s alleged that he “made conscious decisions” to copy the choices of Steal A Brainrot, which, within the Fortnite Creator Program, can earn the developers money. Carptenter says that Steal The Brainrot has reached peaks of over 531,000 players.</p>



<p>In a statement given to Aftermath, attorney Adam Starr, who represents Spyder Games and Speedy Simulator Gaming, says that his parties are doing this to protect their work, which they acquired a copyright for in August.</p>



<p>“We always prefer to resolve these matters cooperatively, but when necessary we will take appropriate legal steps to safeguard our IP,” he said.</p>



<p>The suing parties are requesting a jury trial for the claims presented. They are looking to see the infringing game taken down while also receiving damages and profits that can be attributed to the game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Have Early Access?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-have-early-access.1334086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re getting toward the end of the year, which means it’s time for a new Call of Duty game. Black Ops 7 follows BLOPS 6, and if you want to get your boots off the ground quicker than most, early access is the perfect fuel to do so—we’re checking if Black Ops 7 has it for you.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was having a fairly tumultuous build-up toward launch. Battlefield 6 was the shooter on everyone’s lips, and Black Ops 7 possibly felt too similar to its predecessor for some. It all changed in the blink of an eye when Activision declared <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-will-have-non-disbanding-lobbies-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 was getting rid of skill-based matchmaking</a>.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is now back on the menu for many, so let’s check if there’s any possibility of early access.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-black-ops-7-early-access">Can You Play Black Ops 7 Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Judgment day is near. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no Black Ops 7 early access, meaning it doesn’t matter which edition you buy, all of them will give you access to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 at the same time—release day.</strong></p>



<p>One thing we can definitely say is the same as Black Ops 6 is the decision not to give Black Ops 7 players early access. You have to be patient and pass the time until launch. As usual, there is a super-duper edition (Vault Edition) offering a Season Pass, as well as the usual benefits, such as packs and items for CoD Zombies.</p>



<p>The good thing is that no one can gain an advantage before November 14. Once Black Ops 7 is out, everyone is near-enough on a level playing field and can upgrade weapons, earn attachments, and do everything in between at the same starting point.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-way-to-play-black-ops-7-early">Is There Any Way To Play Black Ops 7 Early?</h2>



<p><strong>No, the only way you could’ve played Black Ops 7 slightly earlier than anyone else was by pre-ordering the game to give yourself an exclusive early access beta window.</strong></p>



<p>If you didn’t know, Black Ops 7’s beta has come and passed. If you pre-ordered BLOPS 7, you were guaranteed a code to play the early access Black Ops 7 beta. That’s it, though, just the beta.</p>



<p>The beta window has closed, as has any chance to play Black Ops 7 before launch. We’ve seen other titles spontaneously announced impromptu betas—like ARC Raifers did—so we can’t theoretically rule out one more chance to play early. If this doesn’t happen, we’ll see you in a persistent Black Ops 7 lobby!</p>



<p>If you did play the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 beta, let us know if you enjoyed it. Can the removal of disbanding lobbies and a lack of SBMM make this one of the best CoDs ever? Leave your thoughts through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Discord</a> and the comments section below.</p>

That is, in terms of the revenue it has generated, as opposed to unit sales. Ghost of Yotei launch week unit sales in the U.S. were down by a mid-single digit percent versus Ghost of Tsushima — so yes, it sold slightly less — but dollar sales were up by a similar mid-single digit percent, Piscatella confirmed. The average price per unit was about 12% higher for Ghost of Yotei than Ghost of Tsuhima’s launch week. “So... effectively flat,” Piscatella said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Piscatella pointed out, there is an important context we need to understand when making the comparison. “Everyone was home in July of 2020, and gaming saw a significant boom in player count and engagement,” he said. “At the time, the PS4's installed base was about 20% higher than the PS5's is today.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I look at it and say... it did somewhere between fine and great given all the factors at play,” Piscatella continued. “But it's early.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The true test now for Ghost of Yotei in terms of commercial performance will be in how well it holds in the coming weeks and months. And we of course do not know what Sony’s internal targets are for the title. It may be underperforming, doing fine, or overperforming versus Sony expectations. Ghost of Tsushima ended up a hugely successful release, with over 13 million sold as of September 2024, so Ghost of Yotei has plenty of work to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In any case, in the U.S. it was a perfectly fine launch,” Piscatella concluded. “Not amazing, not bad.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a similar situation in Europe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sales-of-ps5-exclusive-ghost-of-yotei-in-line-with-ghost-of-tsushima-in-europe-new-data-reveals">where Ghost of Yotei sales are in-line with Ghost of Tsushima’s</a>. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ghost-of-yotei-delivers-strong-opening" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a> noted that Ghost of Yotei is the biggest first-party PlayStation launch since Spider-Man 2 in October 2023.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> has posted some impressive numbers since launch, but right now, it looks like the game has some competition. While Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won't be out until next month, indie eggs-traction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-duckov/">Escape From Duckov</a> is busy climbing the charts on Steam. For a brief time, the viral indie game had 152,207 concurrent players, beating Battlefield 6 during that time period with its concurrent-player count of 129,729 players.</p><p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/indie-shooter-escape-from-duckov-overtakes-battlefield-6-on-steam-3273511/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>, Escape From Duckov outshone Battlefield 6 during that period before the current Steam status quo reasserted itself. The game has proven to be a big hit with players since launch, and what makes the achievement even more impressive is that the duck-themed parody of Escape From Tarkov is the product of the five-person team known as Team Soda. At the time of writing, Escape From Duckov has peaked at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3167020/charts/" rel="nofollow ">257,952 concurrent players on Steam</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Essential Starter Guide</p>
      </div>
<p>Battlefield Studios made the battle royale game available to testers in the Battlefield Labs program, and now the studio is addressing feedback. The updates include an adjustment to time-to-kill values at close range, along with armor changes (everyone can hold two armor plates now), bug fixes and lighting improvements, and vehicle-balance changes. Here is a rundown, as written by the developer:</p><ul><li><strong>Close-range TTK:</strong> We’ve adjusted time-to-kill at close range for all weapons to reward clean positioning and tracking while giving players more time to counter attacks. We’ll keep monitoring this once it’s live.</li><li><strong>Armor Changes:</strong> Everyone will now have the capacity for 2 armor plates at the start of the game. All players will spawn with 1 plate, so you will have the chance to upgrade as soon as you start looting, giving everyone an equal chance at upgrading their armor fully.</li><li><strong>World Improvements:</strong> We’ve been fixing pesky world bugs and optimizing areas to improve the environment. With these improvements, we made adjustments to the lighting as well as enhancing the visibility across the map.</li><li><strong>Vehicle Balance:</strong> We’ve adjusted the balance for helicopters and combat vehicles to keep them as powerful tools showing off Battlefield’s core DNA, without making them necessary to survive or win the late game. This includes significant adjustments to the heli countermeasures and ammo economy.</li></ul><p>Beyond all of this, Battlefield Studios said it has been working to unlock "smoother performance overall" for the battle royale game. "We have identified and addressed a range of issues that affected performance that we simply couldn't have done without our players' involvement in the tests," the developer said.</p><p>Battlefield Studios has confirmed it's working on a battle royale mode for Battlefield 6 but has not shared much in the way of specifics about it yet, including whether it will be free or paid. Footage of the game has leaked out of the Battlefield Labs tests, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay-footage-leaks/1100-6534689/" data-ref-id="1100-6534689">showing off a first look at gameplay.</a></p><p>Battlefield 6 got off to a great start earlier this month, selling 7 million copies out of the gate for the "biggest opening" ever for the FPS series. The game is set to grow with the debut of Season 1 on October 28, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">adds new maps and modes</a>, along with battle royale, if the reports are true.</p>

                <p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231">Hades 2</a> fans finally can take their journey through the Underworld on the go on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-release-times-revealed-for-switch-2-and-pc/1100-6534925/" data-ref-id="1100-6534925">Nintendo Switch and Switch 2</a>, the battle continues on PC with the release of the first Post-Launch Patch 1 Preview for the game. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1145350/announcements/detail/505090299391902120" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supergiant Games said it is grateful for all the community feedback</a> since the v1 Launch, and those reports have directly inspired a host of new enhancements, most notably to the narrative's True Ending. This preview is now available to brave players who want to jump in early, offering a significant update to Boons, foes, and getting to the heart of Melinoe's quest.</p><p>In Hades 2, players step into the role of Melinoe, the sister of the first game's protagonist, Zagreus, on a quest to defeat the titan Chronos, who has overthrown her family's domain. Melinoe's journey is guided by her mentor, Hecate, and supported by a cast of new and returning gods. While the game maintains the same fast-paced action of its predecessor, it introduces a key mechanical shift: Melinoe is less reliant on dashing and more on a new sprint ability, which can be upgraded with boons and even used offensively to encourage a fresh approach to combat. You can check out GameSpot's review here, where we gave it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231">a perfect 10/10 score</a>.</p><p>The most significant changes in this preview focus on the game's late-stage narrative, with major enhancements to the True Ending. This includes new events both leading up to and following the ending, increasing the number of Underworld clears required, and revising key True Ending scenes. To help players revisit these moments, a new Cauldron Incantation has been added that lets you return to an earlier point in the story. Beyond the story, players will see a general balance pass to various Boons, Aspects, and Daedalus Hammer Upgrades, along with a Crossroads Renewal that reduces the Kudos cost of many decorative items, refunding any excess Kudos you've already spent.</p><h4>True Ending &amp; Narrative Enhancements:</h4><ul><li>Added new events in the lead-up to and after the True Ending.</li><li>Increased the number of Underworld clears required to achieve the True Ending.</li><li>Added to and revised parts of the main True Ending scenes before the end credits. (Note: Changes are primarily to the Underworld route; the Surface route is largely unchanged.)</li><li>Art and dialog have been updated with new artwork, animations, and voice lines for characters such as Chronos, Zagreus, Hecate, and Hades, to support these new events.</li><li>Returning to a Real Possibility: A new Cauldron Incantation lets you return to an earlier point in the story so you can re-experience the True Ending.</li><li>Fated Prophecy Adjustments: Some character-related Prophecies, including the story epilogue one, should now unfold faster than before.</li><li>Fated List of Minor Prophecies: Priority of key events increased for: Melinoe, Help Us, Silk and Spitefulness, and Voice and Vanity. Born to Win is revealed sooner, and the requirements for Denier of Suitors are reduced.</li></ul><h4>Combat and Balance Changes:</h4><ul><li>Witch's Staff (Circe): Smolder Ring (Hestia) now also applies Scorch from the bonus Cast when your Casts overlap.</li><li>Boons and Blessings: Increases to damage/effectiveness for: Anvil Ring (Hephaestus), Controlled Burn (Hestia), Sword Ring (Ares), Carnal Pleasure (Ares x Aphrodite), Shadow Pounce (Artemis), Life Tax (Hades), Last Gasp (Hades), and Fight Fight Fight (Echo).</li><li>Ares: Increased Plasma pickup range.</li><li>Success Rate (Hermes): Now affects Nurture of Hera (Selene x Hera).</li><li>Gigaros Dash (Hades): No longer staggers foes when dealing direct damage.</li><li>Life Tax (Hades): Restorative effect is no longer reduced by Vow of Scars (Oath).</li><li>Daedalus Hammer Upgrades:</li><li>Increased damage for Elephant Rockets (Coat - Shiva) and Chakra Collider (Coat - Shiva).</li></ul><h4>Foes &amp; Dangers:</h4><ul><li>Adjusted hitboxes for Unrivaled Prometheus (Heracles attacks) and Headmistress Hecate (flame attacks).</li><li>Phantom (Fields): Reduced effectiveness and removed the Life-drain effect from some attacks.</li></ul><h4>Crossroads &amp; Economy:</h4><ul><li>Crossroads Renewal: Many decorative items have reduced costs in Kudos. Excess Kudos already spent will be refunded.</li><li>Added Primordial Chaos theme to the Music Maker.</li><li>Crossroads Cauldron: Disintegration of Monstrosity--you are no longer required to cast this as soon as you can afford to.</li><li>Greatest Gift of Gaia: Reduced requirements for this to be revealed.</li><li>Keepsakes: Jeweled Pom (Hades &amp; Persephone)--bonus Hades blessing is no longer kept if you are not at the Fates' Whim; fixed an issue preventing it from granting Last Gasp (Hades).</li><li>Well of Charon: Yarn of Ariadne: Now also raises the chance of finding Duo Boons.</li><li>Mist Veil: Now restores Magick lost for any reason</li></ul><h4>Miscellaneous, bug fixes, and quality of life:</h4><ul><li>Special Encounters: Added a preview icon for Location exits leading to an Infernal Contract (after the True Ending), Nemesis can only show up once per night while battling through the Underworld, and Circe appears slightly more often.</li><li>Settings (New Options): Danger Pulse: New toggle to switch off the persistent flashing at critical Life levels. FPS Limit: New option to limit max fps while VSync is off.</li><li>Bug Fixes: Numerous fixes, including those for Argent Skull not firing reliably, various Boon and Keepsake interactions (e.g., Calling Card and Time Piece), collision issues, and visual/audio errors.</li></ul>

She's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_JJLuJrPAg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed some of her favorite lines from the games</a>, including a hilariously silly line from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect-2/" data-ref-id="5000-34111">Mass Effect 2</a>.

<figure data-uuid="50933ec4874e0"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/50933ec4874e0/final-fantasy-vii-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Even just a handful of months after its launch, the Switch 2 is proving to be a particularly compelling console for third-party developers. One of the biggest surprises was the announcement that not only would <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> launch on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>, but it would be followed by both <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth">Rebirth</a> and the currently untitled third entry in the Remake Trilogy.</p>
<p>To find out more about the process in bringing the games to the Switch 2, we recently spent some time with series director Naoki Hamaguchi. We talk over how he got into game development, how Remake was optimised for Nintendo's new console, and how the team was influenced by a little game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.</p>
<p>We also had another go with the Remake demo on Switch 2, all in handheld mode, and it's not hyperbole to call this is thing astonishing. The visuals are near indistinguishable from the PS5 version, and although frame rate is capped at 30fps, it felt much smoother and stable than the official figures would have you believe. Provided the full game is up to scratch, this is almost certainly a 'miracle port', and it's comfortably the best-looking game on Switch 2 so far.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let's dive into our conversation with Hamaguchi-san...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Ollie Reynolds): Am I right in thinking you were inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy VI</a> to get into game development?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi:</strong> Yes that's absolutely right. I think I was in secondary school, so I was still fairly young back then. But even as a child, I remember seeing that: the ensemble cast with their own stories to tell, the setting, the emotional and dramatic storytelling. It was amazing, and it's not a movie, but a piece of digital entertainment I could become involved with.</p>
<p>It was very vague at that point, there was nothing specific in my head, but I thought it would be great if I would get involved in this kind of thing when I'm older. So yes, it was definitely from Final Fantasy VI.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e8c606c650ca2"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e8c606c650ca2/final-fantasy-vii-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>So how does it feel to go from being a fan of Final Fantasy to now leading the development on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was inspired by Final Fantasy when I was a kid, it made me want to go into games at some point.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So I was inspired by Final Fantasy when I was a kid, it made me want to go into games at some point. Then I joined Square Enix some time after university and I've been working here for over 20 years now – maybe 24, 25 years, I'd say – working on Final Fantasy that whole time, slowly growing and learning more about it.</p>
<p>In some ways, I've been brought up by Final Fantasy and I've learned so much about it over the years. So the feeling that I have now is very much the idea that I want to give back to the series that has really taught me so much and given me so much. So that's where my mind and my heart are at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>How much pressure do you feel to ensure that the trilogy lives up to fans' expectations? And as a fan yourself, do you have your own personal expectations that you'd like to meet?</strong></p>
<p>My honest feeling is that yes, there is pressure, I can't deny that, but I don't really let it get on top of me. It's just so satisfying and rewarding to have so many people out there waiting for your game. Having so many people play and enjoy these games is really special, so I'm having a lot of fun with it at the same time.</p>
<p>One other thing is that the team we have working on this series is just really, really great. I'm blessed to have it, and it really supports me in making these games. It contains a lot of new people, people like myself who were fans of the original games, but then we also have a number of creators who worked on the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>. So people like Tetsuya Nomura, Yoshinori Kitase, Motomu Toriyama, Kazushige Nojima...</p>
<p>Having them there really helps to ground it in the original and keep that essence of what made Final Fantasy VII what it was. In some sense, if it was just me and I was responsible for everything, then it might wind up becoming my personal take on it as a fan. But together, we're able to determine what is most important for the fans and create a modern piece of entertainment that still retains the core essence.</p>
<p><strong>With that in mind, how confident are you that the upcoming third game will deliver a satisfying conclusion?</strong></p>
<p>Well obviously, there's no way I can tell you today how this ends what happens in the conclusion of the trilogy. But the game itself is coming along really well, the story is all fixed down and final now, and we've moved onto working on the core gameplay experiences; I know exactly how that's going to be structured to be really satisfying and delight the fans.</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to the day when that can be brought to the players, and I am very confident that it will be a fitting conclusion to the trilogy.<strong><br></strong></p>

<p><strong>I've played the demo for Final Fantasy VII Remake on Switch 2, and it's remarkable just how good it looks and how well it runs – particularly in handheld mode. Can you talk about the development process for this and what challenges you faced?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, thank you! That's the best praise you could give me for that. I am confident at the moment, with all the games available on Switch 2, in terms of the most high-end graphical experience, I think we are the best – we really hit the peak on that game.</p>
<p>I love the Switch 2, I think it's a great piece of hardware, it's got impressive specifications, and it can do a lot. From a developer's perspective, there's a little kink in it where when you go from TV mode to handheld mode, there are obvious concerns about battery life, conservation, etc. And of course, the technical capacity of the system actually drops when you go into handheld mode. That can be a difficult thing for developers to get around.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...in terms of the most high-end graphical experience, I think we are the best</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when we started development, we ported the previous version to Switch 2 to see how it was running. As we'd expected, the frame rates in handheld mode were perhaps a little below where we wanted them. So we had to do some optimisation to ensure the frame rate was where it needed to be and the visuals were what fans were expecting, and I think we got a really good result from how we approached it.</p>
<p>It's very character-based, we've got lots of really iconic main characters like Cloud, Sephiroth, etc. And the way that they appeared as characters had to be right, they couldn't be in any way inferior to how they will have appeared on the other platforms.</p>

<p>Most of this was in the lighting, and how the light affects their faces and expressions. We decided that even though lighting is quite a high-processing burden and would put a lot of pressure on frame rate, it had to basically stay the same.</p>
<p>So once we had that baseline down, we could look at things we could adjust, so things like shadows and the post-processing effect. A lot of this was down to our engineering team, and if you compare the games side-by-side, even in portable mode, they look really close. Some small effects you might be able to notice things have changed, but having the lighting remain the same was important to have the most impact on the players' experience of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a personal preference between TV mode and handheld mode?</strong></p>
<p>I personally prefer the portable mode, that's the one I'd most like people to try out and experience.</p>
<p>However, we really wanted as little difference as possible between TV mode and portable mode, so when you have TV mode, you have native 2K with a very stable resolution and frame rate. When it goes down into handheld, it can't be maintained in the same way, so it does drop the resolution, but we've used DLSS to upscale it and get it as close as possible.</p>
<p>So even comparing side-by-side, you can see that the quality is very much the same. That's why I want people to really pay attention to what we've done with the handheld mode.</p>

<p><strong>The original Final Fantasy VII is also available on the Switch. Would you recommend newcomers try this out first before moving onto Remake, or would you prefer the opposite?</strong></p>
<p>In a lot of ways, that's a difficult question to answer. A lot of people say to me that if they could go back and play the original Final Fantasy VII with no knowledge of the story and enjoy it for the first time, there'd be nothing better than that. The Remake is designed to be enjoyed by people who have played the original and know it well, and also by complete newcomers who know nothing about it.</p>
<p>So either way is fine, you'll enjoy the game and have a similar experience whether you've played the original or not. If you have the opportunity, I'd like you to play the Remake first and enjoy it as a fresh experience on its own.</p>
<p>There are definitely nods in there, so if you've played [the original] before, you can see how we've reworked things, and that's a completely legitimate way of playing. But if you've not played it before, I'd kind of like you to experience the Remake first with the new graphics and presentation and have that be your first impression of the game.</p>
<p><strong>And like the Switch port of Final Fantasy VII, the remake has also introduced Streamlined Progression, which includes options for maximum health, damage, etc. What was the thinking behind this? And did you get any pushback from your colleagues for adding it?</strong></p>
<p>So there's two main points as to why we wanted to include these. The first one – and this kind of links into the fact that we wanted to announce that the whole trilogy would be coming to the Switch 2 – is that these are very large RPGs and we want people to play through the whole trilogy and experience everything. However, the time commitment is quite strong and that might put some people off. So to lower the barrier for entry is really the idea behind that. People can get through the games quicker and prepare themselves to play the later games in the series.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I always find myself wanting these kinds of functions when I play games</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The second point is very much a personal thing for me. As a game creator, I spend a lot of time making games, and so I find that I have very little time to play games outside of that. And I imagine there are a lot of people in similar situations. I think it's a shame.</p>
<p>I would really like to spend more time and see more of the game I'm playing, but if a powerful enemy shows up, I don't want to be spending all the time getting stronger just to beat that one guy. If only there was a way to put my level up to maximum and then see more of the game. So I always find myself wanting these kinds of functions when I play games.</p>

<p>In terms of whether there was any pushback or negative response to that within the team, I don't remember there being any. It might be the fact that I'm the director and it's difficult to say these things to me, but I don't remember there being anyone particularly worried.</p>
<p>Of course, after we announced it, there were people on social media concerned about whether it would affect playing the game properly. It's important to stress that it's an option. It's important to provide choices that fit into what players are looking for today, and one of the parallels is the idea in streaming services like Netflix of the double-speed playback mode. When that was introduced, everybody thought it was terrible, but people have started to get used to it and accept it now as an option. But of course we're not going to base the game balance on having those features available and therefore forcing you to use them. If you want to use it, you can.</p>
<p><strong>As a Nintendo-focused site, one of the big RPG franchises for us is Xenoblade Chronicles. I'm curious if you'd played the Monolith-developed games and if these have influenced your approach to the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy?</strong></p>
<p>I remember I was involved with the <strong>Xeno</strong> games we made in the past with Square Enix, but unfortunately I haven't played the more recent ones from Nintendo, so I'm sorry about that.</p>
<p>But if you talk about other Nintendo games that have influenced me and I've taken a lot from – and you might think this is a bit of a cop out – then it'll be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. It's such an inspirational game and I've learned so much from that. Looking at how its affected the Remake series, moving from Remake to Rebirth and that switch to more open-world gameplay, Breath of the Wild was hugely influential there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...telling a story around gameplay first, seeing how Zelda achieved this was definitely an inspiration for Rebirth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you compare the kinds of games we make in Final Fantasy with Zelda, in some ways the approach is slightly different. Our games very much start with the story, and then we kind of work out what kind of gameplay experience we want to add to create that story and that feeling of being in that story.</p>
<p>I think Zelda does it the other way around, they start with the gameplay experience and then the setting and world is kind of fitted around that. So telling a story around gameplay first, seeing how Zelda achieved this was definitely an inspiration for Rebirth.</p>
<p><strong>When you're done with the third entry in the trilogy, will you be taking a much-deserved break? Or do you have other projects that you're working on?</strong></p>
<p>In my position, I am the director for the Final Fantasy VII Remake series, so my biggest focus at the moment is getting part three done and seeing fans reactions to that. In addition, I'm also the head of Creative Studio One, so that's involved in making other games which I'm a part of.</p>
<p>One big thing I'm looking forward to in the future is having the team I've put together work on something new. One thing that's common in the industry is that when a project is finished, the team is split and moved around, but that hasn't happened here. We've basically got the same guys all the way from the beginning of the project right through to the end. So I'm really looking forward to the game that we look to create after – it could be a Final Fantasy, it could be something completely different... I've not decided yet.</p>
<p>But whatever it is, gamers who have paid attention and seen what we've done with the Remake trilogy, they'll have great expectations and will look forward to seeing what the team come up with.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1c794968f3977"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c794968f3977/final-fantasy-vii-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Are there any other Final Fantasy games in the series that you'd like to see get remade?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of if the company thinks it's a good idea and there's a business opportunity there to do one of the older Final Fantasy games and remake it in a similar way, there's a lot of them we haven't done, so I definitely think we could.</p>
<p>However, I wouldn't want it to be me that does it. The Final Fantasy VII series has taken up well over 10 years of my career as a creator, and it's been great, I've really enjoyed working on it. But if I was asked by the company to helm another Final Fantasy for another 10 years, that would probably be my career over by the time it's done, so I would rather work on something completely new. I think the fans would probably appreciate something new too, maybe.</p>
<p>If there's another younger creator within the company, someone who's really passionate about Final Fantasy and wants to do a remake project, then I'd definitely back them up as much as I could; I just don't want it to be me!</p>
<p><strong>Finally, I just want to personally thank you for the work that you've done. Fans have been dreaming for a remake of Final Fantasy VII for years, and I think the results so far really speak for themselves. I can't wait to play Remake, Rebirth, and the third game on the Switch 2.</strong></p>
<p>I'm so happy that there are people out there with that passion for the game, and myself, I'm very much in the same boat. The love and affection I have for Final Fantasy is very much there, I really do love the games. I made a joke about it, how I've been working on this for 10 years and would like to try something different, and that's funny, but the experience has just been amazing to work on this game for so long and really put everything I have as a creator into it. It really is the culmination of my whole career so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The love and affection I have for Final Fantasy is very much there</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting the third game out there is very important and making sure it's as good as it needs to be. I have a vision in my head of what the final version is going to look like, and I think it'll be a really satisfying experience.</p>
<p>But obviously, before then, people who haven't played Final Fantasy VII Remake yet, this is such a good opportunity to do so now that it's coming out on the Switch 2. The whole series is coming to the Switch 2, so if you want to play it, have a go with the first one, you won't regret it, and then we can all play the third game together and it enjoy it together in real time.</p>

              <p>Being and adult can be a lot. We’re expected to work at least eight hours a day — usually more. For some of us it might take over and hour to commute to work, each way. When we finally get home, we have dinners to cook and dirty clothes to launder. To stay healthy, we should be getting in some daily exercised too. Plus, some of us have small humans to take care of, pick up from school, help with their homework — it’s never ending. If you fall behind on vacuuming your living room, that’s completely understandable with everything else going on. Though, you work so hard, you deserve to come home to a clean home every day. That’s why you got to jump on this Amazon limited time deal for a Eufy robot vacuum.</p>
<p>The Eufy C10 can be scheduled to clean up for you every day while you’re out so you can come home to a clean living space. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4991/">The robot vac is currently 54% off, saving your more than half. It normally is listed at $480, but the discount brings it down to just $220.</a> That’s a savings of $260 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4991/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Self-Empty Station</h2>
<p>Not only does this vacuum clean your floors for you. It can also empty itself all by itself. The docking station it returns to after every trip has a three-liter dust bag which the robot vacuum empties into each day. So instead of needing to empty the robot vacuum every few days, you only need to empty the dust bag about every 60 days.</p>
<p>This robot vacuum has a powerful suction with 4,000 Pa of sucking power. The rolling brush makes it so the vac can pick up all kinds of tough debris like pet hair, dirt, and crumbs embedded deep in your carpet.</p>



<p>The vacuum is designed to be a short 2.85 inches tall. This slim shape allows it to navigate under tight, hard-to-reach spaces like beneath a couch, bed, or desk.</p>
<p>Navigating your home comes easy to this robot vacuum. The Eufy C10 uses laser navigation to map out the layout of your home, analyzing and creating an optimal path to take for a thorough cleaning.</p>
<p>You can used the companion app to mark off any no-go zones you don’t want it to enter. The app also can be used for scheduling when you want the robot vacuum to run. You even use voice controls to get it started on the fly.</p>

              <p>Have you ever gone duck hunting? It’s terrifying. Somehow those birds are always watching, ready, hiding just out of plain sight ready to get you. Mmm. On second thought I might have that experience confused with something else. Regardless, murderous animals are funny and horrifying, and it seems a lot of folks on Steam are in agreement as duck-based indie shooter <i>Escape From Duckov</i> has just pulled ahead of EA’s big AAA shooter <i>Battlefield</i> <i>6</i> in concurrent players.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-damned-good-reason-escape-from-duckov-has-sold-a-million-copies-in-a-week-2000638588">There’s A Damned Good Reason <i>Escape From Duckov</i> Has Sold A Million Copies In A Week</a></p> <p>Released on October 16, 2025, <i>Escape From Duckov</i> is a solo survival extraction shooter featuring ducks with guns who aren’t afraid to use them. It has that lovely charm that many indie games tend to get when they fuse an otherwise serious, <a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-damned-good-reason-escape-from-duckov-has-sold-a-million-copies-in-a-week-2000638588">well-executed</a> genre with a not-so-serious premise: in this case, ducks with guns. And it would seem (<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/indie-shooter-escape-from-duckov-overtakes-battlefield-6-on-steam-3273511/">h/t <i>Dexerto</i></a>) that us extraction diehards or those who just enjoy silliness aren’t the only ones drawn to these funny birds; the game has recently outstripped <i>Battlefield 6</i> in concurrent players, successfully hopping over the popular milsim shooter in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/">top five most-played games</a> on Steam at the time of this writing.</p>

<p>After receiving feedback on the Deluxe Pack: ex special booster pack, Pokémon TCG Pocket developers are working on a new Card Dex Registration update for next year. </p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket recently celebrated its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-year-one-anniversary-update-includes-huge-wonder-pick-buff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first anniversary</a>, and with that, we got some decent improvements, including a new share feature, an upgrade to trading, and a Wonder Pick Buff. Now, the developers are updating how the card players collect are registered in the Card Dex. </p>



<h2 id="h-cards-that-appear-in-multiple-booster-packs-will-be-registered-in-the-tcg-pocket-card-dex-for-all-corresponding-packs">Cards that Appear in Multiple Booster Packs Will be Registered in the TCG Pocket Card Dex for All Corresponding Packs</h2>



<p>According to a recent post on Pokémon TCG Pocket’s official <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1981707338969956720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the Card Dex Registration update will be released after summer 2026, and many players aren’t happy about the developers taking so long to implement this change. The new “changes are intended to provide players with a more enjoyable card collecting experience.” Check out how Pokémon TCG Pocket Card Dex will change in 2026 below: </p>



<ul>
<li>Firstly, whenever a player procures a card that appears in multiple booster packs, that card will be registered in the card dex for all corresponding booster backs. Which means if you receive a Mewtwo ex from a Genetic Apex booster pack, the card dex will register it for both Genetic Apex and Deluxe Pack: ex. </li>



<li>Secondly, the cards that players have already obtained, which include any cards collected from the Deluxe Pack, will automatically be registered in every applicable card dex retroactively. </li>



<li>Lastly, these changes, along with related UI improvements, will arrive after summer 2026. </li>
</ul>

It will launch “as soon as possible,” with the team aiming for a December release. It will be a free upgrade for existing owners of <em>Factorio</em> on Switch. The <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [597 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a> version of the expansion downloadable content “Space Age” will launch at the same time. <span id="more-1002419"></span></p><p><em>Factorio</em> is currently available for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/factorio" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/factorio" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.factorio.com/buy" target="_blank">direct download</a>, as well as for Switch.</p><p>Here is an overview of the <em><a title="Platforms > Nintendo [22,975 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> Switch 2 Edition</em>, via Wube Software:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Factorio – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em></strong></p><p>Similar to other games, we decided to release a <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em>, an upgrade you can get if you own the game for the original Switch. If you don’t have the game you can get it as part of a”bundle” which is the game with the <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em> upgrade. Nintendo has some more information / clarification about <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Editions</em> <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/switch-2-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>The upgraded version will feature:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>Better resolution. The game will run on the screen’s native 1080p resolution instead of 720p. When docked, it supports all resolutions, including 2160p (4K).</li><li>Variable refresh rate support for the console’s screen.</li><li>Some higher quality animations.</li><li>Some higher resolution <a title="Companies > sprite [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sprite">sprite</a>s.</li><li>Other visual improvements.</li><li>Faster loading times.</li><li>Ability to build much larger bases.</li><li>Mouse mode support. Using the Joy-Con Mouse Sensor, the left or right Joy-Con can be used as a mouse.</li></ul><p>The price for this upgrade will be… free. We don’t believe paying for a technical upgrade is reasonable. For players who want to support us, and want more content, they can get the “Space Age” expansion.</p><p><strong>Expansion Downloadable Content “Space Age”</strong></p><p>We are happy to announce that “Space Age” will be coming soon to the Switch 2, as a downloadable content priced at $35. It will feature the same content as the PC version—nothing was removed or trimmed down.</p><p>For full details on the “Space Age” expansion, check out the <a href="https://factorio.com/space-age/content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Space Age” content page</a>.</p><p><strong>Release Date</strong></p><p>Both the <em>Factorio – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em> and the “Space Age” downloadable content for Switch 2 will release at the same time. The release date is… as soon as possible.</p><p>Like with the release for the original Nintendo Switch, the certification and store setup can take a long time. I don’t want to delay the release by setting a conservative release date, but I also don’t want to promise a release date that we might miss.</p><p>We are aiming for a December release, so you can get a nice gift before Christmas. Not an official release date, just something we are aiming for.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the first footage of <em>Factorio – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em> below, showcasing the game’s mouse mode.</p><h2><span>Switch 2 Mouse Mode Gameplay</span></h2><p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]--><br><video id="video-1002419-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-439-mouse-mode-demo.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-439-mouse-mode-demo.mp4">https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-439-mouse-mode-demo.mp4</a></video></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/factorio-nintendo-switch-2-edition-announced]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/brainrot-roblox-court</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/brainrot-goes-to-court.1334017/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The maker of one of <em>Roblox</em>'s top games is taking brainrot to court. Developer Spyder Games filed a complaint in a California court on Thursday, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/937410050/Brainrot-Goes-To-Court" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which has been reviewed by Aftermath</a>, over what it calls a copy of its record-breaking <em>Steal A Brainrot</em>.</p><p><em>Steal A Brainrot </em>is consistently within the top three games on <em>Roblox</em>. It's a simple game: You collect and steal brainrots from other players. It's kind of like capture the flag, but instead of one or two flags, there's a lot. And they're also not flags—they're brainrots. Brainrots in <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> are based off Italian brainrot, which is a bunch of weird, absurd memes, like a shark wearing three Nike sneakers. (He's Tralalero Tralala.) Or it's a cappuccino mug that's got a ballerina body. (Ballerina Cappuccina.) The brainrots in <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> are based off these memes. By stealing brainrots, you earn currency to upgrade your base and thus defend your brainrots.</p><p>Attorney Adam Starr is tasked with explaining all this to the court. He describes it in the complaint as "a treasure hunt in a world filled with unique 'brainrots,' which are based on silly internet meme characters."&nbsp;</p><p>"The brainrots march slowly in a line down a red carpet that runs through the center of the arena of game play," Starr writes. "Players capture the brainrots and take them to their base, which is like a mini jail on the edges of the arena, to earn virtual currency. Different brainrots have differing values, depending upon their rarity. Meanwhile, players can steal each other’s brainrots from their respective bases. The virtual currency a player earns from the brainrots can be used to upgrade their bases or unlock special abilities (like grabbing brainrots or escaping thieves more easily)."</p><p>It's absurd, and that's kind of the point. <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> is exceptionally popular. In October, it had <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/robloxs-steal-a-brainrot-becomes-first-game-to-surpass-25m-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25.4 million people</a> logged into the game at one time, surpassing both <em>Grow A Garden</em>, another supremely popular <em>Roblox </em>game, and <em>Fortnite</em>'s peak of <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/563750-most-concurrently-played-videogame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">15.3 million</a> concurrent players.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Steal A Brainrot</em>’s playerbase goes up when there's an update, but typically decreases, though not enough to take it out of the top three <em>Roblox </em>games. There are more than 619,000 players in the game at the time of writing. The game often goes viral on TikTok and other platforms because its chaos is good content—<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@neney_10203040/video/7529432713707801887" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like kids crying over brainrot</a>. All this is to say that <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> is really popular, which makes it really lucrative for developers earning money by selling items and through <a href="https://create.roblox.com/rewards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Roblox</em>'s creator rewards program</a>.</p><p>The developers <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/siebel_PA002544969" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> copyrighted</a>, as of August. There are a lot of <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> copycats or offshoot games on <em>Roblox</em>, but one on <em>Fortnite</em>'s user-created platform, an alleged copycat, stands to earn a lot of money: <em>Steal The Brainrot</em>. <em>Steal The Brainrot</em>, which is at issue in the complaint, has more than 33,000 active players at the time of writing, <a href="https://x.com/FeRinS_FN/status/1977478743892324365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but has reached peaks of more than 531,000 concurrent players</a>. (Ironically, <a href="https://x.com/AdamStarrLawyer/status/1977484085141639659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Steal A Brainrot</em> attorney Starr congratulated the developer</a> for the concurrent player number in early October.) <em>Steal The Brainrot</em> is effectively <em>Steal A Brainrot</em>, but a version that's rendered more closely to <em>Fortnite</em>. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNdhHZ8yOxz/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fortnite</em> publisher Epic Games</a> and <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1977524915365617762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEO Tim Sweeney</a> even posted the game on its official social media accounts. <em>Steal The Brainrot</em> is the most popular user-created <em>Fortnite</em> island at this time, drawing in more players than even some of Epic Games own modes, like <em>Save The World, Lego Fortnite Odyssey,</em> and <em>Fortnite OG Zero Build</em>.</p><p>“Our client takes its intellectual property rights seriously and brought this action to protect its work," Starr said in a statement to Aftermath. "We always prefer to resolve these matters cooperatively, but when necessary we will take appropriate legal steps to safeguard our IP.”</p><p><em>Fortnite</em>'s creator program pays out money to developers based on user engagement, but Epic Games will let users create and <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell in-game items directly in their games starting in December</a>—a new revenue stream.</p><p>Starr, representing the <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> makers, says in the complaint that <em>Steal The Brainrot</em> was uploaded in July and copies <em>Steal A Brainrot</em>'s "protectable expressions," like its artwork, objects, design, and game elements. "[The similarities] are the result of willful infringement by defendant in an effort to steal the market for plaintiff's game," he writes.</p><p>Spyder Games wants the court to take <em>Steal The Brainrot</em> down and to receive damages and profits related to the infringed content.</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to <em>Steal The Brainrot</em> developer ferins, identified in the complaint as Thomas van der Voort of the United Arab Emirates, for comment.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ai-trump-cuomo"><h3>AI Political Videos Tell Us Too Much About The People Behind Them</h3></a><p>AI lets politicians like Trump and Cuomo show us exactly what they see in their heads</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers"><h3>Beefed Up TwitchCon Security Couldn’t Stop The Internet’s Issues From Spilling Over Into Real Life</h3></a><p>A high-profile assault and toxic IRL streamers have forced the Twitch community to reckon with deeper-seated problems</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/criterion-mobile-closet-picks-peter-decker-interview-chicago-international-film-festival"><h3>Criterion’s Mobile Closet Wasn’t About The Van—It Was About IRL Friendships We Made Along The (Five-Hour) Way</h3></a><p>Criterion president Peter Becker reflects on how Closet Picks evolved from a spontaneous idea into a beloved ritual among cinephiles for its 40th anniversary roadshow celebration.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/brainrot-roblox-court]]></content:encoded>

While there was a moment where we thought we might have gotten a new Huntr/x banger that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-huntrix-spotify-new-song-mazatlan-by-night-2000632680"><span>turned out to be a Spotify hack</span></a><span>, Netflix hasn’t put out any new music from the fictional K-pop group yet.

It’s definitely giving the late 2000s/early 2010s adult contemporary diva, along the lines of Leona Lewis and Adele, so don’t come expecting a Huntr/x-style banger here. All that said, the song is a vocal showcase for Ejae, who soars over its chorus as she sings of an estranged relationship that’s fallen through.

Ultimately, she discontinued her idol training to pursue a career as a songwriter. After working with groups like Red Velvet and&nbsp; Le Sserafim, she was brought onto </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span> to write songs and record demos, then was asked to be Rumi’s singing voice in the final film. And now, she’s got some of the biggest songs of 2025 and is becoming a household name and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-tonight-show-golden-performance-ejae-2000633180"><span>performing on late-night talk shows</span></a><span>.

<h2 id="h-what-is-wordle">What Is Wordle?</h2>



<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game tasks players with guessing a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">From the series’ earliest 2D entries, to Ryu's critically acclaimed foray into 3D, Ninja Gaiden has hacked and slashed its way to the top of the hyper-violent action games genre. And while countless ninja games have been released since the 1988 NES original, Ninja Gaiden still remains relevant nearly 40 years later. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why is that? Let’s take a look back to when this series found its core game design DNA, with its early use of cinematics, narrative-driven gameplay, and innovation in difficult but rewarding challenges (not to mention, one of the sickest finishers ever in a video game.) From there, we’ll chart the course of Ninja Gaiden to see how it has kept its blade sharp over the decades, and why it remains one of the most influential action series of all time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Defining The Great Line</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The year is 1988. Arcades are a dominant force thanks to the likes of Double Dragon, Ghouls &amp; Ghosts, and Contra. These are all excellent games in their own right, but little did the world know that one of the most important ninja games of all time was about to be released. Ninja Ryūkenden, the game we in the western world now know as Ninja Gaiden (because, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100819051328/https://hg101.kontek.net/ninjagaiden/ninjagaiden9.htm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to the game’s art director</a>, “it sounded cool,”) launched with two dramatically different versions. The arcades saw a Double Dragon-inspired port, which while popular at the time, was dramatically different from the NES console version of Ninja Gaiden we would all come to know and love. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden was an unexpected revolution in action games. Overnight, it redefined what video games were capable of thanks to its difficult but gratifying combat, narrative-driven gameplay, and one of gaming’s first uses of cinematic cutscenes to tell its story. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/20/ninjagaiden-1760963315218.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The original Ninja Gaiden box art. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, you’d be hard-pressed to find a major release without some sort of cutscene or narrative break, with some even feeling more like interactive movies than video games. In the early days, though, this simply wasn't the case. The majority of games on the NES used a single static image with text and music to bookend a game's story, something you could only very loosely call a cutscene. Games like Castlevania or The Legend of Zelda, which featured stories that demanded more explanation, would require you to open up the manual and find it yourself, rather than find it in the game. And yes, while hardware was a limitation, that wasn’t the only reason. Western and Japanese versions of some NES games varied dramatically in narrative,  tone, and marketing. Such variations were due to the fact that, at the time, video games were still considered to be primarily for kids, which each territory’s version tweaked for their respective younger audiences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of Ninja Gaiden’s goals was to change that. Developer Tecmo used a Hollywood blockbuster-like approach to elevate its storytelling for mature audiences. The game starts with a <a href="https://youtu.be/ueeKMQSS4bw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cutscene of two ninjas</a> duelling to the death in a grassy moonlit field. Like a “big budget” movie, it utilized fast cuts, cinematic camera work, a widescreen aspect ratio, and expressive music to set up the death of Ryu’s father, the inciting incident that leads you on a game-long quest for revenge. Revenge narratives weren't new to video games, but that kind of cinematic setup sure was. In just a few seconds, we went from video games with little to no storytelling, to anime-inspired cutscenes and dialogue motivating you to complete your journey. This level of storytelling marked a major step forward in the perception of video games, proving they could be so much more than a child’s toy. Now, video games could also be an engaging platform to tell a captivating story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cutscenes, however, aren't the only thing that made Ninja Gaiden stand out all those years ago. Tecmo’s game design also made significant strides, and Ninja Gaiden proved to be uniquely challenging to gamers of the 8-bit generation. Instead of having to time jumps and memorize level layouts like in early Mega Man and Mario games, Gaiden’s high difficulty, high reward gameplay tied progression to skill development and a player’s ability to master the game’s combat mechanics.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/20/ninjagaiden-stage11-1760963708535.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ninja Gaiden had a fresh approach to difficulty, with enemies that would surprise attack from behind.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before Ninja Gaiden, most “hard” games were purposefully designed to be challenging because it was an easy way to pad out the run time (or, in the case of the arcade, make sure our pockets were noticeably lighter when we left.) While some games, like early Mega Man, Castlevania, and Mario games, did demand a level of skill to beat, their difficulty was mostly based on level memorization. Ninja Gaiden was one of the first games to take the idea of high-challenge, high-reward and mould it into something enjoyable. You’re going to die a lot, but after enough frustrating failure (those dogs at the start of the game are no joke, and don't even get me started on the flying enemies in later stages) you’ll quickly find yourself playing with a mix of defensive dodging and aggressive strikes, and having a lot of fun while you do them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stage 1-1 is a masterclass in this philosophy, teaching players that challenge can be rewarding. The first stage in most games typically acts as a tutorial. Super Mario Bros. teaches players how to jump with little difficulty. Metroid forces the player to backtrack in order to gain the morphball ability, teaching players the necessity of exploration. And Sonic quickly demonstrates the need for speed. By immediately thrusting you into combat, Ninja Gaiden’s first level not only explains the game's core mechanic of kill or be killed, but also demonstrates that enemies can come from all directions, even behind you. The game's tutorial level is a trial by fire that teaches you to strike first and strike fast. That skill is continually reinforced throughout the game, requiring a lot more trial and error as things get progressively harder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sounds familiar, doesn't it? While the first true “soulslike” game wouldn't be released for another 20+ years, it's not hard to see Gaiden's DNA in Demon’s Souls, Bloodborne, and every other soulsborne game since. This challenging and, at times, frustrating game design not only solidified Ninja Gaiden’s NES adventure as one of the 8-bit era’s best games, but also helped shape the next generation of Ryu’s adventures on the Game Boy, SEGA’s Master System, and, a decade later, the original Xbox.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bury Me in Black</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/20/ninja-gaiden-black-1760964153805.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Team Ninja's 2004 3D re-imagining of Ninja Gaiden was an action game revolution.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The sixth generation of video games featured some of the most influential games of all time. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Resident Evil 4. Halo: Combat Evolved. Kingdom Hearts. Metal Gear Solid 3. The list goes on and on. So, it would take a forward-thinking (not to mention generation-defining) entry in the Ninja Gaiden series to cut its own place in what many consider one of gaming’s best generations. For Ninja Gaiden, no fewer than three games kept the series sharp during a time where the competition was fierce and groundbreaking innovation was everywhere. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A few years earlier, Tecmo had established a new internal studio to develop Dead or Alive. But by the turn of the millenium, that studio – now named Team Ninja – had begun work on a new Ninja Gaiden. That project would become 2004’s Ninja Gaiden, released exclusively on Microsoft’s new Xbox console. Its expanded 2005 release, Ninja Gaiden Black, is considered one of the greatest action games of not only the sixth generation, but of all time. IGN gave it an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/19/ninja-gaiden-black">incredibly high score of 9.4</a>, praising its fast-paced combat, its hard but rewarding gameplay, and action. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to the original, this new take on the series had the goal of redefining the standards of what an action game could be. While the cutscenes looked great for the time, it’s Ninja Gaiden’s gameplay that would once again shine and raise the bar for challenging action games across the board, while still emphasizing the strike hard, strike fast precision and timing from the NES era games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is more chaotic and aggressive now that Ryu can be attacked in three dimensions, and parrying incoming attacks relies heavily on timing and rhythm. You can't just button mash your way through enemies – it requires a more methodical approach with each encounter, something you hone through a lot of death. Just like in the first game, you're taught this right off the bat as you find yourself fighting two very annoying ninjas on a cliffside. Rhythm, timing, and enemy behavior are important here. Foes can attack you from all sides and quickly overwhelm Ryu. Choosing when to attack, when to dodge, and when to avoid enemies ends up becoming a meta game of rock, paper, scissors, and it’s something we’ve seen in countless games since – from the Batman Arkham series to practically every Souls game ever. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/20/ng2b-1760964258281.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ninja Gaiden 2 was re-released in 2025 with remastered visuals and extra content.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For some players, myself included, Ninja Gaiden Black was one of the first games where, even though the gameplay could get extremely frustrating at times, it was pretty hard to put down once the game's core mechanics were figured out. For me, it wasn't until I beat the first boss, timing my strikes and dodges by finding the right balance between patience and aggression, that I understood how rewarding Ninja Gaiden could be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the time the final boss comes stomping around, I’d been trained to fight in such a way that the entire event feels cinematic based on its gameplay, not cutscenes. Instead of cheesing the boss and spamming the attack button a million times until their health bar hits zero (which is how I unsuccessfully played at the start of the game,) I found myself dodging and parrying in ways I simply couldn't early on in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a journey that's found in pretty much every high-difficulty, high-reward game to this day. But if you take a step back and think about it, by forcing the player to “get good”, or at least achieve some semblance of a flow state, the combat actually becomes a narrative device that helps progress the story. By combining parries, dodges, and attacks with razor precision, you grow alongside Ryu. You get stronger alongside Ryu. And, most importantly, by the end, you fight like a master Ninja. It’s just like what the first game achieved, way back in 1988. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Never Fade Away</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While not as impactful as the 2004 release, Ninja Gaiden 2 and 3 went on to receive critical acclaim and multiple re-releases and revisions. These games improved on what made the original Xbox release so meaningful, pushing Gaiden’s precise combat and difficulty into the next console generation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the franchise didn't cut through the competition in quite the same way Ninja Gaiden Black did at the height of the sixth console generation. And so it wasn't until well over a decade later that indie developer The Game Kitchen would revitalize the series with Ninja Gaiden Ragebound. What’s old is new again. Ragebound took the series back to its 2D roots, adding more to the lore of Ninja Gaiden, and perfecting the series’s difficult-but-fair gameplay for a new generation of side-scrollers. It went on to be considered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review">one of the best</a> entries in the series, according to the IGN audience, and I concur. What’s more, it helped pave the way for the latest instalment, Ninja Gaiden 4, which looks set to raise the bar again for a new generation of hyper-violent and tough action games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s impossible to overstate the impact Ninja Gaiden has had on action games over the years. Its DNA can be found in hundreds of great games – echoes of its excellent combat mechanics, crushing difficulty, and use of cinematics can be found everywhere in the genre. Simply put, action games as they are today simply wouldn’t exist without the influence of Ninja Gaiden.</p><div id="rank-the-ninja-gaiden-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank the Ninja Gaiden games</h3><h3>Rank the Ninja Gaiden games</h3></p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-ninja-gaidens-razer-sharp-gameplay-still-influences-games-today]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Strauss Zelnick, the chairman and CEO of Take-Two, has once again shared his thoughts on AI in the video game space, and he believes the technology is "great" but people are overstating what it can do.</p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/ai-is-a-combination-of-metadata-with-a-parlor-trick-take-two-boss-says-a-great-thing-for-business-but-its-not-creative-and-never-will-be/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer reported</a> that Zelnick said at the Paley International Council Summit this week that, "AI is a great thing" for "every industry," including video games. But it's not a magic wand.</p><p>"Will it recreate or create genius? No. Will it create hits? No. It's a bunch of data with a bunch of compute with a language model attached," he said.</p><p>The executive added that AI will probably be able to help people work more efficiently, but AI is not a forward-looking technology that can actually do anything creative.</p><p>"What AI is, is the combination of big datasets with a bunch of compute within natural LLM—a large language model," Zelnick said. "And by definition, a data set is what? Backward-looking. By definition, creativity is what? Forward-looking. And to the extent that AI appears to be forward-looking, it is what? A predictive model."</p><p>What's more, Zelnick pushed back on the claim that AI will lead to net losses in jobs, citing historical evidence to make his point. "In 1865, 65% of the US workforce was involved in agriculture. Today we make food for America and food for the rest of the world. And 2% of the workforce is involved with agriculture. And I defy you to find anyone who recently said to you, 'It's so horrible, I can't get a job as a farmer,'" he said.</p><p>Before this, Zelnick said the term "artificial intelligence" is an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-boss-discusses-ai-and-how-machines-dont-learn/1100-6529316/" data-ref-id="1100-6529316">oxymoron</a> because machines cannot learn. "Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever."</p><p>Zelnick also previously talked about how people are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/" data-ref-id="1100-6511244">overstating the power and abilities of AI technologies</a>. "It's not going to allow someone to say, 'Please develop the competitor to Grand Theft Auto that's better than Grand Theft Auto', and then they just send it out and ship it digitally and that will be that. People will try, but that won't happen," Zelnick said.</p><p>The executive went on to say that AI technologies may be similar to a hand calculator. Decades ago, parents worried that hand calculators would mean children wouldn't need to learn math, but that wasn't the case. "The answer is yes, you still have to learn math, turns out, you absolutely have to learn math, but you have a tool that makes it easier to do. And ChatGPT is the same thing," he said.</p><p>Masahiro Sakurai, who is best known for creating the Kirby franchise and for his work on the Super Smash Bros. series, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">the AAA game development scene is unsustainable but that AI can help.</a> Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield, meanwhile, believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-can-help-save-the-broken-beaten-battered-games-industry-dev-says/1100-6535516/" data-ref-id="1100-6535516">AI can help save the "broken, beaten, battered" games industry.</a></p><p>Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a> EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a> Workers at EA have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">blasted the proposed sale</a> over a range of concerns, including the possibility of mass layoffs and studio closures.</p><p>Regarding concerns from workers about AI across the global games industry overall, 30% of developers cited in the survey mentioned above said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">they believe generative AI is having a negative impact on the video game business</a> (up 12% from 2023).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.7, which brings a "highly anticipated" playable character, a brand new permanent game mode, and more early next month.</p>

<p>As announced in a press release, Version 3.7, "As Tomorrow Became Yesterday", launches on November 5th across all platforms. As you'd probably expect, the update's story follows on from that of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-3-6-release-date" rel="nofollow">Version 3.6</a>&nbsp;and "marks the climactic finale of the Amphoreous saga".</p>

<p>You'll explore the Ruins of Time, where a huge sword marks the place in which Phainon used his power to seal away the dread Irontomb. Naturally, Irontomb is stirring once more, and it'll be up to you and your team to put him down again.</p>

Just by having her in your team, your party's damage will be increased.</p>

<p>Not only that, but Cyrene can deploy a Zone on the battlefield that deals an additional instance of damage to any enemy within it that's struck by an ally. Her Ultimate uses stacks of the Remembrance resource to activate her teammates' Ultimate abilities and to buff teammates further.</p>

<p>You can also expect a new gameplay mode in the form of Currency Wars, which sees players forming teams of up to ten fighters in order to take part in combat operations. 61 characters will be available as part of this mode, and you'll be able to try them all out as part of a free trial as well.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em><a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now for free</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices. Version 3.7, "As Tomorrow Became Yesterday", will launch on November 5th across all of these platforms. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
