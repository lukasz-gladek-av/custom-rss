            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US industry analyst group Circana has released its gaming sales data for November, and it turns out that&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>has earned itself a rather impressive accolade.</p>

<p>According to the indefatigable Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf4czuc2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on social media platform Bluesky</a>,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>"became the best-selling sports video game in US history" in dollar sales terms in November.</p>

<p>That's perhaps not particularly surprising given that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana" rel="nofollow">scored the top spot</a>&nbsp;on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S in the month of its release. <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>'s achievement is perhaps even more impressive when we consider that so far, it hasn't been released on PC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game-play.jpg?itok=YoRcFsNA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game-play.jpg?itok=bBB3chky 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>has sold pretty well, and that's an understatement.</figcaption></figure><p>Piscatella goes on to point out that not only is&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>sitting pretty in the sports game hall of fame, but it also now "ranks among the top 50 best-selling tracked video games" of all time according to dollar sales.</p>

<p>While the game may have reached the lofty status outlined above in November (and topped the Xbox charts to boot), it wasn't actually the best-selling PlayStation game of the month; <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf4dbok2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that honor</a> goes to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, which apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">enjoyed the franchise's biggest ever launch</a>.</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>didn't get a release on Switch, the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf7vf2c2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">best-selling game on Nintendo's console</a> for November was instead&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, with&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>MySims: Cozy Bundle&nbsp;</em>taking up second and third place.</p>

<p>Overall, consumer spending fell by 7% in November compared <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-sales-data-november-2023" rel="nofollow">to last year</a>, although subscription service spending was up by 8% on a year-on-year basis, which Piscatella attributes to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1" rel="nofollow">debut of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>on Game Pass</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-slightly-increase-in-november-2024-thanks-to-ps5-pro/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Video game hardware sales in the United States (US) slightly increased in November 2024. That’s according to the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf4dap62o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>.</p>



<p>For November 2024, video game hardware spending increased by 0.3$ from $924 million (M) to $927M year-over-year. That’s a major change from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-fell-october-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October’s numbers</a> which saw a 23% year-over-year fall. </p>



<p>Unlike October 2024, where a decrease in sales was across the board, November was a bit different. Thanks to the launch of the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro and its $700 price tag, the PS5 saw a 15% increase in overall spending. On the other side of things, however, the Nintendo Switch say a 3% year-over-year drop in sales while the Xbox fell 29%.</p>



<p>Going back to the PS5, the PS5 Pro made up 19% of the number of PS5 consoles sold in November while also accounting for 28% of the money. That’s a 12% decrease in launch month sales of the PS4 Pro, but a 50% increase in dollars. The PS4 Pro launched at $400 in 2016 compared to the aforementioned $700 of the PS5 Pro. </p>



<h6 id="h-related-college-football-25-remains-2024-s-best-selling-video-game">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-remains-2024s-best-selling-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">College Football 25 Remains 2024’s Best-Selling Video Game</a></h6>



<p>In total for 2024, hardware sales in the US have fallen 24% to $3.74 billion (B) from the $4.9B in 2023. In terms of general units, 2.4M consoles were sold in November 2024 compared to the 2.3M sold in November 2023. That brings the total number of consoles sold for 2024 up to 9.4M, down compared to the 11.7M sold by this time in 2023.</p>



<p>That said, accessories continue to perform better than a year ago. In total, accessory sales rose 4% in November year-over-year while the year-to-date numbers jumped 8%. According to the data, the PlayStation Portal remains the best-selling accessory both for November 2024 and the entire year.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Uncharted's Amy Hennig announced that her first title at Skydance New Media will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-featuring-captain-america-and-black-panther/1100-6521993/" data-ref-id="1100-6521993">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, a game that will bring Captain America face-to-face with the Black Panther of World War II, Azzuri, who is also the grandfather of the modern Black Panther, T'Challa. The early preview trailer suggested that the game would take place in Europe during the Nazi occupation, but apparently the story will also bring players to Wakanda and other locations.</p><p>"Wakanda and Occupied Paris are both key locations," Henning told <a href="https://ew.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-globe-trotting-wwii-epic-wakanda-setting-exclusive-8760326" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EW</a>. "We wanted to tell a globe-trotting story... There are yet-to-be-revealed locations in between... Wakanda at this point in time is hidden away from the outside world and protected by this impenetrable jungle. They are non-interventionist, but events transpire that pull them into the conflict. They have to protect their interests. The world is getting smaller... but how long can you stay in the shadows?"</p><p>Henning also teased that there's another super soldier in Paris during this story whom she did not name. However, EW's report did announce that one of the new characters created for the game is Julie (Lyne Renée), an ally in the French Resistance. As previously revealed, there are four playable characters in the game: </p><ul><li>Drew Moerlein as Captain America/Steve Rogers</li><li>Khary Payton as Black Panther/Azzuri</li><li>Marque Richardson as Gabriel Jones</li><li>Megalyn Echikunwoke as Nanali</li></ul><p>Cap's ally, Howard Stark--the father of future Iron Man, Tony Stark--will also be in the game, as voiced by Joel Johnstone. For now, Henning declined to reveal what sets the story in motion, but she hinted at a mystery that will unfold during the game's narrative.</p><p>"In these kinds of stories, particularly when you have this unfolding mystery, you always want your MacGuffin to pull the characters along," said Henning. "That there is this impending threat and a shared object of desire."</p><p>Marvel 1943: Rise Of Hydra will be released in 2025, but the game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">If you're looking for a last-minute gift for a Nintendo fan who grew up during the Game Boy era, the newly released <a href="https://modretro.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ModRetro Chromatic</a> is one of the coolest retro gaming gadgets of 2024. The Chromatic is a modernized Game Boy Color that looks, plays, and feels like the real thing. Unlike most retro handhelds that aim to do a little bit of everything, the Chromatic is unabashedly committed to the singular goal of replicating the GBC experience as you fondly remember it. For the subset of retro gamers who crave authenticity, the Chromatic is an undeniable success. It's also one of the best-built portable devices I've ever used.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no shortage of retro gaming handhelds on the market today, including <em>many </em>that mimic Nintendo's iconic Game Boy family. Most are emulation devices that can offer solid experiences for budget prices. But whereas most of these devices resemble the general look of the Game Boy, the Chromatic is one of the few that truly replicates the experience of playing on one. It takes "paying homage" to the next level. If you prefer original hardware, whether stock or modded, the Chromatic is the closest approximation to the Game Boy I've ever played. But if you slapped a Nintendo logo on it and told me the Chromatic was Nintendo's jump into the premium retro hardware space, I wouldn't believe you. Not because it's inauthentic, but because Nintendo would never mass produce a handheld built with such pricey components.</p><p dir="ltr">ModRetro was founded by Palmer Luckey, who is best known as the creator of the Oculus Rift. He sold Oculus VR to Facebook in 2014 for $2 billion and went on to cofound Anduril Industries, a defense technology company, in 2017. Anduril Industries manufactures AI-powered military devices such as drones and sells them to the Department of Defense. It appears ModRetro is a passion project for Luckey, and based on the Chromatic's build, he spared no expense making it happen.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417521-modretrochromatic.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417521" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417521-modretrochromatic.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417521"></a><figcaption>ModRetro Chromatic</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417521-modretrochromatic.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Chromatic plays all Game Boy and Game Boy Color cartridges as well as Chromatic-branded carts. Because the Chromatic is an FPGA device, all of your original cartridges will run <em>exactly </em>as they did on the Atomic Purple Game Boy Color you wish you hadn't sold at that garage sale as a kid. This also means all Chromatic carts are simply Game Boy carts with different branding that work on original hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">While the Chromatic has a few modifiable display settings, including different levels of brightness for the backlit screen, Frame Blending, and Color Correction for streaming gameplay on computer monitors, it was intentionally designed to replicate, rather than improve, the visuals of the Game Boy Color. The backlit screen understandably makes a huge difference, but it looks very similar to a modded Game Boy Color with a nice backlit panel. The Chromatic has a 2.56-inch backlit IPS LCD made of sapphire crystal. The screen size is virtually identical to that of the Game Boy Pocket, which had a slightly larger screen than the GBC (2.3 inches).</p><p dir="ltr">For purists who refuse to play games on anything but original hardware, native resolution is one of the commonly cited explanations. The Chromatic retains the GBC's 160 x 144p resolution, so every pixel is the right size and in the right spot. This is a much different approach than the Analogue Pocket, which has a 3.5-inch Gorilla Glass display with a staggering 1600 x 1440p resolution and 650 pixels per inch. Games play the same on Pocket, but the greatly increased pixel density means they don't look exactly the same. Whether they look better or worse depends on who you ask--I think they look better--but there's no denying the Pocket's screen and internal tech are more advanced. It has display settings that replicate the look of various Game Boy models as well as its own filters that effectively upscale the visuals. This also means the Pocket can recreate the green background color of the original Game Boy DMG, which had a dot-matrix display. The Chromatic isn't capable of that; instead, it displays original Game Boy carts as they looked on the Game Boy Color.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417528-allthreesidebyside.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417528" data-ratio="0.627" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417528-allthreesidebyside.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417528"></a><figcaption>Game Boy Color | ModRetro Chromatic | Analogue Pocket</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417528-allthreesidebyside.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">So while both the Chromatic and Pocket both play GB and GBC carts--the Pocket also plays GBA carts and supports adapters for other platforms--they aren't doing exactly the same thing. The Chromatic is made for people who want the most authentic Game Boy Color experience possible without buying and modding one. The Pocket is an openFPGA handheld with support for a long list of retro platforms. It has the general Game Boy shape, but it's a larger device with an enhanced visual experience and tons of customization features.</p><p dir="ltr">I <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analogue-pocket-review-the-best-way-to-play-game-boy-games/1100-6498917/">reviewed the Analogue Pocket</a> when it launched back in 2021 and called it the best way to play Game Boy games. I still feel that way today, but keep in mind that I am not someone who cares about playing games in their native resolution with the same pixel density, screen size, and form factor. While I prefer the Pocket due to its upscaled resolution, the $199 Chromatic has a more premium build than the base Pocket for $220. And if I was picking between the Chromatic and any of the modded Game Boys I've used, I'd pick the Chromatic. It's highly unlikely you could get a Game Boy Color and make it as nice as the Chromatic for less than its $199 launch price. The build quality is <em>seriously </em>impressive.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417532-chromaticpokemon.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417532" data-ratio="0.85222222222222" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417532-chromaticpokemon.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417532"></a><figcaption>ModRetro Chromatic Wave | Analogue Pocket Glow in the Dark</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417532-chromaticpokemon.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">From a feel perspective, the Chromatic's uncommonly used Sapphire Crystal panel is no different from glass, though the technology is typically viewed as even more resistant to scratches than tempered and Gorilla Glass. A quick Google search will tell you that Sapphire can cost 10 times as much as Gorilla Glass. A 144p display utilizing one of the priciest materials possible is a peculiar combo, but that's the theme with the Chromatic as a whole: ultra-premium.</p><p dir="ltr">The Chromatic's shell is 5.2 x 3 x 1.2 inches, a near-exact match to the Game Boy Color's 5.26 x 3.1 x 1.08-inch shell. But instead of plastic, ModRetro used injection molding to craft the Chromatic's magnesium alloy shell. Portable gaming devices with metal shells aren't unheard of, but, again, they aren't common due to cost. Analogue, for instance, released a limited-edition Pocket with an aluminum shell for $499 earlier this year. Boxy Pixel, a popular choice in the modding community, sells aluminum GBC sells for $72 and up. ModRetro built the Chromatic shells with the pricey injection molding process, which generally leads to more consistency and material strength. The Chromatic, unsurprisingly, is heavier than a Game Boy as a result. On the spec sheet, it's 6.2 ounces, whereas the Game Boy Color is 4.9 ounces with two batteries and the DMG is 7.8 ounces with four batteries. When you pop in three AA batteries, the Chromatic is closer to 9 ounces. I wouldn't say it's heavy, but for a handheld this small, it definitely has some heft to it. To be fair, magnesium alloy is the lightest structural metal, so the Chromatic is likely as light as it gets in this form factor. And the metal shell is important here--I definitely wouldn't trade it for plastic.</p><p dir="ltr">The Chromatic is without a doubt the sturdiest handheld I've ever used. It's extremely well-made, with no weak points, creaks, or inconsistencies of any kind. The remarkably premium feel does come with one caveat. As mentioned, it mirrors the Game Boy Color in size. If you haven't held a Game Boy as an adult, you may be surprised at how small it is. As an adult with average-sized hands, it took a little time for me to readjust to the form factor and screen size. The slight bit of added depth helps, and Nintendo's vertically oriented Game Boys have surprisingly solid ergonomics in general. The Chromatic is comfortable to hold--for me at least. The screen and shell size might be an issue for you, depending on your eyesight and hand size.</p><p dir="ltr">As with the rest of the build, the buttons are also made of premium materials. ModRetro built the D-pad and two face buttons with PBT, the same thermoplastic used for keycaps on some high-end mechanical keyboards. Like those keycaps, the D-pad has a slightly textured, matte finish, while the A and B buttons have a glossy coating. The D-pad is larger and softer than ones found on Game Boys, which certainly makes the Chromatic more comfortable to hold and control. It's a superb D-pad with fast action and consistent travel distances with each tap. The buttons are quieter than on many controllers, partly because they don't rattle or wobble in the slightest. I suspect the injection molding helped with getting the perfect fit.</p><p dir="ltr">The front layout is identical to the original Game Boy, with even the Start and Select buttons being positioned diagonally. It's neat that the Chromatic borrows a small piece from each of the Game Boys it pays homage to. Where the Chromatic's layout differs is on the sides and top. The power switch is located on the top-left corner. The IR sensor, which is used for limited multiplayer functions like trading Pokemon, is on the top-right corner. For more traditional competitive and cooperative multiplayer, the Chromatic has the Link Cable port on its left side and can be connected to other Chromatics, Game Boys, and Analogue Pockets. The volume rocker is on the right, and the 3.5mm headphone jack is (thankfully) on the bottom right corner.</p><p dir="ltr">The Chromatic, like basically every portable device, sounds better with headphones, but this little device has a very impressive speaker. It's pitched as a "custom ultra-loud speaker module," which is an accurate description. When I tested it at full volume with my office door closed, my family could hear it clearly in the other room. More importantly, the audio is crisp. Portable speaker technology has made huge strides since the '90s, and it's put to here, making for a pleasant listening experience, with or without headphones.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417534-chromaticwave.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417534" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417534-chromaticwave.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417534"></a><figcaption>ModRetro Chromatic Wave</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417534-chromaticwave.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417554-chromatic_gameplay_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417555-chromatic_gameplay_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417556-chromatic_gameplay_7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417557-chromatic_gameplay_8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417558-chromatic_gameplay_9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417559-chromatic_gameplay_10.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417554,1300-4417555,1300-4417556,1300-4417557,1300-4417558,1300-4417559" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4417554-chromatic_gameplay_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4417555-chromatic_gameplay_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4417556-chromatic_gameplay_7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4417557-chromatic_gameplay_8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4417558-chromatic_gameplay_9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4417559-chromatic_gameplay_10.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417554-chromatic_gameplay_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417555-chromatic_gameplay_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417556-chromatic_gameplay_7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417557-chromatic_gameplay_8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417558-chromatic_gameplay_9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417559-chromatic_gameplay_10.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Chromatic has one button you won't find on Game Boys. When you flick the power switch, you're booted right into the cartridge, just like old times. But there is a button on the right side that pulls up a small settings menu. This is where you can adjust display brightness, enter silent mode (disables the sound output), and alter display settings. As mentioned, there are only two settings here: Frame Blend and Color Correction. The former fixes issues with games that the Game Boy's screen couldn't keep up with due to the slow response times of older screen technology. The frames would, in essence, blend together. Color Correction is disabled by default, though it'll come in handy if you decide to utilize the Chromatic's USB-C port.</p><p dir="ltr">You can connect the Chromatic to your PC via USB-C to stream gameplay with OBS. It's not a traditional video-out function, so you aren't "docking" the Chromatic, but streamers can share gameplay and you can play on a larger screen without streaming by simply starting a local OBS stream. Modern monitors interfacing with retro hardware sometimes make color palettes look <em>off</em>, and that's where Color Correction comes in to clean things up.</p><p dir="ltr">Out of the box, the Chromatic is powered by three AA batteries. It comes with three Chromatic-branded batteries and is compatible with rechargeable AA batteries. Battery life will be highly dependent on brightness levels, but I averaged six to seven hours before needing to pop new ones in. I'd definitely recommend rechargeable Duracell or Energizer batteries to save money. It's not available yet, but ModRetro will have a custom lithium-ion battery for sale that can be charged through the USB-C port. If you do rely on swapping in AAs, the battery cover and clip feels like they will hold up a lot better than plastic covers and clips on original Game Boy hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">While the Chromatic is designed to play all of your old Game Boy and Game Boy Color cartridges, ModRetro has started its own line of Chromatic-branded cartridges. <a href="https://modretro.com/collections/games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Seven games are available at launch</a>, with more in the pipeline for early 2025. ModRetro rebuilt two of the best puzzle games of the Game Boy era for the Chromatic's launch. Just like the original Game Boy in 1989, "first edition" Chromatic handhelds are bundled with Tetris at launch. Yes, actual, officially licensed Tetris. This enhanced version of the greatest puzzle game of all time is superb, with bright and colorful 8-bit visuals and numerous customization options, including the ability to toggle between modern or classic rules. ModRetro also revitalized the GBC puzzle-platformer Toki Tori, and much like Tetris, this is a better version of the game thanks to faster movement speed and auto-jump.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417535-modretrochromaticbox.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417535" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417535-modretrochromaticbox.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417535"></a><figcaption>ModRetro Chromatic packaging and release titles</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417535-modretrochromaticbox.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The other launch games are indies from homebrew developers, including one of the most-anticipated titles in the Game Boy homebrew scene: Dragonyhm, previously known as Dragonborne DX. This sprawling top-down adventure is a fun mix of Pokemon and Zelda that's definitely worth checking out. In the Dark 2 is a story-based, exceedingly clever puzzler from the co-creators of <a href="https://krooltoys.itch.io/grimaces-birthday" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Grimace's Birthday</a>, while the Chromatic-exclusive Patchy Matchy is a really enjoyable grid puzzle game that's a perfect pick-up-and-play experience. Traumatarium Penitent is a gorgeous first-person dungeon crawler that I had already played when the <a href="https://horatiunyc.itch.io/traumatarium-penitent" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">digital version</a> launched earlier this year (I'd also recommend its predecessor, <a href="https://horatiunyc.itch.io/traumatarium" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Traumatarium</a>). Finally, Tales of Monsterland DX is the enhanced and expanded version of one of the better homebrew Game Boy platformers I've played. If you like Wonder Boy, you'll probably like this.</p><p dir="ltr">With the exception of Tetris, which is packaged with the Chromatic, each game comes inside an old-school style cardboard box with key art on the front and facts on the back. Inside the box you'll find an instruction manual, a plastic insert to hold the cartridge, and a little charm that could be added to a charm bracelet (if you have one).</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://modretro.com/collections/products" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Chromatic costs $199 and is available in seven colors</a>: Inferno (orange), Leaf (green), Bubblegum (pink), Volt (yellow), Wave (blue), Midnight (black), and a Game Boy DMG-inspired gray. The gray bundle is exclusive to GameStop, while the rest of the colors are only available directly from ModRetro. The Chromatic looks just as good up close as it does in pictures. The packaging for the Chromatic might be the coolest I've seen for a handheld. It's designed to look like a school notebook, complete with a fold-out front cover and a wide assortment of colorful doodles surrounding pictures of the handheld and "Chromatic" in bubble letters.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The bottom line</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">ModRetro's Chromatic is a truly superb recreation of the Game Boy Color. If you want a near-exact replica of your childhood Game Boy with a backlit screen, this is the handheld for you. At $199, and even if you didn't get a great new spin on Tetris, I'd argue the Chromatic is a bargain due to its ridiculously premium build. But this is a bargain for a <em>very </em>specific type of retro gamer. If you've been considering modding a Game Boy or buying a pre-modded one from a reseller, the Chromatic is arguably the highest-end modded Game Boy Color around. It's not anywhere close to as versatile as the Analogue Pocket, but for those who want to play GB and GBC games as authentically as possible, the Chromatic is as real as it gets.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Price</strong> - $199 for first edition bundle with Tetris cart</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Compatibility</strong> - Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Chromatic cartridges</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Display</strong> - 2.56-inch sapphire crystal backlit IPS LCD</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Resolution</strong> - 160 x 144p</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Size</strong> - 5.2 x 3 x 1.2-inch</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight:</strong> 6.2 ounces</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Shell</strong> - Magnesium alloy thixomolded shell</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Buttons</strong> - PBT face buttons and D-pad</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery</strong> - 6-7 hours with two AA batteries (from our testing)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Audio</strong> - internal speaker, 3.5mm headphones</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ports</strong> - link cable, 3.5mm audio, USB-C with video out for streaming with OBS</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Multiplayer</strong> - via backwards compatible link cable, IR sensor</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Colors</strong> - Inferno, Leaf, Bubblegum, Volt, Wave, Midnight, Gray</li></ul><hr><hr><p><em>ModRetro provided GameSpot with the Chromatic and game cartridges for the purpose of this review.</em></p>

            <p>Lost Soul Aside is set to launch in 2025, nine years after its solo developer first revealed the Devil May Cry and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy 15</a> inspired action game.</p>
<p>Chinese developer Yang Bing originally started the project alone, before founding his studio Ultizero Games. Now Sony will publish the game for PS5 and PC (Steam).</p>
<p>Alongside the launch news, a new trailer for the game has been released with fresh footage of its sword-wielding hero and dragon companion fighting an ice beast with spectacular combat.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUpfaHrR8Yk">PlayStation previously shared a trailer</a> for the game two years ago from the PlayStation China Hero Project launch event, which includes more of its character action and platforming across a world blending sci-fi and Chinese tradition.</p>
<p>Before that, eight years ago, it was an indie prototype developed by Bing alone using stock assets.</p>
<p>And if the protagonist looks a little like Noctis from Final Fantasy 15, that game directly inspired Bing's work, along with Devil May Cry.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-killzone-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios has announced the very first&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>crossover, and it's with a classic Sony first-person shooter franchise we haven't heard from in some time.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750491" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam news post</a> earlier today,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s first ever collaboration is with none other than&nbsp;<em>Killzone</em>. More specifically, the crossover introduces items inspired by&nbsp;<em>Killzone 2&nbsp;</em>to the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>arsenal.</p>

<p>Arrowhead says that this crossover represents the first foray into a "new tier of special Premium content reserved for collaborations and other uniquely-themed work", so it sounds like we'll be getting more crossovers later down the line.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-killzone-crossover-store.jpg?itok=HHrzynCK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-killzone-crossover-store.jpg?itok=JeIrzW0j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s first crossover is with none other than&nbsp;<em>Killzone</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2 Killzone&nbsp;</em>crossover doesn't take the form of a Warbond along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">Truth Enforcers</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-chemical-agents-warbond" rel="nofollow">Chemical Agents</a>. Rather, it's a set of new gear and other goodies you can buy from the game's Superstore, which offers individual items for in-game Super Credits.</p>

<p>Given&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s theming, it'll probably come as no surprise that this crossover revolves heavily around&nbsp;<em>Killzone</em>'s fascist Helghast, with an armor set, a cape, and other liveries available that echo the logos and visual aesthetic of the Helghan Empire.</p>

<p>Of course, the tones of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>are somewhat at odds.&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>takes a more&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em>-esque satirical view of fascism, while&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>plays things more seriously.</p>

<p>Still, it's interesting to see&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s first crossover emerge in this way. Could this also be Sony's stealthy way of trying to gauge interest for a potential&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>revival? We will have to wait and see.</p>




<p>This crossover comes shortly after the release of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Omens of Tyranny update, which introduces the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-cloaked-ships-rumor-update" rel="nofollow">long-awaited</a> (and apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-blue-beam-attacks-the-illuminate" rel="nofollow">previously-teased</a>) Illuminate faction into the mix.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The first part of the game's&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>crossover is live now, and a second part is apparently on its way on December 23rd.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24305570/steam-deck-best-games-2024-verified-playable-valve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The Steam Deck gets better every year, and 2024 was no exception. It’s been my primary gaming device ever since I became a parent, and I love being able to access the humongous library of games available on Steam from wherever I want, whether it’s at home or while the baby is taking a nap at grandma’s house. Valve keeps adding great features via software updates, too, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24289138/steam-game-recording-now-available-all-users">like game recording</a>.</p><p>If you’re just setting up a Steam Deck for the first time — perhaps you’re lucky enough to get one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24294106/valve-white-steam-deck">limited-edition white models</a> — or you’re dusting off your Deck after a little break, I’ve put together some recommendations of great games from this year, along with one update to a classic.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2379780%2FBalatro%2F"><em>Balatro</em></a></h3></p><p>Move over, <em>Slay the Spire</em> — there’s a new card-based roguelike king in town. Well, maybe a joker. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a>, the goal is to make familiar poker hands to earn increasingly higher amounts of chips. But between rounds, you’ll get to shop for new cards that make you more powerful, including jokers that can stack up to earn you mind-bogglingly high amounts of chips. When you get a good round going in <em>Balatro</em>, it’s a thrilling mix of planning, gambling, and watching numbers go up — and when your luck eventually runs out, it’s all too easy to hop back in for just one more round.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1845910%2FDragon_Age_The_Veilguard%2F"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></h3></p><p>BioWare’s latest fantasy RPG is an epic quest that’s especially well suited to the Steam Deck. It’s got all of the hallmarks of what’s expected from BioWare — dialogue trees, fun companions, and lots of ways to build your characters — and the game’s expansive story is broken up into several smaller quests, making it easy to take care of one in a short session before bed. While the game is verified for Steam Deck, you’ll have to tweak your graphics settings to make it run well. But I’ll take the imperfect performance to be able to play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24281631/dragon-age-the-veilguard-early-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>The Veilguard</em></a> wherever I want.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1145350%2FHades_II%2F"><em>Hades II</em></a></h3></p><p>I wasn’t going to include early access games on this list, but I had to break my rule for <em>Hades II</em>. Even though it isn’t complete yet, it’s better than most of the games I’ve played this year. Supergiant’s sequel smartly builds upon the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc">action roguelike formula of the first game</a> with new weapons, <em>two</em> different routes to tackle (though one is unfinished), and a great new cast of hotties to hang out with (and some old ones returning). I’ve had to actually stop myself from playing this game as much as I want to — I don’t want to get tired of the game before its eventual 1.0 launch. And as my colleague Ash Parrish has already said, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152085/hades-2-steam-deck-performance">it’s the perfect Steam Deck game</a>.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2679460%2FMetaphor_ReFantazio%2F"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a></h3></p><p>I’ve already written an entire article about how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, the newest RPG from Atlus, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24266327/metaphor-refantazio-persona-handheld-heritage">continues <em>Persona</em>’s great handheld heritage</a>: battles are turn-based but quick; the game is broken down into easily digestible days; and it runs well enough on Steam Deck with some tweaking. It’s a huge game that I still haven’t finished, but because I have it on a portable device, I’m looking forward to chipping away at it when I get spare moments here and there.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2420660%2FNeva%2F"><em>Neva</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Neva</em> is a jaw-droppingly gorgeous game about a young woman and the fox that she cares for. There’s some combat, but much of the game is about solving light platforming puzzles and taking in the absolutely stunning art and music. (I can attest that it looks really good on a Steam Deck OLED.) The game tells a powerful story about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24267805/neva-nomada-studio-interview-gris-devolver">love and loss</a> that takes just a few hours to beat — it’s the perfect game to play over a couple of evenings on the couch next to a warm fire.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Playstack / Color Gray Games</cite></p></div><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2716400%2FThe_Rise_of_the_Golden_Idol%2F"><em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em></a></h3></p><p>If you’re looking to solve some murder mysteries, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24295956/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc-playstation-xbox-netflix-mobile"><em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em></a><em> </em>will probably cast its magic on you. The game is loaded with 20 point-and-click mysteries to solve by investigating scenes and people and figuring out the right words to explain exactly what’s going on. The game is a little grotesque, but that’s part of the fun — why are you playing a murder mystery if you’re not willing to see some dead bodies with weird red eyes?</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F413150%2FStardew_Valley%2F"><em>Stardew Valley</em>’s 1.6 update</a></h3></p><p><em>Stardew Valley</em> is one of the most-played games on the Steam Deck, and with good reason: the game’s farming simulation and delightful characters are easy to spend time with for five minutes or five hours. Earlier this year, the game got a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084461/stardew-valley-game-1-6-update-release-date-pc-mac-console">massive 1.6 content update</a> with new festivals, a new farm type, and more late-game content, meaning there’s a lot to dig into, whether you’re a <em>Stardew Valley</em> veteran or starting a farm for the first time.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2366980%2FThank_Goodness_Youre_Here%2F"><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em></a></h3></p><p>In <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em>, you play as a little man bopping around a quaint English village, interacting with the many quirky townspeople, and, uh, slapping stuff. The writing is hilarious and the absurd accents are even funnier. Best of all? You can finish the whole game in about three hours. It’s delightful.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, that’s on default settings, and there’s a way to fix it—by disabling the AI-driven Game Filters setting.</p><p>The term “AI” now means so many different things, even just within the field of gaming, that it’s deeply unhelpful. It’s used to describe the programmed behavior of in-game characters and systems. It’s the name given to large language models that scrape other people’s work to generate derivative, plagiarized work. And it’s used to define any “learning” program that adapts itself based on experience. It’s the latter that’s relevant here, what Nvidia describes as “game enhancing filters, including innovative new AI-powered filters for RTX users.” It seems that, since the switch from GeForce Experience, it’s this feature that’s causing some serious issues.</p><p>Game Filters aren’t new—they were a feature in GeForce Experience and known as Nvidia Freestyle, and by all accounts <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-improve-pc-graphics-and-add-filters-with-nvidia-freestyle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-improve-pc-graphics-and-add-filters-with-nvidia-freestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was a suite of settings worth fiddling with</a></span> to get the most out of specific games. It’s just, with the new Nvidia App, the setting is set to on by default, and whatever fancy new “AI-powered” elements it includes are causing these significant hits to performance, even when it’s sitting idly in the background. Nvidia told <em>Tom’s Hardware</em> that they’re now aware of the issue, and in the meantime explain how to switch it off:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> You can turn off Game Filters from the NVIDIA App Settings &gt; Features &gt; Overlay &gt; Game Filters and Photo Mode, and then relaunch your game.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, there’s an even more effective means of avoiding the issues: you can just uninstall the app altogether. As someone who has become lazily reliant on GeForce Experience/Nvidia App to notify me when a new Nvidia driver is available (something you really do need to stay on top of if you want to avoid issues with the latest games), it’s become a default application on my PC. It’s a useful reminder that you don’t actually <em>need</em> it—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/drivers/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can just visit Nvidia’s driver page</a></span> and download the latest drivers whenever you fancy. Like we all did in the Olden Days.</p><p>(Nvidia, despite wholly retiring Experience with the latest driver release, still hasn’t updated many of its web pages to acknowledge this, the driver site still suggesting you install it, while explanatory pages about the Game Filters all list it as an Experience feature.)</p><p>A 15-percent increase in dropped framerates is more significant than it might first sound. As <em>Tom’s Hardware </em>usefully explains, the difference in performance between the super-fancy RTX 4060 Ti and the $100-cheaper RTX 4060 is 18 percent.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From irritating bugs, to poor matchmaking, to kernel-level anti-cheat issues, there’s something for everyone to gripe about!</p><p>But first, let’s quickly review the many positive reviews users have left on Steam. Perhaps the biggest boon <em>Delta Force</em> offers is allowing those who feel disassociated with the <em>Battlefield </em>franchise a chance at rekindling their love for large-scale first-person shooters. The game offers up a lot of freedom: Want to jump from a helicopter while firing a rocket launcher at ground troops? . <em>Delta Force</em> delivers that. But more importantly, players love the feel, the optimization, and the sheer amount of opportunity in the game’s weapons, maps, and modes.</p><p>It’s not all sunshine on the battlefield, though. Many players find they cannot enjoy the experience because it feels like a cheap knockoff of their beloved franchise. Some point toward gun recoil ruining the experience, the presence of too many useless gadgets, and the game’s anti-cheat system, which the developer had to rectify in a post-launch update.</p><p><br>No matter which side of the fence you inevitably fall on, there’s no reason not to try <em>Delta Force</em>. It’s a free-to-play game with no pay-to-win mechanics. Plus, the developer resolved the anti-cheat software woes. Here’s your look at <em>Delta Force</em>, as told by Steam reviews! <br></p><hr><figure id="" data-id="803fabb66c8887edb7d2957af5b0cbbc" data-recommend-id="image://803fabb66c8887edb7d2957af5b0cbbc"

                <p>Industry analysis firm DFC Intelligence has released its 2024 market report and forecast, and despite the past two years of uncertainty, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">sweeping layoffs</a>, and studio closures, the industry is set to rebound. After two years of major growth fueled by the pandemic, and its subsequent slump, DFC predicts the industry will return to growth in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>As of 2024, the number of gamers worldwide is around 3.8 billion, a figure DFC expects to reach 4 billion--around half the global population--by 2028. Of that number, 10% are considered core gamers and account for 65% of video game spending, while the rest are considered casual gamers, many of whom only game on mobile devices and don't own any dedicated hardware.</p><p>Nintendo is set to be a major winner in the next few years, with its next console (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">colloquially known as the Switch 2</a>) expected to release in 2025 with little competition from Sony or Microsoft. DFC predicts that the Switch 2 will sell 15-17 million units in 2025, and more than 80 million by 2028.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1323506270" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

and console software sales in 2023. The category includes not only video game consoles, but PC parts and accessories, and handheld devices like the Steam Deck. This trend is driven by the core gaming audience, especially PC players who see high-end gaming hardware as a status symbol. Despite the cost of some video game accessories and hardware, DFC points out that it is still far more affordable than other hobbies like "sports cars, arts/antique collecting, travel, skiing, golf etc."</p><p>Despite the favorable outlook for hardware sales, DFC is predicting that there will be a major loser in the next generation of console wars--which could be either Sony or Microsoft depending on a number of variables. Getting in early is likely to be the deciding factor, but DFC also says a portability feature, like the Switch's, could make a difference. At this point Sony has a slight advantage thanks to its loyal user base, while Microsoft could pivot to focus on software and distribution as the largest software publisher in the industry.</p><p>"Overall, 2025 is also shaping up to be one of the best years ever for new game releases," DFC adds, singling out the highly anticipated release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">GTA 6</a>, which is expected to break records. The firm also expects that new consoles from Microsoft and Sony will release sometime between 2026 and 2028, contributing to DFC's prediction that PC and console revenue will reach $200 billion a year by 2028.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/18/alien-rogue-incursion-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>An Alien VR game seems like a no brainer, especially as the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review/">Alien Isolation’s</a> VR prototype has become a cornerstone myth of virtual reality gaming. This is one of the biggest sci-fi horror franchise of all time with iconic enemies, locations and weapons, and even the tracker ping is iconic. It’s a world just begging to be jammed in to a fancy headset. Alien: Rogue Incursion gets the the atmosphere right, but it’s more frustrating than scary to actually play.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bSTJ9RnDGfc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game starts strong with ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks literally in the hot seat of a transporter as it hurtles towards the planet Purdan – a planet which unsurprisingly looks a lot like LV-426. It’s cold and snowy with an abandoned Gemini Exoplanet Solutions research facility doing a very good impression of the colony from Aliens. You get a few moments peace before something dislodges some snow from a roof and there it is, a glistening black xenomorph, visible in the night for a few brief seconds before it skitters off in to the darkness with that classic terrifying scream.</p>


<p>The first encounter with a xenomorph is truly exhilarating as it scampers from the shadows, crawling around the sides of buildings before dropping to the ground and towering over you just as it should. Some well placed shots from the classic Pulse Rifle and you also learn the first annoying thing about the game: the Pulse Rifle kicks like a mule. Hold the trigger down and after less than a second it is firing bullets in the ceiling. This is because you are meant to be using two hands to steady the rifle, which is fine, but you need to hold the tracker in your other hand to work out where the xenomorphs are coming from, or have the map out to know where to go.</p>
<p>You’ll soon have other tools and extra weapons to juggle as you settle into a rhythm of moving between locations while fighting a few enemies,&nbsp;solving a fairly simple wiring puzzle, surviving a wave of creatures and moving on. The game is billed as having “most cunning Xenomorphs ever encountered” but it doesn’t take too long to realise that’s not true.</p>

<p>They will stalk you, scampering around in the ceiling and popping out of vents but when they decided to get close they always take a few seconds to hiss at you before they attack. They just stand there, arms outstretched like they’re coming in for a hug and always giving you a window of opportunity to unload a shotgun in their direction. You will also learn that, apart from a few key sequences, the xenos come in pairs so you know exactly how many there will be and how easy they are to kill, robbing them of their fear factor and making them more of a nuisance than anything else. You can also just away – they aren’t fast enough to catch up and kill you, so you can just leg it round most of the corridors and listen to them snarl in the distance.</p>

<p>If an encounter with an Alien gets a bit too close it will result in death (as it should) and there’s some delightfully gory sequences including watching an Alien tail burst through your stomach. If you die then you had better have manually saved your game in a Panic Room because the checkpointing is atrocious, you can lose a good twenty minutes of progress. Just to add to the annoyance, if you do try to run back to the nearest Panic Room the game may spawn a few extra xenomorphs so you have to lose precious ammo just to get a save. The game is tense, but it’s not because of the Aliens, it’s because you are worried you haven’t manually saved for a half an hour and die.</p>
<p>The game does have moments of brilliance though. One sequence in particular was genuinely sickening, and it’s followed by an exceptionally creepy stroll that was absolutely gripping. It does feel very much like you are in an Alien movie at this point – it’s wet and squelchy with things skittering overhead and hissing at your from ventilation shafts. It looks and sounds great with lots of effects for smoke and steam and some excellent heart racing music when you are being stalked.</p>
<p>Zula is partnered with Davis, an android who accompanies her physically for a short time, adding much needed firepower, before becoming the classic quest advisor on the radio. Their dialogue is mostly functional but we do occasionally get a little more of their personality so that they feel like firm friends by the end of the game.</p>

<p>The play area is fairly large which plenty of options to explore and uncover more the story via emails on terminals. However, as every single room and corridor is of the same general design it is very easy to get lost, especially when the map is so bad. Which reminds me, all the icons the map that show if there’s a terminal or a lift or a closed door, if you zoom out a bit and they all become plain white dots. There’s no way to know if you are running towards a lift that will save you from marauding creatures, or a locked door. What would have really helped is simple but effective sign posting in the world to telling you Medical is down the corridor to the right, then you don’t need to keep bringing up the map.</p>
<p>As you enter the end of the game it does pad things out by bringing you back to your ship then sending you out to the furthest reaches of the facility to complete an objective and there’s a lot of cycling through air locks and trying to remember where lifts are.</p>
<p>I did encounter a few bugs of the video game kind. Crawling into a vent got me completely stuck one time, an important object clipped through the floor and vanished, both requiring me to go back to a previous save, and my head was always level with the floor on the pause screen.</p>
<p>What is rather more annoying is the inaccuracy of the quest descriptions and map. Davis usually gives you a quick briefing on the next step, but the quest summary on your pad is very brief and missing important details, and the map markers are frequently wrong. I spent half an hour trying to deposit some canisters inside the loading bay on my ship, only to discover that you’re meant to go outside to a nondescript panel and punch a button before the canister receptacle will appear. The following mission had me go to Operations… but not the part of the map that’s clearly marked “Operations” a completely different place.</p>

<p>There’s a good game here – it looks and sounds fantastic and really captures the feel of the films – but there are so many little annoyances that it’s hard to like it. Rogue Incursion has you constantly juggling two-handed weapons, the motion tracker, mission object, and the touch screen map that requires two hands to use, and it’s just clumsy going back and forth all the time. Heck, the map doesn’t even auto-track your location, so you need to drop whatever else you’re holding just to scroll it.</p>
<p>All of this is probably fine when it’s a quick button press away, but annoying in VR. Not to mention that Zula is an ex-Marine. Give her a helmet with the tracker, an auto-scrolling map and the mission briefing on a HUD and you fix the vast majority of problems with the game and free up your hands for the important things – like aiming straight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-release-window-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Ultizero Games have announced that long-awaited hack-and-slash action game <i>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</i>finally has a release window, and they've given us a fresh glimpse at some gameplay as well.</p>

<p>In a new trailer, the two studios confirm that the game is set for release on PC and PlayStation 5 in 2025, so let's hope that this time, we're finally going to be able to get our hands on this one.</p>

<p><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>has had a very lengthy development process indeed. It was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/impressive-one-man-project-lost-soul-aside-will-be-timed-exclusive-for-ps4" rel="nofollow">first announced</a> as part of the inaugural round of games in Sony's China Hero Project all the way back in 2016, at which point it was to be a timed exclusive on PS4.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-soul-aside-2025-release-window-boss.jpg?itok=4lC5Mr5U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-soul-aside-2025-release-window-boss.jpg?itok=Wv2kdiym 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>finally has a release window.</figcaption></figure><p>We got to hear more from the game last year, when a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-shows-gorgeous-graphics-amazing-action-in-new-rtx-trailer" rel="nofollow">new trailer was released during the ChinaJoy event in July</a>. That trailer was all about the ray tracing that will be featured in&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, so perhaps we'll see this one get some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">PS5 Pro enhancements</a> as well.</p>

<p>As for details regarding the game's plot and moment-to-moment gameplay, Sony and Ultizero are remaining fairly tight-lipped for now. It'll be a hack-and-slash "action-adventure RPG", according to Ultizero, and it'll be a single-player game too.</p>

<p>Narrative-wise, you're out to "save your sister and the whole of humankind from dimensional invaders", so you can perhaps think of this one as a sort of cousin to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, albeit one with perhaps less of an emphasis on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/festive-stellar-blade-update" rel="nofollow">the main character's costumes</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out the new release window announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>right here. It's got some nice stylish action for you to look at as well.</p>




<p><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>is due to arrive on PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime next year. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-new-pre-wipe-event-cultists/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov-pre-wipe-event-gives-cultists-marked-keys-and-100-spawn-rates.1064256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-new-pre-wipe-event-cultists/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has rolled out another pre-wipe event for Escape from Tarkov, introducing a 100% spawn rate (at night) for Cultists across their main maps: Shoreline, Customs, and Woods. The latest update has equipped many of these Cultists with Marked Keys, which as you might know, open doors to some of the most high-value locations in the game.</p>



<p>Most recently, players were tackling a pre-wipe event in Escape from Tarkov that required them to kill 30 enemies on the Factory map to unlock Kappa, one of the most sought-after items in the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kill-cultists-make-gains">Kill Cultists, Make Gains</h2>



<p>This latest pre-wipe event for Tarkov comes with the following description on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The losses of both PMC factions during night-time operations have increased. The old-timers believe that this is due to the pilgrimage of the so-called “witnesses” to their marked circles. </p>



<p>There are reports of many of those hooded people carrying marked keys. Despite the increased danger, PMCs are now preparing for night raids and taking advantage of the fact that Mechanic started selling NVGs at a great discount.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, the large maps that accommodate Cultists (so, not Ground Zero or Factory) will have a 100% spawn rate for the faction <strong>at night only</strong>. Also, Mechanic has massively discounted NVGs like the GPNVG-18, which is selling for just 43,000 roubles at the moment.</p>



<p>When you kill Cultists, you’ll have a solid chance of picking up a range of Marked Keys from their bodies, which you can then turn into some great loot. Bear in mind that you’ll be competing with thousands of other players to access these locations, though.</p>



<p>As expected, this pre-wipe event is only available for PvP players, because the game’s PvE mode doesn’t accommodate forced wipes, so a <strong>pre-wipe event </strong>doesn’t make much sense.</p>



<p>As a bonus, you can secure Cultist Knives and trade them with Mechanic for coloured keycards.</p>



<p>It’s expected that the next Escape from Tarkov wipe will arrive around Christmas. Are you ready? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-meta-may-have-a-new-champ-as-celebi-ex-dominates<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> received its first expansion yesterday in Mythical Island and the collection of new cards has shaken up the meta, seemingly pushing newcomer Celebi ex to the top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Celebi ex is one of five ex Pokémon added in Mythical Island, a Themed Booster which brought 68 unique new cards to the digital trading card game. It's a basic Grass type with 130 Hit Points and a Weakness to Fire and a one Energy Retreat Cost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its single attack is called Power Bloom and costs one Grass Energy and one Colorless Energy, with the following effect: "Flip a coin for each Energy attached to this Pokémon. This attack does 50 damage for each heads."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/celebi-1734525066409.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is okay by itself; it's on par with one meta leader Mewtwo ex's smaller attack, essentially averaging 50 damage for two Energy, but increasing it to, say four Energy, means it averages 100 damage. There is potential there for some devastating attacks, with four coin flips potentially presenting 200 (or zero) damage, but it's another Mythical Island card that boosts Celebi to the top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Serperior is a Stage 2 Grass type with 110 HP, a weakness to Fire, and two Energy retreat cost. It has a single attack called Solar Beam which deals 70 damage for one Grass Energy and three Colorless Energy, which is well below the standard rate of damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it also comes with an Ability, Jungle Totem: "Each Grass Energy attached to your Grass Pokémon procides two Grass Energy. This effect doesn't stack." This "stack" clause simply means that if two Serperior are on the board at the same time then only one of these effects will activate, but it otherwise doubles the value of every energy attached to other Grass Pokémon, including Celebi ex.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/serp-1734525066410.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Having Serperior on the bench, which will take a while given its a Stage 2 Pokémon and needs to be evolved twice, therefore essentially makes Celebi's Power Bloom card half the cost. One Grass Energy attached to it will result in two coin flips, for between zero and 100 damage, two Grass Energy will mean four coin flips for between zero and 200 damage, and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly what cards are best around these two core pieces will be figured out by players in the coming days and weeks, but Lilligant from original set Genetix Apex may be a valuable inclusion. It's a Stage 1 Pokémon evolving from Petilil that has a two Grass Energy, 50 damage attack that also grants a Bench Pokémon a free Grass Energy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Putting it in play with a Celebi ex on the Bench, and building up to a Serperior at the same time, would let players pile Energy onto Celebi ex and then switch it in with the threat of doing serious damage, enough to take down the likes of Mewtwo ex and Charizard ex in one turn.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/lil-1734525172640.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the first deck from Mythical Island to emerge as a meta leader, capable of stacking up to these other dominant decks, but there are other changes already in place, including some that push down Pikachu ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-reveals-mew-led-set-coming-next-week-and-60-million-download-milestone">Mythical Island arrived December 17 and as a Themed Booster is a smaller set</a> compared to the debut Genetic Apex, containing a total of 86 cards.

            <p>Since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">The Witcher 4's impressive, ultra-high-fidelity debut trailer at The Game Awards</a> last week, there's been a fair bit of consternation from fans as to whether it'll actually be playable on current-gen hardware. That's something only compounded by the mention, in the trailer's small print and a brief <a href="https://press.cdprojektred.com/en/news/1702/the-witcher-iv-revealed-at-the-game-awards">official blog</a>, that the trailer was pre-rendered on a mysterious, "unannounced Nvidia GeForce RTX" graphics card, "using assets and models from the game itself" - suggesting at least some minor level of similarity to what the game will look like on arrival.</p>
<p>Developer CD Projekt Red also has some history with older console struggles of course, with the last-gen consoles of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One proving hugely problematic for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s launch. The studio ultimately dropped them for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion that arrived in 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">Speaking with CDPR in a new interview this week</a>, Eurogamer asked whether the studio could reassure console owners that they could actually run it - and whether it could run on, say, an Xbox Series S, which as things stand is still required for any game releasing on the Xbox Series X. The developers were a little coy in response.</p>
<p>"You know, first of all, this is good to say: this is not a kind of 'beginning of marketing' campaign," said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s game director, Sebastian Kalemba, referring to the trailer. "We firstly wanted to showcase and share with the entire world that: Ciri is the main protagonist; it's The Witcher 4; and she's mutated; and she's on The Path, definitely, right?"</p>
<p>Rather than specifically referencing concerns about certain consoles, Kalemba elaborated a little more, but only went as far as to mention it would be coming to the key platforms more broadly.</p>
<p>"The second thing is that, yes, we are working on a new engine right now, together with Epic's engineers, and there is a great synergy and a great collaboration between us. And currently we're working on Unreal Engine 5 and our custom build. And obviously we want to support all the platforms - meaning PC, Xbox and Sony, right? - but I cannot, right now, tell you more specifics regarding that."</p>
<p>He also stressed for a second time that this trailer was just a technical showpiece and "good benchmark" for now.</p>
<p>"For sure, it's definitely worth remembering [that for this] first time, we created the cinematic, pre-rendered, without post production piece, that we want to [show that we're] simply aspiring to achieve such quality in cinematics as much as possible. That's my opinion: it's a good benchmark."</p><p>The emphasis on this just being an early showcase, rather than a true 'beginning of marketing' campaign, brings to mind some comments from CDPR joint CEO Michał Nowakowski to Eurogamer recently, detailed more fully in our recent report on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red">what we can expect from The Witcher 4</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer earlier this summer, Nowakowski explained that while Phantom Liberty had a more truncated, six-month marketing campaign before its launch, "for a new game, we would still expect a slightly longer - but not two-year - lasting campaign." (The two years it took for Cyberpunk 2077 was down to its delays, he explained, with the studio originally planning something closer to 12 to 18 months from its big Keanu Reeves moment at E3 to launch.)</p>
<p>Nowakowski also referred to as a marketing "mass attack" being the main kick-off point for that less-than-two-year run up to launch. "Having said that, I want to stress: it doesn't mean we would not tease or drop some cool assets before [a full reveal]. Because the marketing campaign, slightly earlier before the launch of the game, that's different than the actual, say, 'mass attack'. Mass attack is when you announce the date, you start collecting the pre-orders and it really is that race from that point, that moment, to the moment you launch the game."</p>
<p>For example, he continued at the time, "If I ask you, what do you know about The Witcher 4? The answer is not much, probably - yes, there's theories and so on. But there's nothing really specific. So we want to drop the crumbs here and there so that people - and the media as well - can, you know, pick up on it and try to figure out what it is we're trying to say this time. So that [is something] we can start doing a little bit earlier." That would involve aspects such as "having some video assets, or something to whet the appetite of the fans - not even to create the hype so much," he said, as to simply get the early conversations flowing.</p><p>More simply: it might be reasonable to infer that this first trailer would count as one of those "cool assets" releasing as an earlier tease - establishing we're playing as Ciri, and some basic foundations of lore such as her having become a fully fledged witcher - but still coming a little way before that roughly 18-month countdown.</p>
<p>Coming back to the consoles, there's also some interesting context in the form of CDPR vice president of technology Charles Tremblay's comments to Eurogamer earlier this year. There, Tremblay noted that the studio's next game likely wouldn't launch on just PC. "I don't think this is a strategy we want to adopt right now. That being said, will it mean that we will have - let's say there were 20 platforms available - we'll have 20 at launch? Maybe not. But at least PC only, and then scattered, it's not necessarily the approach we want to go forward, for sure."</p>
<p>He also noted that the studio now develops all of its games on the "lowest" spec hardware, such as consoles, at the same time as it does on PC, rather than its old method of working to PCs first and going backwards from there - one of the many causes for Cyberpunk's launch woes.</p>
<p>Console versions "working super late" are now "unacceptable," he explained. "It's part of our process; we do the reviews on console so we know exactly where we are on all the platforms, [including] the lowest [spec] platform we have, rather than saying, 'PC's fine, we can go forward'."</p><p>With the process applied across all of the studio's upcoming games, it makes for an interesting situation with The Witcher 4. If the studio's hesitant to commit to its viability on current-gen platforms (albeit not ruling that out of course), and it also now develops games on the lowest-spec platforms alongside high end PCs, what might those platforms be here? Going from what CD Projekt Red's said so far, we might be waiting a fair bit longer to find out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-update-010e<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Grinding Gear Games has released&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em><em>2&nbsp;</em>update 0.1.0e, and it's designed to introduce several oft-requested quality-of-life features to the action RPG, including checkpoint fast travel and more.</p>

<p>The update introduces the ability to travel between an area's checkpoints, and more checkpoints have also been added to areas "generally at all the entrances and exits", so traveling around an area should be a little less painful now.</p>

<p>On the whole, this update is focused on adding lots of little changes to make your&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>experience smoother, rather than one or two bigger additions. It's all in keeping with the promise made by Grinding Gear last week to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-devs-feedback-early-access" rel="nofollow">address user feedback and implement changes</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-update-0.1.0e-forest.jpg?itok=-Cr6spvP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-update-0.1.0e-forest.jpg?itok=8tSksYdi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s latest update adds a ton of quality-of-life features.</figcaption></figure><p>Various changes have been made to&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s endgame content as well, and its monster balance has also been addressed. Monsters will now deal 40% less bonus damage from critical strikes, for instance, while higher-tier maps no longer have extra elemental resistance penalties.</p>

<p>You'll also find a ton of changes to individual classes and skills, with lots of abilities' damage values and effects being changed to improve the difficulty curve.</p>

<p>There are far too many tweaks in update 0.1.0e to list here, but you can check out the full&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3645467" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> if you want to read everything that's new. If you're a buildcraft hound, I'd recommend doing so.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>, it's an action RPG that serves as a followup to 2013's popular&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. Originally planned as a major expansion of the original game, it was instead <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-will-be-standalone-game-closed-beta-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">revealed to be a full sequel in July last year</a>.</p>




<p>The sequel released in Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-release-delayed" rel="nofollow">earlier this month</a>, proving so popular that its developers <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-server-issues-warning" rel="nofollow">expressed concern</a> regarding whether or not the game's servers would be able to hold up. Luckily, it seems those issues didn't manifest to any significant degree at launch.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>right now on PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Steam Early Access</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
