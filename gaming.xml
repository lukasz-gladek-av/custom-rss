		<p>There’s a fascinating side to our natural world that we can only imagine. From the dark depths of the sea, to the leafy jungle canopy, and the uninhabited spaces in between, the world of Empire of the Ants might be closer to home, but it’s no less mysterious and unknown. You take control of ant 103.683e, planning, surviving and strategising in the midst of a micro-environment: the outdoors.</p>
<p><iframe title="Empire of the Ants – Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gayRYRZoU-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Based on the best-selling novels by Bernard Werber, Empire of the Ants charts a story set within the same world, putting you in direct command as leader of the antennaed forces.</p>


<p>What we’ve got here is fundamentally an RTS, though there’s a sleek fluidity and stripped-back feel to proceedings that should help it to be more accessible and approachable than some of the genre’s stalwarts. There are also different mission types that play with the formula, or even discard it completely, taking you away from commanding the army to go exploring the environment, collecting items, capturing creatures or even platforming, hopping from vibrant leaf to leaf.</p>


<p>There are three core troop types – Workers, Warriors and Ranged – with an ant-infused weapon triangle meaning that each is strong against one and weak against the other. That means that encounters and skirmishes require more than simply sending every ant in your nest in the same direction, placing the emphasis on choosing the correct unit to fight against the correct enemy.</p>
<p>It’s all very clearly orchestrated and organised, despite the myriad ants scurrying across the dirt. Each unit in your army and your enemy’s is indicated by a large, recognisable icon, and it’s these that you target rather than the ants that make up the units on the ground. You begin with five units, raising that number to seven once you’ve progressed, and once again there’s a focus on tight and controlled skirmishes rather than an overwhelming force. Admittedly, just one unit is made up of a multitude of ants, so it would otherwise get immediately overwhelming.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s the garden setting, or the micro scale you’re working in, but there’s more than a hint of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/19/pikmin-4-review/">Pikmin</a> at work here. With a controller in hand and the simplified but robust controls, you can command your minuscule minions with ease, but just like in Nintendo’s exceptional but approachable series, there’s still clear tactical depth, even in our short hands-on.</p>
<p>One of Empire of the Ants clearest selling points is its incredibly lifelike visuals. Unreal Engine 5 is being used here to spectacular effect, and everything we were shown through our hands-on was in-engine. Watching the inhabitants of an ant nest scurrying to and fro, foraging for food and material, looks stunningly realistic. As part of that, the animators have meticulously observed the movement of ants and the other creatures in the game, and faithfully replicated it, and the results speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I particularly liked the way in which Tower Five has baked in the UI and menu systems into the landscape, and your ant commander must access the upgrade trees and building options for each nest by physically moving around them, highlighting the required option while doing so. It’s little touches like this that make the game more grounded and less game-like, and it feels like that’s more important here than it might be elsewhere, despite the sci-fi and fantasy leanings of its source material.</p>

<p>Empire of the Ants has the potential to be a great success this winter, appealing to fans of the book and the RTS genre, as well as insect aficionados who won’t often find this level of detail in gaming. The timing seems perfect as well, with Empires of the Undergrowth, a more faithful RTS that’s drawing on many of the same inspirations, having just had its final update, leaving its raft of players looking for the next ant-filled epic. In Empire of the Ants, they might well have found it.</p>
<p><em>Empire of the Ants releases for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on November 7th.</em></p>

<p><em>Ender Magnolia&nbsp;</em>was originally announced back in February as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-january-2023-recap-find-all-news-and-announcements">that month's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a>, and was subsequently released on Steam in March, garnering an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2725260/ENDER_MAGNOLIA_Bloom_in_the_Mist/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Overwhelmingly Positive rating</a> across more than 3,700 reviews since then.</p>

                <p> Sony's ill-fated multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concord/" data-ref-id="5000-589443">Concord</a> has been removed from sale and had its servers shut down, while players across PS5 and PC are receiving refunds. Now, Concord content is being removed from consoles that had it installed. </p><p>Players who bought the digital version of Concord from the PlayStation Store are now being notified that Sony has deleted the game from their console. A message prompt reads, "Thank you for being a valued PlayStation customer. Live services for Concord went offline on [September 9, 2024). The game is no playable and as a result, we have removed this content from your account."</p><p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/playstation-deleting-concord-consoles/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a> reports that physical copies of Concord continue to allow players to boot the game to the title screen, but players cannot progress further. For digital copies, though, it seems PlayStation is simply wiping the game entirely.</p><p>When Sony announced that Concord would shut down, the company signaled that this would happen. Sony told fans that once their refund went through, they would "no longer have access to the game." </p><p>Many online are pointing out how Sony's ability to wipe content from your console is yet another example of how people do not own digital content but merely license it and are beholden to the whims of a giant, multi-national company like Sony. This is nothing new, of course, but the situation surrounding Concord is reminding players of this fact. </p><p>Concord launched in late August and failed to find an audience, peaking at fewer than 700 concurrent players on PC. PS5 player data was never made available, but whatever the case, the situation was so dire that Sony made the dramatic decision to stop sales, close the servers, and refund players after less than two weeks on the market. </p><p>Concord is the debut title from Firewalk Studios, which is owned by Sony. Game director Ryan Ellis said the game's "initial" launch "didn't land the way we intended." As such, the team is now looking at "options" for how to "better reach our players." Some believe Concord could return as a free-to-play game or as part of the PlayStation Plus catalog, but one expert believes <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1831039618122174707" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game is simply doomed no matter what.</a></p><p>Not long after Concord's failure, Sony found more success with its platformer Astro Bot, which is getting rave reviews, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/" data-ref-id="1900-6418277">9/10 here at GameSpot. </a></p>

            <p>PlayStation is currently riding high following the release of its adorable platformer Astro Bot. Unlike the God of Wars and The Last of Us' of this world, Astro Bot is a family focused title, suitable (and definitely enjoyable) for players young and old.</p>
<p>Reflecting on Astro Bot's recent success, Hermen Hulst - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">PlayStation's recently appointed joint CEO</a> - has now said the family market is "really important for us to focus on".</p>

<p>Hulst was speaking on the official <a href="https://soundcloud.com/playstation/official-playstation-podcast-episode-493-the-joy-of-astro-bot?utm_source=blog.playstation.com&amp;utm_campaign=wtshare&amp;utm_medium=widget&amp;utm_content=https%253A%252F%252Fsoundcloud.com%252Fplaystation%252Fofficial-playstation-podcast-episode-493-the-joy-of-astro-bot">PlayStation podcast</a>, in a joint interview with Astro Bot's creative director Nicolas 'Nico' Doucet. During the discussion, the show's host asked if PlayStation would now consider putting more of its resources behind these games with a more family friendly feel, noting Lego Horizon is also set to release in just a few short months.</p>
<p>"I think it's massively important that PlayStations Studios develops games in various genres, and the family market I think is really important for us to focus on," Hulst replied.</p>
<p>"It's interesting that Nico and I at the beginning of [Astro Bot] talked a little bit about, you know, platformers. So many great ones have come out of Japan, and I was kind of joking with him like... some of those best games [are] coming out of the country that you operate out of - Let's see that as the bar."</p>
<p>Hulst went on to state Team Asobi has delivered a "massive" game with Astro Bot which, in his opinion, "plays like some of the best in the genre". The CEO complimented the game's accessibility, adding he believes the audience will "range from new players to young players, but also to players of my age" (Hulst is, I am going to say, in his 40s/50s).</p>
<p>"Astro is very, very important to PlayStation," the Sony executive continued. "Obviously, we had the pre-install [Astro's Playroom] on the PlayStation 5, that millions and millions and millions of people have embraced and loved, and I think that's become a little bit of a platform to launch this new game now.</p>
<p>"It's remarkable that a relatively small team - actually a very small team - is able to deliver a game that is so big now and it's really become a great game in itself."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-is-available-in-test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-evotinction-and-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA has confirmed several newly released PC games that include day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS 3, the most anticipated of which is undoubtedly Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown.</p>
<p>The third installment in the open world racing series and the first since 2011's Unlimited 2, Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown was announced over four years ago and suffered several delays throughout its development, first from 2022 to 2023 and then from 2023 to 2024. Developed by KT Racing (formerly known as Kylotonn and primarily known for making the WRC games until a couple of years ago), Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown is set to launch on Thursday, September 12.</p>
<p>Its PC system requirements were <a href="https://wccftech.com/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-gets-steam-demo-and-pc-requirements-rtx-4090-needed-for-4k60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> over three months ago and looked pretty demanding, with the 4K@60FPS target requiring a GeForce RTX 4090. We can only hope this was a reference to native rendering; if so, NVIDIA DLSS 3 should be able to provide much higher frame rates.</p>
<p>Another game out this week with NVIDIA DLSS 3 support is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005090/EVOTINCTION/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVOTINCTION</a>. This third-person stealth game puts players into a dystopian sci-fi setting. EVOTINCTION is out this Friday on PlayStation 5 and PC, and the latter version is enhanced with ray traced reflections as well as the aforementioned NVIDIA upscaling and frame generation technology. According to NVIDIA, the combined usage of DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation can boost frame rates by 3.9x on average at 4K resolution and 2.6x on average at 1440p/1080p resolution.</p>
<p>This Friday will also see the debut of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843310/Funko_Fusion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funko Fusion</a>, a funny third-person action game featuring lots of irreverent humor and, of course, NVIDIA DLSS 3 (and DLAA) support. In late August, Evil Raptor and PLAION released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843540/Akimbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Akimbot</a>, an action platformer game that also supports DLSS 3 and DLAA. Lastly, the high-speed on-foot racing game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1273560/DeathSprint_66/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeathSprint 66</a> will launch this Thursday with DLSS Super Resolution support. As a reminder, there are more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">600 games and applications</a> that support NVIDIA RTX technologies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-sony-boss-chris-deering-comments<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-Sony boss Chris Deering has suggested that those laid off from their jobs in the gaming industry should "drive an Uber" or "go to the beach for a year".</p>
<p>Appearing on writer Simon Parkin's <a href="https://x.com/SimonParkin/status/1833418977944514798" rel="noopener" target="_blank">podcast My Perfect Console</a>, Deering says he doesn't think it's "fair" to say the widespread industry layoffs, which have seen companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">Take-Two</a> affected, are the result of "greed".</p>
<p>He goes on to say that "if the money isn't coming in" from gamers on the games Sony - or any company - is making, then it's "hard to justify spending the money for the next game".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ex-sony-boss-chris-deering-comments-ratchet-and-clank.jpg?itok=fWTe7LwW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ex-sony-boss-chris-deering-comments-ratchet-and-clank.jpg?itok=nzxi_F1B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony Interactive Entertainment reduced its workforce by about 900 employees earlier this year, including cuts to Insomniac and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Deering says it's "probably very painful for the managers" when employees are laid off. Rather tellingly, he doesn't acknowledge that it's also probably pretty painful for the employees themselves.</p>
<p>He then says having skills in game development won't result in a "lifetime of poverty or limitation", and that employees who are laid off should "take a few, figure out how to get through it, drive an Uber or whatever, go off to find a cheap place to live and go to the beach for a year".</p>
<p>Following these comments, Deering says he assumes those who were laid off from Sony "were paid some kind of a decent severance package", and when that package runs out, "well, you know, that's life".</p>
<p>I don't think you need me to tell you why these comments are raising eyebrows right now. At best, Deering comes across as out of touch, and at worst, he comes across as actively callous and unfeeling in the face of thousands upon thousands of job losses.</p>

Did you lose your job this year? Don't worry; just go "drive an Uber"!</figcaption></figure><p>Deering's comments come after several months of brutal job cuts across the industry. At last count, industry layoffs had already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">surpassed those across the entirety of 2023</a>, and that was in June; there have been more since.</p>
<p>Both major companies and indie studios have been affected. Several smaller studios have closed down entirely, and so have bigger studios like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition"><em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer Volition</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report"><em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>developer Piranha Bytes</a> (reportedly, at least).</p>
<p>As you might imagine, this doesn't really feel like the right time for Deering to make the comments he made on Parkin's podcast, but hey - perhaps he'll have a Scrooge-like epiphany sometime soon. We can but hope!</p>

IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review"><u>Star Wars Outlaws review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: "Star Wars Outlaws is a fun intergalactic heist adventure with great exploration, but it’s hindered by simple stealth, repetitive combat, and a few too many bugs at launch." Outlaws isn’t the only game seemingly impacting Ubisoft shares. Free-to-play Call of Duty rival <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/xdefiant"><u>Xdefiant</u></a> also appears to be having a tough time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>AJ Investments, a hedge fund that holds less than 1% in Ubisoft, urged the board of directors to take the company private or sell it to a strategic investor. The group clearly wants to see Guillemot out as CEO, and threatened to gather similarly disgruntled minority shareholders for a “proxy fight” that would brute force a sale if its demands are not met. It also called for further layoffs at the company, despite the brutal state of the video game industry for developers.</p><p>“Ubisoft at current state is mismanaged and shareholders are hostages of Guillemot family members and Tencent who take advantage of them,” the open letter reads. There’s further and somewhat bizarre commentary on pretty much all of Ubisoft’s games, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">the cancelation of free-to-play shooter The Division Heartland</a>, pirate game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a>, which the investment group says “was not a success,” single-player adventure <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> (“was okay but not very impressive as nobody talks about the game anymore”), and ongoing live service multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a>, which the group admits “is doing great.”</p><p>However, franchises such as Rayman, Splinter Cell, For Honor, and Watch Dogs “are sleeping for years.” And on Star Wars Outlaws, it’s “expected to bring good numbers, but recent reviews shows that game was not 100% ready to release, despite the fact that [sic] whole world was waiting for open world game under the Star Wars franchise.” The group pointed to Outlaws’ 76 Metascore and even IGN’s review, “which is quite good rating in our view."</p><p>IGN has asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><p>Ubisoft has yet to comment on Star Wars Outlaws’ commercial performance. Ubisoft has said it enjoyed a “solid” start to its financial year (April to June), and looked forward to a “strong upcoming release slate” with Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin’s Creed Shadows. “We are excited about the future and confident in the sustained progress of our turnaround throughout the year,” Guillemot said at the time.</p><p>The pressure is now on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows"><u>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</u></a>, due out in November, to make a big impact on Ubisoft’s bottom line.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

You assume the role of Stella, who was born on the ship 24 years ago and recently inherited her father’s post as Chief of Security. Dive into the conspiracy behind the incident that threatens to disrupt the Zephyr’s social order and foil its mission.</p><p><em>Between Horizons</em> is a modern 2.5D pixel art adventure that brings a branching narrative into a semi-open world. The team at DigiTales has applied numerous lessons from their first game Lacuna and proven solutions to detective game design problems to maximize player agency in the investigation process—all the while maintaining the tight pacing of a meaningful story that will ask you to reevaluate your moral compass and make increasingly tough decisions as the situation aboard the ship spirals out of control.</p><!-- AD: content -->

A new and improved auto-save system will make sure there is no going back, as the story branches and endings are based on player decisions, none of which can be taken back.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Between Horizons - Consoles Release Date Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5T476VE3nTI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"If the money isn't coming in from the consumers on the last game, it's going to be hard to justify spending the money for the next game."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY5O8yx_rNw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IY5O8yx_rNw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There is some truth in Deering's comments. The recent failure of Sony's hero shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/" data-ref-id="1100-6526235">Concord</a> means that eight years of development costs are irretrievably lost and the studio behind the game, Firewalk Studios, could potentially face layoffs because of that title's poor reception. Having made his initial point, Deering proceeded to make additional remarks that may not paint him in the best light.</p><p>"I think it's probably very painful for the managers, but I don't think that having skill in this area [of game development] is going to be a lifetime of poverty or limitation," said Deering. "It's still where the action is, and it's like the pandemic but now you're going to have to take a few…figure out how to get through it, drive an Uber or whatever, go off to find a cheap place to live and go to the beach for a year. But keep up with your news and keep up with it, because once you get off the train, it's much harder."</p><p>Suffice to say, driving an Uber or going "to the beach for a year" aren't viable options for everyone, especially skilled professionals who have dedicated themselves to this industry. Executives may be able to more easily weather the turbulence in their careers than the rank-and-file workers, but that doesn't mean they can simply dismiss what everyone else is going through. That's why Deering is currently being roasted on social media. <strong>Warning:</strong> There is some very strong language used in the following posts.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/RetroAli93/status/1833463691070632334" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I had to shake my head with some of the quotes from Chris Deering in this article. some proper boomer shit this one really made me mad. <br>"go off to find a cheap place to live" <br>MOTHERFUCKER THERE ARE NO CHEAP PLACES TO LIVE!!!<br>like seriously, so out of touch! <a href="https://t.co/zQ8LVjxOba" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/zQ8LVjxOba</a></p>  — Harún Ali (@RetroAli93) <a href="https://twitter.com/RetroAli93/status/1833463691070632334?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/IWGB_GW/status/1833456962404557000" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">22000 game devs have been laid off.

What inspired the creation of this game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Giafferi</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I had the idea for the game while watching The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>X-Files</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for the 10th time… There's this scene where Mulder and Scully find a strange sample in a body and ask a lab technician to analyze it. When the technician gives them the results, he's shocked and asks where they found the sample. At that point, I thought it would have been great to see the action from this person's perspective instead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to have players act as assistants rather than the agents in the field? How did that affect your design for solving crimes in the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think it was just more original. One of the strongest constraints I had was my skill set. I can't do art per se, so I had to do something different. I quickly came up with the idea of doing a UI-only game, and it made sense that the player would be the assistant rather than the actual agent. I really like to use my constraints as a creative tool.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The biggest consequence of this decision is that the player has a better overview of the cases than the agents themselves, so it became clear that there must be a conspiracy somewhere. It also works better because I can present a situation directly to the player, with limited access to a subset of evidence, and ask them to solve a specific problem. It basically turned the game into a puzzle game.</span></p><p>Image via Bureau 81.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into the interface for the game? How did you design the overall look of the game to make players feel like they're working with complex, high-tech investigation systems?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My goal was to mimic a real OS. Since I work on Windows, macOS, and Linux, I took a bit from each. The interface was designed one step at a time, and for each part, I tried to think about how the software would actually work. For instance, with a chemical analysis software, it made sense to have a place somewhere in the FDI where the samples would be stored and an automated system that would take this sample and put it into a very sophisticated machine where you'd have to input settings based on your sample. This would both create gameplay and serve the story. Since immersion was one of my pillars for this game, I really tried to ensure the interface and software would be as credible as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you choose the analysis systems players would use in the game? What ideas went into their design and how they would make evidence-checking more interesting?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I chose the systems based on the ideas I had for each sequence. Most of the time, the ideas for a specific sequence were based on story goals, and they had to be different from the previous ones. I didn't want to use the same system the same way twice.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, in the first case with Agent Andrews, my story goal was to show that the FDI was censoring information, and that it was the first time we worked with HAL and Agent Andrews. The only objective for this sequence was to prove that the accidental fire that cost the life of Mia Cole was not an accident in order to reopen the case. With that in mind, I looked for a way to prove a fire wasn't an accident. The best idea I had was to analyze an ash sample and discover that gasoline was used to start the fire (not much of an accident…). I then created the chemical analyzer just for that use case.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges did you face in making those systems interesting to the player without overwhelming them with options on how to proceed with a case?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I really wanted to make sure the game was accessible to everyone. I didn't want to include gameplay that required complex knowledge. Some things are deliberately difficult and overwhelming, like the bomb defusal, but that serves the story. For the bomb, the goal was to make you feel helpless. It's your first day, you're not even supposed to be there, so of course defusing a bomb is hard without the proper knowledge!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the hardest part was dealing with my own limitations when it came to polishing the game. A lot of the ideas I had were just too complicated to polish. Because of that, I focused first on the mandatory evidence. If a sequence was too easy or just too obvious, I'd obfuscate the evidence a bit or add more easy-to-make evidence to help hide the important parts. Depending on how the information is presented to the players, it's really easy to hide the key information or make something more obvious.</span></p><p>Image via Bureau 81.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges do you face when creating the evidence you give the player in the game? How do you give them enough clues to figure things out without telling them too much?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To be honest, the biggest challenge I faced was my own ability to polish. I had to cut a lot of "flavor" evidence because it was simply too hard to polish. When I started developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Operator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, AI was just starting to get really great results. For a small creator like me, it was a really great tool, allowing me to go much further. But as development progressed, and as ethical concerns around AI rose (especially with the data used for training said AIs), I decided to remove AI-generated content entirely. However, some evidence simply couldn't be replaced without a proper budget (like burnt photos of an apartment, for instance) and had to be cut.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for the "clue distribution," since I knew exactly what the player would know in each sequence and what I wanted them to understand, once I found a gameplay or puzzle for the sequence, I decided what piece of evidence to put there. As for what the players understood, a lot of playtests were done!</span></p><p>Image via Bureau 81.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you walk us through the process of how you design a case for the game with a specific example? Take us from start to finish on how you came up with the concept and how you figured out how to relay the story through narrative moments and evidence.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I started with the plot twists I had in mind and the sequence ideas I really wanted to create. For instance, I knew I wanted a sequence where you help an agent defuse a bomb over the phone (a bit like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">). I then created the story and the characters to combine those sequence ideas and twists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, in the Evidence Room sequence, the story goal was to retrieve hidden evidence from a previous case. It was a good opportunity to create an entirely new interface, as we had to break into the FDI's evidence room to access this evidence. I decided to go for an MSDOS-inspired UI. In terms of gameplay, since the goal was to stray as far as possible from the base UI, I decided to use keyboard-only navigation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For experienced players, it's easy, but for non-technical players, this is the first challenge of the sequence. Every available key is displayed under the window, so even if you're not used to this kind of interface, you can still do a bit of trial and error to understand how it works. It also made sense for this interface to be highly technical, so it's harder to find what we're looking for.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>There is also an overarching storyline contained within the investigation systems themselves. Can you tell us a bit about how you wove the story into the analysis systems in a way that would make players feel clever for finding those "secret" elements?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think it's actually the other way around. I wove the systems into the story. Because the story was laid out first, I knew exactly what I could hide and where so it would seem like an unimportant element. Some players probably noticed those details and figured out some plot twists sooner than they should have, but that's okay. For instance (spoilers), at some point at the beginning of the game, you can ask Mike (your "friend," except that he's not) about his wife, and Mike tries to act like it's a fact, but if you check the database at this point, you'll see that he doesn't have a wife. It's a hidden detail that almost nobody notices, but if you do, you really feel smart.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Beyond Galaxyland launches in two weeks on on 24th September and to give you a taste of the what to expect we have a five minute trailer explaining what you will experience in the game including creature capturing, photography, and turn-based combat.</p>
<p><iframe title="Beyond Galaxyland | Gameplay Overview Trailer | Pre-Order on PC, Playstation, Xbox &amp; Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3_H7SZFDBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Beyond Galaxyland, the main character is Doug, a high schooler, who is transported away from Earth moments before the planet is mysteriously destroyed, and arrives in a galactic zoo called Galaxyland.</p>
<p><em>“I’m a huge fan of classic turn-based RPGs from the mid and late-1990s, and some of my favourites – such as Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VII –have provided me a galaxy’s worth of inspiration when developing Beyond Galaxyland,”&nbsp;</em>said developer Sam Enright<strong>.</strong><em>&nbsp;“I wanted to make a game that felt uniquely cinematic, while being within a familiar genre. I hope when gamers play it they’ll appreciate how Beyond Galaxyland’s pacing will often feel closer to a movie than a videogame. Doug, Boom Boom, and MartyBot’s adventures across and beyond Galaxyland is a very personal tale to me, and I can’t wait for people to experience their intergalactic story!”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Here are those ever so useful key features:</p>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Active turn-based combat: Engage in strategic turn-based battles against a vast range of galactic nemeses, with time-responsive defensive gameplay to minimise damage. Each party member has a range of unique abilities at their disposal, but for an additional tactical advantage, sneakily scan your enemy pre-battle to discover their strengths and weaknesses.</li>
<li>Interplanetary exploration: From the blizzard-swept planes of Arcos to the tropical jungle ravines of Erros, the neon-buzzing cities of Neo to the arid sand dunes of Xalm, explore a cosmic cluster of unique worlds, each with its own quests, environmental puzzles, and out-of-this-world characters.</li>
<li>A classic sci-fi adventure: A semi-open 2.5D adventure-RPG in a classic sci-fi fish-out-of-water tale that pays homage to family-friendly adventure and sci-fi movies. Beyond Galaxyland’s story features laughter, loss, peril and friendship, all dipped in a dazzling layer of neon-tastic pixels.</li>
<li>Epic boss battles: Encounter 25 epic bosses throughout many extraterrestrial travels, including colossal space dragons, flesh eating flowers, and the all-knowing bionic behemoth that is the Nexus Mind.</li>
<li>Capture &amp; utilise enemies: Successfully capture the many weird and wonderful creatures encountered on different worlds, each possessing exclusive abilities, and later unleash them during the heat of battle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The game will be available on<a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009887"> PS5, PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/beyond-galaxyland/9p41gc4t6bjg">Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/beyond-galaxyland-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>, and PC via both<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1543710/Beyond_Galaxyland/"> Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/beyond-galaxyland-521b75">Epic Games Store.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/towerborne-feels-like-a-product-of-a-different-time.976659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/towerborne-feels-like-product-of-different-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Side-scrolling Beat 'em ups are a time-honored tradition that most who enjoy video games have spent time with. Whether it be pumping quarters into <em>The Simpsons</em> arcade game, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, or more recently with <em>Castle Crashers </em>(ok, maybe not that recent)<em>&nbsp;</em>or <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>. <em>Towerborne </em>is the next Beat 'em up to hit Steam Early Access but will it live up to hype or fall to monsters?</p>
<p><em>Towerborne </em>is a mission-based multiplayer Beat 'em up where players create their own character, known in-universe, as an Ace. With humanity almost at the edge of extinction by Monsters who roam the world, it's up to the Aces to travel around and push back the threat.</p>
<h2><em>Towerborne </em>Classes And Combos Leave Us Wanting</h2>
<p>There are four available classes to play as in Towerborne; Sentinel, Shadowstriker, Pyroclast and Rockbeaker. While you'll start as a Sentinel, wielding a sword and shield, after the tutorial mission you can shift between each class any time you're not actively in a mission.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towerborne-comboing-goblins.jpg?itok=8tqcPBXy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towerborne-comboing-goblins.jpg?itok=7FgpmPUu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each class fights with a different weapon type, this also dictates the different combat style you'll perform and what your base stats are. The Pyroclast swings their Warclub at a slow speed but deals out heavy attacks, while the Shadowstriker's Dual Daggers are nimble and might deal less damage but are more equipped to dodge out of the way where necessary.</p>
<p>Combos can be performed by triggering a sequence of Light or Heavy attacks in order. There's a bit of trial and error when you first pick up a new weapon style, but I quickly found a number of combos that effectively stunlock most enemies. Once you've used one type of Gauntlet the combos and actions for all others are the same.</p>
<p>On top of standard attacks there are also special attacks for each class, like a swirling fire inferno for the Pyroclast, and equippable pets called Umbra that can also have unique attacks. Early on I was given one that simply fires an energy blast in front of my character.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towerborne-class-select-screen.jpg?itok=erst0gJo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towerborne-class-select-screen.jpg?itok=gCwJDcag 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The character creator is actually quite robust, but I knew as soon as I saw those ears what had to be created​​​​​​</figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately combat is an extremely shallow experience. Moving from one screen to the next you'll perform an easy combo that will leave you free from damage and move on to the next. There are some foes introduced early that have shields that need a single heavy attack to break through or prepare bombs to throw, but don't add much to the experience.</p>
<p>Completing a level you'll pick up new gear and experience that will level up your characters stats, this is where the 'hook' of <em>Towerborne </em>starts to rear its head.</p>
<h2><em>Towerborne </em>Is A Game Of Numbers</h2>
<p>Combat from level to level is a repetitive experience, the loot that you obtain from each of those levels comes in the form of new weapons or protective equipment. Each has a base number associated with the equipment's Gear Level, as well as some kind of percentage modifier on a stat. The modifiers might mean that you get a +4% to your super attack gain, or heal slightly faster.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towerborne-gear-screen.jpg?itok=R_WddyGY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towerborne-gear-screen.jpg?itok=Jn5ZoIeY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can have three of the same helmets, each with very slightly different percentage buffs</figcaption></figure><p>The higher the gear score will generally tell you which levels you might be most equipped to handle, but for every level you beat there will also be two more difficult variants that demand a higher Gear Score to access.</p>
<p>Early Beat 'em up games like <em>The Simpsons</em> might have also had simple combat and no progression but there was story to work through and a challenging experience. With <em>Towerborne </em>there's little to no challenge or depth in combat, and the reward for the lackluster gameplay is loot that slightly increments your abilities to be able to experience more lackluster gameplay.</p>
<h2><em>Towerborne's </em>Biggest Issue Is Its Core Loop</h2>
<p>I was expecting <em>Towerborne </em>to be an average Beat 'em up game but something good for some mindless fun while listening to a podcast or watching a TV show. Unfortunately, the experience I was met with was so shallow it wasn't enjoyable with additional entertainment.</p>
<p>While <em>Towerborne </em>is releasing in Early Access the bland core gameplay loop, built to create near-limitless replayability but with very little incentive, is the largest thing holding it back. Playing the game with friends might offer a more enjoyable experience, it's likely that there are other titles that would be better to spend that shared time in.</p>

                <p>It's been nearly two decades since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/timesplitters-future-perfect-review/1900-6121173/" data-ref-id="1900-6121173">TimeSplitters: Future Perfect</a> closed out the TimeSplitters trilogy. However, fans have recently noted that the title once rated M by the Entertainment Software Rating Board in 2005 currently has a T for Teen rating on the Xbox game store and the PlayStation store. Now, the ESRB has cleared up why the rating has changed even though the content of the game remains the same.</p><p>The ratings change for TimeSplitters: Future Perfect was first noticed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/timesplitters/comments/1f8c2v5/future_perfect_updated_rating/?rdt=47906" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">by a fan on Reddit</a>, and subsequently confirmed by other players as well. The fans on the site also noted that the ESRB still has Future Perfect <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/10853/timesplitters-future-perfect/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">listed as an M-rated game on its official site</a>. According to the ESRB, the reason why the game has a new rating is because the group didn't rate the version that's currently available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. Instead, the International Age Rating Coalition provided the Teen rating for both platforms.</p><p>"Our website lists the original physical/retail releases of the game for GameCube, PS2, and the original Xbox from 2005," said an ESRB spokesperson. "The game was recently re-rated via IARC as part of new releases on modern consoles; the Xbox.com rating was updated to conform to those new ratings. It is a digital version of the original Xbox release that works on Xbox One and Xbox Series consoles. The ESRB.org website is limited to retail releases and reflects the rating assigned for the original, retail release from roughly 20 years ago."</p><p>Presumably this means that IARC's standards for blood, gore, and violence don't line up with the ESRB's, which is why it's no longer an M-rated game for the modern consoles. Perhaps <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-esrb-made-a-song-to-celebrate-turning-30-for-some-reason/1100-6526201/" data-ref-id="1100-6526201">the ESRB should sing another song</a> to clarify that.</p>

<p>This time, according to a statement sent by Activision to COD news source <a href="https://x.com/charlieintel/status/1833272473158135915" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>, the plan is for all of the game's modes to have a simultaneous launch. "The team is fully focused on October 25th," the statement reads. "We are excited about all the game has to offer across campaign, multiplayer and Zombies. This year, we made the decision to ensure the community gets to dig in to any and all modes that they want at the same time, so we are back to one massive global launch moment October 25.

            <p>Five years ago, a small team of three people released a really rather special game out into the world, all about anonymously writing and receiving letters, which had also been written by other real people, and offering some words of encouragement to those who need it. This was Kind Words, a fitting name for a game that did so much to lift spirits and create a safe space for anyone going through a hard time.</p>
<p>In the time since Kind Words released five years ago, developer Popcannibal has been working on a sequel. It is called Kind Words 2, and unlike the original game where you were confined to a bedroom, in the sequel, there's a world outside to explore. Those wonderful letters still remain, though.</p>
<p>As for when you can explore that wholesome outside world for yourself? Well, there is not too much longer to wait. Kind Words 2 is coming to Steam next month, on 7th October. You can check out its release date trailer below.</p>

<p>Writing on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2118120/Kind_Words_2_lofi_city_pop/">Steam</a>, Popcannibal co-founder Ziba Scott said Kind Words has been "one of the biggest changes" in their lives over the past five years.</p>
<p>"It's been an amazing trip for Luigi and I to learn how to care for this community we started. And what a joy it has been that the community has cared for us in return," Ziba wrote in a post accompanying Kind Words 2's release date announcement.</p>
<p>"I could go on all sentimental like for a while, but I've got to go fix bugs now to make everything ready for the launch day."</p>
<p>For more on Kind Words, last year Bertie, Eurogamer alum Johnny Chiodini and I all sat down to talk about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-video-games-have-helped-us-with-our-mental-health">video games that have helped us with our mental health</a>. Kind Words was one of these games.</p>
<p>Stay safe out there all, I hope you are doing ok.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
