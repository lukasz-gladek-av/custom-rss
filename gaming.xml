We also rave about the inventory system in the great new role-playing game <em>Avowed</em>, go hands-on with <em>Monster Hunter Wilds, </em>and explain why some <em>Overwatch 2 </em>fans are actually excited about the return of loot boxes.

Thankfully, if you were still planning on picking up the <em>Elden Ring</em> spin-off when it launches on May 30th, it’s already available for preorder with a $10 gift card at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/0k2dsz12d775j">Best Buy</a> for $39.99 or from <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/elden-ring-nightreign" rel="sponsored">Fanatical</a> for $35.19 (about $5 off).</p><p>From what we’ve seen, and our own Ash Parrish <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">has experienced</a>, <em>Neightrein</em> isn’t so much a sequel to <em>Elden Ring </em>as it is a standalone co-op title set in a parallel universe. It’s got all the visual hallmarks of FromSoftware’s 2022 epic — sweeping vistas, haunting ruins, etc. etc. — along with the brutal boss battles and combat on display in both the original game and its excellent DLC, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">Shadow of the Erdtree</a></em>.</p><p>The big difference between <em>Nightreign</em> and previous <em>ER </em>titles is that you’re forced to tackle the new region of Limveld over a three-day span, either solo or in a team of three. Then you throw in a few character classes, a leveling system, and a <em>Fortnite</em>-like storm that shrinks the map over time, making each run absolute chaos.

<p>The Farm 51 has just released the playable demo for Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone. This post-apocalyptic-like, open-world game plunges players into the heart of Chornobyl, throwing them head over heels into a multiversal, ambitious survival RPG. It’s not a far cry from the first game, which was released in 2018, but the demo reveals a few flaws that need ironing out.</p>



<p>I picked up a preview copy of Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone a few days ago and was able to complete the playable demo in around 80 minutes. It’s a great glimpse behind the curtain, and it sets up some solid expectations for the full game, which will be released on March 6.</p>



<p>Check out my preview below to learn about my major gripes with Chernobylite 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-looks-great-doesn-t-play-well">Looks Great, Doesn’t Play Well</h2>



<p>Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone looks fantastic on the surface. The character models and animations are scarily good, and the open-world environment of the Exclusion Zone is authentic and feels great to look at. The enemy models are pretty much the same as the last game and look intimidating enough, and there are enough small details scattered around to make the world feel populated.</p>



<p>With all that being said, exploring Chernobylite 2 – even in the limited demo – doesn’t feel too sharp. It’s not the best experience and the new model that requires you to switch between a first- and third-person perspective to explore and fight is pretty jarring. I’d rather have it locked to a first-person perspective, just like the first game. </p>



<p>Combat is a little janky, and the first boss you encounter (a mini one, at least) presents a cumbersome, clunky battle that feels uninspired at best. There are a few classes to choose from, or you can pick a combination of multiple class types and use a mix of ranged, melee, and elemental attacks.</p>



<p>As I played the Chernobylite 2 demo, I found that no fight scenes felt satisfying or entertaining. I was just tapping buttons and awkwardly dropping targets.</p>



<h2 id="h-potentially-overcomplicated">Potentially Overcomplicated</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chernobylite-2-early-access-release-date/">Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone</a> is a survival RPG of sorts. There are branching skill paths that players must traverse, and at the heart of the game sits the typical tropes that accompany that genre – base-building, crafting, upgrades, and looting. The UI is simple enough, but the density and depth of the menus and the sheer amount on display can feel a little overwhelming.</p>



<p>Within the first hour of the demo, you’re introduced to the game’s major mechanics, but that’s just a scratch on the surface of this game. Before long, I was plunged into a base defence sequence, taught how to manage and maintain a full-fledged doomsday bunker, and instructed how to harness the power of radiation, turning it into fearsome fire and ice attacks.</p>



<p>That all sounds a little scattered, right?</p>



<p> I loved the first Chernobylite game, and admittedly it was just as complex, but it felt like more of a slow burner. It’s my impression that you’re thrown into the deep end in Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone quite quickly.</p>



<h2 id="h-flaws-uncovered">Flaws Uncovered</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another thing I have an issue with is the voice acting in the game. The main character has the sound of a middle-aged man from Yorkshire, and it doesn’t suit the model one bit. Everyone seems to have an accent that doesn’t suit them, and I’m not sure to what extent these voice actors are real people…</p>



<p>I found various spelling errors and grammatical blips in the game’s UI and text-based segments, and I had a few visual glitches here and there as I explored the demo. One thing I didn’t like was the heavy motion blur and frame rate issues that I experienced. And I’m playing Chernobylite 2 on a <strong>very </strong>high-end PC, so that shouldn’t happen.</p>



<p>I was less than encouraged to learn that the Chernobylite 2 demo had been pushed live early because the team at The Farm 51 had experienced unresolvable technical issues with Steam. I hope that’s not a case of ‘start as you mean to go on’ and that further issues won’t surface down the line.</p>



<p>I feel it’s worth stressing that The Farm 51 is a small studio that has crowdfunded to finance much of the development of Chernobylite 2. It’s not fair to criticise the game without pointing that out.</p>



<p>Chernobylite 2 could be something special, if only because I’m a massive fan of post-apocalyptic games. I love titles like Fallout <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-patch-fixes-bugs-and-overhauls/">and STALKER 2</a>, and Chernobylite (2018) wowed me through and through. I’m willing to settle into the game and give it a solid run to produce a full review shortly, but right now, I’m approaching the full release with guarded expectations and a tentative attitude.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/613495/while-waiting-review-switch-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Boredom is something of a dying concept. Our phones, filled with games and videos and social feeds, allow us to fill every moment with <em>something</em>, whether we’re on a long flight or in line for 30 seconds waiting for coffee. But the silly and playful <em>While Waiting</em> is a good reminder that that can be a good thing — an opportunity for our minds to wander in unexpected directions.</p><p>Possibly the best way to describe <em>While Waiting</em> is that it’s what would happen if <em>WarioWare</em> also tried to tell the story of a human life. Which means that it’s a collection of extremely short, often weird minigames that all fit together to follow the story of a singular character through moments of waiting. It starts right from the beginning: the first thing you’re asked to do is wait to be born.</p><p>From there, you jump through time via idle moments. You have to wait for the commercials to end while watching a show with your parents, or wait to fall asleep while lying in bed, or wait for the water to heat up to take a shower. In each instance, you can simply wait and do nothing, and eventually, time will pass and whatever you’re waiting for will happen. But this is a game, after all, so you can also mess about.</p><p>There are a handful of stickers to collect in each level that hint at what you can do. While you wait to get your grade on an exam, for instance, you can sneak around the classroom and spy on your friends’ grades. It plays out like a stealth game, as you have to avoid your teacher’s gaze, lest you be forced back to your desk.</p><p>The tricky part is figuring out what you’re able to do, and how to do it, in a very limited timeframe. And since almost every level is different, that challenge repeats itself over the 100 or so minigames. This is eased by the incredibly simple controls. You use one stick to move around and one button to interact with things. That’s it, aside from another button that does nothing but let you play with a fidget toy.</p><p>For the most part, the minigames are very silly. You have to make sure you remembered to pack underwear for a flight or push through crowds to get a better view of fireworks. One of my favorite stages involved making up constellations to impress a date. It’s all very charming and goofy, often using wonky physics to add some slapstick comedy. Some of the stages can be melancholy as well; one involves simply waiting to grow up.</p><p>But each one shows that, in those brief moments of idling around that we’re so eager to fill with distractions, something surprising can happen — if only you’re bored enough to pay attention.</p><p><sub>While Waiting <em>is available now on the Nintendo Switch and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For years, Maciej "Groobo" Maselewski&nbsp;stood as the undisputed champion of <em>Diablo</em> speedrunning. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW8XorD9RwI">3-minute, 12-second Sorceror run</a> looked all but unbeatable thanks to a combination of powerful (and allowable) glitch exploits along with what seemed like some unbelievable luck in the game's randomly generated dungeon.</p>
<p>But when a team of other speedrunners started trying and failing to replicate that luck using outside software and analysis tools, the story behind Groobo's run began to fall apart. As the inconsistencies in the run <a href="https://diablo.tas.bot/">started to mount</a>, that team would conduct an automated search through billions of legitimate <em>Diablo</em> dungeons to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Groobo's game couldn't have taken place in any of them.</p>
<p>"We just had a lot of curiosity and resentment that drove us to dig even deeper," team member Staphen told Ars Technica of their investigation. "Betrayal might be another way to describe it," team member AJenbo added. "To find out that this had been done illegitimately... and the person had both gotten and taken a lot of praise for their achievement."</p>
<h2>If we have unearned luck</h2>
<p>If you have any familiarity with <em>Diablo</em> or speedrunning, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW8XorD9RwI">watching Groobo's run</a> feels like watching someone win the lottery. First, there's the dungeon itself, which features a sequence of stairways that appear just steps from each other, forming a quick and enemy-free path down to the dungeon's deeper levels. Then there's Groobo's lucky find of <a href="https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Naj%27s_Puzzler_(Diablo_I)">Naj's Puzzler</a> on level 9, a unique item that enables the teleporting necessary for many of the run's late-game maneuvers.</p>

      Groobo's 3:12 <em>Diablo</em> speedrun, as submitted to Speed Demos Archive in 2009

</figure>
<p>"It seemed very unusual that we would have so many levels with the upstairs and the downstairs right next to each other," Allan "DwangoAC" Cecil told Ars Technica. "We wanted to find some way of replicating this."</p>
<p>When Cecil and a team of tool-assisted speedrunners (TAS) started that search process in earnest last February, they said they used Groobo's run as a baseline to try to improve from. While Groobo ostensibly had to rely on his own human luck in prepping his run, the TAS runners could use techniques and tools from outside the game to replicate Groobo's run (or something very similar) every time.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>To find an RNG seed that could do just that, the TAS team <a href="https://github.com/Matthew-petroff/diablo-mapgen">created a custom-built map generation tool</a> by reverse-engineering a disassembled <em>Diablo</em> executable. That tool can take any of the game's billions of possible random seeds and quickly determine the map layout, item distribution, and quest placement available in the generated save file. A scanner built on top of that tool can then quickly look through those generated dungeons for ones that might be optimal for speedrunning.</p>
<p>"We were working on finding the best seed for our TAS, and we were trying to identify the seed from Groobo's run, both to validate that our scanner works and to potentially straight-up use it for the run," Stephan said of the effort. "We naturally had a lot of trouble finding [that seed] because it doesn't exist."</p>
<h2>A thorough search</h2>
<p>In their effort to find Groobo's storied run (or at least one that resembled it), the TAS team conducted a distributed search across the game's roughly 2.2 billion valid <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/354373/what-exactly-is-a-seed-in-a-random-number-generator">RNG seeds</a>. Each of these seeds represents a different specific second on the system clock when a <em>Diablo</em> save file is created, ranging from between January 1, 1970, and December 31, 2038 (the only valid dates accepted by the game).</p>
<p>After comparing each of those billions of those RNG dungeons to a re-creation of the dungeon seen in Groobo's run, the team couldn't find a single example containing the crucial level 9 Naj's Puzzler drop. After that, the team started searching through "impossible" seeds, which could only be created by <a href="https://ultimatestuff.tripod.com/ultimatediablo/cheats.htm">using save modification tools</a> to force a creation date after the year 2038.</p>
<p>The team eventually found dungeons matching Naj's Puzzler drop in Groobo's video, using seeds associated with the years 2056 and 2074.</p>

<p>The early presumption that Groobo's run was legitimate ended up costing the team weeks of work. "It was baffling when we couldn't find [the early Naj's Puzzler] in any of the searches we did," Cecil said. "We were always worried that the scanner might have bugs in it," Staphen added.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The TAS team's thorough search also showed troubling inconsistencies in the other dungeon levels shown in Groobo's run. "Normally you would only need to identify a single level to replicate a run since all the other levels are generated from the same seed," AJenbo told Ars. But the levels seen in Groobo's run came from multiple different seeds, which would require splicing footage from multiple different saves.</p>
<p>"At that point we also wanted to figure out how manipulated the run was," AJenbo said. "Was it a legit run except for [dungeon level] 9? Was it three good runs combined? In the end we only found two levels that had come from the same run so at least 13 (probably 15) runs were spliced into one video, which is a lot for a game with just 16 levels."</p>

<h2>The evidence piles up</h2>
<p>After Groobo's dungeon generation problems came to light, other inconsistencies in his run started to become apparent. Some of these are relatively easy to spot with the naked eye once you know what you're looking for.</p>
<p>For instance, the "1996–2001" copyright date seen on the title screen in Groobo's video is inconsistent with the v1.00 shown on the initial menu screen, suggesting Groobo's run was spliced together from runs on multiple different versions of the game. Items acquired early in the run also disappear from the inventory later on with no apparent explanation.</p>
<figure>
    <div id="caption-2076362"><p>
              This copyright date doesn't line up with the "V1.00" seen later on the menu screen in Groobo's run.

          </p></div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Even months after the investigation first started, new inconsistencies are still coming to light. Groobo's final fight against Diablo, for instance, required just 19 fireballs to take him out. While that's technically possible with perfect luck for the level 12 Sorceror seen in the footage, the TAS team found that the specific damage dealt and boss behavior only matched when they attempted the same attacks using a level 26 Sorceror.</p>
<p>After the TAS team compiled their many findings <a href="https://diablo.tas.bot/">into a lengthy document</a>, Groobo defended his submission in a discussion with Cecil (screenshots of which were viewed by Ars Technica). "My run is a segmented/spliced run," Groobo said. "It always has been and it was never passed off as anything else, nor was it part of any competition or leaderboards. The Speed Demos Archive [SDA] page states that outright." Indeed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091121211238/https://speeddemosarchive.com/Diablo.html">an archived version of Groobo's record-setting Speed Demos Archive submission</a> does say directly that it's made up of "27 segments appended to one file."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>But simply splitting a run into segments doesn't explain away all of the problems the TAS team found. Getting Naj's Puzzler on dungeon level 9, for instance, still requires outside modification of a save file, which is specifically prohibited by <a href="https://kb.speeddemosarchive.com/Rules">longstanding Speed Demos Archive rules</a> that "manually editing/adding/removing game files is generally not allowed." Groobo's apparent splicing of multiple game versions and differently seeded save files also seems to go against SDA rules, which say that "there obviously needs to be continuity between segments in terms of inventory, experience points or whatever is applicable for the individual game."</p>
<p>After being presented with the TAS team's evidence, SDA <a href="https://speeddemosarchive.com/">wrote</a> that "it has been determined that Groobo's run very likely does not stem from only legitimate techniques, and as such, has itself been banished barring new developments." But Groobo's record is <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/110580-fastest-completion-of-an-rpg-videogame">still listed as the "Fastest completion of an RPG videogame"</a> by Guinness World Records, which has not offered a substantive response to the team's findings (Guinness has not responded to a request for comment from Ars Technica).</p>

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>This might seem like a pretty petty issue to spend weeks of time and attention debunking. But at a recent presentation attended by Ars, Cecil said he was motivated to pursue it because "it did harm. Groobo's alleged cheating in 2009 completely stopped interest in speedrunning this category [of <em>Diablo</em>]. No one tried, no one could."</p>
<p>Because of Groobo's previously unknown modifications to make an impossible-to-beat run, "this big running community just stopped trying to run this game in that category," Cecil said. "For more than a decade, this had a chilling impact on that community." With Groobo's run out of the way, though, new runners are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXG1vW6VEKA">setting new records on confirmed legitimate RNG seeds</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9mn5CpQCFw">with the aid of TAS tools</a>.</p>
<p>In the end, Cecil said he hopes the evidence regarding Groobo's run will make people look more carefully at other record submissions. "Groobo had created a number of well-respected ... speedruns," he said. "[People thought] there wasn't any good reason to doubt him. In other words, there was bias in familiarity. This was a familiar character. Why would they cheat?"</p>

<p>Recently, eagle-eyed gamers spotted a listing on the Xbox Store for Tides of Annihilation, the new hack-n-slash title revealed by Eclipse Glow Games at the State of Play showcase. This ambitious, post-apocalyptic title turned heads for its representation of a tantalising combination between Stellar Blade and Elden Ring.</p>



<p>The listing on the Xbox Store surfaced without warning and even had a price point associated with it – a modest sum of $22.49. However, gamers trying to purchase the game were met with something of a digital stonewall.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-yet">Not Yet</h2>



<p>Tides of Annihilation isn’t out yet – and presently, nobody knows when it will be released. When it <strong>does drop </strong>it’ll be on Xbox Series, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3li4itlcsfx2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Wario64 shared an image of the Xbox Store, showing that Tides of Annihilation had seemingly been released and had a price point of just $22.49. This encouraged gamers to try purchasing the game, but they were met with nothing but a stonewall and a 300 MB ‘placeholder’ file. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the transactions were carried out as expected, which means players were charged the $22.49 that they paid for the file.</p>



<p>It could have been that someone at Xbox was very excited about the prospect of Tides of Annihilation and pressed a button a little too early.</p>



<p>Here’s the most recent extended gameplay trailer for Tides of Annihilation, just to loop you in and set your expectations:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Tides of Annihilation is a mystical, post-apocalyptic title set in a torn rendition of London. The game’s protagonist, Gwendolyn, has an ethereal connection to spectral knights of Arthurian mythology and uses their powers to battle monumental and enormous boss characters.</p>



<p>I recently caught up with Eclipse Glow Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-annihilation-interview-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to ask them about</a> some of the core elements of Tides of Annihilation.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals continues to stun gamers worldwide since debuting in December 2024. This free-to-play hero shooter has pulled in tens of millions of fans, dominating the charts and attracting all kinds of top-tier content creators and pro players. Recently, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-host-400000-global-invitational-tournament/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a $400,000 esports tournament</a> is already planned to take place.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Marvel Rivals’ developer, NetEase, offered up a tidbit of information regarding the future of the game, looking specifically at a PvE mode. This is one of the most talked-about topics in the community, but what’s the chance it’ll be added?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-yet">Not Yet</h2>



<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-developer-says-theres-currently-no-plan-for-a-pve-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, NetEase’s producer, Weicong Wu, spoke about PvE mode for Marvel Rivals. It’s a feature that many players have requested, either to seek a lesser challenge or to potentially sharpen their skills for when they fight real players.</p>



<p>Here’s what Wu said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For now we don’t have any kind of a PvE plan, but our development team is continuously experimenting with new game play modes. So if we found that a new specific game mode is entertaining enough, fun enough, we would of course bring it to our audience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>NetEase is aware of the demand, of course. Wu explained, ‘We believe there are some of our audience that would like the PvE mode.’ For now, the team at NetEase is ‘continuously experimenting’ with ways to please everyone and one proposed solution is a ‘lighter mode’ instead of a full-blown PvE experience.</p>



<p>It was revealed in the same interview, which took place at DICE in Las Vegas, that the developer is ‘open’ to bringing Marvel Rivals to Nintendo Switch 2, which would be a boon for the platform.</p>

<p>Team BDS is the first organisation to qualify for the grand final at the Six Invitational 2025, which will unravel tomorrow in Boston. Following a solid run through the upper bracket, Team BDS has found a spot in yet another pole position and remains the favourite to win the event and claim the $1 million prize.</p>



<p>To get there, Team BDS had to throw the likes of Unwanted and FURIA into the lower bracket. Both of these teams now stand a chance of squaring up against Team BDS once again to deliver an age-old tale of revenge, but FaZe Clan could also surface in the grand final.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-long-left">Not Long Left</h2>



<p>Today, two matches will play out, the first being a clash between Unwanted and FaZe Clan. From there, the winner will play FURIA for a spot in the grand final. One of these three teams will face off against a dominant Team BDS, which finds itself in a grand final for the fourth time <strong>this season</strong>.</p>



<p>Last year, Team BDS secured the top spot at the inaugural Esports World Cup, earning a prestigious place in the gaming history books.</p>



<p>Team BDS has enjoyed a solid streak through the Six Invitational, which is one of the biggest and most valuable esports tournaments in the world. The squad topped the charts in the group stage, and as the team steamed through the playoffs bracket, it forced Unwanted, Spacestation, and FURIA into the elimination bracket after earning a bye thanks to group seeding.</p>



<p>This could be Team BDS’ first Six Invitational Win. Currently, every team in the running except FaZe Clan has never seen a grand final at the Six Invitational. Here’s a spread of the past winners of the Six Invitational:</p>



<ul>
<li>2017 – Elevate &amp; Continuum</li>



<li>2018 – PENTA</li>



<li>2019 – G2 Esports</li>



<li>2020 – Spacestation</li>



<li>2021 – Ninjas in Pyjamas</li>



<li>2022 – TSM</li>



<li>2023 – G2 Esports</li>



<li>2024 – w7m Esports</li>
</ul>



<p>Do you think Team BDS can break through the grand final and lift the hammer in Boston? Right now, the team is <strong>guaranteed to win </strong>at least $450,000. Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Gray Zone Warfare’s developer, MADFINGER Games, continues to innovate and expand Gray Zone Warfare, one of 2024’s most impressive shooters. In April 2024, Gray Zone Warfare emerged to a positive reception, presenting a tactical shooter experience bursting with realism and intensity. It has since sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-whats-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 1.5 million units</a>.</p>



<p>Recently, the team at MADFINGER revealed the next lineup of improvements and changes coming to Gray Zone Warfare. The first port of call for these changes is the game’s test server, but if all goes well, they’ll be deployed across the full game soon enough.</p>



<hr>







<p>Gray Zone Warfare is being pieced together with the community in mind, and stacks of feedback have been taken on board and actively considered by the developer. Last year, I was fortunate enough to catch up with MADFINGER’s CEO to ask him about the state of play for Gray Zone and the extraction shooter market in general.</p>



<p>While Gray Zone isn’t <strong>strictly </strong>an extraction shooter, it does have mechanics that align it quite nicely with the genre.</p>



<p>Here’s what MADFINGER is testing in the latest test server patch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Introduction of a ‘repair feature’</li>



<li>Easier progression to max vendor level</li>



<li>Better disconnect protection</li>



<li>Better item and body behaviour and physics</li>
</ul>



<p>The first feature on that list is the most widely requested note in the Gray Zone Warfare community. When implemented, it’ll allow users to patch up their equipment instead of paying a costly price to replace items. As you can expect, items can be repaired, but each successive repair will degrade the overall max quality rating of that item.</p>



<p>MADFINGER’s intent to strengthen disconnect protection in the game is also a nice inclusion. Many modern shooters feature this mechanic, and it means that if you disconnect while playing, you’ll load back up with the option to continue where you left off.</p>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare has a solid development pipeline lined up, and the passion evident in MADFINGER is a wondrous thing. Have you given Gray Zone a try? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/level-zero-extraction-updates-canned-two-weeks-after-game%E2%80%99s-full-release.1110327/</guid>

<p>Level Zero Extraction has succumbed to one of the issues plaguing the wider industry. The developer behind the title – Doghowl – has taken to social media to announce that no further updates will be rolled out for this extraction shooter that emerged as a 1.0 release just two weeks ago.</p>



<p>Level Zero Extraction was shaping up as a tasty, alien-fuelled competitor to Escape from Tarkov, but now, the developer has stressed that the ‘relatively small team’ cannot continue to sustain the game from a financial standpoint.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-down-the-drain">Down the Drain</h2>



<p>Level Zero Extraction entered early access in August 2024, impressing players worldwide with an innovative take on the extraction shooter genre. In this game, players could assume control of ‘Mercs’ or fearsome aliens, loading into a raid and trying to loot their hearts out before successfully extracting again.</p>



<p>Like a few extraction shooters that came before, Level Zero Extraction failed to gain enough traction to sustain the title.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, just 10 people are playing the game on Steam, and the title’s all-time peak sits at just 2,601. That’s a paltry condition compared to competing titles like Hunt: Showdown and Dark and Darker, both of which were floating between 10,000 – 12,000 players at the time of publishing.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/LevelZeroGame/status/1890367933810966719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the Doghowl team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, LZ:E has underperformed compared to our expectations. It’s no longer feasible for our relatively small teams to sustain the game from a financial standpoint. Therefore, it’s a hard but necessary decision to gradually wrap up support.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stressed that the servers will stay up and wipes will continue to happen, but no further updates will be applied to the game. Now, Doghowl looks to what’s coming next, with the team mentioning that it has plans to develop a new multiplayer title that’s based on a cooperative experience.</p>



<p>Did you give Level Zero Extraction a try yet? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum what you think</a>.</p>

Recently, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1igzcw4/marvel_rivals_leak_reveals_possible_pve_boss/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors have spread of a potential PvE boss fight</a>, leading some to speculate that a PvE mode is right around the corner. Unfortunately, NetEase recently clarified that it doesn't have plans for such a mode...yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke to Marvel Rivals producer Weicong Wu at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas this week, and asked him about any plans for a PvE mode.

Wu continued:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah, we believe there are some of our audience that would like the PvE mode. But also, you can see that if we come up with a hardcore PvE experience, that will be totally a different distinctive experience from what we have right now. So our development team has been continuously experimenting with different approaches to achieve that goal, maybe a lighter mode, in a lighter sense of that, and to see what would work best for our game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for now, it sounds like there are no concrete plans for PvE, but Wu does seem to be suggesting that NetEase is playing around with ideas for a "lighter" game mode of some kind, perhaps like a one-off event or something similar.

But NetEase and Marvel say they have better things to do...like actually make the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, dataminers began sharing names of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-fear-netease-is-planting-fake-hero-leaks-to-throw-off-dataminers-but-whats-really-going-on">potential future heroes hidden in the code of Marvel Rivals</a>, a few of whom seemed to be confirmed pretty quickly as real when the Fantastic Four were officially announced. However, as the list of datamined heroes grew, a different rumor began to circulate in the community: some of the names were fake, planted there by developers to mislead dataminers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even now, there's disagreement in the community as to which, if any of the datamined characters are really being seriously considered for the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We recently had the opportunity to directly ask Marvel Rivals producer Weicong Wu and Marvel Games executive producer Danny Koo if they're secretly performing an elaborate troll. And while it sounds like there are no pranks being pulled here, we should still take all the names being found in the code with a grain of salt. Here's what Wu had to say:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So firstly we want to say that we don't recommend anybody to make adjustments to the files [of the game]," he began. "Also, you can see that for each character's design actually we come through a very complicated process and we make a lot of concepts, trials, prototypes, development, et cetera. So there could be some information left in the code, and it might mean that we have tried those directions and they may appear or may not appear in our future plans. And whether or not they will appear in our future pipeline is highly depending on what kind of gameplay experience our players would expect in our game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Koo added, "If I could have a ten-year plan, it'd be great. But the team experimented with a lot of play styles, heroes. It was like there's someone doing scratch paperwork and then just left a notebook there, and someone [a dataminer] decided to open it with no context."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I pushed a little, asking them point-blank if they were deliberately trolling people. Koo replied, "No. We would rather spend our time developing the actual game."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same conversation, we also discussed how a character gets chosen to be added into Marvel Rivals in the first place. The two told me that the team plans updates roughly a year in advance, and is committed to keeping its current pace of adding new characters every month and a half. For each update, NetEase first looks at what type of character and skillset is needed to balance out the rest of the game and add variety to the roster, and come up with a list of several different possible additions. Wu told me that part of NetEase's strategy for achieving game balance is to focus less on aggressively tweaking existing characters to be perfectly fine-tuned, and more on adding new characters and experiences to keep things fresh, fill gaps, support characters that are a bit weak with new team abilities, or counter characters that might be a little too strong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once they have a list of possibilities, NetEase then takes these suggestions to Marvel Games, and begin working on initial designs. From there, they look at what the community is currently excited about, as well as what's planned a year in advance in other Marvel divisions, such as if a big film or comic arc is coming that they can tie a character in with. That helps them come to a final decision on who's going in. All this explains why there might be a lot of different heroes listed in the code - NetEase just has a lot of ideas it's tossing around all the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review">great at launch</a>, and each new character only seems to make it more powerful, with the Human Torch and The Thing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-sets-february-release-date-for-the-thing-and-human-torch">set to be the latest heroes joining the game</a> on February 21.

And whenever we find that we could provide great performance for our game on Switch 2, we're open to that. The reason why we didn't launch it onto the Switch, it was the first generation of that device they cannot provide a great experience for our gameplay.

While we don't have too many details on its capabilities just yet, it appears to be a bigger and more powerful Nintendo Switch system.
