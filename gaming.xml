Yet, while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-remaster-remake-capcom-teaser-frank-west-1851561484&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-remaster-remake-capcom-teaser-frank-west-1851561484"><em>Dead Rising</em></a></span> might not be as famous or beloved as <em>Resident Evil,</em> its quirky characters, oddball tone, endless hordes of zombies, and tension-building ticking clock made it feel unique and helped it develop its own fanbase. </p><p>It all started with <em>Dead Rising</em> in 2006, which was unlike any other zombie game released before that time. It let people live out the fantasy seen in George Romero’s iconic <em>Dawn of the Dead. </em>Finally, you could explore a zombie-infested mall and test your various strategies. Over time the franchise would evolve and change, in good and bad ways. After <em>Dead Rising 4</em> in 2016, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-sly-cooper-titanfall-splinter-cell-left-4-dead-1851506835/slides/20&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-sly-cooper-titanfall-splinter-cell-left-4-dead-1851506835/slides/20">series went dormant for a bit</a></span>.<br></p><p>But good news: The franchise is returning later this year, though not with a new sequel. Instead, in September, nearly 20 years after the first game came out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-remaster-classic-frank-west-skin-pre-order-1851575527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-remaster-classic-frank-west-skin-pre-order-1851575527">Capcom is set to release a remake of<em> Dead Rising</em></a></span>. So before people start hopping into this new spin on an Xbox 360 zombie classic, let’s dive into the entire franchise and figure out which games are good, meh, and bad.</p></div></div><div><p>While on paper this is meant to be a port of the original Xbox 360 game, in reality, it’s an awful, ugly, and barely playable version of <em>Dead Rising</em>. Remember how the big selling point of <em>Dead Rising </em>was the impressive number of zombies on screen? Well, that’s missing, as is most of what made the original game good.</p></div><div><p>Porting<em> Dead Rising</em> to the Wii was always going to require some cuts. But unlike the phone port, <em>Chop ‘Till You Drop</em> at least plays, looks, and sounds like <em>Dead Rising</em>. Sure, it’s basically just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/fgi8Rw-8BMc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/fgi8Rw-8BMc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capcom’s <em>RE4</em> Wii port re-skinned</a></span> as <em>Dead Rising</em>, but it mostly works, even if, like in the mobile version, the amount of zombies on screen is still pretty low.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b837dc81e4a01545c54b4d3a72224269" data-recommend-id="image://b837dc81e4a01545c54b4d3a72224269" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows Frank and Chuck overlooking a facility in the desert.

Sure, it’s cool that Frank West (the protagonist of the first game) meets up with and helps Chuck Greene (the protagonist of <em>Dead Rising 2</em>). I also like the way this tiny standalone DLC moves the franchise’s narrative forward a bit. But beyond that, <em>Case West</em> is a pretty forgettable, but thankfully very short, experience.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1906794d262a7238205209dcab018e44" data-recommend-id="image://1906794d262a7238205209dcab018e44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows Frank West as he appears in Dead Rising 4.

But sadly, this winter-themed sequel is mostly a flop, and it comes down to the fact that it doesn’t really feel like a <em>Dead Rising </em>game anymore. </p><p>What made the older entries great wasn’t just all the zombies. It was the way the worlds felt believable but weird, the photography mechanic, and the challenge of balancing a ticking clock with exploration. <em>Dead Rising 4 </em>strips away the clock, makes it easier to carry around weapons, and turns the wacky knob past 10 and breaks it off. This leads to an experience that feels disconnected from the best games in the series, even though I was happy that Frank could still take photos of giant zombie hordes using his phone.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c3f00396656dd24cee0b6fcbf6fb7799" data-recommend-id="image://c3f00396656dd24cee0b6fcbf6fb7799" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a large zombie horde as seen in Dead Rising 3.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Dead Rising 3</em> is the point in the franchise where things start to go off the rails. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoy this installment. Its gritty, open-world city is a perfect setting for a zombie apocalypse, its main character (Nick Ramos) is a likable guy, and the weapon and vehicle crafting (first introduced in <em>DR2</em>) isn’t too outrageous or game-breaking yet. So it’s a better game than <em>DR4</em>, but it also marks the beginning of the end for the franchise as it shows the series shifting focus to wacky weapons while downplaying the ticking clock that added so much tension to the older games.</p></div><div><p>Sure, it’s not as big as<em> Dead Rising 2 </em>or the original, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-2-case-zero-review-the-case-of-the-zombie-5623108&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-2-case-zero-review-the-case-of-the-zombie-5623108"><em>Case Zero</em></a></span>—a standalone prequel to <em>DR2</em> released before the game’s launch—is a lot of fun. It was our first introduction to the new and improved mechanics of <em>Dead Rising 2.</em> It also was the first time the series stretched its legs, letting you explore a small western-themed town as you hunt for Zombrex—a medicine that stops an infected person from turning into a zombie—for your daughter. A solid entry in the series, even if most players finished it up in less than two hours.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="88f6a141bbb00c82f1e6ca86b9aa63ef" data-recommend-id="image://88f6a141bbb00c82f1e6ca86b9aa63ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows zombies in Dead Rising 2.

It looks better, plays better, and its Vegas-like locale is a perfect place to set a <em>Dead Rising</em> game. But what holds<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/review-dead-rising-2-5656942&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/review-dead-rising-2-5656942"><em>Dead Rising 2</em></a></span><em> </em>back compared to the other games on our list is mainly a less interesting story, a main character who isn’t as memorable as Frank West, and the removal of the photography mechanic. In <em>DR1</em> it was such a neat feature that as you survived the zombie invasion of the mall you could take photos of your adventure, both documenting your journey while also earning XP to level up. </p><p>Removing the in-game camera was a mistake, but hey, Capcom added co-op and the crafting system—letting you combine weapons to make better zombie-killing tools—in this entry. So in the end, <em>Dead Rising 2 </em>is mostly a win with just a <em>few </em>frustrating flaws.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e9e7dc3ee6a2a612876272973cd9d207" data-recommend-id="image://e9e7dc3ee6a2a612876272973cd9d207" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows Frank West in front of a horde of zombies in Dead Rising.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The original game that started it all is a clunky thing, for sure, and some of its boss fights and missions are extremely annoying. And yet, <em>Dead Rising</em>’s oddball tone, as well as the way it uses the zombie horde and a ticking clock to always pressure you to take risks, is wonderful. Being able to pick up nearly anything in its large, highly detailed mall and use it as a weapon was incredibly fun and impressive at the time. Want to toss plates at a zombie? Go ahead. Wanna use a chair as a weapon? You can! </p><p>Sure, a lot of people complained that the ticking clock ruined the game, making it hard to just have fun. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-2-off-the-records-new-sandbox-mode-is-all-i-5834783&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-2-off-the-records-new-sandbox-mode-is-all-i-5834783"><em>Dead Rising 2: Off the Record</em></a></span> would “fix” this by adding a sandbox mode with no clock.) But while I get the frustration of missing a mission because time ran out or you got trapped behind a giant horde with no good weapons, I think that’s part of the game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-timer-makes-dead-rising-2s-zombies-scary-1792225419&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-timer-makes-dead-rising-2s-zombies-scary-1792225419">It’s what makes it work</a></span>. Besides, you should restart <em>Dead Rising</em> at least once or twice, taking your experience and skills into a new playthrough. In a way, it’s almost a roguelike experience.</p></div></div><div><p>What an odd video game! <em>Dead Rising 2: Off the Record</em> is a non-canonical retelling of the events of <em>Dead Rising 2</em>, but this time you play as Frank West. It’s strange to play a spin-off alt-reality sequel, but it works! That’s because <em>Off the Record</em> keeps all the stuff that was good in <em>DR2</em>—the setting, improved controls, more zombies, weapon crafting, etc.—but brings back Frank and his camera. </p><p>In a lot of ways <em>Dead Rising 2: Off the Record</em> feels like Capcom let some <em>DR </em>fans mod the hell out of <em>Dead Rising 2</em> and then sold it to people as a new game and…I love it! And it’s easily the best game in the series. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a free-to-play open-world survival crafting game, a word salad of flavor-of-the-month genres if ever there was one, and it takes those well-worn ideas and simplifies them into relatively basic forms. And yet, here we are a few days after launch and I find that I can’t put it down. It’s still early, but so far it’s so fun, and so <em>weird</em>. </p><p>There’s no shortage of post-apocalyptic survival games out there, whether you’re talking about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-76-review-2024">Fallout 76</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/24/rust-review">Rust</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review">7 Days to Die</a>, or the many, many other options. But Once Human makes its take on that setup feel unique and interesting by wrapping the end of the world around an alien infestation rather than your classic zombies or nuclear war scenarios. It’s a fun approach that, in hindsight, seems underused in the genre, and Once Human puts it to use in some really clever ways. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Once Human Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>This alien organism has the ability to turn basically anything into a grotesque monster, living or otherwise. Sure, that shuffling and snarling person may seem like a zombie, but then it turns around and reveals it has a blinding stage light for a head. I’ve fought lightbulbs that have turned into giant spiders, evil trees, and even a bus that sprouted a really unfortunate number of giant legs and trotted up and down the road like the biggest, yellowest, and strangest centipede that has ever existed. I did not see those enemies coming, and that has kept Once Human full of surprises.</p><p>Your weaponry is fairly basic, consisting of simple melee weapons like blades and bars, as well as your general pistol, rifle, and shotgun small-arms options. They are pretty unremarkable, but it’s hard to be bored with a baseball bat when you are beating on a monster with a traffic cone for a head or trying to snipe at a massive shadow-beast boss that just as easily could have been fighting Kratos in God of War. Sure, most of the fights are resolved by flailing your melee weapon or running around in circles and shooting as you drain health bars, but the boss fights do a nice job of mixing in unique mechanics, like forcing you to kill monster spawners to make the boss vulnerable. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Once Human makes forming pick-up parties for dungeons easy.</p></div><p>The creatures are the best looking things in Once Human, with organic and inorganic meeting in a strange, body horror aesthetic. That said, the rest of the world is pretty bland. Forests aren’t particularly lush and the same trees repeat a noticeable amount of the time. Urban areas are largely covered in drab concrete that shows signs of decay, but not to the degree that stands out in something like the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-review">Last of Us</a> series, which seems like a missed opportunity to lean even further into the alien infestation look. </p><p>The biggest monsters are reserved for instanced dungeons, similar to classic World of Warcraft design. These fights are geared towards groups of up to four players, and Once Human makes forming pick-up parties easy. A click of a button brings up a server-wide team finder where you can browse what sort of groups other people are looking for, or start your own. Just pick what activity you are doing and interested parties will apply to join you, and you can give them the thumbs up or down at your leisure. Even as a relatively shy gamer when it comes to queueing up with randoms (I typically bring my own group of friends), I’ve had a lot of success getting groups together, and the fact that no words or other back-and-forth is necessary makes it painless even for online introverts like myself. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Outside of combat there’s a simple linear questline to follow that, so far, is a loop of going to different places and then activating things, finding things, and fighting things. Roughly 6 hours in, it seems mainly geared towards making me visit important landmarks and introducing me to Once Human’s fundamental mechanics, which is fine for now, though it will need to pick up the pace soon if it’s going to keep my interest. I do, however, appreciate how it leans into the strangeness of the world, like the time I was sent to hunt the monster that kept turning pregnant people into trees (seriously). </p><p>I haven’t uncovered the full map yet, but even in the early going it’s big enough that running from one end to the other can be a chore. Thankfully, there are a number of ways to speed that up. An early quest gave me a motorcycle that I can summon anytime, and it’s fun to zoom around on. There are also Transportation Towers to unlock, which act as fast travel points, and even a glider, which all help make the distances much more manageable. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The survival-crafting aspects benefit from being very simple.</p></div><p>The survival-crafting aspects have me very motivated to explore, too, as Once Human benefits from being very simple and straightforward here. At the start you have very few things you can craft, but as you accumulate XP and level up you get Memetic Cyphers, which let you unlock nodes on four upgrade trees. There aren’t any gaps, and as long as you have Memetic Cyphers and materials you can progress quickly to making quality food and equipment. It’s a less-is-more approach that makes it easy to get back to the action, which I appreciate. </p><p>Gathering materials is still done via the tried and true “run around and punch trees” method, but at least early on supplies are abundant enough that heading out for some mining doesn’t feel laborious. Resources seem to grow back quickly, and there are upgrades down the line that look like they can even automate some potential time sinks. Aspiring to things like that is so important in this genre, and although how well those more advanced options are executed remains to be seen, the early stage does a good job of requiring some effort to acquire materials without being tedious. </p><p>Right now my home base is pretty rudimentary, as you’d expect for someone just getting started. It’s a wooden foundation big enough for my bed and some crafting tables – it may not be fancy, but it was easy to put together with the simple point-and-drop building system.  But, since this is a shared-world crafting game, I’m able to browse other players' structures, which range from rundown shacks that make my place look like a palace, to two-story mid-century modern homes that would fit right in on HGTV. I haven’t yet channeled my inner Frank Lloyd Wright, largely because I haven’t invested the upgrade points that unlock the more interesting construction options, but I’m eager to give it a go soon. </p><p>So far I haven’t had any temptation to spend any real money on Once Human to speed that process up, either, as the monetization strategy mostly revolves around cosmetic items like weapon skins and home decorations. There is a battle pass with a premium and free track, but from what I can tell all the premium rewards are also cosmetic, while the free rewards contain some useful crafting components mixed in. Importantly, it doesn’t seem like there is much in the way of pay-to-win concerns, but I’ll be keeping an eye on that as I continue my playthrough. </p><p>Naturally I’m still well short of the endgame, both from a story and a survival crafting standpoint, but my initial impression of Once Human is surprisingly very positive. It’s simple and straightforward mechanically, which lets the absolutely bizarre world of this alien post-apocalypse shine. The creatures are horrifying in a fun way, and I’m thoroughly caught up in the loop of being ever so slightly able to craft better and better things. I don’t know where we will end up as I continue to play over the next week or so, but Once Human is off to a really solid start. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the ancient Chinese game of <em>Go</em>, state-of-the-art artificial intelligence has generally been able to defeat the best human players <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/google-ai-begins-battle-with-humanitys-best-go-player-tonight/">since at least 2016</a>. But in the last few years, researchers have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/11/new-go-playing-trick-defeats-world-class-go-ai-but-loses-to-human-amateurs/">discovered flaws in these top-level AI <em>Go</em> algorithms</a> that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/man-beats-machine-at-go-in-human-victory-over-ai/">give humans a fighting chance</a>. By using unorthodox "cyclic" strategies—ones that even a beginning human player could detect and defeat—a crafty human can often exploit gaps in a top-level AI's strategy and fool the algorithm into a loss.
</p><p>Researchers at MIT and <a href="https://far.ai/">FAR AI</a> wanted to see if they could improve this "worst case" performance in otherwise "superhuman" AI Go algorithms, testing a trio of methods to harden the top-level <a href="https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo">KataGo algorithm</a>'s defenses against adversarial attacks. The results show that creating truly robust, unexploitable AIs may be difficult, even in areas as tightly controlled as board games.</p>
<h2>Three failed strategies</h2>
<p>In the pre-print paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12843">"Can <em>Go</em> AIs be adversarially robust?"</a>, the researchers aim to create a <em>Go</em> AI that is truly "robust" against any and all attacks. That means an algorithm that can't be fooled into "game-losing blunders that a human would not commit" but also one that would require any competing AI algorithm to spend significant computing resources to defeat it. Ideally, a robust algorithm should also be able to overcome potential exploits by using additional computing resources when confronted with unfamiliar situations.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cyclic.png" data-height="800" data-width="800" alt="An example of the original cyclic attack in action."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cyclic.png" data-height="800" data-width="800">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> An example of the original cyclic attack in action.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The researchers tried three methods to generate such a robust <em>Go</em> algorithm. In the first, they simply fine-tuned the KataGo model using more examples of the unorthodox cyclic strategies that previously defeated it, hoping that KataGo could learn to detect and defeat these patterns after seeing more of them.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>This strategy initially seemed promising, letting KataGo win 100 percent of games against a cyclic "attacker." But after the attacker itself was fine-tuned (a process that used much less computing power than KataGo's fine-tuning), that win rate fell back down to 9 percent against a slight variation on the original attack.</p>
<p>For its second defense attempt, the researchers iterated a multi-round "arms race" where new adversarial models discover novel exploits and new defensive models seek to plug up those newly discovered holes. After 10 rounds of such iterative training, the final defending algorithm still only won 19 percent of games against a final attacking algorithm that had discovered previously unseen variation on the exploit. This was true even as the updated algorithm maintained an edge against earlier attackers that it had been trained against in the past.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-109417607-scaled.jpg" data-height="1707" data-width="2560" alt="Even a child can beat a world-class <em>Go</em> AI if they know the right algorithm-exploiting strategy."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-109417607-scaled.jpg" data-height="1707" data-width="2560">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Even a child can beat a world-class <em>Go</em> AI if they know the right algorithm-exploiting strategy.</p><p>Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>In their final attempt, researchers tried a completely new type of training using <a href="https://medium.com/@hansahettiarachchi/unveiling-vision-transformers-revolutionizing-computer-vision-beyond-convolution-c410110ef061">vision transformers</a>, in an attempt to avoid what might be "bad inductive biases" found in the convolutional neural networks that initially trained KataGo. This method also failed, winning only 22 percent of the time against a variation on the cyclic attack that "can be replicated by a human expert," the researchers wrote.</p>
<h2>Will anything work?</h2>
<p>In all three defense attempts, the KataGo-beating adversaries didn't represent some new, previously unseen height in general <em>Go</em>-playing ability. Instead, these attacking algorithms were laser-focused on discovering exploitable weaknesses in an otherwise performant AI algorithm, even if those simple attack strategies would lose to most human players.</p>
<p>Those exploitable holes highlight the importance of evaluating "worst-case" performance in AI systems, even when the "average-case" performance can seem downright superhuman. On average, KataGo can dominate even high-level human players using traditional strategies. But in the worst case, otherwise "weak" adversaries can find holes in the system that make it fall apart.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>It's easy to extend this kind of thinking to other types of generative AI systems. LLMs that can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/12/chatgpt-vs-google-bard-round-2-how-does-the-new-gemini-model-fare/">succeed at some complex creative and reference tasks</a> might still <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/chatgpt-math-problems">utterly fail when confronted with trivial math problems</a> (or even get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/ai-poisoning-could-turn-open-models-into-destructive-sleeper-agents-says-anthropic/">"poisoned" by malicious prompts</a>). Visual AI models that can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/microsoft-unveils-kosmos-1-an-ai-language-model-with-visual-perception-abilities/">describe and analyze complex photos</a> may nonetheless <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/07/can-you-do-better-than-top-level-ai-models-on-these-basic-vision-tests/">fail horribly when presented with basic geometric shapes</a>.
</p><figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-11-115243.png" data-height="297" data-width="1080" alt="If you can solve these kinds of puzzles, you may have better visual reasoning than state-of-the-art AIs."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-11-115243.png" data-height="297" data-width="1080">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> If you can solve these kinds of puzzles, you may have better visual reasoning than state-of-the-art AIs.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Improving these kinds of "worst case" scenarios is key to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">avoiding embarrassing mistakes</a> when rolling an AI system out to the public. But this new research shows that determined "adversaries" can often discover new holes in an AI algorithm's performance much more quickly and easily than that algorithm can evolve to fix those problems.
</p><p>And if that's true in <em>Go</em>—a monstrously complex game that nonetheless has tightly defined rules—it might be even more true in less controlled environments. "The key takeaway for AI is that these vulnerabilities will be difficult to eliminate,” FAR CEO Adam Gleave <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02218-7">told Nature</a>. "If we can’t solve the issue in a simple domain like <em>Go</em>, then in the near-term there seems little prospect of patching similar issues like jailbreaks in ChatGPT."</p>
<p>Still, the researchers aren't despairing. While none of their methods were able to "make [new] attacks impossible" in <em>Go</em>, their strategies were able to plug up unchanging "fixed" exploits that had been previously identified. That suggests "it may be possible to fully defend a <em>Go</em> AI by training against a large enough corpus of attacks," they write, with proposals for future research that could make this happen.</p>
<p>Regardless, this new research shows that making AI systems more robust against worst-case scenarios might be at least as valuable as chasing new, more human/superhuman capabilities.</p>

As I’ve documented already, I’ve recently been making my way through <em>FF14</em>’s many expansions and haven’t quite made it to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-players-thirsty-bakool-ja-ja-1851580847&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-players-thirsty-bakool-ja-ja-1851580847"><em>Dawntrail</em></a></span><em> </em>yet. Post-expansion patch quests are nothing new. As expansions typically have two to three years between them, the team at Square Enix doles out smaller story and content updates to tide players over. With past expansions, these patch quests have often worked in two parts. The first wraps up the story of the preceding expansion and the second sets up the next. For <em>Endwalker</em>’s<em> </em>patch quests, the team had a unique opportunity to buck that formula, since the expansion’s release served as its own finale and an ending to the overarching Hydaelyn-Zodiark saga of the MMO’s past ten years. That meant that the <em>Endwalker </em>patch quests could be their own contained story.</p><p>The new freedom turns the post-<em>Endwalker</em> quests into a mini-expansion of its own. They introduce new characters, locales, dungeons, and a big bad for Warriors of Light to deal with. But, so as not to start entirely from scratch, the story deals with the Void, a world engulfed by darkness that has come up from time to time in the past. It’s a setting that has always seemed prime for an expansion, and while this isn’t quite that, the smaller approach works to its benefit.</p><figure id="" data-id="0f188497243d3144b3435e6c1a75fcd3" data-recommend-id="image://0f188497243d3144b3435e6c1a75fcd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1215" data-height="683" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A floating castle sits within a purple void" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A floating castle sits within a purple void" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f188497243d3144b3435e6c1a75fcd3" data-recommend-id="image://0f188497243d3144b3435e6c1a75fcd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1215" data-height="683" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A floating castle sits within a purple void" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Void is a world lost. Now engulfed by darkness and ravaged by beasts corrupted by that power, it is effectively beyond saving. It’s a contrast to so much of what we have encountered in the past of <em>FF14</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers-the-kotaku-review-1838105413&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers-the-kotaku-review-1838105413"><em>Shadowbringers</em></a></span><em> </em>introduced us to a world called the First, which was engulfed by light and on the brink of death, but could be pulled back with our help. Here, however, we are confronted with a world that our endless heroics can not do much for. It is there that we encounter one of its denizens, Zero. Like the other inhabitants of the void she is cursed to a deathless existence. In the years since her world was lost she has shed many of her memories, and her humanity with it. When we first meet Zero she is a cold, uncaring person who has something in common with <em>Endwalker</em>’s antagonist; both see existence as an endless cycle of suffering with little to justify it. Yet because she cannot die, Zero can’t get the rest she yearns for.<br></p><p>The bulk of the post-<em>Endwalker</em> patch quests see us dragging Zero around as we try to rescue an ally from the Void while also managing recovery efforts after the nearly-avoided apocalypse on our own world. In contrast to the entire MMO’s story up to that point, the <em>Endwalker </em>patches relegate your hero, the Warrior of Light, to a supporting role. This is Zero’s story, and it’s a good one. After spending an entire expansion filled with existential dread and defeatism, helping someone who has given up hope for a better life is incredibly cathartic. It’s basically a story about learning the power of friendship, a cliché idea if ever there was one, but it does this with sharp writing and wonderful character moments for its leading lady, and let’s be real, <em>Final Fantasy</em> has never been subtle with its themes.</p><p>The story also parallels Zero’s journey with that of the people of your world. In life, Zero was a loner who believed she could not trust anyone and had to work to save the world on her own. It’s the same problem that the patch quests’ primary villain has, but it’s also one that everybody trying to get back to a normal life is going through. This is best exemplified when you visit the people of Garlemald, a now-fallen nation that long served as the MMO’s evil empire. Now, they’re under occupation from you and your allies, and while you have the best intentions, they’re not so willing to accept your aid. Both sides need to put aside their pride to move forward together, as it is the only way they can both rebuild. The situation has a profound effect on Zero, who reflects on her own choice to turn down the help of a pair of heroes hoping to stave off the end of their world before it became the Void.</p><figure id="" data-id="c0de45092ddf8fc0048cc6944a407cc1" data-recommend-id="image://c0de45092ddf8fc0048cc6944a407cc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1183" data-height="665" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zero stands in awe within a glowing blue cavern" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zero stands in awe within a glowing blue cavern" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0de45092ddf8fc0048cc6944a407cc1" data-recommend-id="image://c0de45092ddf8fc0048cc6944a407cc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1183" data-height="665" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zero stands in awe within a glowing blue cavern" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ultimately it’s revealed that the surviving member of the duo she encountered so long ago is the arc’s big villain, Golbez. It’s a poignant moment for Zero, in which she realizes how much her closed-off way of life has impacted those around her. She isn’t responsible for the Void entirely, but she does feel a new sense of guilt and missed opportunity. If only she could have reached out a hand back then. The patch quests don’t quite stick the landing in their predictable end to the conflict at play, but as a character study of Zero, it excels. When Zero is finally able to bring a spark of light to the Void, it’s a reflection of how we have brought a spark of hope into her life as well.</p><p>Though there’s only about half as many quests here, they convey a sense of narrative impact and adventure worthy of a full <em>Final Fantasy 14 </em>expansion. Following <em>Endwalker</em>,<em> </em>I almost hoped that smaller, more focused stories became the new norm for the MMO. Of course, that isn’t what happened, and right now thousands of players are exploring the grand new expansion, <em>Dawntrail</em>. But based on what I’ve been hearing about its structure, it may at times feel more like you’re playing a series of episodic mini-expansions, and to me, that sounds like a good thing. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the past 14 years, Perry has been having trouble finding relevance in a pop space where she was once dominant, and that could not be more clear after today, July 12, as she released her new single “Woman’s World.” The “anthemic” pop song is getting raked across the coals online.

It’s meant to be empowering, and it mostly just ends up being Perry saying a bunch of adjectives and platitudes. It’s a toothless, juvenile song that only got worse as the truth of its creation was revealed. When it came out that Dr. Luke, the same man who has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.as.com/entertainment/katy-perry-to-release-new-song-womans-world-lyrics-and-comments-about-dr-luke-collaboration-n/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.as.com/entertainment/katy-perry-to-release-new-song-womans-world-lyrics-and-comments-about-dr-luke-collaboration-n/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused of assaulting women like fellow pop star Kesha</a></span> and being misogynistic and predatory toward women in the industry, was a writer and producer for the song, the entire pro-woman anthem became a laughing stock of the internet. There are six writers on “Woman’s World” and four of them are men.</p><p>The music video that also launched today is pretty nonsensical. “Woman’s World” is the kind of shit you’ll hear on women’s razor commercials, but when it’s not cashing in on the most cliched and generic feminist imagery, it’s leaning into a strange, absurdism like Perry filling her ass with unleaded gas. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.themarysue.com/who-is-trisha-paytas/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.themarysue.com/who-is-trisha-paytas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Controversial YouTuber Trisha Paytas</a></span> is here, for some reason and drives Perry around in a monster truck, then the singer is airlifted out of a random girl’s backyard by a helicopter as the onlooker just screams “who are you” at her.

In fairness, that’s true, if you look at songs like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGJuMBdaqIw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGJuMBdaqIw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Firework”</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CevxZvSJLk8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CevxZvSJLk8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Roar,”</a></span> but those songs were far more effective thanks to their specificity. “Firework” was a queer anthem in the 2010s because it spoke specifically to finding the light inside oneself despite hardship. “Roar” works when it’s speaking to how power dynamics in relationships can make us small and about reclaiming your space. “Woman’s World” essentially boils down to “women exist,” while also propping up one of the most prominent known abusers in the music industry.</p><p>But “Electric,” the 2021 <em>Pokémon</em> anthemic pop song, was all of those things.</p><p>I’m a total mark because while some might call the song cheesy, I get a little choked up listening to it and watching the music video with Perry and her partner Pikachu. The two time travel to an earlier point in their lives when Perry was younger and trying to make it in music, though her Pikachu was a Pichu at the time. The duo helps their younger selves get past a rut in their respective careers. It’s all very sweet, actually. It would’ve been great for a future version of her and Pikachu to have stopped the sequence of events that had her collaborating with a known abuser and putting out the most half-hearted swing at a feminist anthem as she attempts a comeback.<br></p><p>We reached out to Perry’s Pikachu for comment and she said, “Pika, piiiiiiikaaaa” with a bewildered expression.</p><p>But that disappointment is how I feel listening to most of Perry’s music. <em>Teenage Dream </em>is legitimately one of the most important pop records of the modern era and the falloff has been disastrous to watch unfold. Her next album, <em>143</em>, launches on September 20. Hopefully, there is something to redeem it after this shitshow.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia is expected to be launching its GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card this year, and rumors are starting to circulate about just how powerful these GPUs will be. And the latest involves the base clock speed of the flagship 5000 series GPU.</p>



<p>According to a known leaker on the Chiphell forums (h/t to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/rumor-geforce-rtx-5090-base-clock-nears-2-9-ghz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videocardz</a>), the RTX 5090 will have a base clock of nearly 2.9 GHz. That’s a 30% increase from the 2.23 GHz of the RTX 4090. It even beats out the RTX 4090’s boost speed of 2.52 GHz.</p>



<p>There was no mention of a potential boost clock for the GPU. </p>



<p>In addition to the base clock claims, the RTX 5090 is rumored to feature a 448-bit memory bus with a bandwidth of 1568 GB/s and 28GB of GDDR7 memory. </p>

<p>Nvidia has yet to confirm any of these rumors regarding the RTX 5090, and refuse to comment on any “rumor or speculation”. The RTX 5000 series is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2024/04/09/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-5080-expected-to-launch-late-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reportedly on tap</a> to start launching in late 2024.</p>

But more importantly, they pave the way for me to write a blog I’ve been meaning to write for years, about video games that have the same name.</p><p>First, the memes: “JUST IN: Biden reportedly confused THE OUTER WORLDS for THE OUTER WILDS!!” wrote <a href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1811583174637437120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter user Radec</a>, in a widely-reposted tweet. Other good jokes include Biden imaginarily mixing up “<a href="https://x.com/TheofficialJugg/status/1811755355816227035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em> and <em>Fire Emblem: Three Heroes</em></a>,” “<a href="https://x.com/airbagged/status/1811747633217593489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gone Home</em> and <em>Grow Home</em></a>,” and “<a href="https://x.com/siegmeyer161/status/1811702494097031528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> and <em>Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake</em></a>.”</p><p>Now, let’s undertake the more important task of making this historical moment about me. Ever since <em>Outer Worlds</em> came out a few months after <em>Outer Wilds</em>, part of my job as an editor at Kotaku became find-replacing the words “wilds” or “worlds” in everyone’s blogs about one or the other game. The games couldn’t be more different, but it’s impossible not to mix these two titles up. I was even amused to see that Google suggests “people also search for <em>The Outer Worlds</em>” when I Googled <em>Outer Wilds</em>. (I literally mixed them up writing that last sentence!)</p><p>After <em>Outer Worlds</em>, I started keeping a list of other video games that have the same title. That list is sadly lost to failing to save it from my Kotaku docs when I left, but here’s what I can recreate of it from memory, as well as some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videogames/comments/16fve4m/what_video_game_titles_do_you_always_confuse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggestions</a> from Reddit:</p><ul><li><span><em>Warframe</em> and <em>Warface</em></span></li><li><span><em>Battlefield</em> and <em>Battlefront</em></span></li><li><span><em>Gloomhaven</em> and <em>Gloomwood</em></span></li><li><span><em>Deadlight</em>, <em>Dead by Daylight,</em> and <em>Dying Light</em></span></li><li><span><em>God of War</em> and <em>Gears of War</em></span></li><li><span>The fact that there are two <em>Star Wars Battlefronts</em> and once when writing a blog mentioning them I used a picture of the wrong one and the commenters tore me to shreds</span></li><li><span>“AC” being either <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> or <em>Animal Crossing</em> (or <em>Armored Core</em>)</span></li><li><span>“DS” being either <em>Death Stranding</em>, <em>Dead Space</em>, or <em>Dark Souls</em></span></li></ul><p>This is all to say nothing of the games that you mix up based on looks, plot, or vibes. I can’t draw any grand conclusion about video games (or politics) from this; lots of games are about the same thing, and there are only so many words you can put into a title, though lord knows video games love to make you say nonsense words out loud when you’re looking for them at the store.&nbsp;</p><p>I tend to find Biden’s verbal stumbles largely harmless, especially for someone who struggles with stuttering, but I’m with my pals at <a href="https://www.discourseblog.com/p/the-president-does-not-deserve-our" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discourse Blog</a> that we are not under any obligation to cut him some slack here–while everybody ages, everybody is not the President. I have been putting off calling my ride-or-die Democrat mom ever since the debate, but this is a good reminder that I should do that. Please put your favorite video game title mixups in the comments so I’ll have something to laugh about after she and I get into a fight.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>Though Yars Rising pays tribute to its Atari roots with arcade-style hacking games, puzzles, action-packed gameplay, and anime-style character art help the game establish a new, modern identity.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Okay, I'll admit it: Outside of my brief love affair with Galaga and the small bit of Frogger I played as a child, I've never meaningfully engaged with the vast majority of arcade games. It's my weakest area in terms of video game genres I'm knowledgeable in and as such, I walked into my appointment to play Yars Rising only minimally aware of its first entry and the impact it had at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">Upon its release in 1982, Yars' Revenge--the first entry in the Yars series--became the highest-grossing original title for the Atari 2600. It's been included in more than a few Atari classics collections, a handful "Greatest Games of All-Time'' lists, and a display on video game history at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Though part of its popularity was due to Atari's status as a video game powerhouse at the time--thus giving the studio the necessary resources to actually promote Yars' Revenge and build "hype,'' as we'd call it here in the year 2024--it was also just an incredibly solid sci-fi shooter.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, despite its success, a follow-up to Yars' Revenge (a rail-shooter called Yar's Revenge) didn't emerge for nearly three decades and was largely met with disdain--<a href="https://issuu.com/michelfranca/docs/retro_gamer____153#google_vignette" rel="nofollow ">even from series creator Howard Scott Warshaw</a>. But after <em>another</em> decade--and another stab at regniting the Yars fandom with Yars: Recharged--Atari has recruited a new studio, Shantae and River City Girls developer WayForward, to help revitalize the series. The first challenge for WayForward? Steering Yars away from flies and aliens and into a new, flashier direction. And based on my time spent with the upcoming reiteration, I feel confident that it's going to nail it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332732-yr_screen9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332732" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332732-yr_screen9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332732"></a><figcaption>Emi takes on a robot lurking at QoTech.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332732-yr_screen9.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rather than stick to Yars' arcade-shooter roots, Yars' Rising reimagines the game as a cyberpunk metroidvania. However, the game still honors its past by incorporating arcade games throughout the game via terminals that protagonist Emi "Yar" Kimura must hack in order to enhance her abilities and gain new powers. This creates the main gameplay loop as well as that metroidvania feel, as new powers mean access to new locations that were previously just out of reach.</p><p dir="ltr">It becomes very easy to feel like Samus Aran herself as you traverse the futuristic QoTech laboratory--crouching, wall-jumping, and blasting your way through obstacles and enemies--although I'd say, from what I saw, Yars lacks the same tension, complex puzzles, and hyper-satisfying sense of progression and traversal as many other titles in the genre, for better or worse. In many ways, it feels like a great starting point for people who are newer to the genre: You have fast-paced arcade minigames that require decent reflexes and add challenge (particularly for those of us who grew up after their time), some light 2D platforming and combat, and that sense of accomplishment of unlocking a new power and knowing precisely what to do with it. But where Yars Rising truly shines is in its overall aesthetic.</p><p dir="ltr">It comes as little surprise that WayForward knows how to make a game feel stylish and lively, and this is what chiefly sets the game apart from other 2D action-adventure games. Yars Rising kicks off with a comic-style opening--an homage to the Yars comic series that was released shortly after the original game--in which our Ramona Flowers-esque protagonist, Emi, frantically dresses and leaves her house to work at a job she hates. It's easy to adore Emi immediately, with her spunky attitude and outfit to match, but she's not the only lovable character in Yars Rising.</p><p dir="ltr">During the 40 or so minutes I played, I met several cute, anime-inspired characters that I am positive others will thirst for; I myself was not immune to Mrs. Davidson's good looks, pink hair, and arrogant attitude. Nearly all the game's characters boast colorful hair, stylish techwear, and bold personalities, and alongside the game's neon-lit levels and bouncy techno-pop music, this creates an overall peppy and energetic-feeling to the game. Considering your main goal is to take down a corrupt and oppressive company, it feels like a fun and very conscious choice to keep things a bit more light-hearted and anime-esque. So while the gameplay might be familiar, there was enough style and playful banter to give Yars Rising its own sense of identity and keep me engaged.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332731-yarsrising-officialannouncementtrailer0-20screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4332731" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332731-yarsrising-officialannouncementtrailer0-20screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4332731"></a><figcaption>The world of Yars Rising</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332731-yarsrising-officialannouncementtrailer0-20screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Yars Rising also implements a fun system that Nier Automata fans will automatically recognize and was a very intentional pull from the sci-fi action game, according to the developers I spoke with. Emi is able to Biohack herself and equip upgrades by inserting Tetris-like blocks--each one representing a different ability--into a slotted grid. Powers and upgrades will vary in size and shape, with more simplistic powers taking up one block of space whereas more complex powers are made up of multiple blocks in a more difficult-to-place shape. Something else I really enjoyed was how even small features--such as the ability to listen to music--were dependent upon equipping the right upgrade (in this case, Emi's Earbuds).</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, I had a great time playing Yars Rising. While I didn't get the sense that it was anything particularly novel or challenging, it was a fun experience that left me wanting to see even more of Emi's world and the cute characters who inhabit it. Yars Rising is slated to come to PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on September 10, 2024.</p>

            <p>
80s movie favourite The Karate Kid is being turned into a 16-bit-style side-scrolling beat-'em-up, and it's heading to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 20th September this year.
</p>
<p>
The Karate Kid: Street Rumble comes from GameMill Entertainment, the publisher behind Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and is firmly setting its sights on the 80s era of Karate Kid rather than Netflix's Cobra Kai continuation - which has already spawned two games itself.
</p>
<p>
Street Rumble is, somewhat surprisingly, only the second game to be directly based on the 80s movie series (the first, Atlus' NES action game The Karate Kid, arrived in 1987) and promises to feature a whole bunch of familiar faces as its 80s-set mulitplayer action unfolds.

<p>
As per Street Rumble's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-karate-kid-street-rumble-a-pixel-art-beat-em-up-announced-for-pc-and-consoles">IGN reveal</a>, Daniel Russo, Mr. Miyagi, Kumiko, and Ali Mills are all playable across the game's 12 belt-scrolling-style stages, for instance, while the likes of Johnny Lawrence, John Kreese, and Terry Silver will feature as foes.
</p>
<p>
There's not a lot else to report at present, but The Karate Kid: Street Rumble is scheduled to release for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and Steam on 20th September - and you'll find some gamplay footage in the reveal trailer above.
