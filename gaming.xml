            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/taliesin-jaffe-talks-asha-of-critical-role-downfall-monk-builds-and-what-ashton<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role Campaign 3 has begun airing its three-episode prequel special titled <em>Critical Role Downfall</em>. Set in the far past this adventure is the memories of the city of Aeor before it's fall. We had a chance to talk with Taliesin Jaffe earlier this week to learn about his character Asha, her role in Downfall, and how the events of this prequel could affect Ashton of Bells Hells.</p>
<p><em>Critical Role Downfall</em> covers episodes 99-101 of Campaign 3. The game is being DM'd by <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b853d22b-df8b-43ab-afaf-0e3829194c09" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/brennan-lee-mulligan-discusses-sean-finnerty-importance-of-laughing-at-fear-and">Brennan Lee Mulligan</a>&nbsp;(<em>Dimension 20, Game Changer</em>) who previously worked with Critical Role for Calamity. Joining Jaffe at the table are fellow co-creators of Critical Role Laura Bailey (<em>Critical Role, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="feb0b551-7fe5-4f74-9986-717a95c8865c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us: Part II</a></em>) and Ashley Johnson (<em>Critical Role, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="feb0b551-7fe5-4f74-9986-717a95c8865c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us: Part II</a></em>), as well as Noshir Dalal (<em>Star Wars: The Bad Batch, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a1550c58-472a-4d2d-93f5-1d2835ab0eaa" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mortal-kombat-1-preview">Mortal Kombat 1</a></em>), Nick Marina (<em>Cobra Kai, Chicago Med</em>), and Abubakar Salim (<em>House of the Dragon, Tales of Kenzera</em>).</p>
<p>As someone who absolutely loved but was scarred by the events of Critical Role Calamity I first wanted to know how Jaffe had felt knowing that he was entering a similar kind of situation with Brennan Lee Mulligan helming the story. "Boy, I was really excited"</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//bsS-aGTq-_4"></iframe></p>
<p>"I'm full enough of myself that I'm very rarely intimidated by other human beings [...] so I knew he was going to bring something very challenging and I was really glad that I was picked for this," Jaffe continued to explain "This kind of thing is my jam"</p>
<p>Later on in our discussion Jaffe hoped that viewers of episode 2 will realise that "Brennan is so cruel and mean, but in a good way. He's very good at finding the specific aspects of our characters that matter to us and really hurting us with that, on a fundamental level"</p>
<h2>Asha, Mortal Aspect Of The Wild Mother</h2>
<p>In talking about Asha Jaffe revealed that playing as a mortal aspect of the Wild Mother wasn't his first choice. "At one point I asked if I could be a Betrayer God because I've got a great idea"</p>
<p>After pitching some of those ideas to Matthew Mercer, the creator of the world of Critical Role, Mercer explained that there were a lot of 'lore things' that were unknown to Jaffe.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asha-cr-downfall_0.jpg?itok=yBcy4wde 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asha-cr-downfall_0.jpg?itok=upLIOqTF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"I had a Moonweaver idea and just seeing the way the cast was coming together, and Brennen was very much like 'can you find a different opinion going into it?', especially with Noshir coming in with [The Emissary] it was great because it was essentially the same opinion from two very different vantage points. My take on the Wild Mother has always been a little weird"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was glad to come in and take the essential philosophy I had been putting forward with Caduceus and make a version of what I call 'Perhaps I didn't make myself clear'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing the animalistic take on the Wild Mother I noted that the performance Jaffe was giving was accentuating the 'Wild' whereas previous times we've been given a glimpse of the power of the Wild Mother - Especially for Campaign 2 characters Fjord (Travis Willingham) and Caduceus (Jaffe) - she has seemed more mothering.</p>
<p>The quick and simple response I received was that she is nurturing "when things are better"</p>
<p>Talking about what Asha and the Wild Mother were doing prior to the events of Downfall Jaffe revealed "Things are not great, she doens't have a lot of followers and even the natural world [...] is kind of gone or dead"</p>

<p>"Backstory that doesn't really get hit up [Asha] found herself a little patch of forest, hidden away. It is the 100 Acre Woods or the 'Mad Max Thunderdome' little chunk of forest and that's where the food that they're bringing in is from. She's basically started up a cult and that's where those people are. People who wander in are like Tthis is what I want' and she's like 'Great, you live by my rules and if you fuck up I kill you."</p>
<p>Taking on the form of the Wolf was also a deliberate result of the kind of world that the Gods are facing pre-Downfall. As a Wolf Asha is able to take action and it serves to remove that level of compassion and empathy for the human world.</p>
<h2>What Is Asha's Dungeons &amp; Dragons Build?</h2>
<p>Wanting to know a bit more about how Asha was built mechanically I wanted to hear from Jaffe what type of elf she was, being a wolf normally but Wild Shaping into an Elf. Asking whether she was a Lythari Elf Jaffe clarified "No, her actual incarnated for is basically a wolf or direwolf. I essentially dropped one of the feat options of my level 20 build and took what was a Wild Shape but could only do one thing which was to Wild Shape into an Elven form at will as a matter of convenience."</p>
<p>Jaffe began to describe the different situations where Asha would be aware that being humanoid would be easier to get by in comparison to a Wolf. He also revealed that when Asha does "talk it is slow and broken. It's not a muscle that works very well. I don't know if that reads as often as I like but it's almost entirely telepathic.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I essentially dropped one of the feat options of my level 20 build and took what was a Wild Shape"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As regular listener of Critical Role I had remembered Jaffe in the past stating that they had a Monk cooked up for the next EXU. I only got part way into my question before Jaffe cut in to let me know that while Asha is a Monk, Asha isn't the Monk he'd been thinking about.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asha-introduction.jpg?itok=TKc-D_pP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asha-introduction.jpg?itok=C75SokKQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Taliesin introduces Asha to the table and the viewers, the binary on her passport reads NATURE</figcaption></figure><p>"That was one of my pitches, that Monk, but I was given a lot of reasons not to do that. I'm going to save them for a future game. That Monk is still going to come along but this was definitely 'I wanted to, but no'"</p>
<p>Wanting to dive more into the mechanics of Asha's build Jaffe played his explanation very close to the chest. He decided that he didn't want to reveal which subclass she was a part of, and not remembering whether her very specific weapon was revealed in Episode 2 or 3 he didn't touch on that either.</p>
<p>"Other than a weapon, that I kind of homebrewed, and not even a very complex one the whole notion [of Asha] was somebody who is very grounded."</p>
<p>Where other gods in the party would be able to show off divine powers for Asha he wanted to make a character that was "cool, not necessarily in a God-level way, but more in a Jackie Chan or Stephen Chow way. It's really being more grounded that anyone else in the group."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's nothing anyone on the outside would see and say 'What is that?' It's like 'oh, this is a very dangerous woman'"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A Short Story With A Definitive End</h2>
<p>Stepping away from a character that he's been playing since October 2021 Jaffe and I discussed the differences in making a character for such a short adventure. Discussing this we talked about how there isn't room for events to occur and for them to grow with your character Jaffe also added that "Gods don't change really. They are what they are."</p>
<p>"Giant archetype characters, I really love, just because they're immutable. It's hard to change a fundamental notion of the universe but figuring out how to make sure I wasn't always going to be on the same path and could be swayed one way or the other was hard"</p>
<p>There was a definite appeal for Jaffe in just the experience of playing a character at Level 20, something very rare in most Dungeons &amp; Dragons games.</p>
<h2>What Of Taliesin Can Fans Find In Asha</h2>
<p>Jaffe is known to put aspects that are true to him into his characters. For Ashton, it is his character's chronic pain and how that's shaped him, for Asha I wanted to know what part of him was most true within.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mighty-nein-and-caduceus.jpg?itok=TDjsOE03 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mighty-nein-and-caduceus.jpg?itok=hIshH8Lh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Caduceus was a Firbolg Cleric of the Wild Mother from Campaign 2 of Critical Role</figcaption></figure><p>"It's a chunk of what Caduceus was, and perhaps it's a bit of a teenage reaction to being raised by hippies" Jaffe explained "That soft Earth Mother archetype is wonderful, don't get me wrong, but not necessarily my experience of nature."</p>
<p>He then paraphrased a quote from Stephen Fry "People seem to forget that it is in nature without human intervention, nature in it's purest form is all life on Earth leaves a life of starvation and dies violently and that is Nature."</p>
<p>Taking that mentality Jaffe joked that "Caduceus was his nice way of explaining that, and Asha is his mean way of saying it."</p>
<h2>A Family Of Gods</h2>
<p>Having spoken about Asha for some time I wanted to dive into the relationship that she has with others at the table. Talking specifically about the meeting between the Prime Deities and the Betrayer Gods at the end of episode 1 I commended everyone on their ability to play such a convincing family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked what kind of prep work was done to establish these relations I once again got a short but sweet answer, "none."</p>
<p>Jaffe continued "Roleplayers roleplaying and I can see what Brennan didn't want us to play Betrayer Gods. Honestly, all of us did the 'Can we be a Betrayer God?' but that was quickly squashed."</p>

<p>"I had never really given much thought on the gods as people in Exandria, and treating them more as a family, I don't know how it hadn't occurred to me that they have personality, that they are more of a roman/greecian pantheon."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Years of D&amp;D have numbed me to the notion that Gods are just engines for Paladin"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While he's been playing D&amp;D since High School Jaffe explained that Gods in the games have always felt just like additional rules and that he never really enjoyed the way that they interfaced into the game. "This is the first time I'm going 'Oh wow, these guys are actually cool. How have I not known this for over a decade?"</p>
<p>"I realized also that Asha had a favorite sibling and that they were a Betrayer God and I was like 'oh my god, this is weird that I'm suddenly having this very intense love for one of the characters.'"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Honestly, I wish we'd had nine more episodes. This is three episodes and I want to spend more time with each character including the NPC"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Active Listening Makes A Good D&amp;D Player</h2>
<p>Noticing Jaffe moving as Asha even when the audience might not notice amid other conversations I asked how he feels remaining in character enhances his performance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/taliesin-jaffe-facial-reaction-critical-role-downfall.jpg?itok=s2Nq6dUH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/taliesin-jaffe-facial-reaction-critical-role-downfall.jpg?itok=p-4gbaDb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jaffe embodies Asha as he focuses on active speakers with a 'Wild' look</figcaption></figure><p>"It's Active Listening, there's nothing worse for a D&amp;D game that people who don't listen," Jaffe talked on experiences of poetry readings in coffee houses where poets would leave as soon as their part was over. "You're supposed to be participating. You should be the audience you want. 90% of being a player at a D&amp;D table is being the audience for your friends and that's more important, at least for me."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"90% of being a player at a D&amp;D table is being the audience for your friends"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jaffe continued to explain that the importance of engaging when you're part of the audience isn't just to show interest but without paying attention "you're not going to be as interesting, you're not going to have enough to say, you're not going to be able to relate to these people"</p>
<p>"I also love physicality for characters, being in that mindspace means you're sitting there forming opinions, forming notions of the things you want to do with the other players, the things you want to say."</p>
<p>Joking about his specific situation at the Critical Role table Jaffe also added "Especially when you're at a table with people who are really talented it's really easy to look like an idiot"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/taliesin-jaffe-in-costume.jpg?itok=ZauEFq61 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/taliesin-jaffe-in-costume.jpg?itok=wvVKtZwr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Taliesin Jaffe emerging in costume at The Greek for Episode 98 of Critical Role Campaign 3</figcaption></figure><h2>What Does Ashton of Bells Hells Think Of Downfall?</h2>
<p>Ashton, one of Bells Hells most cynical critics of the Gods, is another active viewer of the events of Downfall. Talking on how Ashton might be processing the revelations of this three episode event Jaffe admitted "I didn't know until we actually got there, it was such an intense experience for me that relating it to [Ashton] is hard"</p>
<p>"Ashton has been really trying to fix the things that are fucking up their life because there's not enough time left to blow up [his] life three more times."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I don't even know how to answer that because I'm still working it out myself"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having to decide on some semblance of an answer Jaffe remarked "It definitely both made things worse and better. [...] Is it better that you know the Gods are people or is it worse?"</p>
<p>While not revealing much for the conclusion of Downfall Jaffe did simply state that there will be some "interesting moments" before bursting out into laughter that he simply didn't know how else to put it.</p>

What drew you to bring horror to racing?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For those who don’t know, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nightmare Kart</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was originally a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fan game before it was rebranded. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had a community in-joke about a kart racer spin-off, and that’s where I got the inspiration from!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What interesting elements did horror bring to the idea of a racing game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I loved how a health bar changed the entire feel of the game. Most kart racers don’t have health, so seeing racers get beat up by power-ups before exploding in a gruesome death definitely contributed to the game’s identity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>In what ways do you feel this mechanic alters the emotions players go through while playing? How does it alter the feel of the racing play compared to other racing games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The simple act of having a health bar that can result in death in a kart racer makes it feel more visceral. It makes players feel more fragile, seeing as a death sends them to the back of the pack or gives them a Game Over during boss fights.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nightmare Kart</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> offers an array of grisly beings and unsettling beasts as racers. Can you tell us a bit about how you designed the various characters and the opponents we race against?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The enemies that weren’t directly inspired by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were pulled from the "generic Halloween spooky" side of culture. Things like walking skeletons, mummies, or evil corvids felt appropriate.</span></p><p>Images via LWMedia.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Likewise, what ideas went into creating the equally unique vehicles in the game? How did you create such a variety of vehicles that all felt on-theme?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each kart is "owned" by one of the characters. When I designed the karts, I designed them as an extension of the characters. For example, Mistress Marie, keeper of the clocktower, rides a clock-themed kart.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts go into creating unique karts based on the type of monster that rides them?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I viewed the kart that was assigned to each racer as an extension of them. Mistress Mary of the Great Clocktower needed a kart and making it clock-themed made sense! The Outsider’s story was that he restrained himself on an operating table before he turned into a werewolf, and that's where the operating table kart idea came from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>This game is not just about going fast, but also attacking your fellow racers. Can you tell us about how you chose the weapons for the game and how you developed them to be used and aimed by someone racing around complex tracks?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course! The first power-up that I made was the pistol. I liked the idea of using "rated M" weapons for a kart racer, as that is uncommon, and I wanted to make weapons that fit the horror theme. They, of course, were originally based on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> weapons, but even then, the idea of having a blood-soaked axe, a giant rusty razer, or a lever-action shotgun felt appropriate to the theme.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What ideas went into the other things players could do while rushing around (shooting beasts to increase speed, doing tricks, etc)?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of the ideas came from using </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-like mechanics and grafting them onto a kart racer. It was kind of like how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Smash Brothers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> uses the mechanical identity of their characters and translates them into a fighting game.</span></p><p>Images via LWMedia.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you tell us about some of the </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>-like mechanics you brought into this racing game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The countering system is what comes to mind immediately. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, attacking opens the player to countering by an enemy bullet. This means that randomly flailing around constantly is disincentivized and forces the player to be more considerate of their approach. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nightmare Kart</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it’s drifting that opens players up to countering via enemy bullets. Drifting is one of the core mechanics of kart racers, so it felt appropriate to make it vulnerable to countering in this "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-inspired" kart racer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into how the weapons would operate (aiming, firing) while racing around a track? What thoughts went into things like weapon effects, firing speeds, trajectories, and the like when your battle arena involves racing around complex tracks?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first power-up I made was the pistol. I wanted it to be similar to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which skipped manual aiming and simply had the hunter fire toward the lock-on target to keep the pace of combat from slowing down. Skipping manual aiming and having the racer shoot toward an auto-lock-on target also keeps the player focusing on racing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to deciding the balance of the power-ups and levels, it’s a simple example of testing the game over and over again and “adjusting the dials” (so to speak) when it comes to effects, speeds, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nightmare Kart</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> features boss battles as well. What ideas go into designing a boss fight in a horror racing game? How did you create interesting boss battles for your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The idea of boss battles was born from the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-like mechanical inspiration, but they also offered an opportunity to house all the unique ideas I had. Ideas like a platforming segment or a maze for players to get lost in (which normally wouldn’t work in the "race/battle mode" dichotomy the game exists within) could work in a boss fight, as those operate under a unique rule set.</span></p><p>Images via LWMedia.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horror is often dark and gloomy, but having to fire weapons and race around opponents requires visual clarity to know where to drive and shoot. How did you create a world that felt bleak and foreboding while preserving the visual clarity players would need to keep things from being frustrating?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Luckily, due to the dark environment, creating a gameplay overlay was relatively easy: just make it bright! The lock-on icon is a white glow, the power ups were white flares, guns shoot white bullets, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to use a PSX visual style for the game? How did this affect the look and feel of the experience? How did it affect the design of the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My previous game was a PSX demake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and seeing as this was originally </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-themed, the assets carried over from that project.

            <title><![CDATA[Maybe Game Demos Aren’t Always A Good Thing]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/game-demos-schim</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/maybe-game-demos-aren%E2%80%99t-always-a-good-thing.932004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-demos-schim<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in May, I wrote about <a href="https://aftermath.site/schim-demo-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the demo for shadow-platforming game <em>SCHiM</em></a>, a neat-looking indie game I’d been excited about for a while. The full game came out yesterday for PC and consoles; if you played the demo, it’s basically more of that. Maybe <em>too</em> much more, which is not something I expected to feel, and which is making me think a lot about the strengths and pitfalls of the recent glut of Steam demos.</p><p>I write a lot about <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/steam-next-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demos</a> on Aftermath. It’s not a beat I intended to create; instead, they’re a good way for me to cover a lot of games without spending a ton of time or money, two things that are in much shorter supply than they used to be now that I own my own site. I like that I can give readers hands-on impressions of smaller or unknown games that they can also check out, instead of writing up a press preview that has limited access and feeds into the marketing machine. And while I’m not in the business of telling anyone what their time or money is worth, I know that things are tough all over, so I appreciate that money won’t be a barrier to a reader checking out a demo I wrote about if they’re interested. And, apart from work, demos are a good way for me to get a sense of whether I might like a game that I’ve either been hearing about or stumbled across.</p><p>With events like Next Fest, Steam has been leaning hard into demos of late, which has definitely increased my awareness of them. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ajbqhx/why_do_demos_have_such_a_big_comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent thread on a game dev subreddit</a>, some developers said they found an increase in wishlists following demos, which help <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/wishlist#:~:text=A%3A%20Wishlists%20can%20be%20an,game%20is%20on%20their%20wishlist." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boost a game’s visibility</a>, or at least remind interested potential players when a game comes out. Others in the thread posited that demos can lead to press and influencer coverage that can help a game, or that demos have become more valuable as more players feel <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-days-before-this-day-in-the-day-before" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burned by games that don’t live up to their marketing hype</a>. Others, however, also saw downsides: that people get their fix of a game from its demo and don’t subsequently buy it, or that demos can hurt larger games, or those that already have strong marketing, more than they help. And that’s to say nothing of the fact that making a demo is <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/should-you-release-a-demo-for-your-game-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of work</a>, and that there’s no guarantee they’re <a href="https://aftermath.site/demo-trailer-e3-gamescom-pax-tgs-made" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an accurate representation</a> of a full game.</p><p>Which brings me back to <em>SCHiM</em>, a game I’d been excited about since its reveal and whose demo I really enjoyed. A quick recap: You play as a little shadow guy, which is a splotch with adorable googly eyes, who becomes detached from their person and has to find their way back to him. In the full game, you do that across 65 levels of various lengths by jumping from shadow to shadow. Hopping between stationary objects gives way to catching rides on passersby or cars, bouncing off signs or clotheslines, solving little environmental puzzles to create new shadows, or timing your jumps between flickering lights.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="SCHiM - Launch Trailer | PC &amp; Consoles" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4p8ZWSSAhXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The demo gave a glimpse of the narrative that, as a truncated slice, felt a little confusing. Seeing the full story, told wordlessly, made it compelling and surprisingly moving. You watch the person go through some struggles–a breakup, losing his job, going back to what I think is his hometown to recuperate–and it’s a relatable narrative premise that definitely made me feel for the person and want to see his story through.</p><p>But in terms of gameplay, you mostly do the same thing in the demo you do in the full game. This isn’t a knock–you would hope a demo would be an accurate slice!–but the trouble came for me once I realized that while <em>SCHiM</em>’s bigger levels are creative–traversing a giant automated factory, or exploring the different enclosures at a zoo–and they’re a lot of fun to move through, the game never quite does anything new with the core mechanic the demo shows off. After the first 20 or so levels showed me what the game had to offer, the experience started to feel draggy and repetitive. Despite the number of levels, the game itself only takes a handful of hours to complete, so it doesn’t quite wear out its welcome, but I found myself ready to be done with it far sooner than I expected to when I first booted up the full game, eager to have more of the experience I’d enjoyed so much in the demo.</p><p>When I imagined what I would tell a friend if they asked me about <em>SCHiM</em>, the first response that came to mind was, “The full game is cool, but you could really just play the demo.” It made me wonder if the demo actually hurt the full game for me, showing me the best of what <em>SCHiM</em> had to offer in a way that made the full game feel disappointing. Would I have been less dissatisfied with the shape of the game if the shortened experience of the demo hadn’t been so strong?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/developers-tell-us-why-early-access-games-are-better-than-ever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing popularity of early access games</a>, as players we know how we can burn ourselves out on a game or develop opinions on something that isn’t finished. Do demos have the same problem? Early access games are works-in-progress; while demos are as well, they’re also curated experiences, whether on Steam or at a convention or press event. Designing one is surely a careful balancing act between representing a game well and leaving players wanting more, a careful line to walk with pitfalls on both sides.</p><p>I still essentially enjoyed <em>SCHiM</em>; it’s charming and, as I wrote in May, “feels like <em>play</em> in the way games can sometimes lose sight of.” But it’s weird to feel like the demo was <em>better</em> than the full game, whose only major difference from the demo was that it was longer. For all a demo’s potential strengths, maybe it’s better to experience a game in its entirety once it’s ready, to have the experience developers are <em>actually</em> making and not one designed with the extraneous variables of marketing and Steam wishlists in mind.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-leak-rumor</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunt-showdown-sequel-possibly-leaked-via-esrb-rating.931983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-leak-rumor<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An ESRB listing has appeared for a game called&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, potentially suggesting that a sequel to the popular PvPvE shooter is in the works.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39965/hunt-showdown-1896/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rating</a>&nbsp;is, as you'd probably expect from a followup to&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em>, Mature 17+ owing to "blood and gore" and "violence". The listing also warns that the game will contain in-game purchases.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hunt-showdown">the first game</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, whatever it turns out to be, will be set in the Victorian era and will revolve around the use of "bladed bats, clubs, brass knuckles, and pistols" to kill both monsters and other players, according to the ESRB.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-swamp.jpg?itok=_coYu_jv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-swamp.jpg?itok=SBYM1xEA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hunt: Showdown&nbsp;</em>may well be getting a sequel soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The listing goes on to describe some pretty grisly things you'll be able to see and do in&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, including "cav[ing] in zombies' heads" and "cut[ting] off their limbs".</p>
<p>According to the ESRB, the game will feature a type of zombie that "explodes into blood and viscera when killed", as well as another one that wears "human skin as a cape". Well, we've all had some pretty extreme Friday nights, no?</p>
<p>I'm not a&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown&nbsp;</em>aficionado, but I'm pretty sure the aforementioned descriptions don't neatly fit any of the game's existing monsters, so&nbsp;<em>1896 </em>could&nbsp;be a followup or a new game rather than an expanded re-release of the original.</p>
<p>Sadly, we haven't had an official announcement from Crytek yet, so we'll have to fall back on speculation and this ESRB rating for now. Hopefully, we'll hear something more in the next few weeks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-spider.jpg?itok=-Pgq7WCV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-spider.jpg?itok=rdu0QTLQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>will presumably feature some new monsters.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>will, according to the ESRB page, launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S when it does arrive, although no release date is listed.</p>
<p>It is, of course, possible that this is the name Crytek is giving to the current-gen version of&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em>, which is due to arrive sometime after the PS4 and Xbox One versions are <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/hunt-showdown-to-sunset-on-ps4-xbox-one-from-15th-of-august" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sunsetted in August</a>.</p>
<p>That new version is set to <a href="https://www.crytek.com/news/hunt-showdown-reveals-upgrade-coming-15th-august-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bring an engine change</a>, UI improvements, and a new map to the game, among other things, although Crytek has already announced the relaunch without referring to it as&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>.</p>
<p>It's all to play for right now, so watch this space for any further information from Crytek. Until then, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/hunt-showdown/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/hunt-showdown/9ncmq9dxgxf6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hunt-showdown-review-bayou-bounty-blues">take a look at our review here</a> to see how it shakes out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201551/halo-paramount-plus-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount has canceled its live-action <em>Halo</em> series for Paramount Plus, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-2-seasons-1235952581/">according to <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-1236075994/#"><em>Variety</em></a>. But if you’re a fan of the show and want to see it continue, there’s a sliver of hope: both publications report that the show’s producers are shopping the series around, so perhaps there will be a third season. </p><p>The <em>Halo</em> show premiered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23132662/halo-tv-series-season-1-review-paramount-plus">in 2022</a> and ran for two seasons, with the second <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24063618/halo-season-2-premiere-review-paramount-plus">debuting earlier this year</a>. Pablo Schreiber starred as Master Chief.</p><p>“We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work,” Paramount said in a statement to <em>THR</em> and <em>Variety</em>. “We wish everyone the best going forward.”</p><p>The <em>Halo</em> show had its issues, primarily the fact that we never really got to see the titular Halo in any kind of detail. Some fans of the games could never get over the decision to show the Master Chief’s face throughout the majority of the show — something that’s never been done in the games. And some folks were <em>really</em> unamused by the romance subplot between the Chief and a human member of the alien Covenant, which included an unintentionally hilarious sex scene. </p><p>The show’s second season was a vast improvement over the first. The season’s first episode and its later depiction of the Fall of Reach — a major moment in the game series — really captured the harrowing yet valorous essence of the<em> Halo</em> games despite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22994651/paramount-plus-halo-tv-show-halo-lore">not strictly following the game’s canon</a>. Season 2 also added <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/10/24067616/pablo-schreiber-halo-season-two-paramount-plus">more depth to Schreiber’s Silver Team costars</a>, especially from Riz-028 (Natasha Culzac) and Vannak-134 (Bentley Kalu). The games have done a poor job of capturing the humanity of the people under all that power armor, and that was something <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/2/24087962/halo-paramount-plus-episode-five-aleria">the <em>Halo</em> TV series really excelled at</a>, despite all its other faults.</p><p>Hopefully, the showrunners will find a new home for the series to continue what’s been an interesting take on one of the most popular video game series of all time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to information from <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240712PD223/shipments-graphics-card-pc-market-msi.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DigiTimes</a>, the motherboard market is on pace to sell 38.8 million units in 2024 from the big four companies — ASUS, ASRock, Gigabyte, and MSI — out of Taiwan. That’s a 5% increase from the 36.8 million shipments from 2023, and a massive 25% increase from the 30.9 million shipments in 2022.</p>



<p>While it’s not going to hit the 42.7 million shipments from 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic was at it’s peak and people were looking for things to do, seeing the jump from 2022 can only be viewed as a win for manufacturers. It also comes alongside a jump in <a href="https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/shipments-of-graphics-add-in-boards-increase-for-third-quarter-in-a-row/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPU sales year-over-year</a> that saw a 32% increase as of Q4 2023. </p>



<p>These shipment increases are expected to continue as both AMD and Intel prepare to launch their next-generation CPUs. AMD is set to launch their new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-amd-ryzen-9000-cpus-are-already-at-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryzen 9000 series CPUs</a> later this month. Intel, on the other hand, has its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-next-intel-cpus-have-been-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrow Lake-S processors</a> coming in the fall.</p>

And in a major change, EA is paying athletes to be in the game as part of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals.</p><p>College Football 25 is available on console for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but not last-gen consoles, PC, or Nintendo Switch.</p><p>If you're just getting started with College Football 25, you may want to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-day-preorder-buying-guide/1100-6525115/" data-ref-id="1100-6525115">College Football 25 starter guide</a> that runs through all the key things to know.</p>

		<p>The indie hit horror game, The Mortuary Assistant, is coming to console with the expanded and enhanced Definitive Edition release.</p>
<p>The Mortuary Assistant – Definitive Edition will be available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch on 2nd August 2024. It will also be a free update for the PC version of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Mortuary Assistant - Definitive Edition" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnEMbIsyxiQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Launching for PC in 2022, The Mortuary Assistant gained a quick following for all its spooky, haunted vibes – this always goes down well with Twitch streamers.</p>
<p>The game puts you in the role of Rebecca Owens, a graduate in mortuary sciences and new apprentice at River Fields Mortuary, but as if having to work with corpses wasn’t already eerie and unsettling enough, it quickly becomes clear that the mortuary is afflicted by an otherworldly spirit or creature. A phone call from the mortician themself makes it clear that you’re now trapped inside and cannot leave.</p>

<p>There’s a bunch of new features and content for the Definitive Edition, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embalming only mode – embalm unlimited bodies</li>
<li>New Haunt Events</li>
<li>Additional Lore</li>
<li>New bodies to embalm</li>
<li>New Valentine’s Day seasonal event (Stop by the mortuary in February)</li>
<li>New achievements</li>
<li>Multiple Bug and Stability Fixes</li>
<li>Performance Improvements</li>
</ul>

            <p>
Atlus has released an official Persona 5 coffee line, so you can set up your own iconic Café Leblanc.
</p>
<p>
In collaboration with Jade City Foods, the coffee line includes three different roasts: the Café Leblanc dark roast, Phantom Thieves of Hearts medium roast, or Shujin Academy light roast.
</p>
<p>
The dark roast offers chocolate and caramel notes, the medium roast has fruity acidity, and the light roast has a cherry and chocolate flavour. All are available as whole beans or ground.

<p>

Café Leblanc serves as the base of operations for Persona 5's cast of Phantom Thieves, where the protagonist (Joker) can whip up a brew. It's well known for boosting your SP.
</p>
<p>
The café is also known for its curry, so it's fitting that Atlus is also releasing a line of hot sauces alongside the coffee.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
These sauces are - suitably - named after the game's fire spells (Agi, Agilao, Agidyne) as well as the characters Joker, Violet, and Crow. Flavours range from roasted jalapeno, to scotch bonnet, and reaper. 
</p>
<p>
Just be careful with those. As my mother always says, "a tickle on the tongue means a tingle on the bum".
</p>
<p>
All items are available on the <a href="https://jadecityfoods.com/">Jade City Foods website</a>: £15 per sauce, or £16 for a bag of coffee. It's US based but shipping is international. There are also bundles available for multiple items.

</p>
<p>
And if Persona 5 isn't your thing, there are other foods available based on the likes of Naruto, Cuphead, and Ghost in the Shell too.
</p>
<p>
Atlus itself is busy working on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-3-reload-episode-aigis-the-answer-will-release-in-september">Persona 3 DLC Episode Aigis</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atlus-gives-us-a-peek-at-rpg-metaphor-refantazios-story">forthcoming new RPG Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.

            <p>The Mortuary Assistant is finally coming to all consoles on 2nd August, 2024 – two years to the day the influential indie horror hit PC.</p>
<p>Called The Definitive Edition, the base game has been spruced up to include new haunts, bodies, embalming-only mode, and numerous stability and bug fixes.</p>

<p>In The Mortuary Assistant, you take on the role of Rebecca Owens, a newly graduated apprentice at River Fields Mortuary – but the job is not quite what it seems.</p>
<p>"Late one night you are called in to handle some embalmings," developer DreadXP teases. "When the Mortician, Raymond, calls the mortuary when you arrive, you soon realise this is a night like none other, and there’s no escape from the demonic forces plaguing the mortuary."</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-mortuary-assistant-is-getting-a-companion-piece-movie-adaptation">The Mortuary Assistant is getting the silver screen treatment</a>.</p>
<p>The indie horror - which has been a huge hit since it launched in August 2022 - was reportedly plucked for an adaptation before the full game released earlier this month.</p>
<p>Director Jeremiah Kipp says the film will be a "companion piece" to the game, and Kipp hopes to "retain the minimalist setting in and around the mortuary, the fascination with the process of embalming, and the nerve-shredding terror of the gameplay".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-hammerfell-setting/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Very little is currently known about The Elder Scrolls VI, but some recent findings may have provided a rather solid hint regarding the game's setting.</p>
<p>As spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TESVI/comments/1e6fxao/bethesda_employees_pinterest_account_is_still/#lightbox">Reddit</a> by nitsuaztnarf, an active Pinterest account from a Bethesda Game Studios employee contains a lot of pins for concepts for the upcoming new entry in the series. Judging from these pins, it definitely feels like the game will be set in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-hammerfell-targeting-2025/">Hammerfell</a>, a vast province located in the west of Tamriel, covered by jungles, wooded mountain ranges, subtropical grasslands, swamps, and deserts.</p>
<p>While this could have been a whole lot of nothing, what makes this The Elder Scrolls VI-related finding interesting is how the profile has been mostly pinning fantasy-related images and concepts since the release of Starfield, indicating these have been indeed pinned for the new entry in the series, and the fact that the profile was set to private a few hours after it was shared on Reddit, an attempt to hide something that wasn't supposed to be discovered.</p>
<p>Very little is known about The Elder Scrolls VI. The game was announced in 2018 together with Starfield, but it is still at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-five-years-away/">five years away</a>. According to Todd Howard, it will be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-ultimate-fantasy/"> ultimate fantasy world simulator</a>, so it should be a big step forward compared to its predecessor.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls VI is currently in development. A release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

<p>The highly anticipated Pirates of the Caribbean collaboration in Fortnite, which was launched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pirates-of-the-caribbean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier than expected</a>, is now officially underway. Players will receive the v30.20 hotfix for Fortnite today, introducing the content of the Cursed Sails event. This limited-time offering will be live until August 6, 2024; here’s more about the Cursed Sails Pass, Quests and other new content.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortnite players will obtain Cursed Sails Quests, which they must complete to earn rewards in the Cursed Sails Pass. Completing Cursed Sails quests will fetch players Cursed Gold. The quests have been divided into eight parts and will go live on alternate days between now and August 2.

Players can open the bottle to summon a cursed ship that can ram through opponents, builds, and the environment. Additionally, Pirate Cannons, the Flint Knock Pistol and other treasures have been unvaulted and can be found across the BR island.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- cache hit 99:single/related:87963907aecae3bbb7e1b88b4075e717 --><!-- empty -->
<p>The FTC says the across-the-board price increases that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/microsoft-asks-many-game-pass-subscribers-to-pay-more-for-less/">Microsoft recently announced</a> for its Xbox Game Pass subscription service tiers represent "exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged" when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/report-ftc-will-file-to-block-microsofts-69b-activision-blizzard-acquisition/">sought to block Microsoft's merger with Activision</a>. In <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453.121.0_1.pdf">a letter to the court</a> posted as part of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/ftc-appeal-in-microsoft-activision-case-shows-us-regulator-isnt-giving-up-yet/">an ongoing appeal by the FTC</a> in the case, the federal regulator alleges Microsoft's moves are a clear example of "product degradation" brought about by "a firm exercising market power post-merger."
</p><p>The letter's primary focus is on the soon-to-be-discontinued $10.99/month Console Game Pass tier. That's being replaced with a $14.99/month Game Pass Standard tier (a 36 percent price increase) that no longer includes "day one" access to all of Microsoft's first-party titles. To maintain that key benefit, "Console" subscribers will have to spend 81 percent more for the $19.99 Game Pass Ultimate tier, which also includes a number of additional benefits over the current $10.99/month option.</p>
<h2>Is this “based on the acquisition”?</h2>
<p>The FTC notes that these changes "coincide with adding <em>Call of Duty</em> to Game Pass’s most expensive tier." Previously, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/sony-calls-microsofts-3-year-call-of-duty-sharing-offer-inadequate/">Microsoft publicly promised</a> that this Game Pass access to Activision's ultra-popular shooter would come "with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>It's that "based on the acquisition" clause that's likely to give Microsoft some wiggle room in arguing for its planned pricing changes. Inflation is also a sufficient explanation for a large portion of the price increase in nominal terms—the $14.99 Microsoft charged for a month of Game Pass Ultimate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18296816/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscription-pricing-release-date-rumors">when it launched in 2019</a> is the equivalent of $18.39 today, according to <a href="https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=14.99&amp;year1=201906&amp;year2=202406">the BLS CPI calculator</a>. When Microsoft raised the Game Pass Ultimate monthly price from $14.99 to $16.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768400/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-increase">just last year</a>—just before the Activision merger was finalized—the company said in a statement it had "adjusted the prices to reflect the competitive conditions in each market."</p>
<p>Microsoft might have a harder time finessing the alleged "degradation" inherent in going from the discontinued Game Pass Console tier to the new, more expensive Game Pass Standard tier. True, the replacement does include the online multiplayer benefits of Game Pass Core, which could previously be purchased separately. But the removal of the long-promised day one access to first party games will heavily reduce the value most subscribers get from the new option.</p>
<p>It's now been over a year since the FTC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/ftc-appeal-in-microsoft-activision-case-shows-us-regulator-isnt-giving-up-yet/">first announced it intended to appeal</a> the ruling that effectively stopped <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/report-ftc-will-file-to-block-microsofts-69b-activision-blizzard-acquisition/">its attempted injunction</a> against the merger deal. While Microsoft and Activision have moved forward with their merger since then, courts <a href="https://www.crowell.com/en/insights/client-alerts/ftc-wins-reversal-in-whole-foods">have reversed similar mergers on appeal</a> even after a merger deal has fully closed.
</p><p>Elsewhere in its letter, the FTC makes note of previous arguments that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/microsoft-cancels-blizzard-survival-game-lays-off-1900/">Microsoft's recent round of nearly 2,000 Xbox-focused layoffs</a> is a sign of "reduced investments in output and product quality" post-merger.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> Grand Festival, a final Splatfest for their ink-splatting online shooter that will take place in September and run for an extended 72-hour period.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splatoon 3 – Grand Festival is coming! (Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TAZohLilNjM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Beginning on 13th September and running for three straight days:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start date &amp; time</strong> – Friday 13th September 1AM UK time</li>
<li><strong>End date &amp; time</strong> – Monday 16th September 00:59AM UK time</li>
</ul>
<p>The Grand Festival is the biggest ever Splatfest that the series has featured, and from the announcement trailer, it absolutely leans into that with a grand music festival taking place with all the music acts from the series to date dancing and singing on stage to a huge crowd.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s really all about the battling, and the three-way question that the Grand Festival will ask is: What is the most important to you? Past, Present or Future?</p>

<p>In a twist to the usual Splatfest questions, it’s the idol groups that will represent the three themes. The past is the Squid Sisters, the present is Off the Hook, and the future is Deep Cut.</p>
<p>The deep suspicion is that, as with the final Splatfest for Splatoon 2, the community-driven answer to this question will determine the future of the series. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/09/splatoon-2-final-splatfest-july-order-chaos/">Splatoon 2’s finale asked players to choose between order and chaos</a>, and with chaos winning, Splatoon 3 moved the story to a rather desolate new location of Splatsville, AKA the “City of Chaos”. If past or future win, we could see a potential Splatoon 4 go in some really wild new directions.</p>
<p>To mark the moment, Nintendo is also releasing <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1814212474263994518">two new sets of Splatoon amiibo</a> on 5th September: the Side Order Set featuring Pearl &amp; Marina, and the Alterna Set with recoloured Callie &amp; Marie.</p>
<p>It will be bittersweet to say goodbye to these regular events for the Splatoon community, and I admittedly regret not playing enough of the game in the past couple years, as good as the game is.&nbsp;For our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/07/splatoon-3-review/">Splatoon 3 review</a>, I wrote: “Splatoon 3 is a bit like your mum making your favourite meal when you head home for the holidays. It’s been a few years since the last game —&nbsp;while there have been some great improvements and additions, it’s the same old Splatoon we know and love, and that’s still pretty great.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-24-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.4 release date, along with some of the new content that's coming your way when the turn-based gacha RPG's latest update drops.</p>
<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-23-release-date">June's Version 2.3</a>, Version 2.4 arrives on July 31st, bringing with it a new map in the form of The Shackling Prison, along with the chance to recruit two new five-star characters into your team.</p>
<p>The Shackling Prison is a "formidable facility" whose entrance lies hidden beneath the water's surface. It's where Xueyi and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-reveals-new-playable-character-hanya">Hanya</a> carry out their duties, and it's also the home of many of the realm's most notorious criminals, not to mention wolflike monsters known as the Borisin.</p>

<p>First up is Yunli, a Physical-type swordswoman who follows the Path of Destruction. Her Counter ability allows her to deal damage to enemies when she's attacked, and she also gains access to a Parry state after using her ultimate, taunting enemies and reducing the damage she takes.</p>
<p>The second new character in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.4 is Jiaoqiu, a Fire-type foxian healer following the Path of Nihility. His attacks have a chance to burn enemies, and his ultimate exacerbates the effects of his regular attacks' burn.</p>
<p>These characters will debut during this Version, alongside reruns for five-star characters <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-five-star-character-huohuo">Huohuo</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-character-sparkle-and-she-goes-from-cute-to-crazy">Sparkle</a>.</p>

<p>HoYoverse has also announced a collaboration with the anime&nbsp;<em>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works</em>, which is due to debut some time in the third quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>Sadly, we don't know the details of that collaboration yet, but HoYoverse says more will be revealed in the coming weeks, so watch this space.</p>
<p>In the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.4 arrives on July 31st across <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
