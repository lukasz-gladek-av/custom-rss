    <article>
      <p>In a late December<a href="https://snscratchpad.com/posts/looking-ahead-2026/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>blog post</u></a> titled “Looking Ahead to 2026”, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote down some thoughts on how he and his company should approach the year ahead. Spoilers: it's almost entirely about AI, and it is some of the most unhinged stuff I have ever seen someone with a supposedly reputable job ever post on the internet.</p><p>He begins with an opening that sounds like<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/23/artificial-intelligence-ai-bubble-bursts-humans-take-back-control?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a man who knows the game is up</u></a>,<a href="https://www.itpro.com/business/business-strategy/microsofts-huge-ai-spending-still-has-investors-sweating-despite-solid-cloud-growth?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>but who is in too deep to back out now</u></a>:</p><blockquote>As I reflect on the past year and look toward the one ahead, there’s no question 2026 will be a pivotal year for AI. Yes, another one. But this moment feels different in a few notable ways.</blockquote><p>The passage that has attracted the most attention over the past week, though, is the one below, where he says everyone needs to move past the idea of AI being 'slop', a sentiment gathering so much momentum among normal human beings not over-invested in a planet-destroying bluffing machine that<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-25/ai-slop-named-macquarie-dictionary-word-of-the-year-2025/106047682?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>it was crowned 2025's word of the year</u></a>. In a list of things “we still need to get right,” Nadella includes:</p><blockquote>A new concept that evolves “<a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2011/12/21/steve-jobs-bicycle-for-the-mind-1990/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">bicycles for the mind</a>” such that we always think of AI as a scaffolding for human potential vs a substitute. What matters is not the power of any given model, but how people choose to apply it to achieve their goals. We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our “theory of the mind” that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other. This is the product design question we need to debate and answer.</blockquote><p>None of that means anything! You sound like an anime villain! Deranged stuff. This is a man drunk on<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-ceo-2025-compensation-hits-165655320.html?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>repulsive levels of executive pay</u></a> and global power, whose brain has been turned to mush by Linkedin and executive self-improvement podcast speak to the point where he writes shit like this down and, instead of recoiling in horror at the first re-read, hitting delete, looking at himself in the mirror and leaving it all behind to go live in the woods decides to publish it for the world to see.</p><p>We don't need to get beyond any argument over slop. You need to stop ramming this shit into everything we use, and realise we used your products and platforms to send emails and play video games, not to delude ourselves into thinking a glorified auto-correct is some kind of "scaffolding for human potential".&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 finally saw the long-awaited arrival of Nintendo’s next console: the Switch 2. But now, it’s time to turn the page to 2026 and talk about what’s in store for Switch 2’s sophomore year. Nintendo already has a pretty fleshed out release calendar for both Switches, a blockbuster movie set to hit theaters, with plenty of surprises surely in store as well. Here’s what to expect from Nintendo in 2026.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo in 2026: What’s Already On the Books</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get into wild speculation, here’s a recap of what we already know is coming to Switch and Switch 2 in 2026. There’s already a lot to look forward to, as Nintendo remains very consistent in pushing something out pretty much every single month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That pattern begins this month, as we’ll all return to our weed-infested islands and face the wrath of our neglected villagers when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> gets a free update on the original Switch and a Nintendo Switch 2 edition on January 15. New Horizons 3.0 is available to players on both Switches, and it comes with a new hotel to customize, a bunch of Nintendo items, and tons of little quality of life updates like upgraded item storage. Meanwhile, if you buy the Switch 2 Edition or the $5 upgrade pack, you can access improved resolution, mouse controls, 12-player multiplayer, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a few weeks later we’ll see the first brand new Switch 2 exclusive of the year with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>’s launch on February 12. The big hook this time is the Fever Rackets that grant special abilities like freezing the court or duplicating yourself. Fever will also feature 38 playable characters, including Donkey Kong’s refreshed design and – for the first time ever – Baby Waluigi.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you love collecting ridiculous Nintendo products like I do, you might be looking forward to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtual-boy-nintendo-classics-announced-for-switch-1-and-2-at-nintendo-direct">Virtual Boy joining the Nintendo Switch Online library</a> on February 17. You need one of two headsets to access this forgotten library from Nintendo’s biggest failure – either a plastic replica or a cheaper cardboard option. That’ll be available on both Switches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon meets Minecraft (or more accurately, Dragon Quest Builders, but that’s not as catchy) in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> on March 5. This Switch 2 exclusive will task you with using Pokémon moves and materials to design your very own town. I expect Pokopia to be an enormous hit this year: Pokémon and Minecraft are two of the biggest things on the planet, and after everyone’s done poking around the new Animal Crossing update, this looks like the perfect game for that audience to shift to next. Amiibo are trudging on in 2026 as well, and March 5 will also see the launch of the Meta Knight and Shadow Star figure from Kirby Air Riders.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokopia is the last firm release date we have, but Nintendo has a few games slated for Spring. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-getting-an-expanded-version-for-nintendo-switch-2">Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> + Meetup in Bellabel Park is an enhanced port of the 2023 platformer, and one part of Nintendo’s ongoing celebration of Super Mario’s 40th anniversary. It adds cooperative and competitive multiplayer minigames, and we’ve seen a small glimpse of what appears to be a new side story in more traditional levels. I predict this will arrive on April 2, the same day as the new pair of Super Mario Galaxy amiibo and just a day before The Super Mario Galaxy Movie hits theaters, putting a new Mario game on store shelves at the exact moment Mario Mania kicks in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other pair of Spring releases is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</a> on Switch 2 and Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream on Switch 1. Yoshi’s illustrated art style looks really nice, and Tomodachi Life is an exciting return for a 3DS cult classic with a hilarious out-of-left-field personality that you really have to see for yourself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s even more coming later in 2026: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave</a> will mark the strategy RPG’s first outing on Switch 2, Nintendo and FromSoftware are teaming up for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> as a Switch 2 action-RPG exclusive, while Switch 1 players can look forward to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/rhythm-heaven-groove">Rhythm Heaven: Groove</a>, the return of Nintendo’s quirky rhythm minigame series for the first time in a decade. Finally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-champions">Pokémon Champions</a> is a competitive battle-focused game coming to Switch and Mobile this year. We know it will be used at the Pokémon World Championships in 2026, meaning it should be out before that event kicks off in late August. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the third-party front, Switch 2 is getting a lot of major games on day one, including huge support from Capcom with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> on February 27 (along with Resident Evil 7 and 8 on the same day), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> on March 13, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a> on April 24. Plus, all three of those games are getting their own amiibo figures. There’s a lot beyond Capcom, too, like Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, 007 First Light, and more. Hopefully we’ll see cleaned up versions of games delayed out of 2025 as well, like Elden Ring Tarnished Edition and Borderlands 4.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon’s 30th Birthday Bash</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/pokemon-red-1765970424726.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A huge element of Nintendo’s 2026 will no doubt be Pokémon, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. You can safely expect a Pokémon Presents around February 27, and – as we move firmly into the speculation part of this yearly preview – I think it’s going to be a big one. I predict Pokémon’s 10th Generation will be 2026’s November release for Switch 2, and that we’ll get our first look at them here. I don’t think there’s any chance Pokémon misses out on its 30th anniversary without a new pair of mainline games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all: I think 2026 is finally the year that Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow come to Switch. I don’t think they’ll join the Nintendo Switch Online subscription library – it’ll make you buy them separately – but similar to how the Gen One games were dropped on 3DS to celebrate the franchise’s 20th anniversary in 2016, I think Nintendo will run the same play here and shadowdrop them the day of the presentation. The Pokémon Company is also planning to open PokéPark Kanto in Tokyo, Japan, on February 5, the first-ever Pokémon theme park. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Else Could Nintendo Have In Store?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re in an interesting spot where Nintendo has already shown a lot of its cards for 2026, but I still think there are a few things we don’t know about. There is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, the single-player Switch 2 spinoff announced last year, but Nintendo hasn’t committed to that launching in 2026 at all, and it feels more fitting as an early 2027 release to me at this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With November likely taken up by Pokémon, that leaves October open for a Nintendo franchise fitting for spooky season: Luigi’s Mansion. Next Level Games has been quiet since 2022’s Mario Strikers: Battle League (except for a small assisting role on Metroid Prime 4: Beyond), and given its usual three-year turnaround time on Nintendo games, I think it’s time for Luigi’s Mansion 4. The last in the series was a huge sales success, so a sequel is a no-brainer. Just for fun, I’ll guess that the setting will be a haunted cruise ship Luigi has inherited for some strange reason.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/gqxkv0lw8aah-tv-1718722189210.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">2026 also marks the 40th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda. With a movie on the way in 2027, and Nintendo’s general pattern of launching at least one Zelda game every year, it’s a safe bet to say something Zelda-related will come out this year. I don’t think a new 2D or 3D Zelda game is close to being ready, so it’s probably time for another remake or remaster. I’ll guess fans will finally get the Ocarina of Time HD remake they want, but it won’t be perfect: it’ll be a touched up HD remaster of the 3DS remake that comes to both the original Switch and Switch 2, rather than the gorgeous 4K reimagining we all dream about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the smaller side, I have to imagine Nintendo is prepping DLC for Mario Kart World, and all signs point to it centering around Donkey Kong. DK and Pauline strangely only have one costume apiece in World, there are no Jungle-themed DK tracks, and Nintendo’s wider push for DK would lend itself to a DLC pack themed around him. And, I’d like 2026 to be the year we finally get answers surrounding Nintendo’s mysterious Switch Online Playtest program that's been running since 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think that’s about all the room we have for 2026’s calendar, but Nintendo will announce a few games this year we won’t see until 2027. Xenoblade developer Monolith Soft hasn’t released a brand new game since 2022, and I have a feeling we might get a quick tease at what they’re working on in the September Nintendo Direct. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, my boldest call of them all is that we’ll get a tease this year for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition to launch sometime in 2027. I believe Ultimate could get the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe treatment this generation, with an enhanced port that carries us through the next several years rather than an entirely new entry. Smash Bros. director Masahiro Sakurai wrapped up Kirby Air Riders a few months ago, and it’s entirely possible he’s already hard at work bringing Ultimate over to Switch 2 with a few new characters. Ultimate noticeably hasn’t received a Switch 2 performance patch like Super Mario Odyssey, the open-world Zeldas, and plenty of other best-selling Switch 1 games, and combined with the fact that a new Smash game almost <em>always </em>hits within the first two years of a new Nintendo console, it feels like a prime candidate for a Switch 2 Edition.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Will Continue Expanding Beyond Games</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/12/ros-1762959730356.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a> will hit theaters on April 3, three years after the original made over a billion dollars at the global box office. I think Nintendo will waste no time in announcing its next animated partnership with Illumination, given they’re likely very confident this movie will perform extremely well like the first one did. I’m expecting a formal announcement of an animated Donkey Kong movie sometime before the end of 2026. You should also expect to see the first trailer for The Legend of Zelda movie before the year is over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, in a bit of a bummer prediction to end on, I’m expecting a Switch 2 price increase sometime after March. Nintendo has essentially committed to keeping the price where it is through the end of its fiscal year – which concludes March 31 – but there are no guarantees after that. We’ve already seen increases on the original Switch, as well as Switch 2 accessories, so it feels like it’s only a matter of time before Switch 2 follows suit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s everything we expect from Nintendo in 2026. What game are you most excited for? Have you picked up a Switch 2, or are you still happy with the original? Let us know in the comments. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager &amp; Playlist Editor.

            <p>If you've found you've been coming up against tougher players in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> just recently, that could well be because you've been deemed an "aggressive" player.</p>
<p>For the last week or so, players who naturally gravitate to PvP modes and shoot on sight without hesitation have found themselves facing much more aggressive combatants, leading to discussions about whether <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ptzhmr/why_do_people_suddenly_believe_in_aggression/">the team at Embark Studios had quietly introduced "aggression-based" matchmaking</a> (ABMM).</p>
<p>Now, in a new interview, Embark Studios' Patrick Söderlund has confirmed that that's "exactly" what it's done.</p>

<p>"Obviously, first it's skill-based, of course," Söderlund said in the interview with <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/">GamesBeat</a>. "Then you have solos, duos, and trios. And then we also - since a week ago or so - we introduced a system where we also matchmake based on how prone you are to PvP or PvE.</p>
<p>"So, if your preference is to do PvE, and you have less conflict with players, you'll get more matched up. Obviously it's not a full science."</p>
<p>Asked directly if the change could be described as "aggression-based matchmaking", he added: "That's exactly what it is."</p>
<p>Quite what it means to be "aggressive" or "prone" to PvP or PvE is unclear and likely never will be, to prevent less scrupulous players from gaming the system. It does, however, at least confirm that those who'd felt there'd been a quiet change to how matchmaking worked weren't imagining it.</p><p>This backs up a prior interview with Arc Raiders art director Robert Sammelin, who recently said that when it comes to the extraction shooter's matchmaking system - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">which was Steam's biggest-selling game over the holiday period</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-developer-confirms-player-behaviour-is-factor-in-matchmaking">player behaviour is indeed a factor</a> in the "complex" process of assigning players to online matches.</p>

            <p>Capcom cut an entire chapter in which you played as Ashley in the opening of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>.</p>
<p>Modder and content creator Michael "Thekempy" Kemp has reportedly restored the cut chapter that was meant to open the game. While there are no cutscenes or even enemies, there are enough "leftover pieces" in the game files to put "Chapter 0" back together and "get a rough idea of how it would have played out". So that's exactly what they did in the video below:</p>

<p>"It would have started with Ashley in the woods at night," Thekempy explains. "She stumbles upon Los Illuminados in the middle of performing a ritual sacrifice."</p>
<p>If that sounds a little familiar, that's because it is - the sequence was briefly seen in the story trailer Capcom released back in October 2022. And while it seemingly didn't make the final cut and the area is not accessible in the final build, Thekempy was able to find the path Ashley took to witness the sacrifice, and then a fork in the road, which takes her down to the village.</p>
<p>"There are a number of leftover spawn locations for scripted events that would have happened in this chapter," thekempy added (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/resident-evil/an-entire-intro-where-you-play-as-ashley-was-cut-from-the-resident-evil-4-remake/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"I am unable to restore all of their functionality, but I can tell you what they're labelled as. There's one here for the spawn of a Ganado who would begin walking around, and Ashley has to sneak past him."</p>
<p>While the cutscenes seemingly no longer exist, Thekempy did manage to trigger autosaves and give a little detail on what each cutscene may have entailed from their labels and descriptions in the code.</p>
<p>We may never know why, exactly, the opening sequence was binned, but it's possible Capcom was a little wary of kicking off the horror with a comparatively slow, non-combat sequence so at odds with the game's action-heavy playstyle.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released next year on 27th February across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Steam. Its dual protagonists will represent two styles of gameplay, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-leon-grace-differing-gameplay">its developers describe as like "jumping into a cold bath after a hot sauna"</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">Resident Evil 7 and Village are also coming to Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>

Similar to inserting the Switch 2 into its dock, the console connects to a USB-C port that delivers power when it’s placed on the stand.</p><p>The new case also has a flap for holding game cartridges, a mesh pocket for storing other accessories, and a hidden compartment for stashing trackers like an AirTag or one of Tile’s.

<p>Right now, there's no formal word from Capcom that the game could be making the jump to Switch 2, but Capcom has long been a supporter of Nintendo's platform. It may be that the Switch port was paused until last month's Title Update 4 rolled out, along with that all-important <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-finally-gets-pc-optimisation-roadmap-to-coincide-with-title-update-4-but-players-still-arent-really-happy">optimisation roadmap for the game's performance on PC</a>.</p><p>These issues have plagued the game since Monster Hunter Wilds launched in February 2025, and whilst Capcom has acknowledged them, the publisher has been slow on pushing out updates that addressed player concerns. This has led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">review bombing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">less than stellar sales</a> for the game outside its launch window, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter">falls in Capcom's share price</a>. It's plausible, then, that Capcom's waiting for the PC version to improve before adding another platform into the mix. Maybe we'll find out more at a Nintendo Direct presentation soon...</p>

<section><p>Behind the QTEs and tough choices, is a pretty great dispatching sim.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Quick-time events, despite everyone's best efforts to spice them up, remain pretty <em>meh</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">When you first begin Dispatch, the new episodic superhero adventure game from AdHoc Studio, you're asked if you want to enable quick-time event prompts as an optional game mechanic. It says something that these QTE prompts only really appear in the first and last episode of Dispatch's eight-episode run. But if you're worried the only input you'll have in Dispatch is pressing a button at the right time, or picking the different narrative choices that affect the game's story, you should know AdHoc has a more compelling, non-optional gameplay hook that deserves as much attention as the game's charming storytelling. And it's in the title of the game itself.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in a fictional version of Los Angeles, California where superheroes are real, Dispatch centers on Robert Robertson III, a former hero turned dispatcher for SDN. It's a private security and service company, except instead of sending paramedics out, SDN (or Superhero Dispatch Network) sends out caped heroes to tackle clients' problems big and small. This serves as the basis for Dispatch's core minigame, and it's one that could honestly be a standalone game in and of itself.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether that's rescuing a cat from a tree, breaking up drunken tailgates, or rescuing people from a collapsing dam, there's no job SDN won't help out with so long as you're a paying customer. And while the superheroes out in the field get most of the credit, Dispatch's true heroes are the team of behind the scenes blue-collar dispatchers who match the right heroes with the right crisis, or at the very least, try to.</p><p dir="ltr">The actual mechanics of dispatching heroes takes the form of a full-on minigame that you play at least once per episode. As Robert sits down at his work station for another day of work, players assume a first-person perspective at SDN's proprietary dispatching program that shows a map of South LA, various crimes that appear in real time, and a menu full of heroes waiting to be dispatched.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626295-1516145796-ss_e8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626295" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626295-1516145796-ss_e8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626295"></a><figcaption>Dispatching in Dispatch</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626295-1516145796-ss_e8.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>The key to success is dispatching the right hero for the job. For example, if there </span><em>is</em><span> a cat stuck in a tree, you'd want to send a speedy hero who can fly, not someone who solves problems with their fists, who'd likely have a lower success rate of rescuing said cat. Likewise, if a gang of grunts is robbing a bank, then you'd send in some bruisers to take care of business. The initial description of each mission clues you in to which skills are best suited to the job at hand, and each hero has individual stats with strengths and weaknesses — your success will depend on how well you line up the heroes' skills with the task at hand. The less overlap there is between skillset and problem, the less likely your hero is to succeed. But get the right hero on a crime, and they'll solve the problem and level up while they're at it.</span></p><p dir="ltr">There are real emotional stakes to dispatching as well. Failure is a very real possibility, especially during rush hour when heroes become unavailable due to exhaustion. This means you're racing against the clock to try to save as many people as possible, and when you find that you can't help everyone, Dispatch makes that emotional burden feel very real, and very disappointing thanks to the feedback you receive in real-time from your team of superheroes. And when Robert doesn't get flak from the team, he'll also cry out in frustration if a job goes poorly.</p><p dir="ltr">What I found truly surprising is how this dispatching minigame fits into the burgeoning subgenre of labor simulators. That is, games that revolve around basic, blue-collar jobs. PowerWash Simulator, for example, is about powerwashing dirty surfaces, and it's one of the most popular games around. In the same way, the dispatching minigame feels very much a part of this microgenre thanks to some clever design choices that put you, as Robert, directly into the action.</p><p dir="ltr">The entire dispatching minigame is played directly on Robert's '90s-era workstation PC, which you interface with in first-person. You might as well be sitting in the cubicle at SDN yourself. Plus, get good enough at dispatching and you'll find that you can enter a flow state: a very real state of being when you find yourself becoming particularly adept at instantly diagnosing a crime and knowing already the best hero for the job. It made me wonder if I could actually be a dispatcher in real life, though I will say being unemployed means I find myself wondering if I could do most jobs in real life these days.</p><p dir="ltr">All this is to say, if you've tried choice-based narrative games before and find yourself wishing there were a little more meat on the bones beyond just quick-time events, one of this year's most popular games has a full-blown sim tucked inside it that is very much worth playing for its own sake.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-confirms-it-recently-added-aggression-based-matchmaking-but-its-not-a-full-science</link>
            <guid>1396798</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark Studios has confirmed one of the community’s biggest questions since the game came out: it does indeed feature ‘aggression-based matchmaking.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means that if you’re big into PvP, you’ll be matched up with players who are like-minded. Similarly, if you prefer PvE, you’ll be matchmade with players who tend to avoid conflict with other players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders’ player versus environment versus player gameplay has resulted in a number of viral clips showing how friendly encounters can quickly devolve into a fight to the last. Yes, you can play solo or in parties up to three, working as a team to progress through the game. However, other players are a constant threat. This has sparked a vociferous debate within the community about the etiquette that has formed in-game, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-just-started-i-have-nothing-retired-pro-gamer-goes-viral-for-relentlessly-killing-casual-arc-raiders-players-but-is-it-griefing-or-just-fair-pvp">a retired pro gamer going viral for relentlessly killing casual Arc Raiders players</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out that Arc Raiders will lean on your playstyle when it comes to matchmaking. This ‘aggression-based matchmaking,’ however, is not an exact science, Patrick Söderlund, CEO of Embark Studios told Games Beat in <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent interview</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/vY3u7wOmm4w?si=QKpGyvRhpr7r-Cdw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video playthrough of the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Obviously first it's skill-based of course,” Söderlund said of Arc Raiders matchmaking. “Then you have solos, duos, and trios. And then we also, since a week ago or so, we introduced a system where we also matchmake based on how prone you are to PvP or PvE. So if your preference is to do PvE and you have less conflict with players… you'll get more matched up [with similar players]. Obviously it's not a full science.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Söderlund said the term ‘aggression-based matchmaking’ is “exactly” the system Arc Raiders currently uses. That puts to bed high-level questions about how Arc Raiders matchmaking works for the community, which had wondered about it in recent months. “I can finally stop arguing on Reddit, thank you for the vindication,” said one player.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, it’s worth noting that Söderlund confirmed Arc Raiders prioritizes "skill" when it comes to matchmaking, then groupings. Aggression-based matchmaking is a factor, but we don’t know how much influence it has on your lobbies compared to other factors. And even Söderlund admitted it doesn’t always works as you’d think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And how, exactly, does Arc Raiders determine if you’re “prone” to PvE or PvP? If you’re a kill on sight player, sure, you’re probably prone to PvP. But what if you only shoot back at those who shoot at you first? Does that make your lobbies more aggressive? If so, is that fair?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, one big question answered, but many more remain. As for Embark Studios, it always hoped Arc Raiders would have a tension between both playstyles. Arc Raiders is a multiplayer extraction adventure in which players scavenge the remnants of a devastated world, but the main threats are Arc’s machines and, as Embark Studios puts it, “the unpredictable choices of fellow survivors.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

If you ever played the game, even once, you surely remember how it worked, but here’s a summary just in case. You were a bird. Your job was to fly, left to right, for as long as possible without crashing into the green <em>Mario</em>-ish pipes coming from both the top and bottom of the screen. Tap the screen to go up, stop tapping to go down. That’s it. That’s the game.</p><p>Nobody, not even <em>Flappy Bird </em>creator Dong Nguyen, thought those were the ingredients for a smash hit. And yet for a few weeks in 2014, the game was at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/5/5383708/flappy-bird-revenue-50-k-per-day-dong-nguyen-interview">the top of app stores everywhere</a> — and became something of a cultural phenomenon. Almost as soon as it took off, though, players began to rebel, annoyed at both the punishing difficulty of the game and the sudden riches it was bringing its developer. Things got so bad, so quickly, that at the peak of its popularity Nguyen did the unthinkable: he simply <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/8/5393208/flappy-bird-creator-says-hes-pulling-the-game-offline-tomorrow">removed the game from stores</a>.</p><p>For <a href="https://pod.link/1840983742">this episode of <em>Version History</em></a>, we dust off our tapping fingers and dig into the story of <em>Flappy Bird. </em>David Pierce, Jake Kastrenakes, and <em><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File</a></em>’s Stephen Totilo discuss the game’s extremely simple beginnings, its nearly unexplainable explosion in popularity, its clone-filled legacy, and the controversy that changed Nguyen’s life forever. Both Totilo and <em>The Verge </em>figure fairly prominently in the story, and we all have a lot to think about (and maybe answer for). The <em>Flappy Bird </em>story isn’t even technically over — there’s still a game by that name that you can play, at least in a few places — but it basically ended almost as soon as it began.</p><p>If you want to subscribe to <em>Version History, </em>there are two ways to get every episode as soon as it drops:</p><p>And if you want to relive the story of <em>Flappy Bird, </em>even though you can’t technically play the original anymore, here are a few links to get you started:</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Mjc0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>David Pierce</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/podcast/853824/flappy-bird-game-version-history]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/846376/xreal-neo-specs-switch-2-battery-dock</link>
            <guid>1396747</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When the Nintendo Switch 2 launched in June, AR glasses brand Viture beat Xreal to the punch with its own multi-port battery pack that doubles as a portable video dock for the new console. After several months, Xreal answered with the Neo, a 10,000mAh (38.7Wh) battery pack with DisplayPort Alt video-out. It sure is one of the prettiest batteries I’ve ever seen, and it works with the company’s own glasses dating back to the Air series, as well as its new $449 Xreal 1S, which just launched. I’ve also gotten Viture’s Luma Pro glasses working with it.</p><p>The $99 Neo is available now and is being shown off at CES 2026. Whether it’s worth the price to you may come down to how much you use your Xreal glasses for gaming or entertainment on the go. Xreal glasses owners have already been able to connect directly to the likes of Valve’s Steam Deck or the Asus ROG Ally for video and audio over USB-C. Outside of Nintendo’s world, the Neo doesn’t change anything except for letting you give your device some juice while you game. You can play at up to 1200p (depending on the resolution of the glasses) at up to 120Hz. The Switch 2 can go up to 1080p at 120Hz through the Neo.</p><p>This isn’t the fastest-charging battery around, but it’s faster than Viture’s dock. The Neo outputs up to 20W, which is plenty fast for phones and tablets as well as the Switch 2, but it’s not enough to quickly charge some handhelds and laptops. However, if you use the Neo to entertain yourself while it’s being charged with a 65W or higher wall adapter, the output speed boosts to 45W.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>I can’t really think of a good reason why the Neo needed a kickstand, but it has one.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Xreal’s battery dock has a magnetized ring to let it conveniently snap onto MagSafe-equipped iPhones, and it has a kickstand in case you want to prop it up. The Neo has a short built-in USB-C cable that’s for the video source you want to view within the glasses. There’s a USB-C port next to that cable meant for your AR glasses. Then, on the other side, there’s a USB-C charging port.</p><p>It would have been nice to have an HDMI port on the Neo — Viture’s Pro Mobile Dock has one, enabling connection to many other kinds of gadgets, like game consoles and streaming devices. I also would have been fine with a <em>slightly</em> bigger size if it meant higher battery capacity. But the Neo is a fine choice if you primarily entertain yourself while you’re on the move.</p><p><em>Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/846376/xreal-neo-specs-switch-2-battery-dock]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Top 10 Lowest-Rated Games Of 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/top-10-lowest-rated-games-of-2025/</link>
            <guid>1396732</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2025 has been an outstanding year for video games, with countless studios delivering ambitious projects and unforgettable experiences. But even in a year packed with hits, not every release can land on its feet.</p>



<p>As we approach the end of the year, it’s the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-wrapped-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perfect time to look back</a> at the titles that missed the mark—not to revel in their shortcomings, but to understand where things went wrong and how future games can avoid repeating the same mistakes.</p>







<p>So, if you’re wondering which titles might be worth sidestepping, or you’re simply interested in how the year’s disappointments stacked up, here’s a closer look at the ten lowest-rated video games released in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-10-lowest-rated-games-released-in-2025">Top 10 Lowest-Rated Games Released In 2025</h2>



<p>This roundup is based entirely on Metascore ratings from Metacritic. To qualify, a game must have launched in 2025 and earned at least seven critic reviews. Keep this in mind with the entries.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">10. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A tech demo at best. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 54</strong></p>



<p>Kicking off the list is Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a title many argue feels more like a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2s-paid-tutorial-welcome-tour-almost-made-a-player-fall-asleep-at-nintendo-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid tech demo than a traditional game</a>. Designed to highlight the capabilities of the Switch 2, it delivers a handful of fun minigames and some neat insights into the system’s new features.</p>



<p>The real sticking point is value. Fans questioned why this wasn’t bundled for free with the console, similar to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bafta-games-awards-astro-bot-scoops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro’s Playroom on PS5</a>. As a paid standalone release, it’s tough to recommend—and that ultimately lands it among 2025’s lowest-rated titles.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-rennsport">9. RENNSPORT</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t let the graphics deceive you. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 53</strong></p>



<p>On the surface, RENNSPORT presents itself as a competent racing sim, with sharp handling, impressive vehicle audio, and a decent variety of tracks. But it doesn’t take long to notice that it lacks the depth and breadth offered by its biggest competitors.</p>



<p>That shallow content offering raised major concerns when the game launched at a premium price point. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gran-turismo-7-update-1-57-adds-three-new-cars-world-circuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Compared to titles like Gran Turismo</a>, RENNSPORT feels more like a paid demo than a full-featured racing experience, a perception that heavily contributed to its low reception.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-bubsy-in-the-purrfect-collection">8. Bubsy In: The Purrfect Collection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>An unsavoury return of an icon. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 53</strong></p>



<p>There was never much working in favour of Bubsy In: The Purrfect Collection to begin with. While the compilation itself is competently put together and preserves the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-selling-ps1-games-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">classic Bubsy titles</a> accurately, the core problem remains: the original games were never particularly good.</p>



<p>The collection is almost too faithful, offering little to make the experience more palatable for modern players. Despite some welcome extras and accessibility options, you’re still left with four games that range from mediocre to outright bad. As a preservation effort, it’s honest—but that honesty is exactly what lands it as one of 2025’s lowest-rated titles.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact">7. Hunter x Hunter: Nen x Impact</h3>



<figure><figcaption>An underwhelming fighting game debut. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 53</strong></p>



<p>Fans of Hunter x Hunter may appreciate seeing the series make its fighting-game debut, but that doesn’t mean Nen x Impact escapes criticism. There’s the outline of a solid fighter beneath the surface, yet too many shortcomings get in the way.</p>



<p>A thin character roster, underwhelming single-player offerings, and a clunky multiplayer experience all chip away at its potential. Unless you’re a dedicated fan of the franchise, there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-definitive-edition-is-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">far stronger fighting games</a> worth your time.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-neptunia-riders-vs-dogoos">6. Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A mess of a UI. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 51</strong></p>



<p>If Hunter x Hunter caters to committed fans, then Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos is strictly for the diehards. With a brief three-hour campaign, frequent glitches, and a host of technical issues, newcomers are unlikely to stick around long enough to see what the wider series has to offer.</p>



<p>It’s a shame, because there are fleeting moments of the familiar Neptunia charm and playful silliness that fans love. But the lack of substantial content—paired with a price tag that feels far too high—ultimately drags the whole experience down.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-captain-blood">5. Captain Blood</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Well, there’s the blood. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 50</strong></p>



<p>If this were the early 2000s, Captain Blood might have been a bit of a cult favourite. But two decades on, it’s far harder to overlook its flaws—and it’s clear why it ranks among the lowest-rated games of the year.</p>







<p>The gameplay quickly becomes repetitive, the audio feels unfinished, and the overall lack of polish drags the experience down significantly. If you’re craving a PS2-style hack-and-slash, this might scratch that itch, but ironically, many games from that era still hold up better than this modern attempt.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-scar-lead-salvation">4. Scar-Lead Salvation</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Eyes on the orbs. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 44</strong></p>



<p>It’s obvious that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/returnals-4th-anniversary-celebrated-with-ps5-pro-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Returnal heavily inspired</a> Scar-Lead Salvation, which makes it all the more disappointing that it fails to capture what made the PS5 exclusive so compelling. Instead, the result is an uninspired roguelike weighed down by clunky animations and limited enemy variety.</p>



<p>The odd choice to have the protagonist lose clothing as they take damage makes the intended approach pretty transparent. Unfortunately, even the game’s attempts at sex appeal can’t quite mask the frustrations lying beneath the surface.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-ambulance-life-a-paramedic-simulator">3. Ambulance Life: A Paramedic Simulator</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Would you trust your life in their hands? Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 44</strong></p>



<p>Simulators are always a difficult genre to judge; they’re either the cream of the crop or a downright mess. Unfortunately, Ambulance Life might just fall into the latter, as it’s one of 2025’s lowest-rated games.</p>



<p>The game aims to recreate the intensity of emergency response work, but it stumbles in almost every area. In the end, you’re more likely to save a life by avoiding the game than you are playing it. </p>



<h3 id="h-2-tamagotchi-plaza">2. Tamagotchi Plaza</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A charmingly soulless experience. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 43</strong></p>



<p>Everyone loves a Tamagotchi—or at least they used to. After spending time with Tamagotchi Plaza, that nostalgia might fade fast. What made <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tekken-director-katsuhiro-harada-leaves-bandai-namco-after-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bandai Namco’s</a> virtual pets so charming back in the day is almost entirely absent here.</p>



<p>There’s simply not much to do. The world you explore feels dull and empty, and the minigames offer little in the way of fun or purpose. Much like the old digital pets themselves, this is one you might want to quietly put away and forget about.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-mindseye">1. MindsEye</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The ‘GTA-killer’ only killed itself. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 37</strong></p>



<p>Oh, MindsEye, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-relaunch-as-ceo-blames-saboteurs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where did it all go wrong</a>? With Leslie Benzies—a former Rockstar veteran—at the helm, expectations were sky-high. Fans hoped he would take everything he learned from one of gaming’s most influential franchises and push the genre into bold new territory.</p>



<p>Instead, what arrived was a launch mired in chaos. Riddled with bugs and technical issues, MindsEye was barely playable for many. And even if you look past the performance problems, the uninspired gameplay and flat narrative leave you wondering why the project was greenlit in the first place.</p>

            <guid>1396726</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Several retailers kick off the new year by rolling out sales right away, and many of those deals stick around. Almost every category out there sees massive drops, making it a great time to stock up on holiday essentials, plus grab the items that feel a little out of reach the rest of the year (TVs, laptops, tablets, premium headphones, etc). You can even grab games for less, both board and digital ones!</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something action-packed, we just spotted Battlefield 6 by EA on sale at Amazon.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6650/"> The PS5 and Xbox Series X version are going for $64, after a nice 43% drop</a>. If you’re planning to relax and get some much-deserved playtime in during the holidays, today is a good time to prep for it. Note that if you don’t spot a discount on the page, click “See All Buying Options” on the left to view all the drops available. You might want to act fast, as the title is high in demand, and we’re not expecting the drop to stay around for long. In fact, keeping past trends in mind, it might not even make it through the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6650/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Ultimate Warfare Experience</h2>
<p>Tactile movement and overhauled gunplay make every shot and movement feel more precise, setting an entirely new standard of FPS combat. High-intensity infantry combat or aerial dogfights, you’re going to enjoy full control over every action, just the way you like it. There is more than one way to win and play; go for large-scale modes like Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush to unleash chaos, or push your limits with fast-paced action with King of the Hill, Domination, and Payload.</p>



<p>Upgraded Battlefield Portal is a sandbox that lets you customize your gaming experience by changing rules, scaling things, and even duplicating objects; the possibilities are endless, and you can quite literally have anything you could think of. Want to have something entirely based on your own imagination? It makes it easy to develop a unique game mode using NPC scripting and a customizable UI, which can then even be picked as an official Battlefield mode. Then there’s Campaign, which puts you in an elite squad of Marine Raiders fighting tirelessly to save the world, so you’re constantly adapting and improvising to tackle what every moment unfolds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6650/">On a regular day, the upgraded Battlefield 6 would run you around $70, but this deal lets you pick it up for $40 for PS5 and Xbox Series X.</a> We know it’s huge discount, and considering how the game doesn’t go on sale often, definitely one that’s worth it. Plus, it makes it easy to pick a few titles during the sale without blowing your budget. Again, the sale is around for a short time, so it’s best to grab it quickly. Our shopping team is covering the best gaming deals as they come, so it’s worth keeping an eye out. More drops will surface as the sale goes on, and you can use this time to prepare a holiday library for that well-earned downtime.</p>

<figure data-uuid="69e77682d8424"><a title="Myles Metroid" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/69e77682d8424/myles-metroid.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> previews dropped <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-great-but-i-want-to-kill-one-of-its-characters">back in November</a>, series fans were rightly worried that the biggest killer in the game may not be scourge of the Space Pirates and bounty hunter extraordinaire Samus Aran, but a geeky sidekick apparently out to murder the series' pensive, lonesome tone with his inane geekery and unwanted guidance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/round-up-the-final-previews-are-in-for-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Not every previewer found him grating</a>, but the general pre-release sentiment was that chatter from Myles MacKenzie and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4-beyond-meet-the-team">the Galactic Federation team</a> risked destroying the mood which feels like a defining characteristic of the series.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4ceqtyzjs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">on playing the full game</a>, it became apparent that the engineer — who can only be the product of a tryst between Gordon Freeman, Zack Braff, and Rick Moranis — wasn't half as obnoxious as he came across in the opening section.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">In his review</a>, Ollie said he "genuinely came to enjoy" the presence of the Troopers, and Myles' pinging in the Sol Valley was only a mild irritation in the grand scheme. Perhaps Nintendo should have done a better job showcasing the wider experience for the preview, because MacKenzie made a poor first impression on a lot of people.</p>
<p>Now that the game's been out for a full month and everyone's had time to step into Samus' shoes and witness firsthand Galactic Federation types geeking out over her, we wonder: <em>Have your thoughts on Myles mellowed?</em> Have you, in fact, come to appreciate his help and upgrades? Or have you been a fan from the beginning?</p>
<figure data-uuid="0644f05110cbb"><a title="Myles Metroid" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0644f05110cbb/myles-metroid.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Myles was definitely, appropriately, a point of conversation early doors, but it <em>feels</em> like people have warmed up to him in the last few weeks. Some discoveries and interviews since release have also shed some light on the developers' thinking behind the game's design, encompassing Myles and his loquacious comrades.</p>
<p>A little datamining <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/fans-uncover-unused-dialogue-from-metroid-prime-4">in the weeks post-launch</a> brought to light over 30 minutes of Federation Trooper dialogue that was left on the cutting room floor, so it seems Retro and Nintendo trimmed back some of the game's chatter for one reason or another. Team Ninja's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_other_m">Other M</a> divided opinion for (among other reasons) being a fairly 'talky' Metroid, and Retro — the studio behind the previous three Prime games — was presumably conscious of maintaining tonal continuity, even if many people from the original Prime dev team are long gone.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Famitsu, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-suggests-metroid-prime-4s-tortured-development-meant-it-was-divorced-from-the-changing-of-times">said</a> that the game's protracted development and intentional choices to stick with an original vision produced in a game "divorced from the changing of times", resulting in a more "limited" open world than we've grown accustomed to over the Switch generation.</p>
<p>Would a more expansive, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>-style Viewros have affected Myles' patter? You might assume it would increase the quota of 'helpful' radio chatter, but Navi wasn't back and bothering Link in BOTW's Hyrule, was she? An open-world approach would have necessitated a total redesign, though — as discussed in the Famitsu interview — and Nintendo wasn't going to start from scratch again. The solitary ambience is a key part of the Metroid experience, but so too is exploring and unlocking areas on a contained map. As the "Nintendo spokesperson" put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Metroid’s core element of ‘increasing the amount of explorable areas by unlocking powers’ is not very compatible with the ‘freedom to go anywhere from the beginning’ of open worlds."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't mean you <em>couldn't</em> design a Prime game with that in mind, but that's a very different concept requiring a different approach — and a different pace — to let the terrain do the talking.</p>
<figure data-uuid="81346e26c382d"><a title="Myles Metroid" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/81346e26c382d/myles-metroid.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having gotten used to more intelligent design, especially from Nintendo, Myles' chatter is a throwback which rubs some people the wrong way. Perhaps it's nothing to do with his personality - he's just the personification of tired game design that feels old and irritating at best, patronising at worst.</p>
<p>Beyond the Navi-like hand-holding, you could argue that he's part of a proud tradition of Nintendo characters that fans love to hate. Does a cult-like following await the maligned, misunderstood 'Metroid Myles'? Will his name one day be whispered in the reverent tones of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-20-years-after-his-last-mainline-appearance-tingle-deserves-a-comeback">Tingle</a> and an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-a-love-letter-to-my-favourite-new-character-in-zelda-totk">Addison</a>? Will Jim be cracking out his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/soapbox">soapbox</a> for a staunch defence in the coming weeks?</p>
<p>For now, let us know below if you think he deserved the Jar Jar-brand vitriol or if a month of MacKenzie has revealed his charms to you. In the ranks of all-time Myles/Miles, he's certainly no Prower or Morales or <em>O'Brien</em>, but who is? Let's not hold that against him.</p>

			<p>Fans of <strong>Western roleplaying games</strong> can start the year a little more hopeful that <strong>The Blood of Dawnwalker</strong> will indeed launch in 2026, following the release of the <a href="https://youtu.be/pi53m9XLE00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer's '<strong>Launch Year Special</strong>' video</a>. </p>



<p><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>, founder of <strong>Rebel Wolves</strong> and former Game Director of <strong>The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</strong> at <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong>, joined Global Community Lead <strong>Dominika Burza</strong> to share this message:</p>



<p><em><strong>Dominika Burza</strong>: It's been one full year since we gathered here and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled The Blood of Dawnwalker to the world</a>, and what a year it was!</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>: We are really honored and humbled by your amazing reactions to our first intro cinematic trailer, our gameplay videos, and presentations. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Dominika Burza</strong>: Yes, and it's been incredible to meet so many of you in person at the events all over the world, including Gamescom, PAX East and West, TwitchCon, and Poznan Game Arena. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>: I want to thank you all, because hearing from you is what motivates us and inspires us.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Dominika Burza</strong>: Also when it comes to the feedback. We're making this game for you, and that's why we always want to show you the game in its current state as we progress through different stages of development, even if it sometimes means showcasing content that doesn't fully represent the final quality we're aiming for. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>: We can't promise to implement all of your suggestions, but we do appreciate them, and we always check what can be done. We would like to ask for your trust. We want this game to be great as much as you do. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Dominika Burza</strong>: Yes. Looking forward, The Blood of Dawnwalker launches this year. We won't reveal the release date today, but you can expect to start hearing from us more and more. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>: We still have so much content to show you. Gameplay features, locations, characters.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Dominika Burza</strong>: Exactly! You haven't even met the entire main cast of characters yet. Or creatures, or music. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>: So, to begin 2026 on a high note, we are really excited to present you the new The Blood of Dawnwalker main musical theme.</em></p>

<p>Rebel Wolves have already proven they are indeed listening to fan feedback regarding pre-release gameplay footage and features of The Blood of Dawnwalker. As <strong>Creative Director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz</strong> told us <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-qa-vampiric-nature-impact-coen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an exclusive Gamescom 2025 interview</a>, the directional combat is still in the game, but because some gamers expressed concerns with it, the developers also introduced the ability to play the game more like a traditional action roleplaying game. That was just one change that came from the community's feedback; others include active abilities being more seamlessly integrated into combat, the radial menu no longer causing time to stop (now it slows down), and the ability to customize the camera's proximity to the main character separately for combat and exploration.</p>



<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easily made our shortlist of the five most promising RPGs scheduled in 2026</a>. The game, powered by Unreal Engine 5, will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It appears Ubisoft have settled on a name for their heavily leaked remake of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</a> as a domain has been registered with the game’s name and “Resynced” added to the end.</p>
<p>The Black Flag Resynced domain was registered 25 days ago by a company Ubisoft has used previously, including for the registration of the latest Prince of Persia game.&nbsp; Ubisoft have said they would be plundering their back catalogue for remakes and remasters but they have yet to officially announce this remake. That has not stopped lots of details leaking out.</p>


<p>It seems like the remake, which will use Anvil Pipeline engine, is going to feature some fairly big changes. The most notable change will be the removal of all the modern-day sequences so we will not see Rebbeca, Shaun and the others. The modern-day plot, which worked really well in the first few games with Desmond, has gradually been side-lined and only appears as text in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Replacing it will be “a few extra hours of content” including content that was cut from the original release, such as parts of Mary Read’s story.</p>
<p>Gameplay is said to be closer to the RPG style of the more recent games, with loot, stats for weapons, and a new inventory. The combat is is also said to lean more towards the style of the recent games. The map is the same size but will have more things to do, and modern systems mean there will be no loading screens when docking your ship and heading to land.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qngrBQnukFc">report from the respected Jeux Vidéo Magazine s</a>uggests the game will now launch in early 2026, probably in March, which is a little later than previous reports. Ubisoft Singapore, Belgrade and Bordeaux are working on it, and some assets from Skull &amp; Bones may be reused to save costs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Year In Review: 2025 Is The Year The Console Wars Ended]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As a 32-year-old who was in high school during the peak of the PlayStation and Xbox war, 2025 was surreal to me. I was raised as a PlayStation gamer, and even to this day, I have never owned an Xbox console. When the PS3 was being absolutely dominated by the Xbox 360 by all metrics in the mid-to-late 00s, it sucked. The PlayStation 2 is the best-selling console of all time, and the PS3 did an awful job of following it.</p>



<p>It had few must-have exclusives for years, while the Xbox 360 was throwing out the likes of Halo, Gears of War, Forza, Banjo-Kazooie, Viva Piñata, and Left 4 Dead like there was no tomorrow. Eventually, the PS3 went on an exclusive hot streak, and the tide seismically shifted Sony’s way with the PS4 and Xbox One. This has continued with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-years-of-ps5-what-the-numbers-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5</a> and Xbox Series X|S, to the point where it’s evident Microsoft has waved the white flag in the console wars once and for all.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-gears-of-war-is-over">The Gears of War…Is Over</h2>

<p>Xbox’s game plan shifted with the Xbox One, tailoring the experience more toward an all-purpose media device, as opposed to Sony and PlayStation’s single-minded vision for the PS4: Gaming. I feel this is the pivotal moment where Xbox got everything <strong>wrong</strong>, allowing PlayStation to catch up, and the blue brand hasn’t looked back since.</p>



<p>The PS4 outsold the Xbox more than 2 to 1 (which is huge), but Microsoft managed to find a way to engage and retain a healthy amount of its player base—the allure of Xbox Game Pass. A paid subscription service offering a huge catalog of games, including Xbox exclusives, and giving players a new Xbox exclusive on day one.</p>



<p>This was an effective tactic for the longest time. But the model has long been touted as destructive to the industry: Ask <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arkane-studios-founder-game-pass-unsustainable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arkane Studios’ founder, who branded Game Pass as ‘Unsustainable’ and ‘Damaging’</a>. 2025 saw the infamous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-tries-to-defend-xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass price hike</a> that left everyone in shock, but it doesn’t seem to have had the big negative impact that was feared.</p>



<p>Microsoft is still making games, but there’s talk that future Xbox ‘exclusives’ are PS5-bound. This is probably expected after a manic 2025, which has effectively seen the console wars end, and Microsoft give up its biggest IPs to its once-rival.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-for-your-thoughts-xbox">Halo For Your Thoughts, Xbox?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image from Microsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s probably an alternate timeline somewhere where Xbox Elite controllers are being used to guide Nathan Drake to Shambhala, strum a guitar in The Last of Us Part 2, and help guide Kratos and Atreus through the fires of Muspelheim. We’re in <em>this </em>timeline, where the Horizon festival is bouncing on PS5 Pros, and Astro Bot-themed devices are having their analog sticks twiddled and turned in an effort to combat Gears of War Reloaded’s Locust.</p>



<p>2025 has been a mega year for PlayStation gamers such as myself. Forza has always eluded me, so has Gears of War, and it’s been a pleasure to soak up these legendary franchises that have stood tall as pillars of Microsoft’s success. However, you can pinpoint the moment when hell froze over, the skies were rife with airborne pigs, and the cows finally came home.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved was officially announced</a> on October 24, and I think it was the <strong>final nail in the coffin for the console wars</strong>. </p>



<p>The biased, 14-year-old Sony fanboy in me felt smug, but maturity hits different. I don’t know how I feel now. A unified platform where games can be played on one console is logically the most consumer-friendly solution. Obviously, Nintendo will never let this happen as it doesn’t need to. But it’s almost shocking that it’s come to this: PlayStation logos appearing in Xbox trailers, and even future Xbox games will likely be coming to PS5 to maximize Microsoft profits. </p>



<p>But where does Xbox go from here? If the biggest Xbox games can be played on PC and PS5, why own an Xbox? Blind brand loyalty? Years of digital purchases and investments forcing you to stick to Xbox? This is where Insider Gaming wants to hear from the community. Do you agree that the console wars are officially over? What’s the best thing Microsoft can do from here?

            <title><![CDATA[Our Most Wanted Games of 2026 – #40 to #36]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/04/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-40-to-36/</link>
            <guid>1396690</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Welcome back to our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a> countdown where we now enter the Top 40, as though we were counting down the top 40 songs of the week. In this list, there is a real big mix of genres with no game here quite like the other. We’ve got fighting in space, fighting in space again, fighting on the streets, fighting in the jungle, and then fighting in a cartoon. Yes, there is lots violence and some resource management ahead.</p>
<h2>40 – Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</h2>
<p><em>PC – Q1 2026</em></p>
<p>The early 2000s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlestar-galactica">Battlestar Galactica</a> is one of my favourite TV series, even if it did lose its way towards the end. A story of humanity fleeing through space while being chased by the unrelenting Cylons, and the personal stories of the people living through it all really grabbed the attention of millions of people. There have been Battlestar Galactica games before, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hope">Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</a> provides a new way to experience this universe.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jNCBvhusit8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You are not part of Admiral Adama’s fleet, but a Gunstar Captain who is on their own journey leading a fleet of survivors trying to join Admiral Adama. However, the journey will be tough, and the gameplay will lend to that. That’s because Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes is roguelite where your choices determine how resources are allocated across the fleet, how you manage each faction’s demands, and how you survive encounters with the Cylons. With each run, you will learn which tools work for different situations and get unlocks that will provide some advantage in your future runs. Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes is essentially <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ftl">FTL</a> on a grander scale.</p>

<h2>39 – R-Type Dimensions III</h2>
<p><em>PS5, NSW2, NSW, PC – May 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/r-type-dimensions-iii">R-Type Dimensions III</a> is one that side scrolling shooter fans should be keeping an eye on. It is a game using rebuilt assets of R-Type III: The Third Lightning, allowing players to experience classic gameplay in both 2D and 3D options visual options. You can see it the announcement trailer how the two styles look.</p>
<p><iframe title="R-Type Dimensions III Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bXOKxxPsUvs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alongside the visual upgrade, R-Type Dimensions III will also feature local co-op multiplayer with a change in the scoring along with new survival mechanics. It will also made advanced mode available from the very beginning, and new accessibility options too.</p>
<h2>38 – Samson: A Tyndalston Story</h2>
<p><em>PC, Consoles – 2026</em></p>
<p>When one of the main creators of the Just Cause franchise announces a new game with their new studio, Liquid Swords, you sit up and listen. Just Cause built up a huge fan base for its open world where players could use their imaginations to cause havoc in various ways. Now Christofer Sundberg and the team at Liquid Swords are taking elements of that legacy to create a new, more grounded experience in Samson: A Tyndalston Story.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SAMSON | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Samson is in a load of debt, and the people he owes are now coming to collect. To pay that money back Samson has to take on various missions from hits to getaway driving to try and pay the debt down. What is interesting about Samson is that you cannot just go and do every mission, with only so many missions that can be done in a day. There is no mission fail state either, so you have to deal with the consequences of your actions. Liquid Swords has also said that vehicle combat is going to be a key element of the game and every vehicle can be used as a weapon, as well as items in the environment when getting into street fights. We also know that the main story of Samson: A Tyndalston Story will last around 10 hours, but over double that if players choose to explore the city in depth.</p>
<h2>37 – Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose">Hell Let Loose</a> is one of the most intense multiplayer experiences I have taken part in. Massive battlefields with teams of 50 going against each other in battles that can be slow and suddenly have bursts of action, with players needing to communicate to really get the best of the game to complete objectives. It was a tough enough experience in the setting of World War II, so the sequel being set in Vietnam is going to add a whole new set of challenges for players.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | First Gameplay Reveal Trailer | World Exclusive with @IGN" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bwfPLwLwQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Instead of the open battlefields of the original, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose-vietnam">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</a> puts you in the dense jungles where American and Vietcong forces battled a mix of open and guerrilla warfare. Players are going to have access to a lot more tools with helicopters and boats both being core vehicles to use to navigate, along with the tunnels the Vietcong constructed to bypass and ambush soldiers. Hell Let Loose: Vietnam has the potential to be one of the most ambitious and memorable multiplayer experiences of 2026.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/hell-let-loose-vietnam-preview-choppers-tunnels-and-a-new-era-of-war/">our early preview of the game</a> from Gamescom in August.</p>
<h3>36 – Mouse: PI For Hire</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 19th March 2026</em></p>
<p>Mouse: PI For Hire looks like the kind of game that could absolutely become a cult classic. It essentially takes the animation artstyle of the 1930s and bends it into video game form, making the whole thing set in the city of Mouseburg and making all the character mice that would fit in any early Disney cartoon. It then adds the great twist of taking that family friendly style and turning it into a noir-styled first person shooter.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="MOUSE: P.I. For Hire | Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IlwZMgDK-kQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Mouse: PI For Hire you are Jack Pepper, who is being voiced by Troy Baker. Things start off with the classic damsel in distress opening that a cornerstone of a lot of noir fiction, but what is said to follow is a dive into the corrupt criminal underworld of Mouseburg where not everything is as it seems. You will be able to explore places like the city streets, the sewers, a casino, a film studio, and the docks, with each having loot and collectibles.</p>
<p><em>Five more games down, and it doesn’t take a private investigator (mouse or otherwise) to figure out that there’ll be another fistful of games coming in a list tomorrow as well!</em></p>

<figure data-uuid="f83aa3661410b"><a title="RE4 Wii Edition - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f83aa3661410b/re4-wii-edition-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello folks, and welcome to the first 2026 edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-ice-climber">Last time</a>, we looked at the iconic, if under-appreciated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ice_climber">Ice Climber</a> for the NES, and would you believe it, we had a tie! North America and Japan achieved a total of 38% each, with Europe trailing at 24%. In our opinion, the Japanese design is <em>slightly</em> better in this case, but we'll leave it as a tie.</p>
<p>Now cast your mind back to 2019. In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/poll_box_art_brawl_3_-_resident_evil_4">one of our very first editions of Box Art Brawl</a>, we looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/poll_box_art_brawl_3_-_resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> for the GameCube. We gave a brief mention to the Wii and PS2 covers at the time, but they weren't a part of the official poll. We're going to change that now by looking specifically at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/resident_evil_4_wii_edition">Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition</a>, originally released in 2007.</p><div><figure data-videoid="L6F_QBKeXfU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytL6F_QBKeXfU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4033abrtqiyz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Boasting motion controls for aiming and quick-time events, RE4 on the Wii is considered by some to be the best version of the game, though it does (in this writer's opinion) make what was already a fairly breezy entry in the series a little too easy at times. Still, it's a banger either way, and we urge you to give it a shot if you haven't already.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/wii/related-articles:1377 @ 1767573022 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="a83ab2924c4a4"><a title="RE4 Wii Edition - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a83ab2924c4a4/re4-wii-edition-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4201-resident-evil-4-wii-edition">Capcom / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Y'all are pretty familiar with this key art by now, huh? Yes, here we see Leon Kennedy front and centre, with a bunch of villagers and Bitores "The Big Cheese" Méndez surrounding him. It's an atmospheric piece that does a good job at conveying the sinister circumstances of the game, though logically, Leon striking a pose like that while in such immediate danger doesn't make a whole lot of sense.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="684cb9abc85bc"><a title="RE4 Wii Edition - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/684cb9abc85bc/re4-wii-edition-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4201-resident-evil-4-wii-edition">Capcom / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Europe's design is pretty cool, taking direct inspiration from the original GameCube release in the region back in 2005. We can see Dr. Salvador, A.K.A. The Chainsaw Man, standing in the bottom left and surrounding by tree trunks. There are some cool shadow effects here, but we reckon it's not <em>quite</em> as impactful as the red GameCube original.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="75b9add0cb2b3"><a title="RE4 Wii Edition - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75b9add0cb2b3/re4-wii-edition-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/4201-resident-evil-4-wii-edition">Capcom / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan decided to use the same image as North America, but zoomed into Leon and cut out the enemies in the background (apart from a random villager's arm over on the right), all the while making the colours a little bit cooler. The keen focus on Leon is nice and it makes for an eye-catching design, but we'd like to see more.</p>
<p>Naturally, it also utilises the Japanese 'biohazard' title in place of Resident Evil, and despite being unlucky over in Japan, the stylised number 4 is also pretty prominent.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! W</em><em>e'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-resident-evil-4-wii-edition]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The Sims 4: Royalty & Legacy is the Game’s Upcoming 21st Expansion Pack]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sims-4-royalty-and-legacy-final-expansion-pack/</link>
            <guid>1396684</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Sims 4 is set to be expanded <strong>yet again </strong>very soon with the game’s <strong>21st expansion pack </strong>since it was released in September 2014. Fans have been wondering what’s coming for the longest time, as it’s almost inevitable that there always was going to be <strong>at least one more</strong> expansion.</p>



<p>However, the newly uncovered Royalty &amp; Legacy expansion should be the <strong>last expansion pack </strong>ever released for The Sims 4. Electronic Arts is planning to move on after more than a decade of crafting content for the best-selling life sim title.</p>



<h2 id="h-royalty-amp-legacy-is-coming">Royalty &amp; Legacy is Coming</h2>



<p>Recently, it was discovered that the South Korean ratings board had registered The Sims 4: Royalty &amp; Legacy as the 21st, and potentially final, Sims 4 expansion.</p>



<p>In a listing published on December 26, it’s explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The 21st expansion pack for The Sims 4 allows players to become nobles and build a long-lasting dynasty.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It seems like the perfect final expansion for The Sims 4, which has been running for more than a decade. Giving players the ability to create a lasting dynasty in a royal setting is a decent farewell.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.gcrb.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?app=ZUa9f5yNjhI=&amp;type=xl/kTOU3dYU=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Korean ratings board</a> issued a ‘For ages 15 and up’ certificate on account of the expansion having ‘indirect and limited sexual expressions’ and ‘realistic expressions of violence’, which are nothing new for The Sims.</p>



<p>Woo-hoo, right?</p>



<p>The filing was submitted by Electronic Arts Korea Ltd., and while it’s the first rating of its kind, it won’t be the last. We checked the ESRB and PEGI ratings boards but couldn’t find a similar listing at the time of publishing.</p>



<p>Typically, these ratings start getting logged mere days or weeks before an announcement or reveal is made by the developer or publisher. We could be very close to getting a full look at what might be the last Sims 4 expansion ever made.</p>



<p>What are you expecting from Royalty &amp; Legacy? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>
