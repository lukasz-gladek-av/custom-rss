            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-bongo-cat-on-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bongo Cat was released on Steam on March 5, and in the time it has been online, it has racked up a review rating of <strong>Overwhelmingly Positive</strong>. As I write this, 130,000 people are playing the game on Steam, but <strong>what even is it</strong>? The game’s description on Steam doesn’t give anything away, leaving many to wonder what Bongo Cat is and why it is going insane on Steam.</p>



<p>Here’s the description, which will make more sense once you’ve read through the explanation below:</p>



<p><em>‘Bongo cat needs your help. Bongo cat needz more hatz!!! Every time you press a key, Bongo Cat will punch your taskbar. Type, click, play, and work to collect more points. Which hats will you find?’</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-hatz">More Hatz</h2>



<p>If you remember the banana-themed game on Steam that was aptly named <strong>Banana</strong>, then you’ll understand some of the premise for Bongo Cat.</p>



<p>In Banana, players were presented with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/banana-steam-make-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a banana that they clicked on</a>. The more they clicked, the more banana skins (get it?) they earned, and the kicker was that they could take those skins and trade them on the Steam Marketplace. That’s how Banana managed to skyrocket to a peak concurrent player count of more than 900,000 Steam users.</p>



<p>What is Bongo Cat? Think of it as being <strong>Banana</strong>, but replace the fruit with a cat, and instead of doing nothing when you click on it, the cat slaps your taskbar. It sits over whatever you’re doing, and everything you do will earn another slap – clicking, typing, and so on. As you rack up points, you’ll earn new cats, hats, and other items, such as emotes and floating icons.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-point-of-bongo-cat">What’s the Point of Bongo Cat?</h2>



<p>It’s not enough to know what Bongo Cat is, you must also understand <strong>what the point of the game is</strong>.</p>



<p>It doesn’t really have much of a point, but the game’s <strong>feature list </strong>on Steam mentions that it will be ‘A friend while working hard.’</p>



<p>As you collect points, you can unlock items that range from Common to Legendary, and when you get them, you’re free to trade and sell them within the Steam Marketplace. </p>



<p>And now you understand why Bongo Cat is soaring in popularity – it’s because there’s a slight chance of making some money on the game.</p>



<p>If you want to give Bongo Cat a try, you get get it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419430/Bongo_Cat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for free now on Steam</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/honor-of-kings-world-gdc-2025-hands-on-and-developer-q-a.1163298/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-gdc-2025-hands-on-and-developer-qa/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>TiMi Studio’s signature multiplayer title may not as well known as other MOBA contemporaries outside the Asian market, but Honor of Kings remains one of the most-played titles in the genre. In mainland China, Honor of Kings will be celebrating its tenth anniversary later this year, while the global/Western release only debuted last year. This Multiplayer Online Battle Arena is branching out into new genres for the first time with a (not so massive) multiplayer online RPG titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-resurfaces-with-gorgeous-gdc-2025-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honor of Kings: World</a> due out sometime later this year. With a new genre comes a new potential to reach a target audience that might have otherwise overlooked this Chinese epic.</p>
<p>At GDC 2025, Tencent allowed me to jump into a pair of missions and experience a bit of the story, with the implication that this was still fairly early on in the adventure as the main character was still getting a grasp of his powers. Rather than picking a single weapon type and sticking with it, Honor of Kings: World lets players pick a pair of classes from a wide range of melee, spellcasters, and ranged combatants. Each of the different classes holds a similar breadth of skills to one another, from three standard attacks unique to that class, a dodge or evasive ability, and some form of ultimate attack. There’s clearly the potential to mix and match some powerful combinations with class attacks, usually conferring some sort of elemental attack and either a positive buff for the player or a negative debuff for any poor fodder enemies in their path.</p>
<p>In a character action game, the melee combat remains the standard to judge first and foremost, and I’m pleased with how Honor of Kings World makes each weapon feel dynamically different. It’s actually the ranged combat that drew me in and made my experience for this brief hour memorable. One of the eleven classes gave my hero character a massive gun, complete with an active reload mechanic and more than enough supporting fire to never stop firing on the enemy. Large swords are undeniably cool, but pulling off solid ranged combat in a character action game will always capture my heart.</p>
<p>Honor of Kings: World showed off only a small slice of the levels, from a couple of encounters that went straight into boss fights to a moderately lengthy dungeon filled with side paths containing loot and a couple of environmental puzzles. Admittedly, one of the puzzles stumped me because I was thrown into a dungeon without having done a tutorial that would teach me that ice grenades can freeze movable blocks in place. I can’t fault the developers for having to point me in the right direction when I solved two-thirds of a puzzle for a hidden treasure chest but couldn’t finish the final piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>It may not have been on my radar before GDC 2025, but I would absolutely check out Honor of Kings: World again sometime later this year. While no PlayStation release is a bit of a bummer, the UI and bite-sized missions would be perfect on the go for mobile gamers. After the hands-on, I chatted a bit with Simon, the lead designer for&nbsp;this project.</p>
<p><iframe title="GDC 2025 Announcement Trailer | Honor of Kings: World" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4oFTbOeyFUI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about Honor of Kings: World for newcomers.</strong></p>
<p>We are a next-generation multiplayer adventure RPG. We started from the original IP and we are ready to take it to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>How much of the IP's DNA is there in Honor of Kings: World?</strong></p>
<p>I think it's in everything because of the way we started this project. We took the core concept, like the combat, but then we elevated it. As you can see, every combat style you play is actually a champion from the game, and we actually turned it into a three-dimensional action experience. Also, the story and the world are from the MOBA.</p>
<p><strong>How many of the champions from Honor of Kings will be playable in this new game?</strong></p>
<p>Eventually, I hope all of them, but we are starting with the first champions from the first region because we don't want players to have this feeling like there are hundreds of champions. So, the way we do it is that we introduce a region and the champions who are related to the region and the story. We introduce players to them, and through the updates, we will add more and more and more champions.</p>
<p><strong>Since players are controlling two separate champions, how do you go about balancing the synergy?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, the player is the protagonist. This protagonist has the power to master the flow of the others, so he's learning abilities from the champions. That's the whole concept. We also try to provide you with the fun of this dramatic difference from each combat style, but we still try to keep it at the same level.</p>
<p>If you play the game like a single player experience, I think the difference is the fun part of it. For example, when you select the character with a gun, the shooting and dodging are emphasized a lot. It's a different kind of experience.</p>
<p>When it comes to the multiplayer, you have a little bit of positioning. If you're into counterattacks, you're supposed to engage with the boss constantly. But if you're a ranger, you're supposed to be providing the damage. Then you have something like a support character role, but we want everything, every class in the multiplayer also to be able to fight back, not just like standing there and healing.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel that Honor of Kings World is trying to do away with the holy trinity of tank, damage dealer, and healer?</strong></p>
<p>We are not going fully exactly on that. The baseline is still that, even if you're a support character, you are meant to have a great action experience. Since you can access two classes, you can actually switch between support and DPS. I mean, if you really want to go for a full support role, you can do that. But normally, you can switch to another style and get into DPS mode, depending on the occasion of the combat.</p>
<p><strong>Can Honor of Kings: World be played entirely solo?</strong></p>
<p>You can if you want. We actually provide quite a lot of a single player experience. It's an option. We provide a non-invasive multiplayer experience for you. At some point, it's always convenient to play with others. Let's say that you feel like a boss fight is too difficult. As a player, you can always call for help,&nbsp;but it's not going to be disruptive.</p>
<p><strong>Can you bring in AI companions?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it's like an assistant function. If you can't find a friend or you just want to play alone, then there are options for AI companions in the dungeons or stuff like that. So it's more like an accessible assistant function to that.</p>
<p><strong>How's the matchmaking? Can you select, like, I want to play this specific mission and the game tries to match you with other players?</strong></p>
<p>I think it's very straightforward. When you are going to a dungeon, then if you want a team, you can just match with players who are similar to your rank.</p>
<p><strong>At launch, how will players have access to the characters? Will they have access to the whole initial roster? Will they just have access to one or two?</strong></p>
<p>I think we provide several in the storyline, like a basic set. It's actually still quite a few. The way actually way you progress in the story, you get to meet the champions and get familiar with them, and then you learn their abilities. You will have a basic combo set along the way, and it's tailor-made for you to understand the system. Then later on, if you want more, you would just go for purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Are you talking about the business model for Honor of Kings: World yet?</strong></p>
<p>What I can tell you is that we are building monetization around social, so it's going to be around outfits and skins, nothing that is pay-to-win.</p>
<p><strong>Do you know roughly how much buying an additional champion would cost?</strong></p>
<p>We're still working on that.</p>
<p><strong>Are there already any plans for a premium or battle pass?</strong></p>
<p>I think that's very possible in the future. Since monetization is at an early stage of testing right now, we don't have a detailed fixed rule on that, but I think something like that is very likely.</p>
<p><strong>Will Honor of Kings: World be free to play, or do players have to make an initial purchase to play?</strong></p>
<p>No, it's a free-to-play game, so&nbsp;no purchase at all.</p>
<p><strong>Which platforms are you launching on?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we are focusing on PC and mobile. Hopefully, consoles will be in the future too, but right now, we're focusing on the first two.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a cross-progression between PC and mobile platforms?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Mobile is more like an accessible way for you to play anytime, but it's as if it were the same platform.</p>
<p><strong>Will you have controller support?</strong></p>
<p>Not right now, but we can tell it's really important here, and so I think we will probably have that in the future plans.</p>
<p><strong>Especially for mobile, not everyone prefers playing lengthy RPGs with just the touchscreen.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think it's quite important, but right now, we are trying to polish the native mobile experience first.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any crossover events or content planned between Honor of Kings and Honor of Kings: World?</strong></p>
<p>We're talking about it since we are the same IP and the same team. We are gradually talking about how do we actually - I mean, the narrative is already kind of merging together. We are at an early phase of the discussions right now.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of release window do you have in mind for Honor of Kings: World?</strong></p>
<p>We don't have a specific date. What I can tell you is that we are working really hard to bring it online as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. Do you have any beta tests planned in the near future?</strong></p>
<p>We don't have a detailed plan yet. But what we're doing is we are constantly testing through private tests. Every couple of months, we try to iterate the game as quickly as possible. So, I think we can expect further tests in the future,</p>
<p><strong>For fans who may play the MOBA a lot but are not as comfortable or familiar with playing action RPGs, do you have any difficulty or accessibility options for this game?</strong></p>
<p>For now, we are focused on polishing the content. Later on, we should definitely consider that. Even with the mobile version, we must consider a lot of control polishing. I think that's definitely going to be on the radar in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anywhere to sign up or wishlist Honor of Kings: World?</strong></p>
<p>Not yet. We are still working on it. But we'll try our best to bring it to the wishlists as quickly as possible in the future.</p>
<p><strong>When's the next event where players will see more of the game?</strong></p>
<p>I don't know, but we'd love to keep the momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>When Verdansk came back on April 3, it brought ‘Battle Royale Casual’ with it, an all-new mode packed with bots to give players a much more forgiving experience. Given how I love Call of Duty’s multiplayer platforms but hate sweating against cracked players and the punishing SBMM mechanics, I’m wondering where my ‘Multiplayer Casual’ playlists are.</p>



<p>It’s not an unheard-of concept. In 2022 and 2023, Modern Warfare II and III featured a mode called ‘Invasion’, which was a large-scale multiplayer mode stacked with bots – and it was <strong>great</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s get some simple playlists sorted out for the less talented player who just wants to chill out and shoot guns.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-struggle">No Struggle</h2>



<p>Before labelling me a crazy person, look at this. I was inspired to explore this topic thanks to a post on <a href="https://x.com/DETONATEDcom/status/1911230593662099703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter by DETONATED</a>, which held a poll that had some <strong>very </strong>telling results:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That post and the subsequent poll got me thinking…</p>



<p>Call of Duty’s skill-based matchmaking mechanics were broken down by their creator during a recent episode of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-creator-of-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Insider Gaming Weekly podcast</a>. They’re not as nefarious as you might think, but they’re designed in a way that keeps you on your toes and in lobbies with players around your ‘calculated’ skill level.</p>



<p>It does mean that, at times, you’ll be lumped in with players that walk out of the lobby with a 4.0 K/D.</p>



<p>It was also confirmed a while ago that Call of Duty’s studios <strong>never </strong>inject bots into any multiplayer matches, which is something that other games have done historically. Sure, they’ve mostly been battle royale games with much higher player counts in a single game, but you can downsize the logic, surely.</p>



<p>Invasion was the perfect example of ‘Multiplayer Casual’. It put players in large, sweeping maps with hundreds of bots and a decent array of real players, making it feel like a full-fledged battlefield (no pun or reference intended). It meant that you’d likely end a match with hundreds of kills, and you never had to go looking for enemies.</p>



<p>Invasion was <strong>dropped </strong>coming into Black Ops 6, which left a gaping hole in my rotation.</p>



<p>Here’s my question:</p>



<p>If we can have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-launching-battle-royale-casual-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale Casual</a> packed with bots that allows you to experience the same game but earn fewer experience points, why can’t we have a Multiplayer Casual mode that serves the same purpose?</p>



<p>Folks can grind camos, learn the maps, play modes that they usually wouldn’t, experiment with non-meta weapons, and so on, all while avoiding cheaters, punishing SBMM mechanics, and potentially connection issues (if it was entirely a bot lobby, of course).</p>



<p>That poll says that I’m not alone, but I’m just wondering how the logistics of a Multiplayer Casual mode would work.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think about this concept in the comments, or join the community over on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Meet DMZ: Nuclear Survival, a new PVE and competitive PVP multiplayer open-world survival crafting game set in a post-apocalyptic world after a nuclear war. It's coming "soon" in early access so that the "brand-new, ambitious, and highly flexible" game can grow alongside its community.</p>
<p>It's thought the game - which hasn't indicated a price, but has at least confirmed it won't be free-to-play - will be in early access for the inaugural year, although that "depends upon development progress and player feedback". You can check it out in the teaser below, which debuted at Indie Live Expo 2025 earlier today:</p>

<p>Developed by a two-person team in Saitama, Japan, DMZ is the debut title from newly formed studio Wild Dog. It takes place on the supercontinent "Pangaea, a "vast, procedurally generated" environment featuring a variety of biomes, including forests, wastelands, deserts, and snowfields. The game's lore suggests it was formed by tectonic shifts caused by the war, where "intense battles for survival" unfolded. Players can excavate ancient ruins scattered across the land - such as pyramids, Terracotta warriors, and Roman temples - and research relics, craft items, and "even resurrect powerful soldiers from ancient genes to revive a fallen civilization and fight for survival".</p>
<p>You'll also get to capture NPCs and bring them back to base to become companions, each one with a specialty that may come in handy. Non-human recruits like Bears, wolves, and, er, ostriches are also available. Players can also set up shop on dedicated servers to "play with over 100 players", although offline single-player mode is also available.</p>
<p>The duo hope the final version will introduce new biomes and locations, "enhance soldier and NPC development features, improve PvE and PvP mechanics, add craftable technologies, and implement server updates that allow more players to participate simultaneously".</p>
<p>For more, head on over to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3316500/DMZ_Nuclear_Survival/">Steam page</a>, which informs me there'll be in-app purchases and full controller support.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Pretty much all we officially know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar</a>.</p>
<p>However, with the first phase of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">its Battlefield Labs initiative</a> - described as the "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" - now live, despite participants needing to sign an NDA before they can get involved, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">gameplay is already popping up in various corners of the internet</a>. And EA is not happy.</p>
<p>Whilst at first, with mostly positive news leaking, EA seemed pretty content to let the rumours fly, the team is now cracking down on the leaks, saying that no one wins when "information and content [...] is shared out of context".</p>

<p>Global community manager Totalfps hit back at a grumpy reddit thread about purported skill-based-matchmaking, cutting the commenter off with "Okay, enough".</p>
<p>"Battlefield Labs is about building and collaborating on the future of Battlefield, and we want to do that in the correct way," Totalfps wrote."I want to remind everyone things that are taking place in Battlefield Labs may or may not make their way to the final finish line.</p>
<p>"This is the greatest thing about this program, it allows us the ability to get creative, see what works with those involved, gain educated and informed feedback from those that are participating and potentially spot bugs around the features too. We've long wanted to implement this program, responding to your requests for greater involvement and a return to this type of reactivity around all things Battlefield."</p>
<p>Totalfps added that "there is a specific time and place for the wider community to learn about new features and functionalities", but now "is not it", and "the constant reposting of things is not that time or place" yet, either.</p>
<p>"Individuals are and will continue to be removed if they continue to violate the NDA that they agreed to," they said.</p>

<p>"While the allure of brief internet fame might be tempting, it undermines our efforts to remain open and communicative. And quite honestly, if that is your intention, then I question where this aligns with the interests of our, THIS, community."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/647048/switch-2-versus-rog-ally-x-asus-nintendo-specs-price-screen-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has entered the ring, possibly complicating your decision of which handheld to buy this year. While Nintendo’s new console, which comes out on June 5th, may seem similar to handheld gaming PCs like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally, there’s a lot that sets them apart. Everything like how you buy and play games, their control methods, how powerful they are, and how you can expand their storage makes them different. Unique doesn’t always mean “good,” by the way.</p><p>While tech-savvy folks likely understand the key differences between each of the major handhelds, possibly enough to establish a preference, some could use a hand breaking things down. That’s exactly what I’m going to do here, specifically comparing the Switch 2 to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">Asus ROG Ally</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">Ally X</a>, two of the most popular handheld gaming PCs that aren’t a Steam Deck (in small part because they’re easy to buy at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus%2Flearn-about-rog-ally%2Fpcmcat1678398541884.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1678398541884" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>). I’ve already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/642866/nintendo-switch-2-steam-deck-lcd-oled-comparison-specs-price">compared the Switch 2 to Valve’s console</a>, so my focus here is exclusively on Asus’ consoles that have a dedicated fanbase and some great specs.</p><div><p id="pricing-and-availability"><h2>Pricing and availability</h2></p></div><p>As mentioned, the Switch 2 will launch on June 5th. Preorders were initially set to begin on April 9th, but were pushed due to the Trump administration’s global tariffs. While that situation remains in flux, it’s possible that preorders will have begun (or will soon), depending on when you read this. Assuming no changes from tariffs, the Switch 2 will be available in two pricing configurations, each with 256GB of internal storage; the $449.99 base console and a $499.99 bundle that also includes <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>. </p><p>The Asus ROG Ally is available in multiple configurations, most of which are discounted regularly (sometimes <em>steeply</em>, but for the purposes of this post, I’m going to share original retail prices). It starts at $499.99 and features the AMD Ryzen Z1 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage, while electing for the more powerful version with the Z1 Extreme APU (and no other spec improvements) bumps the price up to $649.99.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The ROG Ally X has so many improvements that it might as well be the ROG Ally 2 — and you’ll pay a premium for them. We’ll go into more detail below, but pricing starts at $799.99 for the Z1 Extreme model with 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and a bigger battery. Doubling the storage to 2TB adds $100, totaling $899.99.</p><div><p id="display-technology"><h2>Display technology</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2 and all Asus ROG Ally models (even the Ally X) have some specs in common. They each have 1080p LCD touchscreens with a 120Hz refresh rate. However, Nintendo’s handheld has a larger screen (7.9 inches to 7 inches, respectively). The Switch 2’s screen goes toe-to-toe with the Ally X with variable refresh rate (VRR), which is a great feature to have — and quite the shock to have it in the sub-$500 Switch 2 — as it prevents the screen from displaying choppiness as the frame rate fluctuates. While the Ally and Ally X feature AMD’s FreeSync Premium, the Switch 2 has a G-Sync display and HDR.</p><p>Nintendo hasn’t shared the peak brightness for the Switch 2’s screen yet, but the ROG Ally models go up to 500 nits.</p><div><p id="performance-and-battery-life"><h2>Performance and battery life</h2></p></div><p>The ROG Ally — and especially the ROG Ally X — offer some of the best performance of any handheld gaming PCs on the market. While one might think its Z1 Extreme processor is getting long in the tooth, it debuted in 2023, it’s faster than the Steam Deck, and more capable than the Z2 Go that failed to impress us in its 2025 debut device, the Lenovo Legion Go S. </p><p>You’ll get the best performance in the pricey ROG Ally X (let <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister show you some game-by-game frames per second breakdowns <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc#:~:text=Speaking%20of%20benchmarks%2C%20Alan%20Wake%20II%20isn%E2%80%99t%20the%20only%20game%20where%20the%20Ally%20X%20pulls%20ahead.%20Despite%20having%20the%20same%20AMD%20Ryzen%20Z1%20Extreme%20chip%20as%20the%20original%20ROG%20Ally%2C%20the%20faster%20memory%2C%20more%20efficient%20cooling%2C%20and%20power%20tweaks%20make%20their%20mark.">in his review</a>), thanks to its faster memory and more efficient cooling compared to the standard ROG Ally. But even the more affordable models offer a more-than-acceptable baseline, running many popular games at over 60 frames per second at 720p, and in some cases, at 1080p. Several titles can run above 100 frames per second.</p><p>The ROG Ally runs at higher power levels than the Steam Deck, yet it’s unclear whether that’s the case for the Nintendo Switch 2 as well. Nintendo is promising up to 120 frames per second with some Switch 2-exclusive titles that offer performance modes, but we’ll have to wait and see what kinds of visual compromises were made to achieve such a rare feat for a handheld. </p><p>The Switch 2 differs drastically from the ROG Ally models because of its custom Nvidia processor. While exact spec details about this Nvidia processor are slim, Nvidia has confirmed that the Switch 2 supports DLSS (Nvidia’s graphics upscaling tech), which will likely be leaned on to achieve fast frame rates in games at 1080p resolution in handheld mode and at up to 4K while the console is docked. We’re curious how DLSS looks in a low-powered device (the also-Nvidia-powered Switch from 2017 predated DLSS’ existence). For comparison, the ROG Ally supports AMD’s comparable FSR upscaling tech, though the integration sometimes results in a fuzzy-looking image.</p><p>In terms of battery life, Sean Hollister was left wanting more out of the ROG Ally consoles. While its 40Wh capacity matches the Steam Deck, it spends its battery reserve faster, even in low power modes. Hollister said in his ROG Ally review that four hours of battery life was the best case scenario compared to the Steam Deck’s seven. A lot was improved on in the ROG Ally X, beyond its impressively large 80Wh internal battery. Hollister reports that the Ally X is less power-hungry than the original, letting you game for longer.</p><p>Nintendo is currently being cagey about battery specs in the Switch 2, only sharing that it contains a 5,220mAh lithium-ion battery. It advertises battery life ranging from two to six and a half hours, depending on the game.</p><p>It’s a little strange to talk about joysticks in the performance section, but the ROG Ally models feature Hall effect joysticks, while the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644457/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controller-hall-effect-joystick-drift">Switch 2 does not</a>. Those operate with magnetized mechanisms instead of potentiometers, allowing the sticks to not wear down over time, leading to worsening performance and inaccurate inputs. Given the controversy surrounding Nintendo’s Joy-Con drift, we’re surprised and disappointed that Nintendo opted not to go with Hall-effect sticks.</p><div><p id="storage-and-docking"><h2>Storage and docking</h2></p></div><p>Both the Switch 2 and ROG Ally models use fast internal storage, albeit different types. The Switch 2 features 256GB of UFS storage (non-upgradeable), and can be expanded with microSD Express cards, which are classified as PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSDs but have the same microSD card form factor many of us are accustomed to. </p><p>The standard ROG Ally includes an M.2-2230 SSD (user-replaceable), but you’ll need to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/506956/how-to-install-m2-ssd-asus-rog-ally-x">open it up</a> to replace it. This maneuver won’t void your warranty, but it’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtQ24SghjZ0">not as simple as you might hope</a>. For something simpler, the ROG Ally supports microSD cards, including UHS-II versions with faster read and write speeds. The latter can be expensive and tough to find in stock, so I recommend going the SSD upgrade route if you really want more storage.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>One of the many improvements in the ROG Ally X is the support for M.2-2280 SSDs, full-size M.2 SSDs that aren’t shrunk down to fit into tiny gadgets. Those SSDs are much easier to find in large storage capacities (and are often discounted), so it’s a bonus that the ROG Ally X supports them as well as microSD cards.</p><p>Moving on to docking, the Switch 2 and the ROG Ally were both designed as hybrid consoles that can be enjoyed as a handheld, or by linking up to an external screen. Docking is more core to the Switch 2 experience, just as it was with the original Switch, since Nintendo includes a TV dock with the console. With it, you can game at up to 4K resolution, capped at 60 frames per second over HDMI. The dock is low-frills, containing an Ethernet port, a USB-C power plug, an HDMI port, and two USB-A 2.0 ports.</p><p>None of the ROG Ally consoles include a dock (only a 65W USB-C power adapter), though Asus makes one that’s similar in execution to the Genki Covert Dock. It’s a 65W power brick with an HDMI 2.0 port to connect to a display, and one USB-A 2.0 port for connecting an accessory. It costs $64.99 through <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-65w-charger-dock-supports-hdmi-2-0-with-usb-type-a-and-usb-type-c-for-rog-ally-black%2F6542054.p%3FskuId%3D6542054" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, but you’re better off getting something cheaper on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=rog+ally+dock&amp;i=electronics&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> from JSAUX or Anker, both of which make docks that rival the official Steam Deck docking station in terms of ports.</p><p>Of course, if you’re rolling in it, feel free to buy the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frog.asus.com%2Fus%2Fexternal-graphic-docks-group%2Fallmodels%2F" rel="sponsored">ROG XG Mobile external GPU</a> that doubles as a docking station. It plugs into the ROG Ally’s proprietary port on the top, and it’s the cost of a high-end gaming laptop. I don’t recommend it because it’s super expensive, and yet, you’ll be bottlenecked by the speed of the ROG Ally’s Ryzen Z1 APU. The ROG Ally X dropped support for the XG Mobile.</p><div><p id="games-and-software"><h2>Games and software</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2 and ROG Ally have some games in common. Many games coming to the Switch 2 in 2025 are already out on PC, including <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Split Fiction</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em>, and more (and are sometimes discounted, no less). But how you buy games on them is different, and that comes down to the software. While the Switch 2 is limited to titles on the eShop, the ROG Ally runs Windows 11. As such, you’re free to install any game platform available on that OS. That includes Steam, the Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, and others. Games are more affordable on PCs (the ROG Ally is a PC, despite its handheld form factor).</p><p>While the ability to run any game from any platform is one of Windows’ biggest advantages against the Switch 2 (and compared to the Steam Deck, as well), there are downsides. Namely, Windows 11 isn’t a great experience for handhelds, as the OS doesn’t adapt well to the built-in controls and touchscreen. On the other hand, connecting a mouse and keyboard? That’s another story. The Asus ROG Ally will be among the first handhelds not made by Valve to be supported by official SteamOS in an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">update coming soon</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2 has a special mouse mode, for which developers are creating control schemes. Games that support it will allow you to play with standard controls, then seamlessly switch to mouse-based controls when the player turns the Joy-Con 2 so that its sensor faces a hard surface. It’s intriguing, but ROG Ally players aren’t missing out on much because they can connect a wireless mouse to play their favorite games.</p><div><p id="by-the-numbers"><h2>By the numbers</h2></p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Specification</h3></th><th><h3>Nintendo Switch 2</h3></th><th><h3>Asus ROG Ally X</h3></th><th><h3>Asus ROG Ally</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck LCD</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Processor</td><td>Custom Nvidia chipset (details TBD)</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme</td><td>Custom AMD APU</td></tr><tr><td>Screen type</td><td>7.9-inch LCD</td><td>7-inch LCD</td><td>7-inch LCD</td><td>7-inch LCD</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution (handheld)</td><td>1,920 x 1080, up to 120Hz, VRR, HDR</td><td>1,920 x 1,080, up to 120Hz, VRR</td><td>1,920 x 1,080, up to 120Hz</td><td>1,280 x 800, up to 60Hz</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution (docked)</td><td>3,840 x 2,160 at 60Hz, or 1440p/1080p at up to 120Hz</td><td>3,840 x 2,160 at 60Hz</td><td>3,840 x 2,160 at 60Hz</td><td>3,840 x 2,160 at 60Hz, or 1440p at 120Hz</td></tr><tr><td>HDR10 support?</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Internal storage</td><td>256GB (UFS, non-upgradable)</td><td>1TB or 2TB (PCIe 4 M2-2280, user-replaceable)</td><td>512GB (PCIe 4 M2-2230, user-replaceable)</td><td>256GB (M2-2230, user-replaceable)</td></tr><tr><td>Expandable storage</td><td>microSD Express (up to 2TB)</td><td>microSD UHS-II</td><td>microSD UHS-II</td><td>microSD (up to 2TB)</td></tr><tr><td>Sensors</td><td>Accelerometer / gyroscope, mouse / ambient light sensor (in console)</td><td>Fingerprint / gyroscope / ambient light sensor</td><td>Fingerprint / gyroscope / ambient light sensor</td><td>Accelerometer / gyroscope / ambient light sensor</td></tr><tr><td>Ports (handheld)</td><td>2x USB-C / 3.5mm</td><td>2x USB-C / 3.5mm</td><td>1x USB-C / 3.5mm / XG Mobile port</td><td>USB-C / 3.5mm</td></tr><tr><td>Ports (dock)</td><td>2x USB-C / HDMI / ethernet</td><td>USB 2.0 / USB-C (power adapter) / HDMI 2.0 (dock not included)</td><td>USB 2.0 / USB-C (power adapter) / HDMI 2.0 (dock not included)</td><td>3x USB-A 3.1 / USB-C (power adapter) / HDMI 2.0 / DisplayPort 1.4 / Ethernet (dock not included)</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless connectivity</td><td>Wi-Fi 6 / Bluetooth / NFC</td><td>Wi-Fi 6E / Bluetooth 5.2</td><td>Wi-Fi 6E / Bluetooth 5.2</td><td>Dual-band Wi-Fi / Bluetooth 5</td></tr><tr><td>Wired connectivity</td><td>Ethernet (docked mode)</td><td>Ethernet via optional dock</td><td>Ethernet via optional dock</td><td>Ethernet via optional dock</td></tr><tr><td>Built-in mic?</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Speakers</td><td>Stereo speakers</td><td>Stereo speakers</td><td>Stereo speakers</td><td>Stereo speakers</td></tr><tr><td>Battery capacity</td><td>5,220mAh lithium-ion</td><td>80Wh battery</td><td>40Wh battery</td><td>40Wh battery</td></tr><tr><td>Battery life (est.)</td><td>2 to 6.5 hours</td><td>2 to 10 hours</td><td>2 to 4 hours</td><td>2 to 8 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Charging time</td><td>About 3 hours 30 minutes</td><td>Not advertised</td><td>Not advertised</td><td>Not advertised</td></tr><tr><td>Game card slot</td><td>Switch 2 and Switch cartridges</td><td>N/A, uses microSD card (plus internal SSD)</td><td>N/A, uses microSD card (plus internal SSD)</td><td>N/A, uses microSD card (plus internal SSD)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight (grams)</td><td>399.16g (or 535.24g with Joy-Con 2 controllers attached)</td><td>678 grams</td><td>608 grams</td><td>669 grams</td></tr><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td>4.5 x 10.7 x .55 inches</td><td>4.37 x 11.02 x 0.97-1.45 inches</td><td>4.37 x 11.02 x 0.83-1.28 inches</td><td>4.6 x 11.7 x 1.92 inches</td></tr><tr><td>Starting price</td><td>$449.99</td><td>$799.99</td><td>$499.99</td><td>$399.99</td></tr><tr><td>Available</td><td>June 5th, 2025</td><td>Now</td><td>Now</td><td>Now</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/last-of-us-season-2-episode-1-review-welcome-back-to-apocalypse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HBO's <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf991e9-1624-48e4-90de-202719d86a32" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/how-hbo-last-of-us-episode-1-adapt-game" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> was an incredible achievement for was a very spotty history of video-game-to-TV adaptations. It managed to convey the tense tones of the fungal apocalypse with the heartbreak of our protagonists for those they they loved, and the eventual repairing of those breaks with what they found. Season 2 has just begun, and we're excited to see how this quality can be maintained as they move into the storyline of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p>

<p>Ahead of the premiere, TechRaptor was lucky enough to watch <em>The Last of Us</em>&nbsp;season 2 Eeisode 1. <strong>Keep in mind there will be some spoilers for the episode below as well as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="feb0b551-7fe5-4f74-9986-717a95c8865c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a></strong>.</p>

<p>Season 2 opens with a reminder of the status quo at the end of the first. We see the final exchange between Joel and Ellie, her making him swear that what he said about the Fireflies was true, before we get to see a funeral scene attended by the surviving Fireflies and our introduction to Abby, played by Kaitlyn Dever, and her vendetta against Joel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Slowly… [...] When we kill him, we kill him slowly" - Abby</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This short opening sequence does a great job of reminding viewers where we were when we left off from season one, while setting up important characters for this next leg of the journey before jumping ahead five years into the future.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-city.jpg?itok=YjW-k9oU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-city.jpg?itok=ML2jHi6M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A New Life In A Post-Apocalyptic World</h2>

<p>The rest of the episode is set largely in the city in Wyoming, catching the viewer up on where everyone is in life, what the current status of relations are, and showing that in this post-apocalyptic world it is possible to live a relatively normal life.</p>

<p>Here we get to see Joel going about as City Planner, working to fix up new houses for settlers who need a place to stay or fixing breakers by hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The largest change in these five years has been the relationship between Joel and Ellie. In season one, the father/daughter dynamic grew when they needed to rely on one another for protection. They still have that father/daughter relationship but with Joel helicoptering (probably a side effect of the horrific way he lost his first daughter) and Ellie coming out of being a teenager and wanting to be seen as an adult she tries to distance herself.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed that even while their scenes together were tense--and who couldn't feel for Pedro Pascal's brooding expressions--that they felt very real and very normal for an otherwise not-normal world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-workshop.jpg?itok=LFmVRiac 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-workshop.jpg?itok=YjR0KJXv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ellie dilligently cleaning her weapons in the garage.</figcaption></figure><p>These 'normal' moments also do some heavy lifting to set up narrative flags, but we know that for there to be a season, there has to be conflict--even if you haven't played the games--so you can feel that these happier moments are being set up to be reflected back upon.</p>

<p>Ellie's rebellion continues on a raid where she and Dina, played by Isabela Merced, take out some clickers in an abandoned building. This character, who was teased in season 1, is Ellie's main love interest for the season and a confidant for her. We don't get to see too much other than their flirty banter, self-assuredness when taking out the infected, and their kiss, but I'm looking forward to seeing more of their relationship develop.</p>

<p>This scene also introduces the plotline of a talking infected. This is only lightly touched on, so I'm intrigued to see where this goes as the season continues.</p>

<h2>The Powerful Small Moments</h2>

<p>For a TV show about infected mushroom people and the collapse of society, my favorite scene in the episode wasn't about action or stealth but was when Joel went to visit his therapist, Gail played by Catherine O'Hara.</p>

<p>While paying for his session with a massive bag of weed, Joel is offered a drink. Gail, while remaining professional (aside from the drink) laments that this is her "first birthday without [her] husband in 41 years," a statement that makes Joel tense.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-joel-and-gail-therapist.jpg?itok=UsuKSzf4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-joel-and-gail-therapist.jpg?itok=z9tOT-XZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>O'Hara gives an amazing performance as Gail speaks her mind about how mundane Joel's problems are. She verbalizes her internal monologue of having to say the scary things, otherwise nothing will be done about them, and then an incredible delivery of why she hates Joel, how she's tried to forgive him, but that she also knows that she can't.</p>

<p>Those who have played the game know that the rest of the season is fueled by revenge--the revenge of Abby for the climactic finale of season 1, and then the retaliatory revenge of Ellie. To have a moment in episode one of someone taking the higher road, expressing their hatred and anger at another, and accepting that you can not forgive someone but also not want to retaliate back,is a perfect way to set up just how poorly every decision from here on out will be made.</p>

<p>When Gail then asks Joel to "say the thing you're afraid to say," the camera lingers on Joel as he responds to her questions, unable to answer and reveal that the world could have been healed. Then he stands up and defiantly states, "I saved her," and walks out.</p>

<p>I had chills watching Pascal as Joel, recognizing on his face that he knows what he did was for him, and not for her… and definitely not for the world.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-and-dina-dance.jpg?itok=PIFBlmuQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-and-dina-dance.jpg?itok=gprejDqT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>The Last Of Us </em>Season 2 Episode 1 Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There's a lot crammed into this episode. It doesn't exactly go anywhere, aside from knowing Abby's group is nearby. The plot doesn't move forward, but the episode does a great job to show where we are five years later.</p>

<p>We know where Joel and Ellie are at, we know Dina and her relationship with the major cast, and we know the plans and strategies of the settlement. We've been perfectly welcomed back into the world and caught up so that as things begin to go awry, we're ready to worry about our heroes (and villains).</p>

<p>I'm very excited for the continuation of this show. It makes sense that a game that many already described "as a movie" is being so wonderfully adapted for TV, but all of the little details and the stellar performances from the cast really elevate the show to be something not just for those who played the games, but for a wider audience.</p>

            <p>While PCs and smartphones will be exempt from Trump's retaliatory tariffs in the US, consoles will not.</p>
<p>That's according to former GamesIndustry.biz boss Chris Dring, who confirmed in his newsletter, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/pcs-and-smartphones-exempt-from-trump">The Game Business</a>, that not only could Nintendo's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console be impacted by the tariffs, but so too will PlayStation and Xbox's hardware.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, it's unclear if the exemptions for other tech components like SSDs and PCs were intentionally not applied to consoles or if it's merely an oversight. On the plus side, it looks as though Nintendo Switch cartridges will be spared the extra 125% levy.</p>
<p>Nintendo had already directed the vast majority of its Switch 2 manufacturing output <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-already-shipped-over-1m-vietnam-made-consoles-to-us-this-year-as-switch-2-launch-threatened-by-tariffs">from Vietnam towards the US over the first two months of this year</a>, as the threat of Trump's now-confirmed tariffs loomed, but the stinging tariffs applied to Vietnam - a key manufacturer for Nintendo - and China continue to cause considerable uncertainty.</p>
<p>This may also have the ripple effect of piting Asian players against US game studios.</p>
<p>"It is not far-fetched to think that even if 'a deal is struck' for tariffs and other issues between the US and China, Chinese consumers would protest the economic uncertainty by avoiding US products and even by avoiding US technology and games," said Lisa Hanson, CEO at <a href="https://nikopartners.com/nikos-opinion-on-tariffs-video-games-and-us-china-trade/">Niko Partners</a>.</p>
<p>"In fact, Chinese social media already has consumer discourse about a consumer-led rebuke against US-products. The same could become true in Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and so many other countries. Chinese regulators could very well block US games from ISBNs, and may even take a closer look at blocking Steam International, which is currently a major part of China’s gaming ecosystem despite officially illegally operating."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, US trade group <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">the Entertainment Software Association said the Trump administration's tariffs will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the video games industry</a> as a whole. David Cole - founder of games industry marketing and research firm DFC Intelligence - told Eurogamer his firm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-likely-to-stick-with-switch-2s-450-launch-price-despite-trump-tariffs-says-analyst">expected Nintendo to stick with its $450 launch pricing for Switch 2</a>, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">temporarily briefly pausing pre-orders in the US and Canada</a>. Pre-order invites for American players are now expected to go out <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/">"starting 8th May"</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic has finally opened up about its recent acquisition, assuring its staff as well as players that the tentpole franchise will "not undergo any major changes" after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">Niantic was sold to Saudi-backed Monopoly Go maker Scopely as part of a $3.5bn deal</a> last month.</p>
<p>In a general all-hands meeting that united both companies last week in Japan, Niantic representatives sought to assuage concerns, insisting that Scopely bought Niantic because of the success of its games, not because it wants to change them.</p>

<p>"The direction of our game will not undergo any major changes under the influence of Scopely," a Niantic spokesperson told those at the meeting, as reported by <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/mobile/articles/2504/10/news182.html">ITMedia</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-go-will-not-change-due-to-scopelys-influence-niantic-assures-following-acquisition/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"[Scopely] will just be supporting its further improvement, and we will keep doing what we've been doing since the beginning. To put it more bluntly – please rest assured that we will not be shutting down the game."</p>
<p>The Niantic exec said there was nothing else to announce at this time, but did hint that the company will continue to "evolve" Pokémon Go over time.</p>
<p>As Tom recently summarised for us, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">Pokémon Go fans had expressed deep concern over Scopely's acquisition</a> of the game, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">word of the deal leaked online</a>. The hugely-popular mobile game has over 20 million weekly active players, with an average of 40 minutes daily playtime, and is set to celebrate its 10th anniversary in 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Marathon - the upcoming reimagined PvP extraction shooter from the Sony-owned Bungie - will release on 23rd September, 2025, with a closed Alpha test kicking off on April 23.</p>
<p>Bungie finally revealed Marathon's release date in a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-is-finally-getting-a-reveal-this-week">lengthy teasers, all embedded below, showing off its gameplay and cinematics over the weekend</a>.</p>

<p>"Marathon is a team-based extraction shooter set around the mysterious and cutthroat world of Tau Ceti IV," the voiceover teases. "You are a Runner, a cybernetic mercenary who's given up their human form for a biosynethic shell with unique abilities and stats, capable of both tactical and fast-paced combat.</p>
<p>"Here, you'll fight in a crew of up to three players across a variety of zones and points of interest. You'll face rival Runners in zones of up to 18 players, countless security forces, and otherworldly threats. To scavenge the remains of a lost colony for glory and fortune."</p>
<p>There are six classes, although only four were revealed; stealthy Void, tanky Glitch, as well as Locus and Blackbird. All four will be available in the upcoming alpha test, and there's no need to race to lock in your favourite as you ready up - your team can play as three Voids if you want, as there's no limit.</p>

<p>It goes on to describe the scavengable environments of Tau Ceti IV - they're "filled with weapons, materials, and equipment" - with sponsorship from factions able to help replenish your armoury.</p>
<p>It also stresses that Marathon has been designed to play as fireteams, with contextual pings, shared objectives, and down-but-not-out mechanics, although there is the ability to opt out of crew queues if you're a lone wolf wanting to "take all the glory for yourself as a solo Runner".</p>
<p>"Before deploying, you'll strategically build your loadout and select a Runner to ensure you're equipped for the run ahead. Your objective is simple: get in, gather as much loot as you can, and make it out alive. Die, and all your gear will be up for grabs. Survive, and your loot can be taken into future runs as you grow in power and fill your vault."</p>
<p>That said, death is, apparently, "inevitable, but it's never the end".</p>

<p>"Bungie brings its best in class, first-person person multiplayer action to the forefront. Dynamic and tactile gunplay. Runners with unique playstyles and customisable builds create highly dynamic and strategic team fights."</p>
<p>Because of its timed matches, dynamic events, variable weather, and unpredictable players, Bungie reckons no two matches will be the same. There'll also be endgame challenges, ranked play, secrets, seasonal storytelling, community events, "and more" in season one.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, Bungie also warns that no matter how geared up you are, "players with skill and strategy will always have the edge".</p>
<p>Marathon is coming to PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S with full cross-play and cross-save.</p>
<p>In case you were wondering, no, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-wont-require-a-playstation-network-account-on-pc-and-xbox">you won't need a PlayStation Network account to play Marathon</a> on PC or Xbox.</p>
<p>In response to a comment shared on Marathon's Discord channel in which one user said they were a tad "spooked" by the idea of having to use a PSN login to play, the Marathon team replied with a clear cut and straight to the point message: "Marathon will not require a PlayStation Account for players on PC and Xbox."</p>

<p>Marathon is set to be a game-changing extraction shooter, but it’s hard to break into a genre that’s so dominated by existing titles. For instance, Escape from Tarkov has held the top spot in that vertical for many years, and those that have tried to challenge the game have ultimately failed or fallen to the wayside.</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon will attempt to rival the likes of Escape from Tarkov by <strong>not </strong>rivalling Escape from Tarkov. That’s straight from the mouth of the game’s director, Joe Ziegler, who recently sat down with Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky to discuss all aspects of the upcoming shooter.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-most-interesting-stories">‘The Most Interesting Stories’</h2>



<p>Joe Ziegler was transparent when talking to Jake Lucky about Marathon following a recent behind-closed-doors playtest. He suggested that the reason why extraction shooters fail is because they come in and worry about competing with other, existing titles – but it’s all about trying to be <strong>different enough </strong>to live alongside those top dogs.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon TELL ALL with Bungie's Joe Ziegler" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTSnXKDpQvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In another recent interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-boss-says-industry-doomed-to-unnecessarily-brutal-layoffs-while-chasing-after-the-battle-royales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arrowhead’s Johan Pilestedt</a> explained that trying to replicate the success of a game like Escape from Tarkov will always be fruitless because people don’t want to play the same game over and over again.</p>



<p>That’s what Ziegler alluded to in his interview with Jake Lucky:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I might be naive in saying this but I’ll be honest… To me, I don’t think of making games as like, directly competing and trying to eat a bunch of other people’s lunch. For me, whenever I think about it, it’s like, how do we offer something that’s interesting and cool and can live in its own space alongside other titles and be just as big and important as others.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With that being said, Bungie has worked from a variety of perspectives to make Marathon as unique as possible.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We really do want to create some of the most interesting stories you’ve ever had, and we’re inputting a lot of dynamics to make that happen. At the end of a night of playing Marathon, we want you to tell a really cool story to somebody else, you know? To be excited.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team is also making Marathon the most accessible extraction shooter in the market, doing away with punishing mechanics and a steep learning curve to make something that everyone can play and enjoy. They’re hellbent on ‘breaking the already existing military space’ and making something much more adventurous in Marathon.</p>



<p>Do you think Marathon can exist happily alongside a dominant extraction shooter like Escape from Tarkov? Let me know in the comments what you think, or visit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/13/tyranny-oppression-through-the-lens-of-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Throughout history and, unfortunately, right up to the present day, the world has thousands of examples of tyranny and oppression, where powerful groups use their influences to exert force over smaller or less powerful groups. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-remaster-review/">Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</a> may not seem like the first port of call when considering this topic, but its story does touch upon the elements of tyranny, oppression, and resistance. The points this essay will touch upon include the use of military against a peaceful nation, the kidnapping of a group of people, those being the Gobbos, Baron Dante’s tyrannical actions, and Croc’s actions as a resistance fighter and liberator.</p>
<h2>Baron Dante’s Tyranny</h2>
<p>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos starts with the Gobbos taking in an abandoned baby Croc, raising him as one of their own. From what we see in the opening moments, the Gobbos are a peaceful society that work together to maintain a homeland where everyone is treated with respect, kindness, and supported. There seems to be no conflict within Gobbo society, nor does this society come across a warmongering. In fact, they seem almost childlike and naïve to the dangers of the wider world around them with barely any preparedness when having an aggressor as a neighbour. The most basic of plans seem to revolve around Croc saving them, but if he fails then Gobbo society goes extinct.</p>
<p><iframe title="Croc Legend of the Gobbos Remaster OUT NOW!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1CBD8kgxlDw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Completely unexpectedly, at least to the Gobbos, Baron Dante launches an invasion of the Gobbo homeland with his Dantini military at his side. Such is the ferocity of the attack, the Gobbos lose their homes as the Dantini army begin destroying everything. Moments before all the Gobbos are captured, King Gobbo manages to help Croc escape, giving a slither of hope in these dark times.</p>
<p>Post invasion, Baron Dante appears to order that each Gobbo is isolated away from their kin, with everyone thrown in their own cage, box, or used as a prize in mini games with only a brief shot of escape. Here, we can draw out that Baron Dante had no care for Gobbo society and what it stood for, was fine with separating families and putting his Gobbo prisoners in solitary confinement. To further exacerbate this, each Gobbo is imprisoned in areas that have no basic facilities, instead placed in some incredibly dangerous areas that could end up fatal for them. The minigames beg the question that if Croc did not win them, were these Gobbos to be prizes for those invited to take part, and trafficked away with their families never knowing what happened to them?</p>


<p>Baron Dante’s oppression and tyranny is not just saved for the Gobbos. Through the game we see that he does not respect the free will of most other creatures. As Croc makes progress in his liberation mission, Baron Dante uses his power to turn innocent creatures into unwilling combatants within his army, forcing them to fight Croc. These individuals do get hurt in their battles but if they fail they are left to carry on with their lives. They regain their freedom but it shows that Baron Dante has no duty of responsibility towards these drafted soldiers, leaving them to their fates.</p>
<h2>Croc As A Leader of Resistance</h2>
<p>Most that become symbols of resistance do not necessarily choose to become such symbols but are forced to through the events that occur around them. Martin Luther King Jr, Nelson Mandela, Bhagat Singh, Tiananmen Square’s Tank man, Harriet Tubman, Volodymyr Zelensky. These are just some notable figures who have stood up to either lead resistance against more powerful adversaries or become symbols of resistance themselves. Croc is an individual that is forced to act in his own world against a member of the royalty in Baron Dante and all of the resources available to him. This is another showdown between a focused yet disadvantaged person taking on a complex power structure to force a change for the better.</p>
<p>Croc is outnumbered with no allies except Beany, who can teleport Croc to new areas. No one else takes up the cause to free the Gobbos from their prison. This could be down to several reasons. First, there’s a clear lack of information available to anyone else who otherwise would have helped. Baron Dante would tightly control any message from the region, and the invasion of the Gobbos is something he may not have publicised. Second could be fear. It could be other groups have heard of the invasion and displacement of the Gobbos, but do not act out of fear that Baron Dante will turn his forces against them. Third, any other resistance has already been dealt with. We do not know the full history of the region, but Baron Dante may have already crushed other resistances that were rising up giving him free reign over his part of the land.</p>

<p>Croc is essentially a guerrilla fighter, striking at targets quickly to free up his Gobbo family from their prisons before quickly moving to the next area. While the path that he can take is quite predictable, he is not at first seen of as much of a threat with very little of the Dantini military standing in his way at the start. However, as Croc marches onwards and dispatches foes Baron Dante increase security to protect himself. Croc shows very little mercy to those who get in his way, engaging in close quarters combat to fight against the oppressors. This showcases how little in the way of resources Croc has as he has not even armed himself with a weapon, and even if he was it is unlikely he would know how to use it having been raised by the Gobbos.</p>
<p>After facing the trials of navigating hostile environments, and fighting willing and unwilling enemy soldiers, Croc eventually confronts Baron Dante having freed the Gobbos and dismantled much of Baron Dante’s power structure. Croc successfully overthrows Baron Dante and takes his people back to their homeland, with the world around them once again thriving. While this is a good ending for the Croc and Gobbos, it leaves behind another land where there is no one in charge which paves the way for a power struggle and further strife that will impact the Gobbos again. Filling that vacuum is not Croc’s responsibility, but this does show that even successful resistance movements can lead to unintended consequences.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos is a game that on its surface looks like a standard, colourful, and innocent platformer. What this essay has outlined is that Croc: Legend of the Gobbos actually tells a story of oppression, tyranny, forced displacement, the imbalance of power, and the need for resistance against tyranny. If there is no resistance then the majority of victims will be the innocent, like the childlike and naïve Gobbos. Croc is an unexpected symbol of resistance but his actions show that even one person with the necessary drive can bring about change for the better in an unjust world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-doesnt-have-proximity-chat/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been confirmed that Bungie’s Marathon will not have proximity chat despite the developers wanting the game to be a ‘social extraction experience’.</p>



<p>The news of no proximity chat came via a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/marathon-wont-have-proximity-chat-because-itd-be-way-too-toxic-i-dont-think-anyone-has-a-good-solution-to-that-just-yet/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>, game director Joe Ziegler told PC Gamer that they don’t “have a solution yet” when it comes to the toxicity that proximity chat brings to players.</p>



<p>“I don’t think anyone really has a good solution to that just yet. Because we’re so dedicated to making sure that we’re creating a safe space where we don’t have players just flaming each other or doing terrible things to one another, I think we’re not ready to invest in prox chat until we have a solution,” he said.</p>







<p>The comments come <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-wants-marathon-to-be-a-social-extraction-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following an interview that we published in collaboration with Jake Lucky</a>, where in the same day of interviews Joe Ziegler told Lucky that they want the game to be “more of a social extraction experience”.</p>



<p>Ziegler explained, “The key thing for us was making Marathon a little bit more of a social extraction experience where there’s a lot value in playing with other people that you know or people that you want and you all feel like you can create that adventure together and we’re not trying to fragment you all the time, you know?”</p>



<p>In the interview, Ziegler gave the example of being able to be respawned instead of just watching your teammates complete the match, or another example of “data cards” where your entire team can cash them out together.</p>



<p>However, I think a <strong>big point</strong> is being missed here and the conflicting comments are a bit of a head scratcher. Proximity chat ADDS the much-needed social aspect to a game and while I understand Bungie’s stance on toxicity, surely players who don’t want to engage with proximity chat can just… you know… turn it off? Or better yet, just give players the ability to report others for toxicity. These are not new ideas and with the right infrastructure (moderation), they are the solution that Bungie is looking for.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, you’re never going to stop people from being toxic, no matter what you do.</p>



<p>Without proximity chat, Bungie is missing the mark entirely on not only what makes extraction shooters fun and exciting and to be honest… Makes the whole ‘social extractions shooter’ comment laughable.</p>



<p>Marathon is set to be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on September 23, 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of Bungie not having proximity chat in Marathon? Let me know what you think on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>, or post a comment below.</p>

    <div>
        
<p>A new list of characters that are supposedly coming to Fortnite in the near future have been leaked online.</p>



<p>The leak comes courtesy of ShpeshalNick of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnJBa4Q0JSw&amp;ab_channel=XboxEra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra podcast</a>, who has a tendency to be fairly accurate when it comes to Fortnite information. According to Nick, the following characters are coming to Fortnite sometime in the future:</p>



<ul>
<li>Jack Black (apparently its just Jack Black and not connected to the Minecraft release)</li>



<li>More Mortal Kombat Characters</li>



<li>Death Stranding Characters</li>



<li>Tony Hawk Pro Skater Characters</li>



<li>DOOM The Dark Ages Doom Slayer (a DOOM slayer version of The Dark Ages model)</li>



<li>Double Dragons Characters (Billy and Jimmy)</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Characters</li>



<li>Agent 47 (Hitman)</li>



<li>Marvel Characters (in a pixel art style)</li>



<li>A player from the NBA</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-tony-hawk-fortnite-event">Tony Hawk Fortnite Event</h2>



<p>Another surprising detail to come from the leak is that Nick also revealed that there is going to be some kind of Tony Hawk Pro Skater event, but what that looks like is currently unknown and which characters will be coming to Fortnite from the game is unclear (obviously we can assume Tony Hawk himself is one).</p>



<p>You can watch the full discussion of the leak below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 has already been confirmed to release on July 11</a>, 2025, so it’s entirely possible that the event will be take place around the release. But as Nick points out, Epic Games has been notorious in the past with not abiding by any key dates, so it could release before or after the games release.</p>



<p>Which characters are you most looking forward to seeing coming to Fortnite?&nbsp;Let me know what you think on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>, or post a comment below.</p>

                        <p>It might seem insane to be making a new extraction shooter in 2025, but Bungie is doing it with Marathon – and this is why.</p>
