            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As a response to the enforcement of the UK Online Safety Act (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-requires-age-verification-in-the-uk-for-mature-game-pages/">VGC</a>), Valve has begun requesting and requiring that UK players verify their age if they want to access any content pages marked as 'mature' on the platform.</p>



<p>Unlike other age verification processes we've started to see that <a href="https://wccftech.com/youtube-tests-ai-powered-age-verification-in-the-u-s-to-safeguard-teens/">rely on AI tools</a>, Valve is taking a simpler approach, and enforcing age verification through users inputting their credit card on Steam. A <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/fr/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6">support page outlining how it'll work</a> explains that this route was chosen due to UK regulations around needing to be 18 years of age to have a credit card in your name, and because "<em>this process preserves the maximum degree of user privacy</em>."</p>



<p>Users online began to notice this was in effect as of last Friday, according to VGC, though if you're over 18 with your own credit card registered to your Steam account, then you wouldn't have known the verification had begun since you would already be past its requirements.</p>



<p>"<em>In the UK, Ofcom is the independent regulator for online safety. Ofcom's guidance on the OSA states that one highly effective age assurance measure is credit card checks. This is because, in the UK, an individual must be at least 18 years of age to obtain a credit card, therefore credit card issuers are obliged to verify the age of an applicant before providing them with a credit card.</em>..<em>The data processed in the verification process is identical to that of the millions of other Steam users who make purchases or store their payment details for convenience. The verification process therefore provides no information about a user's content preferences to payment providers or other third parties.</em>"</p>



<p>Valve is one of several companies that have begun instituting age verification. Some, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-age-verification-changes-uk-eu-users/">Nexus Mods</a>, are still trying to work out how age verification will be implemented, but have confirmed that it is coming. Others, like Rockstar's <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-age-verification/">GTA Online</a> have yet to confirm that it is being implemented, but some version of verification being enforced seems highly likely. So far, these verification implementations have mostly impacted users in the UK and the EU.</p>

            <p>Are you from the UK and partial to risque adult Steam games, such as Amarillo's Butt Slapper - the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> of Butt Slapping - or the timelessly iconic MILFs of Sunville? Bad! Naughty! GO DIRECTLY TO BED. Unless you have a valid credit card. Steam have begun rolling out a requirement for all UK-based users to verify their ages, if they wish to access store pages for games rated mature.</p>
<p>You should already have done this, of course, if you've bought anything on Steam, which I'm going to assume is 90% of you, with the other 10% being GOG stopouts, holier-than-thou Itch lovers and stinky pirates. According to reports, debit cards are acceptable too.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The regulation follows the passing of the UK's Online Safety Act, which now requires a host of online platforms to impose age verification systems, so as to protect younger people from pornography. I will offer no further comment on the OSA at this stage - it's after 2pm on Friday, which is far too late in the week to have Opinions - but I'm relieved to discover that I can still google images of donkey willies on a work PC. Eurogamer's Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a> has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">a fuller write-up</a>, if you're interested.</p>
<p>Valve have a <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/fr/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6">Steam blog</a> up, which explains the process for age verification and the need for a credit card in particular.</p>
<p>"In the UK, Ofcom is the independent regulator for online safety. Ofcom's guidance on the OSA states that one highly effective age assurance measure is credit card checks," it reads. "This is because, in the UK, an individual must be at least 18 years of age to obtain a credit card, therefore credit card issuers are obliged to verify the age of an applicant before providing them with a credit card.
</p>
<p>"Having the credit card stored as a payment method acts as an additional deterrent against circumventing age verification by sharing a single Steam user account among multiple persons," the post continues.
</p>
<p>According to the Redditors who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1n34vzd/uk_users_must_verify_their_age_to_access_steam/">spotted all this earlier today</a> (ta, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-requires-age-verification-in-the-uk-for-mature-game-pages/">VGC</a>), debit cards appear to be acceptable at least for the time being. Which is good, because I don't have a credit card, and I'd sure hate to be unable to buy *googles random adult games again* "Ideology In Friction"? I didn't know Althusser made a porno.</p><p>Valve have had a busy few months in terms of adult-rated controversy. As you're hopefully very well aware, given that we wouldn't shut up about it, they've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">changed</a> Steam's regulations to give banks and credit card networks a say on the definition of acceptable NSFW games. A bunch of games have been delisted as a consequence. In connection to all that, Paypal recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-explain-why-using-paypal-for-steam-purchases-isnt-currently-an-option-in-a-whole-bunch-of-countries">pulled support for Steam purchases in certain countries</a> at the behest of one of their acquiring banks.</p>

              <p>Hit the button! The big red one. Over <em>there</em>. Fine, I’ll hit it. *LOUD MUSIC STARTS* Folks, it’s Friday! We made it to the weekend. But first, before you go off and enjoy the last work day of the week, please read today’s Morning Checkpoint. Today, we’re talking about <em>The Last of Us </em>TV show, looking at the future of S<em>pace Marine 2,</em> checking out some sales data for<em> Cyberpunk 2077,</em> and learning what Kojima thinks of AI. Someone hit that button again. It’s too loud, I can’t think.</p> <h2>Hideo Kojima thinks AI is the next big gaming revolution</h2> <p>The <em>Death Stranding 2</em> director was in the midst of his Saudi Arabia tour stop when he opined on how games are changing. “Gaming is always about technology,” he said during a panel discussion, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/hideo-kojima-nicolas-winding-refn-blur-lines-games-cinema-1235416035/"><em>Rolling Stone</em> reports</a>. “At first, the games were all 2D, about 16 colors, 16 bits…the biggest, first change was [that] games became 3D. The second is we [became] connected by [the] internet, and you could play [online]. The third is the trend right now that AI is now coming into game creation, and we have not just ChatGPT, but they learn from how the players control. And I think that you’ll take advantage of that.”</p> <p>But Kojima seems more interested in going to the movies or visiting museums than chatting with bots and playing games. “I probably just play maybe one game a year,” he said.</p>

 <h2><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Switch 2 sold far more physical copies than digital</h2> <p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/75-of-cyberpunk-2077s-nintendo-switch-2-sales-were-physical/">As spotted by <em>VGC</em></a>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> developer CD Projekt revealed during the company’s latest financial results that its open-world sci-fi RPG featuring Keanu Reeves was a big hit on Switch 2. Interestingly, 75 percent of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> copies sold on Switch 2 in June were physical game cards. This is notable as CD Projekt Red opted not to use the controversial game key card system, and instead, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was one of the biggest third-party Switch 2 launch window games to ship entirely on a physical game cart.</p> <p>Considering <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was reportedly the <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-set-a-us-launch-month-record-at-1-6-million-units/">best-selling third-party game on Nintendo’s new console</a>, it seems Switch 2 owners, at least for now, prefer a real physical copy over key card shenanigans.</p>

 <h2><em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em> is getting a brand new class in 2026</h2> <p><em>Space Marine 2</em> launched a year ago this month. To celebrate the third-person shooter entering its second year, <a href="https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/news/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-unveils-its-year-2-roadmap-and-sets-its-anniversary-update-to-september-4">Saber Interactive has released a new roadmap</a> for it that promises a lot of new content, including a new class: The Techmarine. The studio didn’t share many details about the new class, but did confirm that Techmarines will get to wield Omnissiah Axes, a new exclusive weapon. Beyond the new class, the next year of content includes new PVE missions, PVP maps, fresh cosmetic options, and more.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Space Marine 2 - Year 2 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CxtlJ06u_lc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>New report claims Sony is planning a Switch-like PS6 handheld</h2> <p>YouTube channel and reliable tech leaker and reporter <a href="https://youtu.be/x-A3Bl2hXoQ">Moore’s Law Is Dead claims in a new video</a> to have seen multiple documents mentioning that Sony is working on a portable, handheld PlayStation 6 console that will launch alongside a more powerful, traditional machine. Notably, the channel claims that this PS6 handheld will support the ability to dock and connect to a TV, like the Switch, turning it into a more traditional home console. Moore’s Law Is Dead speculates that this PS6 portable console might cost around $500 and could ship sometime in 2027.</p>

 <h2>Bella Ramsey tells <em>Last of Us</em> TV show haters to go play the game</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-star-bella-ramsey-has-a-message-for-the-haters/1100-6534348/">As reported by <em>GameSpot</em> and <em>Culture Crave</em>,&nbsp;</a> Ellie actor Bella Ramsey talked about HBO’s <em>The Last of Us</em> and its already aired season two, as well as the upcoming season three. She discussed the death of Joel in season two and negative reactions to the show’s second year, saying:</p> <p>“There is nothing I can do about it anyway. The show is out. There is nothing that can be changed or altered [for Season 2]. There is not really any point in reading or looking at anything. People are of course entitled to their opinions. It doesn’t affect the show, it doesn’t affect how the show continues or anything, in any way, so they’re very separate things to me. So no, I just don’t really engage.”</p> <p>She also added that people who dislike the series can stop watching, explaining, “I would say, you don’t have to watch it. If you hate it that much, the game exists. You can just play the game again. You don’t have to watch [Season 3]. If you do want to watch it, I hope you enjoy it,”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/voidbreaker-fps-review-steam-pc-gamepass-titanfall-roguelike-roguelite-2000621067">The best new game you’re not playing is <i>Hades</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>Portal</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>Titanfall</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>Battlefield</i></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-blizzard-union-ai-layoffs-microsoft-2000621003"><em>Diablo</em> developers unionized: “Passion can’t protect us from job instability”</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-woa-freelancer-world-of-assassination-roguelike-2000620985"><em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em> quietly became a lot more than just the best stealth game around</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="I Bought 100 Copies of Mario Paint for the Art" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHuQZVtzdIo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

<p>Video games can take a long time to make. Certain titles receive extensive development time—Hollow Knight: Silksong being an apt case study. Its development became one of myth and legend at one point, but Team Cherry’s carefully created baby is ready to be born into the world.</p>



<p>I played <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong at Gamescom 2025</a>. My 15-minute demo gave me instant hope that the sequel is going to live up to the fevered hype. I’ve said before that you will struggle to find an indie sequel with this much popularity and pressure resting on its nimble shoulders.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>‘s development ride has taken a few detours. Let’s revisit history and fill in some blanks for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-has-team-cherry-developed-hollow-knight-silksong-for">How Long Has Team Cherry Developed Hollow Knight: Silksong For?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hopefully, it’s worth the wait. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s estimated that Hollow Knight: Silksong’s development first began in 2018, meaning the game has been in development for seven long years!</strong></p>



<p>This means official work on Silksong began only one year after Hollow Knight was released, and a year before the general public was introduced to Hollow Knight: Silksong altogether.</p>



<p>A fascinating article was released in August 2025 detailing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why Hollow Knight: Silksong took so long to release</a>. Quite simply, Team Cherry was having too much fun crafting the game, experimenting with new ideas, and making sure Silksong was worthy of being a sequel—instead of the DLC it was originally intended as.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-was-hollow-knight-silksong-first-announced">When Was Hollow Knight: Silksong First Announced?</h2>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong was first revealed to the world on Feb. 14, 2019, through its reveal trailer.</strong></p>



<p>You can find the “Hollow Knight: Silksong Reveal Trailer” on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TeamCherry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Team Cherry</a>‘s YouTube channel. The two-minute trailer shows off a decent amount of Silksong, and it seemed like it wouldn’t be <em>that </em>long until we got our hands on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-hollow-knight-silksong-a-sequel-or-prequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a>.</p>



<p>Little did we know that it would take over six years until the game launched (and it’s still not technically out yet).</p>



<p>Check out the original reveal trailer below and see if you can spot anything from the Silksong demo or recent trailers and footage.</p>

<hr>



<p>You can throw the words myth and legend into the bin. Silksong is coming. Team Cherry’s effort should be worth the wait, and I’ll be diving into Pharloom the second it launches. I’m genuinely so excited for Silksong, but let me know your thoughts on it through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p>You should also stick around and see if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong is on the Switch or Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-to-play-hollow-knight-before-silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if you need to play Hollow Knight before Silksong</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/analysis-key-takeaways-from-gamescom-the-worlds-largest-games-event.1284018/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The recent slowdown in the global games market has had a noticeable impact on industry events, with many leading conferences and trade shows experiencing reduced footfall or struggling to expand their show floors. It was therefore an encouraging sign for the industry to see Gamescom, the world's largest games event, continue to buck the trend. This year's event welcomed 357,000 visitors from 128 countries, an increase of 7 percent over 2024, with over 34,000 trade visitors, up 6 percent year-on-year. The number of exhibitors also grew by 7 percent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, the developer-focused sister event, Devcom—soon to be rebranded as "Gamescom Dev"—also enjoyed record attendance, with 5,400 participants, signaling sustained interest in developer-oriented sessions despite broader market challenges. The contrast between Gamescom's bustling floors and the struggles of other events over the past year underscores its position as a central meeting point for both trade and consumer audiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All major game companies, with the exception of PlayStation, participated in Gamescom 2025. As in previous years, China-based publishers maintained a particularly strong presence at Gamescom, not through traditional publisher branding, but through content-focused booths emphasizing live-service offerings. Many of these companies are still seeking to expand their footprint in Western markets, using Gamescom as a platform to showcase their IP to a broader audience.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While an event of this scale inevitably encompasses countless news stories and themes, a number of key topics stood out to the Omdia analyst team at this year's show. These trends and developments provide a window into the broader dynamics shaping the global games industry in 2025 and beyond.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nascent PC handhelds category plant roots for Xbox's future&nbsp;">Nascent PC handhelds category plant roots for Xbox's future&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the start of this decade, Microsoft set out an ambitious goal—to reach a billion gamers worldwide. The strategy relied on three pillars the rapid growth of Xbox Game Pass, cloud streaming to multiple devices, and strong adoption of the Xbox Series X/S consoles. Five years later, none of these have scaled as the company hoped. Game Pass growth has stalled and cloud gaming hasn't resonated to a new audience, meanwhile, active installed base of Xbox consoles is estimated to be flatlining around 42m players by the end of 2025, according to Omdia's Games Addressable Market Metrics Database.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamescom 2025 highlighted Microsoft's evolving strategy to reach its goal. Aside from its continued commitment to bring games to competing consoles including the Switch 2, the company is now placing much greater emphasis on PC as a core engagement platform, and making much-needed investments in Windows to serve as an aggregator of PC games content.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This strategy is being led by the new full-screen experience for Windows—an Xbox-like interface on the PC—which is scheduled to debut alongside Microsoft's first co-branded PC gaming handheld: The Asus ROG Xbox Ally. The new full screen experience solves a core challenge plaguing PC gaming handhelds to date, most notably Windows' poor suitability for the form factor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it also pulls through content from additional storefronts such as Steam. This integration offers a clearer picture of Microsoft's broader ambition: to leverage the massive PC gaming audience as a touchpoint for Xbox software and services. Omdia's Addressable Market Metrics Database estimates Steam had 316 million yearly active users at the end of 2024, representing a huge audience for Microsoft to engage. Yet many questions remain unanswered, including the mismatch of Xbox content between console platforms and the PC. Furthermore, much needed functionality, such as advanced shader delivery and the Handheld Compatibility Program, are unlikely to bear fruit for years.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nonetheless, Microsoft is playing a long game. The functionality revealed at Gamescom provides a solid starting point, and handheld PCs running Windows will soon get a much-overdue shot in the arm. Omdia estimates 2.3 million devices will be sold through to consumers in 2025—representing a small, but meaningful avenue to expand Xbox's presence on PC.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Focus turns to practical applications of AI in game development">Focus turns to practical applications of AI in game development</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">AI was not as immediately visible at Gamescom this year as at some recent trade shows, perhaps reflecting that the initial phase of the hype cycle may have peaked. Beneath the surface, it's clear that more substantive applications of AI are coming to the fore. Companies such as AWS and Google are shifting from promoting AI in the abstract to working with customers on the details of implementation. A similar shift could be seen in the content program at Devcom with a higher proportion of AI-related talks focusing on specific applications.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is also increasing clarity about where these early AI implementations can have most impact. While AI tools will almost certainly eventually have an enormous impact on the core creative workflows of game development, immediate gains have been slow to emerge due to a combination of challenges of integration and limitations of the underlying technology. On the other hand, business-focused use cases—especially in marketing, user acquisition, and LiveOps—are already showing increasing compelling results, suggesting that these are the areas where the impact of AI will be most immediately felt in the games industry.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nintendo Switch 2 remains in a state of soft launch">Nintendo Switch 2 remains in a state of soft launch</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite its record-breaking launch in June, Switch 2 saw a limited presence on the show floor, outside of Nintendo's own booth. Omdia learned that a shortage of development hardware continues – even amongst long-time publishing partners – and has greatly hampered publishers' ability to release Switch 2 content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The wider event brought few surprises in terms of reveals for previously-unannounced Switch 2 games. This extends to major titles such as Microsoft's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which was slated for a vague 2026 release window. In short, Omdia believes the wider publishing opportunity for Switch 2 will remain uncontestable to all third-party publishers until at least 2026.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For 2025, Nintendo's strategy appears focused on building Switch 2's installed base through a highly curated approach: monthly first-party releases, select second-party releases such as Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, and a limited selection of hand-picked third-party content from its most trusted partners. This is in line with Omdia's prediction that Nintendo would throttle the volume of new releases to Switch 2 software breathing room on a crowded Nintendo eShop. Nevertheless, for publishers, the wider content opportunity remains on the horizon.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Backend infrastructure providers face headwinds&nbsp;">Backend infrastructure providers face headwinds&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The AI boom stands in contrast to a noticeably more gloomy mood in the market for traditional servers in backend infrastructure, particularly the smaller players hoping to break the dependance of the majority of game studios on hyperscale cloud and in-house tooling. There are undoubtedly success stories in the backend market, notably Heroic Labs which hosted a lavish celebration of its tenth anniversary at Gamescom. The desire to showcase the company's longevity is itself telling, however, serving to highlight a challenge faced by all startups hoping to provide studios with critical infrastructure: convincing prospective customers that you will be around for the long haul.

But with the market highly fragmented and momentum slow to develop, it seems inevitable that many backend service providers will fail over the next few years. The survivors may yet deliver on their early promise, but there was increasing acceptance from industry insiders at Gamescom that the prospects of rapid growth were receding and winning over developers would be a long-term project.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Appendix">Appendix</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Further reading:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Omdia and Game Developer are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Authors</h2><div><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Principal Analyst, Games Tech, Omdia</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Liam leads Omdia’s games tech coverage with his research focusing on the technology and services that power the video games market, and exploring the B2B value chain connecting games development to service providers to consumers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prior to joining Omdia, Liam worked at Irdeto, a digital platform security company and owner of Denuvo, a leading provider of security technology to the games industry, where he advised senior management and product teams on market trends and strategy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Long Story Short&nbsp;</em>is the latest animated series from&nbsp;<em>Bojack Horseman</em>&nbsp;creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg, with art by Lisa Hanawalt of&nbsp;<em>Bojack</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Tuca &amp; Bertie</em>. Despite this pedigree, it feels like it's slipped under the radar a bit, with many folks we know remarking that they didn't even know it was out. Riley and Isaiah have both watched it, and we're here to talk what we loved about it, and what hit a bit too close to home.</p><p><strong>(Spoilers for <em>Long Story Short</em> follow.)</strong></p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Hello, Isaiah! You and I have both finished Netflix's <em>Long Story Short</em>. I totally loved it, and was shocked--which sounds weird to say--by how funny it was. What did you think?</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>When I first caught wind that the creator of<em>&nbsp;Bojack Horseman</em>&nbsp;was back with a new animated series about a family, I was really worried it'd be another oppressively depressing watch like&nbsp;<em>Bojack&nbsp;</em>was. And, like, for all the wonderful writing and brutally honest things <em>Bojack</em> had to say about Hollywood and how stars cope or make their scandals worse, that show was a huge feel-bad watch from pillar to post. So I assumed <em>Long Story Short</em> would be more the same, with the added feel-bad factor of it following a family over time. Long story short on my preface here: I was surprised with how much it didn't suck to watch!</p><p>If anything, I feel I might've enjoyed the show more because it was about a tight-knit family and their problems over Hollywood bullshit.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Long Story Short | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wWziW_vQ_L4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I feel like the tide has really turned on how people feel about&nbsp;<em>Bojack</em>, and I'm not quite sure when or why that happened. Maybe because I got sober while <em>Bojack</em> was airing, and then Bojack the character&nbsp;got sober in the show's final season, but I found that show really moving and I rewatch it a lot, and I always feel a little miffy that people seem to not like it now. If anything, I found&nbsp;<em>Long Story Short</em>&nbsp;a bit grimmer in the way its characters are trapped in a familial cycle of hurt and bickering, with a certain kind of "no way out" vibe that I think&nbsp;<em>Bojack&nbsp;</em>does, eventually, find a way to free its characters from.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>I think for me,&nbsp;<em>Bojack</em>'s gap between moments of levity and everything else became so large as the series went on that it, on top of being pretty prescient with Me Too and folks wrestling with separating the art from the artist, made it feel a little too raw at times. </p><p>Yet somehow, for me, watching<em>&nbsp;Long Story Short</em>&nbsp;tell a non-linear tale about a family and their achievements and their attempts to foist the perpetuation of generational trauma was more a "the devil I know" kind of comedy show. The Schwooper family's whole "joke through the pain" vibe to get at deeper problems was something I felt was more relatable than the more parasocial news headlines of an actor's fall from grace.</p><p>Which is kinda funny to say that I related more to the Jewish family's generational trauma than the anthropomorphic horse's cancellation.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I think I said this to you when we were first talking about <em>Long Story Short</em>, but as someone raised Jewish (despite my name, lol), I was really delighted by how funny and relatable the show was. The ninth episode in particular, where mother Naomi is being honored by the JCC and her son Avi learns all these new things about her--how she's been supportive of all these people in ways he never knew, while he thinks she's been so harsh and exacting with him--is almost entirely something that happened to me with my own mom that still looms really large in my relationship with her. How&nbsp;<em>loud</em>&nbsp;the family is, how there's this endless stream of jokes and insults and chatter, is something my friends have remarked on when they've come to my house, and feels like every childhood get-together with the Jewish side of my family, where you leave a gathering unsure if everyone had a nice visit or was just fighting the whole time. The flipside of that dynamic, though, can be a kind of cruelty that gets painted as love because your family&nbsp;<em>says</em>&nbsp;it's love, which is certainly not unique to Jewish families but definitely... can be expressed in a unique way in Jewish families, maybe.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Long Story Short | Story Time | Sneak Peek | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jxW71mWwHRA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>While I don't think it entirely pertains to the show, growing up in a Lutheran family who was a staple in our church in Cabrini Green had tons of crossover with how decorum would occasionally give way to joking relationships that were sharp jabs at festering issues under the surface between church members and my own family. I had to read between the lines and decipher those kind of battle lines of what is and isn't a touchy subject. I felt that was perfectly encompassed in the first episode with how Avi characterized his girlfriend getting berated by his mother with mean asides as a sign that she likes her. I feel like I've been both on the receiving end of that refrain and the one delivering it to my own partner. The show is really good about playing with humor to get at deeper truths and how eventually, the jokes have to get put to the side to air out grievances.</p><p>I think I related more to Avi's whole storyline by virtue of that being the stage I am in my own life, but I was enamored by how by the end of the first episode I felt I knew every character's whole deal and wanted to witness how they matured from moments that might've traumatized them and, in turn, discover what watershed moment led them to cope with issues the way they do in the show's whole&nbsp;<em>Memento&nbsp;</em>approach to non-linear storytelling.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I wasn't sold on the way the story is told non-chronologically at first, but it eventually really grew on me. Like you say, you get all the main beats pretty much right away, and what happened when sort of doesn't matter as much. It's a real departure from the sort of relentless linearity of&nbsp;<em>Bojack</em>, which really did a lot to make characters have to live with their actions and sit through their shit. Here, jumping in time really paints the emotional vibe of the show, and I think really captures the way family stuff can fester over the years.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>I think too, the show's also just really funny. Oftentimes, I feel animated shows will either rely on referential humor to whatever funny thing happened in Hollywood or memes that wind up dating its jokes upon revisits. <em>Long Story Short</em> is a show rife with the kind of natural situational humor or observations I would stifle a laugh at in my own life. Moments like trying to save a seat for multiple people in a theater or trying to discreetly argue outside of said theater next to another group also arguing is the kind of tapped-in, evergreen humor that made shows like <em>The Simpsons</em> seminal. <em>Long Story Short</em> is filled with those moments and then some. </p><p>It's also occasionally absurdist. My favorite moments tend to be whenever the youngest son, Yoshi, is on his Todd Chavez misadventures, like a visual gag of him being in a car crash with produce trucks making a sandwich and his whole harebrained mattress-in-a-tube scheme turning into ticking timebombs.</p><figure><figcaption>Netflix</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Haha, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOVfl4uskFI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mattress tube</a> episode. I was worried his character was, like, too zany given the largely grounded nature of the show, but I really came around in the intervention episode, when it turns out his big secret isn't that he's using drugs or alcohol, but that he's become Orthodox. I thought that was such a weird, lovely kind of religion deep cut, and I really liked how it played out in the finale.</p><p>I think the show does a good job, by and large, of blending that sort of zany stuff that <em>Bojack</em> could get away with by virtue of everyone being animals with the more grounded, realistic stuff. In some ways it could have probably just as easily been live action instead of animation, but at the same time it takes advantage of not being that to have these really nice visual gags that Hanawalt is so good at.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>By the time I hit credits on the finale, I felt both satisfied and I wanted more. Of course, being the kind of person who'd usually write or critique a show like this, my blog brain had me wondering if there was any more story to tell knowing it'd already been renewed for a <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/long-story-short-renewed-season-2-netflix-season-1-release-1236475449/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second season</a>. But I think the show left enough room creatively to keep going for another ten episodes and did an exceptional job with instilling the feeling in me as a viewer to want the show to keep going. It feels almost&nbsp;<em>JoJo's</em>-esque with how they've already established the next generation in the Schwooper family. It'll be interesting to see cycles get broken and how they'll handle not making new&nbsp; problematic spokes for their young'uns to dismantle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I did feel at the end that it both was and wasn't finished-- it might have been the nature of my watching it in a few big chunks for prospective blog purposes, but it did start to feel a little bit like it was circling the same problems, and I worry that while the story didn't&nbsp;<em>feel</em>&nbsp;resolved at the end, more show will just start to feel oppressive the way you highlight <em>Bojack</em> as feeling. I would be happy if it was just done, but since it's not, I hope they find some new material to mine within that format.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>That's fair. I spaced out my viewing on a Saturday between getting groceries and doing other odd things, so I kind of gave myself some time to ruminate on things that happened in episodic chunks before circling back to it. Maybe that influenced how I felt walking away from the show more glowingly than letting Netflix's whole binge-watch model make it feel like having "the -itis" from a hearty Thanksgiving feast. I do hope that what I felt got resolved won't become a retread for future seasons, but in a way, that's families to a T, so I'll give a wide birth to the show should that be some big-brained point of the whole series.</p><figure><figcaption>Netflix</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I'll be honest that it's tough for me to watch shows about families, especially when they feature older parents. My own parents are quite up there in years, and our relationship has always been... well gosh, it's hard to say. It was definitely "bad" in the traditional sense when I first came out as trans, and over the years it's changed in this way where I'll sometimes say "yeah, we get along well now" and then my friends will remind me that my mom still uses the wrong name and pronoun for me 20+ years since my coming out and I'm like, "right, gosh,&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;this good?" In that way, a lot of the kids' relationship with Naomi really resonated with me, again this kind of "I can be as cruel as I want because I love you, and I love you because I say I do" thing. </p><p>But we see the kids also really wrangle with, what kind of mom was their mom and what kind of family did they have? And I think it's something we all have to wrestle with as our parents get old. Like I think a lot about how one day--not soon, hopefully, but&nbsp;<em>soon</em>--my relationship with my folks will be the whole of it, and anything we don't resolve will just never be resolved, and have I been my best self and what do I need to do to feel good about that inevitable ending, and... ah. It's a lot, and <em>Long Story Short</em> really dug a lot of that stuff up for me.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>I feel that on the family front. While me and my mom are on all accounts good in the kind of parent-child relationship where we're both the quiet ones in our otherwise loud family, seeing Avi go a bit overboard with calling out his mom for her bullshit made me remember a time when I told my mom that I couldn't forgive her for a well-meaning wellness call gone awry during covid. The whole waking up to police outside my door to take me to the hospital, not giving me enough time to splash water on my face and hours in the ER with folks who were legit sick was something my Buddha-like patience couldn't excuse, so I related to Avi's crash out at his mom for the harm she caused. I think the whole "I love you say it back" deal with Naomi and her kids and grandkids highlighted that that love isn't the kind of assured thing that lets you get away with how someone makes their loved ones feel, even if its well intentioned.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>The show is really good at interrogating what love and care really&nbsp;<em>are</em>, in a way I think <em>Bojack</em> was too--not cutting away from relationships at the most dramatic moments but instead really sitting with them and their aftermaths. I think making the show animated definitely keeps it from being&nbsp;<em>too much</em>, though I am also a big fan of adult animation, whereas I know some folks aren't.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>For sure. The show's whole aesthetic definitely helps make its more contentious moments more palatable. Just another reason why I champion animated shows being the shit, and&nbsp;<em>Long Story Short</em>&nbsp;is no exception.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/vivi-is-screwing-up-magic-the-gathering-and-you-know-what-good-for-him"><h3>Vivi Is Screwing Up Magic: The Gathering, And You Know What?

            <link>https://wccftech.com/time-takers-ncsoft-ways-to-win-even-if-your-aim-isnt-perfect-gamescom-onl-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ncsoft%E2%80%99s-third-person-battle-royale-time-takers-wants-you-to-have-ways-to-win-%E2%80%9Ceven-if-your-aim-isn%E2%80%99t-perfect%E2%80%9D.1283994/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Time Takers is a new PvP third-person action-hero-shooter that was debuted by publisher NCSOFT and developer Mistill Games during <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom ONL 2025</a>. Instead of picking one side of combat, where you're either focused on melee or ranged engagements, Mistill Games wants you to have total freedom with how you play. The studio's chief executive officer and the game's director, Yongmin Jo, also calls it giving more players a chance to win "<em>even if your aim isn't perfect."</em></p>



<p>The game was revealed at Gamescom ONL 2025, with its debut trailer focused more on its fantastical setting, which is one where the heroes you play as are pulled from all different corners of time. A medieval-era knight fights alongside a futuristic astronaut monkey and a bionic samurai with insanely powerful robot legs. To call it a mash-up is almost an understatement.</p>



<p>More recently, a new developer video featuring Yongmin Jo digs into the core features of the game, showing how teamwork and the freedom to develop your own strategy is at the heart of real success in Time Takers, as you're constantly racing against the clock, trying to give yourself more time on the battlefield to be the last squad standing.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Time Takers | Dev Video : CORE GAME FEATURES" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9Bvd-iknp0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As part of its teamwork focus, the core mechanic in Time Takers is the fact that you are always trying to take more time for yourself and your squad to survive. You'll constantly make decisions around your Time Energy, whether to save it to help you survive for longer, or to use it to charge your abilities and help you be more aggressive in each match.</p>



<p>It seems to be a mechanical way of trying to prevent each match from having a surplus of players that just  try to wait the whole match out and try to win by taking the final two fighting squads by surprise. It's a strategy you could surely employ, but you'd be doing so from a disadvantage, as you've had to spend your energy on staying in the game, instead of trying to win it.</p>



<p>If Time Takers looks like the kind of game you'd want to try, then you'll soon be able to, as there is an upcoming playtest you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596040/Time_Takers/">currently sign up for on its Steam page.</a></p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta may be over, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> might also have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-pave-over-battlefield-2042s-bullet-casing-filled-potholes-with-a-road-to-battlefield-6">transformed into Battlefield 6</a>, but there must be more battles in the fields of six, so sign-ups for another round of Labs testing are now open. Two fresh maps with plenty of room for vehicle-based fisticuffs will be on offer, as well as a chance to check out the server browser that may well be chock full of 24/7 scraps once the final game launches.</p>
<p>EA have wheeled out all of this info in two separate <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battlefield-labs-testing">blog</a> <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1961084754091995529">posts</a>, which follow neatly on from them running down <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bunnyhop-elsewhere-streamers-ea-are-making-battlefield-6-more-strategic-less-run-and-gun-following-the-beta">all of their learnings from the open beta</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the two maps. Operation Firestorm and Mirak Valley are set to debut, and if you were among the many miffed at the open beta <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-betas-rush-mode-gets-a-balancing-tweak-with-ea-monitoring-the-situation-amid-player-complaints-about-battle-bigness">largely sticking to smaller maps</a>, you'll be glad to hear that they facilitate larger scraps with "a diverse range of vehicles, from quad bikes to tanks and aircraft".</p>
<p>As you might expect, their inclusion's part of EA working to ensure "balancing occurs across different-sized environments" following the open beta. "Improvements to weapons, large-scale vehicular combat, gadget balancing, and more" are all on the publisher's radar to monitor and tweak. This round of testing'll  also be used to lock in "the official setting for Hardcore mode", so put on your best killing pants.</p><p>If you hop into this latest Labs test, you'll also get your first chance to muck around with a work-in-progress version of Battlefield 6's server browser. Its features will be "intentionally limited" so EA can focus on making sure it's stable and useable at a basic level. Basically, making sure folks can set up a server via a shortcode, fill out its description and tags, then host away trouble-free as other players join and leave.</p>
<p>Those who've grown up jumping into 24/7 servers that serve you one map on repeat and don't disappear when everyone goes to bed at the end of the first day will be glad to know EA have confirmed custom servers will be persistent. It won't cost you any extra over the base price of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> either, which is a nice bit of non-money-grabbing from EA, and should mean Battlefield 6 has less trouble establishing a strong sense of community out of the gate.</p>
<p>If you've not taken part in any Battlefield 6 Labs tests to this point, you can <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs">head here to sign up</a>. Though, there's no guarantee you'll be granted access either right away or at all, as the spots are much more limted than the open beta.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-closing-ceremony-recap-z-a-2000618195"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is shaking up the series’ formula in more ways than one when it launches in October. It’s got real-time combat, it all takes place in one city rather than an entire region, and it has a new take on multiplayer to take advantage of that new battle system. Even with all this newness, perhaps the most exciting thing Game Freak is adding is more of something old: Mega Evolutions. These superpowered temporary transformations have long been one of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746"><span>favorite battle gimmicks</span></a><span> from over the years, and since we’re heading back to Kalos, their region of origin, what better time than now to add a wave of new Mega Evolutions? A list of possible new forms </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521"><span>leaked earlier this year</span></a><span>, and so far it seems to be accurate. Here are all the Mega Evolutions we know of so far.</span></p> <h2><b>Mega Dragonite</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Start a New Story in Lumiose City with Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWDx1omjIwM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>Mega Dragonite was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-za-champions-friends-concierge-1851786682"><span>the first new form</span></a><span> revealed for </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. It emphasizes traits from its pre-evolution, Dragonair, by including a jewel on its tail and adding wings to the sides of its head. It maintains its Dragon/Flying typing, but becomes exceptionally faster and stronger in this form. Mega Dragonite views taking out an enemy quickly as an act of kindness, and has a jolly big smile when it uses powerful attacks because it knows all this violence will be over soon. It’s basically Superman.</span></p> <h2><b>Mega Victreebel</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mega Victreebel Raises a Stink! | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f79j5pSboEQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>used a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-victreebel-evolution-trailer-2000619134"><span>spooky found footage video</span></a><span> to reveal Mega Victreebel, but if you take it out of that environment, it is one of the goofier looking Mega Evolutions in the series. The pitcher plant Pokémon’s body has become so engorged with acid that it ties one of its own vines around its throat in order to contain all of it within its bulbous stomach. Now it hops around on its belly as it stalks its prey and loosens the grip around its neck when it needs to projectile vomit its acid onto an enemy.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Mega Hawlucha</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mega Hawlucha Makes a Comeback! | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xt4ccSMw870?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-hawlucha-machamp-trailer-2000620960"><span>Hawlucha’s new Mega form</span></a><span> is probably the most straightforward one we’ve seen thus far. It gets buff like it’s been downing creatine, dons a new mask and cape combo, and its feathers form a belt around its waist. Mega Hawlucha also gets a signature move called Flying Press that it used on Machamp in its reveal cinematic.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That’s all the Mega Evolutions we know of so far. Game Freak will no doubt reveal more between now and when </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>comes to Switch and Switch 2 on October 16. Will Mega Raichu be among them, or will I be made to suffer </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>another slight for my favorite electric rodent</span></a><span>? We all know the answer. I don’t need you to rub it in.</span></p>

    <p><span>Introducing Nod-Krai, the next major region in Tevyat.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The Version <a title="Platforms > Luna [65 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/cloud/luna">Luna</a> I update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [127 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Song of the Welkin Moon: Segue,” will launch on September 10, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [203 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-988935"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>As players conclude their journey through Natlan, they can now set sail north to explore Nod-Krai’s three island territories and meet its inhabitants. In the new Archon Quests, Travelers will join Lauma of the Frostmoon Scions in the fight against the Fatui, stand alongside Flins to resist the relentless “Wild Hunt,” and encounter new allies in Nasha Town. The Fatui’s plot to claim the moon’s power comes to light with the arrival of the Fatui Harbinger, “Marionette,” also known as Sandrone. Meanwhile, Columbina—once known as another Harbinger, “The Damselette”—has withdrawn to her birthplace in Nod-Krai, where she is revered as the Moon Maiden. Meeting her may grant Travelers powerful blessings for their journey. To begin their adventure in Nod-Krai, players can unlock the region after completing Mondstadt’s main story and reaching Adventure Rank 28, or continue into the new Archon Quests after finishing Liyue’s storyline.</p><p>In Nod-Krai, an ancient elemental force known as Kuuvahki permeates the land, shaping both its terrain and its living beings. Players can draw upon this power, hidden within plants, mechanisms, and even the land itself, to overcome challenges in exploration. They may also take on the form of a unique elemental lifeform, the Kuuhenki, gliding swiftly along small patches of mist and Moonlanes. In battle, Kuuvahki reveals itself in both enemies and allies, requiring Travelers to devise targeted strategies to prevail—and granting certain characters the ability to unleash special Lunar Reactions.</p><p>In Version Luna I, three new characters from Nod-Krai will join the playable roster. Lauma, the Moonchanter and a five-star Catalyst wielder, introduces the new Lunar-Bloom reaction with her Dendro powers. Utilizing the Verdant Dew, a special resource generated from the Lunar-Bloom reaction, she can boost her team’s Bloom-related damage. With her unique bond with animals, she can even take on a half-human, half-deer form to sprint and leap with agility. Flins, a five-star Polearm wielder, commands Electro with Lunar-Charged strikes—unleashing either a devastating single blow or a storm of spear attacks. As an experienced Lightkeeper, he can also hear the whispers of the Wild Hunt during exploration. Meanwhile, Aino, a four-star Hydro Claymore wielder and creator of Ineffa, brings both mechanical ingenuity and a touch of home. Her workshop and inventions, including the duck-shaped combat device “Knuckle Duckle,” add playful new interactions to the adventure. Players can recruit Aino to their party for free by progressing through the new Archon Quests in Nod-Krai.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_988936"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>The new feature “Meeting Points” will let players step into the daily lives of their companions: relive the legends of the Frostmoon Scions with Lauma, explore the bustling Clink-Clank Krumkake Craftshop with Aino and Ineffa, or uncover the long-kept stories of the Lightkeepers at Flins’s home. In Version Luna I, the first half will feature Lauma alongside Nahida’s rerun in the Event Wishes, together with a Sumeru-themed Chronicled Wish. The second half brings Flins, Aino, and Yelan’s rerun.</p><p>New optimizations and rewards are set to make your adventure even smoother. Adventure EXP can now be earned through more diverse means, speeding up leveling progress, while harvestable materials will be added to the Battle Pass rewards. In this version, you’ll be able to preview the locked affix of an Artifact in advance and save more team presets with the expanded party setup slots. The biggest change comes with the introduction of Masterless Stella Fortuna, an item that lets you convert the extra 5-star Stella Fortuna to push characters beyond the current cap—all the way to Level 100. And to celebrate both the update and Genshin Impact’s 5th Anniversary, there’s a whole lineup of rewards waiting: a free 5-star character of your choice from the Standard Wish pool, Intertwined Fate ×10 from the login event, Primogems ×1,600 via in-game mail, two special Nod-Krai–themed gadgets, and more.</p><p>Additionally, Genshin Impact announced more details of “Miliastra Wonderland,” the much-anticipated UGC Gameplay System that will allow players to create and enjoy stages made by fellow gamers. Equipped with the “Miliastra Sandbox” editor tool, creators can harness Genshin Impact’s existing systems and assets to design and share a wide variety of fresh experiences, ranging from simulations and party games, to survival challenges and more. Starting with Version Luna II, Miliastra Wonderland will become available, expanding Genshin Impact’s gameplay in bold new ways.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,273 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,825 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,303 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,118 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.

            <p>
Steam users in the UK must now verify their age in order to access store pages for games with mature content, as required by the Online Safety Act.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6">Valve has released instructions</a> for UK users to opt in using credit card details, which will trigger a £0 authorisation. In the UK, you must be at least 18 years of age to obtain a credit card.
</p>
<p>
"Having the credit card stored as a payment method acts as an additional deterrent against circumventing age verification by sharing a single Steam user account among multiple persons," the instructions read.
</p>
<p>
Valve stated this process "preserves the maximum degree of user privacy" in comparison to other age assurance mechanisms. For instance, another mechanism would be using AI to visually identify if a user is over 18.
</p>
<p>
"The data processed in the verification process is identical to that of the millions of other Steam users who make purchases or store their payment details for convenience," Valve continued. "The verification process therefore provides no information about a user's content preferences to payment providers or other third parties."
</p><p>
This requirement on Steam comes as a result of the UK's new Online Safety Act, which is aimed at making the internet safer for children, but regulator Ofcom now requires age verification across all sites and platforms with adult content.
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first anniversary for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> is upon us next week, and Saber and Focus are marking the moment by revealing the contents of the big anniversary update to the hit Warhammer 40K shooter, and sharing a roadmap for Year 2 of the game’s post-launch support.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Year 2 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CxtlJ06u_lc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Update 10 for Space Marine 2 arrives next week on 4th September, and it includes a new PvE mission, a new Helbrute Onslaught PvP mode, a new PvP arena, a new Stratagems PvE mode, three new weapons, the Chaos Spawn enemy, and a Chaos armour pack. Phew!</p>
<p>This marks the start of Season Pass 2 as well, which will add the Black Templars Champion Pack and Imperial Fists Cosmetic Pack.</p>


<p>But that is just the beginning. The pace of updates will slow from monthly to two a quarter for the year ahead, but the further to the anniversary update we will see:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 new Operations &amp; a new Siege map</li>
<li>2 new Eternal War arenas</li>
<li>More Stratagems (PvE) content</li>
<li>New playable class: The Techmarine</li>
<li>New weapons and free unlockable weapon variants for existing weapons</li>
<li>New enemies and bosses</li>
<li>New Progression mechanics</li>
</ul>

<p>More fan-favourite Space Marine Chapters will then get representation with he Raptors, Iron Hands and Carcharodons and further cosmetics for the Blood Angels and Salamanders, all bundled into the Season Pass.</p>
<p>It’s great to see the ongoing support for Space Marine 2, a game that really went down a with fans of Warhammer 40,000. Saber has delivered significant updates with new content and new features (such as this the recently released modding SDK). In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2 review</a>, we said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp-owned-hyperx-gaming-headset-now-cheaper-than-last-labor-day-as-amazon-clears-out-stock.1283949/</guid>

              <p>Playing video games with over-the-ear headphones feels like a wholly different experience than just having the audio play through your TV speakers. The word “immersion” gets tossed around so easily these days, but I get it. Having you game sound pumped right into your ears is a more immersive experience. If you don’t have a pair, you can actually get yourself a wireless gaming headset for not too much money. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3790/">The HyperX Cloud III which normally goes for $150 just dropped by 33% at Amazon.</a> That shaves $50 off the price, bringing what you pay down to only $100 for a limited time.</p>
<p><strong>The audio of the HyperX Cloud II gaming headset is strong</strong>. It’s got angled 53mm drivers designed to optimizing your listening experience while gaming. Hear the pitter-patter of enemy footsteps so no one can get the jump on you when playing ranked.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3790/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfort Is King</h2>
<p>The HyperX Cloud IIIs are a comfortable wear. The HyperX signature memory foam all along the headband softens and spreads out the pressure along your crown so you won’t get that weird pain some headsets can cause after a long wear. The ear cushions are plush, wrapped in a premium faux leather which serves the purpose of keeping your ears cozy and locking in the sound.</p>
<p>Any wireless headset worth it’s salt needs good battery life. There ain’t no point in going wireless if you always need to plug it back in to charge after just a couple Victory Royales. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3790/">The HyperX Cloud III is a behemoth of power.</a> This thing can last you up to 120 hours on a single charge. That’s five full days of battery. So long has you make a habit of plugging it back in every couple of weeks when you’re done, you’ll never have to worry about not having a charge to play. If your gaming sessions are lasting longer than five days, please see a doctor.</p>



<p>Not in a party chat? Just playing some solo runs of <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> or something of the like? Go ahead and pop off the detachable microphone to get it out of the way. When you are in those chats and using the microphones, you can expect high-quality audio with clear voice coming through and going out. The mic is noise-cancelling with a built-in mesh filter to ensure your squad mates only hear your voice and not any disruptive noises in the background.</p>
<p>The headset is durable with it’s flexible aluminum frame. It can travel easily without worry and if you’re prone to accidentally knocking your stuff off your coffee table when you walk by, it should be just fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3790/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is NBA 2K26 Coming to Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-nba-2k26-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1283946/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>September is a huge month for sports games with several big titles on the horizon, with NBA 2K26 among those poised for launch, and we’ve got the details on whether Game Pass subscribers have access to the game.</p>



<p>Releasing fully on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-release-date-explained-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 5</a>, though it’s available from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 29 for those with early access</a>, NBA 2K26 is the latest entry in the long-running franchise and is always among the most popular games every year.</p>



<p>With September stacked full of big releases, a Game Pass subscription can save you some money, and we’ve got details on whether the service includes NBA 2K26.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-nba-2k26-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play NBA 2K26 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not yet. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, NBA 2K26 will not be available to play with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on September 5th.</strong></p>



<p>NBA 2K26 is not an Xbox first-party title, which would see it immediately made available through the service. Unlike rivals EA Sports, there’s no free trial period with a Game Pass subscription either.</p>



<p>Although the first wave of titles launching on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a> in September is yet to be announced, NBA 2K26 is a huge release and, if it were to be on the service, we’d have been told by now. On top of this, the Xbox Store page would have a button that states the title would be ‘Coming to Game Pass’ alongside the purchase option.</p>



<p>With no such announcement and no Game Pass badge on the store page, the game will definitely not be on the service at launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-nba-2k26-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will NBA 2K26 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>NBA 2K26 could come to the Xbox Game Pass service in the future, although no official word has confirmed this.</strong></p>



<p>2K has a close relationship with Xbox, with a free-play weekend for Game Pass subscribers for NBA 2K25 last year, while NBA 2K24 had a six-month stint on the service previously. </p>



<p>Other 2K titles, like Borderlands, have also regularly appeared on the Game Pass service, and the cycle of sports games usually sees them move to the service in the final few months of their lifespan before the latest release is dropped.</p>



<p>Therefore, if NBA 2K26 is to come to the service, don’t expect it to occur before 2026, unless a free-play weekend or a similar incentive is announced later in the year.</p>



<p>Have you purchased NBA 2K26? What are your thoughts on the game? Let us know during the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="resleriana interview" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/612c54c0bbac5/resleriana-interview.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Koei Tecmo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gust Corporation's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-atelier-games-on-nintendo-switch"><strong>Atelier</strong></a> series has been on the go now since 1997. Yes, that 1997, the one that was ages ago.</p>
<p>Traditionally, this is one RPG franchise that's never been a massive mover in the West. It didn't officially see the light of day over here until 2004, after which, I think it's fair to say, it spent quite a long time being so niche in its offerings that the idea of it really taking hold seemed far-fetched. It's all very low stakes, low-key, and incredibly fan-servicey.</p>
<p>However, it's been very interesting — speaking as someone who's reviewed many of the games on Switch 1 — to watch how quickly the Gust devs have, in the past six years or thereabouts, started to appeal to a different, bigger audience, particularly since the genuinely fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_ryza_secret_trilogy_deluxe_pack">Atelier Ryza</a> trilogy released and went from strength to strength.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the first of Ryza's adventures, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atelier_ryza_ever_darkness_and_the_secret_hideout" title="Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness &amp; the Secret Hideout">Ever Darkness &amp; the Secret Hideout</a>, was a slight but meaningful shift in the right direction, with a more explorable world, better mission structure, improved combat and a bunch of other Good Things™, by the time the final entry arrived in 2023, it felt like a proper full-on shift from often-difficult-to-parse fare and fan service to the sort of RPG that I (and I'm sure a bunch of other folk) want to get stuck into.</p>

<p>The core alchemy in these games has always been entrancing - this is some super-deep stuff for folks who like to get into ingredients. But this core is now hugely enhanced by modern open worlds, gloriously fun combat, and things that make for a full loop of gaming goodness, rather than what often felt like half of one.</p>
<p>Why am I telling you all of this? Well, with the arrival of the next entry in the series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_resleriana_the_red_alchemist_and_the_white_guardian">Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</a>, just around the corner, I got the opportunity to fire off some quick questions to none other than <strong>Junzo Hosoi</strong> (head of Gust Corporation and the game's general producer), <strong>Yasunori Sakuta</strong> (its development producer), and <strong>Yuki Katsumata</strong> (its director)...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (PJ O'Reilly):</strong> <strong>There are now a total of 27 Atelier games in this fantastic series, including [this one]. This huge number of games is then further divided into several sub-series - tell us how Atelier Resleriana fits into all of this.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> The mobile version of Atelier Resleriana stands as the 25th entry to the series (A25). As for this title, as it features events that take place at the same time ones in the first part of Atelier Resleriana (A25), it is considered within a part of A25, so we think of it as "A25-2".</p>

<p><strong>The first Resleriana took the very different form of a mobile Gacha game. What was the decision behind choosing this form of game, and how did it work out overall?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yasunori Sakuta:</strong> The mobile version of Atelier Resleriana was created with the intent to allow users who didn't know the Atelier series to casually get in touch with it and discover the appeal of the series. As a result, a lot of people within and outside of Japan mentioned that it became the reason they discovered the Atelier series and their interest in Resleriana is what made them decide to play other Atelier titles.</p>
<p><strong>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian is set within the same universe as the first Resleriana game. Can you tell us what the main differences are for this new adventure?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yasunori Sakuta:</strong> This game takes place within the same setting as the previous Resleriana, so we partially used its system as reference. However, this is a completely new title, with a plot that takes place within the same timeframe as the mobile game, but in a different region.</p>
<p>For those who have played the mobile game, I'd think of it more as a "spin-off" of sorts. These players will be able to see connections to the original game, but those who have never played the mobile version can experience this game as a completely new title.</p>
<p><strong>Several Atelier games feature dual protagonists, such as the pair we find in this new game, and in others (Escha and Logy, for instance). What are the main attractions, benefits, and drawbacks of having dual protagonists in this type of adventure?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> There hasn't been a male protagonist in the Atelier series in the last few years, so we wanted him to have an active role this time. That's how Rias and Slade were born.</p>
<p>With two protagonists we were able to fully illustrate their relationship, allowing for a more immersive experience. At the same time, if the balance between the two of them is not properly done, only one will be active and the other will not stand out. So that's quite a difficult situation to handle. It was quite challenging to keep the balance between the two protagonists throughout the story and game system.</p>

<p><strong>Is Atelier Resleriana planned to be a trilogy, or are there any future plans for this particular sub-series going forward?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> We are focused on Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian and are not currently thinking ahead. Of course, we are considering the next title for GUST, and there's the possibility of considering a third title for Resleriana.</p>
<p><strong>I am a huge fan of the Atelier Ryza series, which you were producer on. Those games felt like they were pulling the Atelier franchise into a more mainstream position, in how they dialled back fan-service and made the games more “modern JRPG”-like. Does Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian attempt to further the franchise in this way?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> Thank you very much! I'm so glad to hear that!</p>
<p>For me, Ryza was a challenging title, as we wanted it to make more people play the Atelier series. And we continued that flow with Yumia. But, during the establishment of the series, I also understand that there are many different needs. For the development for this title, we wanted to make it a series that carefully envelops the turn-based aspects and a kind world.</p>

<p><strong>Atelier Yumia took the series to another level in terms of its open world. Can we expect something similar here, or is this a different sort of experience?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yuki Katsumata:</strong> This time, the field is not an open world but players will have a sectioned area to explore, similar to Atelier Sophie 2. Additionally, there are multi-level dungeons called "Dimensional Paths" around the field. The map's structure changes every time players enter them and the gimmicks and monsters also change slightly. The obtainable ingredients there are also better than the ones regularly found in the field, so players can also challenge themselves by re-entering them time and time again.</p>
<p><strong>[This] Atelier Resleriana is releasing on Nintendo Switch and a few other, more powerful platforms. Can we expect to see a Switch 2 port at any point?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> As this title was developed for the Switch, we currently have no plans to port it to Switch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of Switch 2, do you have one yet and, if so, have you any favourite games so far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> I do own a Switch 2! The recently released Donkey Kong Bananza is really fun. I return to a childlike state to destroy and release my stress!</p>
<p><strong>Finally, and something which has been causing a lot of controversy recently, AI and its many uses within the production of video games. How do you feel about using the likes of generative AI to help on projects, whether it be for background tasks or something like the art or writing in a project?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> I feel the application of AI in game creation is incredibly vast. That being said, I think creators play an essential part of it, which is doing what AI cannot do, such as coming up with new ideas and bringing them to life. Moving forward, the balance between what we can leave up to AI and what creators come up and bring to life may become essential in game production.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Sincerest thanks to Junzo Hosoi, Yasunori Sakuta, and Yuki Katsumata from Gust Corporation for taking the time out to answer my questions.</em></p>
<p><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian releases on Switch on 26th September.</em></p>

		<p>“I don't think enough people are across just how catastrophic an entire generation being raised on Roblox and Fortnite is going to be for the ENTIRE video game industry, not just the AAA end,” wrote <em>Aftermath</em> editor (and Sports! guest) Luke Plunkett on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lxgdgk5mrs2h?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Bluesky</u></a> recently. “These kids have no interest in playing or paying for anything else. And they're not ‘growing out of it.’”</p><p>I think this sentiment is common, and the angst and handwringing about what Roblox’s influence will mean for games is understandable given there are only two kinds of headlines:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/107383/roblox-just-recorded-more-concurrent-players-at-once-than-all-of-steam/index.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Roblox just recorded more concurrent players at once than all of Steam</u></a></li></ul><p>And…</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/roblox-online-gaming-giant-child-predator-allegations-lawsuits-2025-8?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Roblox accused of being a 'hunting ground' for child predators as legal firestorm against gaming giant intensifies</u></a></li></ul><p>Roblox is huge in many senses of the word. It’s played by most children—and also, it's true, brings them a lot of joy! It happens almost every day in my own house with a nine-year-old and five-year-old and they are, like <em>most</em> kids who use Roblox, fine. But my approval of Roblox in the house doesn’t take away from noting it’s also undeniably dangerous, both in the exposure it gives to potential predators and the way it tries to pickpocket their money with trivial microtransactions.&nbsp;</p><p>You're also, in many ways, just describing navigating modern internet platforms. Similar concerns exist across many of them. It sucks.</p><p>The former gets the headlines, but I gotta say, the latter is what gives headaches. You cannot enter a Roblox “experience” without being aesthetically assaulted by pop-ups demanding that you pay a few dollars for basic parts of playing a video game, like checkpoints. Hey Congress, do something useful and block companies like Roblox from targeting kids like this, okay?</p><p>In our house, the policy is that we don’t pay for in-app transactions in Roblox. The kids aren’t even allowed to buy “robux” gift cards with their own money. We just don’t engage. There have been a few exceptions, like buying access to a special room full of exclusive clothes in the <a href="https://www.crossplay.news/p/who-makes-dress-to-impress-on-roblox?utm_source=publication-search"><u>popular (and well-designed, importantly) dress up game <em>Dress to Impress</em></u></a>. I also bought a cosmetic that let both kids look like a Labubu. Both were harmless. Both were exceptions.</p><p>Sorry, we gotta back up for a second and explain the “experience” thing. It’s hilarious.</p><p>Roblox is full of games. <em>Games</em>. But Roblox doesn’t call them games <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22440737/roblox-metaverse-game-experiences-apple-epic-trial/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>to skirt Apple’s App Store guidelines</u></a>. (What Roblox <em>users</em> define as a “game,” however, is the more important distinction.)</p><p>Bizarre, right?&nbsp;</p><p>Over time, Roblox is going to completely change video game design. But it’s also a situation where we can replace “Roblox” with “<em>Minecraft</em>,” if you want. You can swap it for <em>Fortnite</em>, too. The trends match.</p><p>Roblox and <em>Fortnite</em> are, to many young people, the equivalent of Steam. It’s not a game, it’s a platform. You log on to find out what the new trending thing is that everyone is playing, much like you’d open up Netflix and scroll through the service’s top 10 lists to find a decent time waster. The kinds of games that appear on these platforms often resemble the games that you and I obsess over, but under the surface, they’re operating in fundamentally different ways.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, a colleague asked me “Are Roblox games good games?”</p><figure><figcaption><span>The art style is awful. That, sadly, is unlikely to change. We must call for a revolution.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The answer is complicated and comes with bias towards past and current game design history as being forever lessons in the way video games should be designed. The way it will always be.</p>
