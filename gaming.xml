Plus, it's out <em>today</em>.</p>
<p>The DLC is called <strong>DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</strong> and is set on DK's very own home, so expect another huge nostalgia rush.</p>
<p>In Emerald Rush mode, you'll be attempting to join the ranks of Void Co by breaking and collecting emerald ore in a kind-of roguelike mode. You'll get to upgrade skills and choose random boons and benefits.</p>
<p>This mode is available in both DK Island <em>and</em> a handful of levels in the base game, and completing these trials will unlock rewards such as new costumes.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4kghimp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Well... we weren't expecting that. And if you're still on the fence with the base game, then there's also a free demo on the eShop so you can get a taste for the smashing action.</p>

			<p>Nintendo finally announced the release date for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond today during its Nintendo Direct presentation, confirming that it'll arrive this coming December 2, 2025 on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The end is in sight for everyone who has been waiting for Metroid Prime 4 since it was first announced eight years ago in 2017, and even longer for those who've been waiting for this follow-up since the last Metroid Prime game released all the way back in 2007 with Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.</p>



<p>The trailer that was debuted today shows off more gameplay, and interestingly, shows Samus riding around what appears to be an open-world on a motorcycle, which is an element of the game that we hadn't previously seen in any gameplay trailers or game previews.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches December 4th (Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6tSSTH0Z8_M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's an added layer that makes the game all the more enticing. It'll be interesting to learn more about it as we get closer to release, but mostly, it's just good to finally have a release date confirmed for the game.</p>



<p>Leading up to its launch, Nintendo will release a retrospective look at the previous three Metroid Prime titles, and launch three new Amiibo figures ahead of launch, including one with Samus and her motorcycle featured in the above trailer.</p>



<p>When we checked out Metroid Prime 4: Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/">earlier this year for a hands-on preview</a>, while it was just an early look, Wccftech's Nathan Birch wrote that, "<em>it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way</em>."</p>

			<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, a remake of the seventh entry in the JRPG series by Square Enix, will launch worldwide next year.</p>



<p>The remake, which won't be a port of the Nintendo 3DS remake released years ago, as some speculated when <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-remake-in-the-works/">rumors regarding the game started circulating online</a>, will be a full 3D remake which seems bring the game's visuals, interface and combat system closer to the latest entries in the series, including the excellent Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age. Surprisingly enough, it will also take not too long for the game to launch, as its release is set for February 5, 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Despite Square Enix keeping its silence on Dragon Quest XII, fans of the series have plenty to look forward to in the coming months, as, besides Dragon Quest VII Reimagined next February, they will be able to experience the first two entries in the series with the Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake. Unlike the HD-2D remake of the third entry in the series, these two upcoming remakes will offer more than enhanced visuals and some quality-of-life improvements, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-gamescom-hands-on-preview-more-than-a-new-coat-of-paint/"> hands-on preview</a> based on a demo I tried during last month's Gamescom.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on February 5, 2026, on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

No word yet on when it’ll come to Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777117/hades-2-release-date-september-nintendo-switch#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/777117/hades-2-release-date-september-nintendo-switch]]></content:encoded>

It featured several charming design elements that mimicked the look of Astro, including shiny blue accents on the handles and buttons and big googly eyes on the touchpad. Unfortunately, it sold out quickly, and again after a subsequent restock.</p><p>The latest <strong>Astro Bot Joyful DualSense</strong> looks similar to the first model, complete with the blue grips and buttons and carved-in sci-fi lines. The most notable difference is the eyes on the touchpad are slightly squinting instead of fully open, giving it a more cutesy and joyful expression.

Otherwise, the Joyful edition offers the same haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, motion controls, and built-in microphone as a standard DualSense.</p><p>Resale listings for last year’s Astro Bot DualSense controller remain marked up on sites like eBay, making it impossible to find without paying well above the retail price.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Fall semester has already started for college students, so why haven’t you gotten yourself a laptop yet? You may not need it for Syllabus week, but soon you’ll be sent home with more homework than you can imagine. Get a computer that can handle it without completely depleting your monthly budget.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4086/"> Right now, this HP student laptop is down 77% at Amazon. It’s list price is $2,800, but the deal is bringing the price to just $645. That’s a difference of $2,154.</a></p>
<p>Okay, hey now. That over two thousand dollar discount can’t be real right? Well, kind of. If we take a look at the price history of this item, we’ll see it’s only existed on Amazon since June of this year. After a couple weeks, it immediately shot down in price by roughly as much as it has now (mostly around $800). Since then, it’s been back and forth from a crazy discount like this and its full price, but never back up for more than several days at a time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4086/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Looking at the specs, the laptop is pretty good—but not nearly-three-thousand-dollars-good. It’s rocking an Intel Core i3 processor, which is fine. It does come with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of internal storage which is really good, but not pushing the starting price up&nbsp;<em>that much</em>.</p>
<p>So what gives? I’ll tell you. Some Amazon sellers will try to give the illusion you’re getting a better deal than you are. That starting price is just made up. The discounted rate is the real value of the laptop. But now if we’re looking at that, this laptop had spent most of the Summer at around $800. Now that school has started, it’s come down to its new lowest price of $646. For this reason, really we can say this HP laptop is on sale for $2,154 off. That’s not bad!</p>



<p>The HP laptop has a nice and large 17.3-inch display. This is great not just for getting schoolwork done, but if you’re in the dorms, you might end up watching a lot of your shows and movies from it too. Good to have a sizeable screen for that. Of course, you can always connect it to a TV or larger display using the HDMI 1.4 port.</p>
<h2>What Else Your Getting</h2>
<p>Other ports include two USB-A slots, one USB-C, and a good ol’ headphone/mic jack. The HP laptop also supports Wi-Fi 6 as well as Bluetooth 5.0 to easily pair wirelessly to some of your accessories.</p>
<p>Speaking of accessories, the laptop comes with a number of them as a bonus. You get a wireless mouse, and external CD/DVD drive, a full 1TB external hard drive, along with some webcam covers, dust plugs, and a cleaning cloth. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4086/">All that plus an HP laptop that comes preinstalled with Windows 11 Pro for $646?</a> Sounds like a pretty good deal after all.</p>

              <p>Considering we already had a Pokémon Presents just a month ago, I wasn’t expecting to see a new <em>Pokémon</em> game at today’s Nintendo Direct. Yet, here we are, learning about a new game called <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>, and it looks like a cross between Animal Crossing and a farming sim.</p> <p>In this Switch 2 game, you play as a Ditto who takes on a human form and helps build a space for the local ‘mons. It’s kind of a strange concept, and I actually hate seeing the little beady-eyed Ditto person’s face, but I’m down for more <em>Pokémon</em> games that show this world in a different light. The game will launch in 2026. Check out the reveal trailer here:</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Play as a Ditto transformed into a human and shape an empty land into a beautiful home for Pokémon in Pokémon Pokopia, releasing on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch2</a> in 2026. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoDirect</a> <a href="https://t.co/zTiVcLHAgJ">pic.twitter.com/zTiVcLHAgJ</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1966500993593405711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

The sci-fi shooter arrives on December 4, more than eight years after it was first announced at E3 in the original Switch’s launch year. Also Samus has a motorcycle. What?!</p> <p>The latest trailer opened with the bounty hunter tearing across the dunes of an alien planet on a <em>Tron</em>-like speeder. Will these be isolated parts of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> or is the sequel going more open world just like all of Nintendo’s other big franchises? What parts of the map will be locked behind doing a wheelie off a space ramp?</p> <p>Here’s a look:</p>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-red-samus-trailer-date-switch-2-1851772697">As previous footage revealed</a>, the game will feature a new red suit for Samus and psychic powers she must use to navigate ancient alien ruins and solve puzzles. The game’s main antagonist appears to be Sylux, a rival bounty hunter first introduced in <i>Metroid Prime Hunters</i> who hates the Galactic Federation.</p> <p>Samus is also getting new <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> amiibo, including one with her on her motorcycle, on November 6, followed by a Sylux amiibo on release date.</p>

              <p>Yes, seriously! In a move absolutely no one was expecting, the all-time classic 3D gaming device Virtual Boy is coming to Nintendo Switch, via what looks like the ultimate Labo experiment. Via either a faithful plastic replica of the original device, or even a cardboard version, Nintendo is planning to bring 14 Virtual Boy games back to its systems. The 1995 device wasn’t exactly a break-out success, so it’s fantastic to see it begin given a brand new, deeply bizarre second chance some 30 years later.</p> <p>As the subscription service feature that’s now called Nintendo Classics rapidly expands, perhaps there was hope that we might start to see some Wii games getting emulated, and the woefully missing DS category getting added, but it’s safe to say few had Virtual Boy on their bingo card. The three-decade-old device rendered 3D games in a red-on-black format, played by pressing your face into the massive goggles balanced on a stand. When it came out in 1995, it launched with <em>Mario’s Tennis</em>,&nbsp;<em>Red Alarm</em>,&nbsp;<em>Teleroboxer</em> and&nbsp;<em>Galactic Pinball</em>, all of which are set to appear in this new version.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000625330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625330"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625330">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>What’s so extraordinary about this is that it obviously can’t just run on your Switch or Switch 2, because the consoles have no means of being a 3D device. Hence the brand new peripheral which recreates the original look, complete with far-too-spindly legs. But there’s also a cardboard version that will likely cost significantly less, and hopefully still recreate the same effect.</p>

 <p>The original Virtual Boy did not sell well, partly because it was very expensive for the time, and partly because it rendered games as crude red lines in 1995 when 3D graphics cards were just becoming a big deal. Clearly nostalgia makes all of that irrelevant, and this the most bizarrely appealing idea 30 years on.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000625329" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625329"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625329">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>There’s no clear date when it will be arriving in the still awfully-named Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, but we know it’ll coincide with the launch of the physical peripherals. 14 games will be added to the collection “over time,” including two versions if&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em>, and the almost forgotten&nbsp;<em>Mario Clash</em>.</p>

                <p>Donkey Kong Bananza is getting an update today that adds DK Island, along with a new roguelike DLC mode called Emerald Rush. DK Island looks to be modeled after its famous appearances in the Donkey Kong Country games, and if you've completed the campaign, you can find Void Kong to take a job gathering cash in the new Emerald Rush mode.</p><p>Emerald Rush challenges you to gather Emeralds on a time limit, find upgrades to make a build of powers that's great at smashing through rock and finding more emeralds, and buy perks and powers. You can also purchase statues that as permanent additions to your DK Island as rewards.</p><p>The DK Island and Emerald Rush paid DLC launches later today.
