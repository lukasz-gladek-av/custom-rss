		<p>Capcom has confirmed that Season 4 of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/exoprimal">Exoprimal</a> will be its last, winding down the live service support for the over-the-top co-op dino shooter.</p>
<p>However, Capcom isn’t just leaving the game to fester, unchanging until the ends of time – or more accurately until the servers are turned off. No, they will instead start to cycle through the previous seasons, giving players the chance to work through the reward paths and obtain any items they might have previously missed. Season passes for all seasons will be on sale.</p>


<p>Season 4 concludes on 11th July, after which Season 1 will return. From there on, a new season will begin on the first of each month – So Season 2 in August, Season 3 in September, and so on. Exoprimal will also have routine missions cycling through on a weekly basis, which brings the&nbsp;Savage Gauntlet and Time Loop Rebellion endgame modes in and out of the playlist.</p>
<p>See Capcom’s <a href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/other_20240705_001/">Exoprimal FAQ</a> for all the timings and details.</p>
<p>Exoprimal launched in July of last year, taking the team-based hero shooter and twisting PvE and PvP elements together to create one heck of a strange gameplay hybrid.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/24/exoprimal-review/">Exoprimal review</a>, Dom said, “Exoprimal is a multiplayer shooter with bags of potential. A good round has all the thrills of Overwatch’s PvP wrapped up with the brain-massaging mayhem of Earth Defense Force or Dynasty Warriors, but it’s so slow about getting you invested that some players might simply never get there.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/05/how-infinite-inside-blends-augmented-and-virtual-reality-on-quest-vision-pro-and-beyond/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As all manner of companies have pushed to find the next steps in personal computing over the past decade, there’s been a tussle between augmented reality and virtual reality for supremacy. Do you want to be fully ensconced in a rendered environment and cut off from the rest of the world? Or is it better to place objects within our living spaces, analyse the world around us and overlay them with more information and detail? For video games, it’s been clear that VR is the more appealing technology, but what if you blend the two together? That’s what Infinite Inside seeks to do, the next game from Maze Theory.</p>
<p><iframe title="Infinite Inside | Cinematic Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLxaHT_1Wl0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Infinite Inside kicks off with a suitcase falling into your living room, busting open and sprouting a strange stone pillar right in front of you. As you get up and walk around it, you spot gaps or handles for drawers to pull out, revealing 3D shapes that you can grab and then piece together to create a whole. Slotting those completed puzzle blocks into gaps in the front of the plinth eventually reveal little trophy-like statue that, as you grab it, whisks you away from the real world and into an entirely virtual setting.</p>


<p>Talking about the game’s inspirations, Maze Theory’s Chief Gaming Officer Russ Harding told us, “We always ask, when we play with new tech, what can we do now that we couldn’t do before? For us and our previous backgrounds working in VR and AR, combining the two elements together was something that we hadn’t been able to do before. We hadn’t been able to take you from your real world with augmented reality objects and then unlock a virtual world and take you in and out of that space. That felt quite unique and exciting for us to explore.</p>
<p>“Taking away controllers, what can you do just using hand interaction? How do you get around spaces? How do you pick things up?”</p>


<p>Now, it’s important to note that Infinite Inside is coming to all major VR platforms and catering to all their various capabilities. The game on SteamVR and PlayStation VR 2 will have a fully rendered VR living room as the hub, instead of using augmented reality, while Meta Quest 3 and Pico will blend reality predominantly with controller in hand. However, Infinite Inside launches alongside the Apple Vision Pro in Europe next week on 12th July, and that puts a rather different spin on things.</p>
<p>“We predicted ages ago that there would be an Apple headset,” Russ said, “and we wanted to be a part of the launch of that headset, but one of the things we couldn’t predict was how the UI/UX would work on Vision Pro until we got our hands on it. I think that once we did through some of the Workshops, we realised one of the most challenging things would be translating the controller or analogue hand interaction back into the UI/UX of Apple.”</p>
<p>Having gone hands-on with the game on both Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro, the distinction is clear. Going controller-less on Quest 3 is possible, but the default will be to use the bundled controllers for hand tracking, reaching out and grabbing things with grip buttons and triggers, while on Apple Vision Pro you need to adapt your expectations and interactions away from what’s so common in other VR platforms. It’s more about looking and performing a pinching between finger and thumb – though you can still reach out and grab things, just performing this different action.</p>
<p>It’s fortunate that Infinite Inside is so well suited to this style of play, a much more relaxed and considered experience compared to high-octane shooting galleries and energetic rhythm action games. That allows the strength of the passthrough and augmented reality of this headset to really shine, and even ties in with the style of Apple’s own immersive environments.</p>
<p>“Obviously the passthrough is really high quality, you don’t get any warping [around your hand], it makes you feel very present and it really embeds objects in the world. It has things like dynamic lighting, where it takes on light from the room, which is difficult to see if you have a very bright room, but you do get those subtleties, and is a really nice touch.”</p>

<p>As you’re whisked away to a virtual scene, the interaction changes from pacing around your living room to one that’s perhaps a little more familiar to VR gaming. Locomotion is kept very simplistic here;&nbsp;there’s no free motion or slingshot teleportation, but rather floating stones on set paths that you reach out towards and grab to teleport around. Through this you explore a maze-like stone structure, searching for the plinths and places where you can once again physically investigate them, open draws and search for the puzzle pieces you need.</p>
<p>The story is kept light and minimal, but Russ told us that “There is a narrative in the world, as the plinth that arrives in your room has been created by a secret society, the character that you keep seeing in the game is one of the founders, and you kind of get to learn a bit about what that society is about.”</p>
<p>“There’s no voiceover in the game, and you’ll notice that as you go in and out of each chapter, you’ll get a very slight touch of story through the titling of the chapter as it’s introduced. It’s very much about experiencing the progression as you go through the plinth itself and start rebuilding it. You get hints of the echoes and their story.”</p>
<p>It amounts to a game that’s on the smaller and more constrained end of the scale, compared to Maze Theory’s previous games with the Doctor Who license and Peaky Blinders: The King’s Ransom. “Peaky really pushed the boundaries of our art production pipelines,” Russ said, “and for us that’s why we have a very stripped-back and focussed style for Infinite Inside.</p>
<p>“We’ve also tried to focus on just a few mechanics rather than lots of mechanics. We have been utilising App Labs to push out demos and stuff – we have a prototype team that pushes out prototypes to App Labs, so we’ve got a game on there at the moment called Freerunner that’s just looking at movement systems. Some of those we take into other games, but the idea is that we get community feedback. With infinite Inside, we put the demo out with the first two levels (obviously in alpha) and that was really well received. We got feedback about the traversal stones, how people were interacting with puzzle pieces, and it was really interesting to get that feedback.”</p>

<p>And getting a community that’s engaged is more important than ever for game developers – Russ proudly touts the 4.9/5 rating the Infinite Inside demo has garnered on App Laps. Yes, being on Apple Vision Pro is what’s drawn the headlines, but that’s the gateway for talking about the game across all platforms.</p>
<p>Russ told us, “For us, it’s really important that we do go out on everything – of course, it’s very demanding on our team. […] In VR we’re spread across platforms as an audience, and it’s a much smaller audience, so we need to be able to penetrate that successfully. Arguably a lot of platforms have been encouraging and supporting one another, supporting developers to go cross-platform, because sales on one will help sales on another. As an industry, if you can make a bigger noise on release, the better it is.”</p>
<p>Infinite Inside is out next week on 12th July across Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest, Pico, SteamVR and PlayStation VR 2.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-418" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a new Friday Facts post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>website,&nbsp;<em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>launches on October 21st, which Wube says will "give [them] enough time after summer vacations to polish the release", as well as leaving enough time before Christmas for extra bug fixes if necessary.</p>
<p><em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>will set you back $35, which is the same price as the base&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>game costs right now. That should clue you in as to just how much Wube is packing into this DLC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/factorio-space-age-expansion-release-date-gleba.jpg?itok=p-kCUPUr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/factorio-space-age-expansion-release-date-gleba.jpg?itok=B81SP441 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>will add lots of new stuff, including new areas in which to build your factory.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-expansion-pack-announced-coming-in-2022">announced all the way back in 2021</a>&nbsp;and was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-details-about-factorio-expansion-revealed-by-wube-software">targeting a 2022 release</a>, although that window fell by the wayside as work on what would eventually become&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>ramped up.</p>
<p>Eventually, in August last year, Wube Software <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-expansion-space-age">announced</a> both the name of the expansion and a new 2024 release window, as well as detailing some of the new additions&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>will bring to&nbsp;<em>Factorio</em>.</p>
<p>These include new space platforms that represent your factory's "first foray into space", as well as a number of new alien landscapes with different weather patterns and climates to adjust to.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to a number of new gameplay-evolving mechanics like elevated rails for your trains, new item quality tiers, and even enemy creatures against which you'll need to defend if you want to ensure the safety of your factory.</p>

<p><em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>Version 2.0, as Wube is calling it, will bring lots of tweaks and improvements, including new "smarter worker robots", a new fluid system, and much, much more. The full patch notes will likely be revealed closer to the date.</p>

            <p>
A developer who worked on Rockstar's scrapped GTA 5 single-player Trevor DLC has discussed the project's cancellation and expressed regret it never saw the light of day.
</p>
<p>
The existence of GTA 5 single-player DLC, in which fan-favourite character Trevor Philips would have taken a starring role, has been discussed previously, and fans have wondered for some time if they'd ever hear more on why it was never released - though the sheer magnitude of GTA Online's success always seemed the reason why Rockstar ultimately priotised its resources there. 
</p>
<p>
Now, speaking to YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uikfph7oQoE">SanInPlay</a>, former Rockstar senior camera artist and virtual cinematographer Joseph Rubino has discussed his work on the project - and why it was cancelled. 
</p>

</figure>
<p>
"That was kind of my thing," Rubino said of the Trevor DLC. "I was one of the main editors, camera artist and doing a lot of the second unit on-stage stuff.
</p>
<p>
"We split our teams into two, so I stayed on GTA Online and then this DLC, which Steven Ogg was a very important part of, and then some of the team overlapped and went to [Red Dead Redemption 2] early on."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-actor-says-he-shot-some-stuff-for-a-planned-james-bond-trevor-dlc">Trevor Philips actor Steven Ogg personally dicussed the project earlier this year</a>, when he revealed he had "shot some stuff" that would have seen him working as undercover FBI agent.
</p>
<p>
Rockstar "spent so much money" on the project, Rubino continued, though noted that some of what had been worked on had still materialised via updates to GTA Online.
</p>
<p>
"When GTA Online came out, it was so much of a cash cow and people were loving it so much that it was hard to make an argument that a standalone DLC would out-compete that.
</p>
<p>
"Looking back now I would say that you could probably do both, but that was a business decision that they made and I was a little upset about that.
</p>
<p>
"[I was] a little sour at that time, because I was like 'yo, what the fuck guys, this shit's awesome, let's keep going, let's finish this shit, and then we shelved it."
</p>
<p>
Development work on the Trevor DLC was probably half-way complete, Rubino concluded, before work was "paused" as "GTA Online was going crazy". 
</p>
<p>
Rockstar has never explicitly detailed its GTA 5 single-player plans, after initially announcing <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/398a455252k997/Grand-Theft-Auto-Online-Spring-Updates">"some very exciting" story DLC</a> over a decade ago, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-rockstar-has-changed-its-mind-on-gta5-story-dlc">did make clear the barn-storming GTA Online would ultimately be its focus</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Right now our focus is on GTA Online which has exceeded our expectations," Rockstar North design director Imran Sarwar said in 2015. "We currently have all key members of the team that launched Grand Theft Auto 5 focused on supporting GTA Online in every capacity."
</p>
<p>
Of course, now Rockstar is focused on the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, which is set to arrive in the autumn of 2025.

            <p>Whilst acknowledging that game development has a "close relationship" with "AI-like technologies", Nintendo says it is focused on "delivering value that is unique to Nintendo and cannot be created by technology alone".</p>
<p>When asked by a shareholder to expand on "Nintendo's initiatives using AI", Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said that although generative AI was undoubtedly a "big topic" across the games industry, he believed the company's "decades of know-how" was more valuable than AI when it came to "creating the best gaming experiences for our players".</p>
<p>Furukawa also reflected on the issues of intellectual property rights, too.</p>

<p>"In the game industry, AI-like technologies have long been used - for example, to control the movements of opponent characters - so I believe that game development and AI technology have always had a close relationship," Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf">told investors</a>.</p>
<p>"Generative AI, which is becoming a big topic recently, can be used in creative ways, but we recognise that it may also raise issues with intellectual property rights. We have decades of know-how in creating the best gaming experiences for our players. While we are open to utilising technological developments, we will work to continue delivering value that is unique to Nintendo and cannot be created by technology alone."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-says-it-will-have-a-human-centric-approach-to-leveraging-the-potential-of-ai">Embracer Group recently revealed plans to harness AI</a> to "empower" its staff, saying artificial intelligence "has the capability to massively enhance game development by increasing resource efficiency".</p>
<p>In its latest annual report, Embracer privacy and AI governance head Tomas Hedman stressed it would be a risk if the company <em>didn't</em> use AI, as it would put the firm at a "competitive disadvantage [with] other industry players".</p>

This was the first device to run <em>Breath of the Wild</em>! We talk a lot about game preservation, but there’s little point in that without console preservation alongside it. While almost every major game that was ever worth playing on the Wii U has since been improved and re-released on the Switch, that doesn’t include the many more mediocre games, nor indeed a lot of those released for the eShop.

There’s the deep strangeness of beds in the room where you’re playing, but it was nothing compared to my complete bemusement at using the as-yet unreleased Wii U, and not having the faintest idea where I was supposed to be looking, and how I was expected to use a controller with a screen on it to play a game on <em>another</em> screen over there.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/one-1-wii-u-new-sold-switch-nintendo-2023-stats-1850926481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/one-1-wii-u-new-sold-switch-nintendo-2023-stats-1850926481">In The Year 2023, One New Wii U Was Sold</a></span></p><p>I think there’s a universe where the Wii U could have worked, if it had only been a little bit weirder, and not released with almost the same name as the biggest breakthrough casual gaming device of all time.

<p>Recently, Guerrilla revealed LEGO Horizon Adventures, a full-fledged LEGO title set in the heart of the same universe that gave us Zero Dawn and Forbidden West. It’s being developed in collaboration with Studio Gobo and is set to be released later this year on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch – but not Xbox.</p>



<p>In a recent post on Game File, Stephen Totilo revealed that he’d caught up with James Windeler, the narrative director working on LEGO Horizon Adventures. When prompted for an explanation regarding the snubbing of Xbox, Windeler didn’t have too much to say…</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-horizon-but-blocky">Horizon, But Blocky</h2>



<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures looks like a substantial offering at first blush. It’s promised to be an authentic representation of the post-apocalyptic world of Horizon fused with a family-friendly palette that’s accessible and digestible, bringing the franchise to an all-new audience. It’s designed to be inherently cross-platform and will have cooperative elements, which marks a first for the Horizon universe.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/astro-bot-team-asobi-lego-horizon-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest post on Game File</a>, Stephen Totilo sat down with Guerrilla Games’ James Windeler and grilled him about the upcoming title, asking why it isn’t scheduled to be released on Xbox later this year. By way of a response, Windeler just said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You know, we don’t really have anything to announce about Xbox right now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, when talking about the Nintendo Switch version of LEGO Horizon Adventures, Windeler was more forthcoming, stressing that the squad at Guerrilla wanted to deliver to a ‘family-friendly audience and a younger audience,’ while leaning on the PlayStation and PC platforms to get the game looking ‘as amazing as it can possibly be.’</p>



<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures is set to hit Nintendo Switch, PC, and PlayStation 5 sometime in 2024.</p>

    <p><span>Adds new map Simulanka, new character Emilie, and more.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 4.8 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [115 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Summertide Scales and Tales,” will launch on July 17, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [165 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-896936"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Version 4.8 “Summertide Scales and Tales” features the brand-new summer map Simulanka. The adventure in this limited-time magical world brings new stories, seasonal events, rich rewards, as well as a fresh look for Nilou and Kirara. In addition, Emilie, a perfumer will debut as the new recruitable five-star character who can deal even more damage to Burning enemies.</p><p>Simulanka is a captivating world consisting of several distinct lands populated by origami creatures, clockwork figures, and other fantastical beings. Together with Kirara, Nilou, Navia, and the Wanderer, players can explore the enchanting landscapes, lend a hand to resolve an impending crisis, as well as uncover the truth and surprises of this magical world.</p><p>This journey will also be punctuated by seasonal events that will take place around Simulanka, which include a variety of mini-games and bonuses. Players will be able to try their hand at mini-games such as “Boreal Flurry” where they can shoot balloons while enjoying an aerial experience overlooking Simulanka, the claw-machine-like game “Flying Hatter’s Trick” to capture as many moving toy figures as possible, or “Metropole Trials” where they will have to assemble two teams of characters to take on the combat challenges. By successfully completing these mini-games, players will be able to obtain Starsail Coins to draw for a multitude of figurines with diverse gestures, which can be displayed on “Good Shelves” scattered throughout Simulanka. “Good Shelves” can also be obtained as Furnishings as a reward for completing all main stories in Simulanka. They can then be placed in the Serenitea Pot as summer souvenirs!</p><p>Moreover, two heroines of the adventure, Kirara and Nilou, will show up in their new outfits. Players can recruit Kirara into the team for free by drawing for a certain number of figurines, and get Kirara’s new phantom burglar-themed outfit by accumulating “Excerpts of Bliss” as they collect “Jubilant Feathers” and open “Fairytale Troves” around Simulanka. Meanwhile, Nilou’s new floral-themed outfit will be available at a limited-time discount in the store.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_896937"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Alongside the familiar faces, the new 5-star Dendro polearm user and famous perfumer Emilie will make her debut. She has unique abilities that allow her to deal more damage to Burning enemies. Her combat mechanics revolve around the “Lumidouce Case,” which intermittently inflicts Dendro DMG. If enemies are affected by the Burning effect, the Case can be upgraded and deal greater damage based on her attack. It also benefits from a greater attack range and faster attack speed. Emilie’s Story Quest, “Pomum de Ambra Chapter,” delves into her second identity as a “forensic cleaner” expert in crime scene investigation and unravels the mystery surrounding the “Auguste” flower. Emilie’s debut and Yelan’s rerun will appear in the latter half of Version 4.8 Event Wishes. Reruns of Navia and Nilou will take place in the first phase of the version.</p><p>Following the reduction in level requirements in Version 4.7, another optimization will be made to the Encounter Point System. It will allow players to store Encounter Points and use them later to claim Daily Commission rewards at their convenience. New Long-Term Encounter Points can be converted from excess points accumulated beyond the daily limit, by completing quests, collecting specific items such as Oculi, opening chests or completing event objectives. To convert Long-Term Encounter Points into Daily Encounter Points, simply complete activities that consume Original Resin, such as claiming rewards from Ley Line Blossoms, Trounce Domains, and World Bosses. However, the Long-Term Encounter Points will be reset with every version update that ends with “.0,” such as Version 5.0.</p><p>Furthermore, the cooldown for World Bosses which cost 40 Original Resin to claim rewards has been drastically reduced from 5 minutes to just 10 seconds. This enhancement enables smoother challenges, quicker Resin consumption, and facilitates the conversion of Long-Term Encounter Points to claim Daily Commission bonuses.</p><p>Another new version 4.8 feature, “Echo,” will add new effects to character movements, leaving a unique trailing effect while sprinting. In Version 4.8, players will be able to obtain Echoes for Diluc, Qiqi, Kirara, Jean and Ningguang by completing the “Envisaged Echoes” challenges in the Imaginarium Theater lobby. Accessing these challenges requires the use of two special keys. Two keys will be granted to the player upon entering “Envisaged Echoes,” while additional keys can be obtained by completing Act 6 of the Imaginarium Theater each season.</p></blockquote><p>And here is some additional information on the new map Simulanka, new character Emilie, the version 4.8 banner, and the character trailing effect “Echo”:</p><blockquote><p><strong>1.

                <p>Several video game companies have begun exploring how generative AI can help with the development process of their titles, but Nintendo isn't ready to embrace the technology just yet. When asked in a shareholder Q&amp;A if the company had any initiatives in place to use AI, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa explained that AI could be used "in creative ways" but there were also "issues with intellectual property rights" to deal with.</p><p>"Generative AI, which is becoming a big topic recently, can be used in creative ways, but we recognize that it may also raise issues with intellectual property rights," <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Furukawa said</a>. While Nintendo is open to "utilizing technological developments," it is currently relying on its experienced employees to develop unique games.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How the Nintendo Switch SAVED Nintendo</p>
      </div>
<p>"We have decades of know-how in creating the best gaming experiences for our players. While we are open to utilizing technological developments, we will work to continue delivering value that is unique to Nintendo and cannot be created by technology alone," Furukawa said.</p><p>In comparison, companies like EA and Ubisoft have big plans for generative AI. In March, EA boss Andrew Wilson spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-drive-microtransaction-sales-help-games-get-made-faster-no-comment-on-human-impact/1100-6521669/" data-ref-id="1100-6521669">how AI could be used to develop games more quickly</a> and it how it could potentially be used to make 10%-20% more revenue from microtransactions.</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft is heavily invested in AI and has said AI will be featured in every product it makes going forward, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exec-believes-ai-will-be-a-major-inflection-point-for-gaming-but-says-nothing-about-human-impact/1100-6519555/" data-ref-id="1100-6519555">including Xbox</a>, and Ubisoft plans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-trying-to-make-ai-npcs-that-have-real-conversations/1100-6521970/" data-ref-id="1100-6521970">create AI NPCs that players can have conversations with</a>.</p><p>A major concern about the usage of generative AI in the workplace is that it will lead to job losses. Last year, Wilson said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/">that this was a legitimate concern</a>, although he added that there might be "meaningful increases" in job opportunities in the future. In February, EA announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-laying-off-around-670-people-sunsetting-unspecified-games/1100-6521460/" data-ref-id="1100-6521460">laying off 5% of its staff</a>, or around 670 employees. While not directly related to AI, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/">Microsoft also cut 1,900 people from its video game division</a> earlier this year.</p>

            <p>
A little less than a year since its debut, seasonal content for Capcom's dino shooter Exoprimal has come to an end. Or, as our Tom just said, it looks like it failed to meteor expectations, and is now set for extinction.
</p>
<p>
"With the release of Title Update 4, all planned Exoprimal seasonal content is now complete," <a href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/important_240705_001/">Capcom</a> announced earlier today.

</figure>
<p>
This now means at the end of season four on 11th July, season one will make a return. 
</p>
<p>"From there, a new season will begin on the first of each month," Capcom said. "In addition, Season Passes 1-3 will be available for sale again. This will allow players to obtain items from all seasons."</p>
<p>
Capcom assured its players all of Exoprimal's gameplay modes will remain available. "This includes the main Dino Survival mode, as well as endgame content such as Savage Gauntlet and Time Loop Rebellion," it said today.
</p>
<p>
"If you're playing alone or match with only a few other players, Bots (AI-controlled Exofighters) will still be added so that you can fully enjoy the Hammerheads' story and reach the ending."

We called the shooter a "surprisingly rich blend of dino-killing and team vs team" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exoprimal-a-surprisingly-rich-blend-of-dino-killing-and-team-vs-team">Eurogamer's Exoprimal review</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"While crafted from familiar pieces, Capcom's latest shooter is an enjoyable combination of mechs, dinosaurs and general silliness," wrote Edwin last July. He awarded it three out of five stars. 
</p>
<p>
I now just wonder if we will ever hear <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">anything more on Dino Crisis</a>. Capcom did share that picture of a bloody dinosaur foot earlier this week...

<p>In a <a href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/important_240705_001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new announcement</a> via the official Exoprimal website today, the devs confirmed that new seasonal content for the game is ending. However, online services will still be available.</p>



<p>In the team’s post, they explain that “with the release of Title Update 4, all planned Exoprimal seasonal content has been finished.” The devs also thank fans for playing, and broke down the future of the game.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement says that after Season 4 ends on July 11, “a new season will begin on the first of each month.” This will begin with Season 1, and previous season passes will go on sale again. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Valued Exofighters.</p><p> With the release of Title Update 4, all planned Exoprimal seasonal content is now complete.</p><p> From July 11, Season 1 returns, with subsequent returning seasons and content starting on the first of each month.</p><p> Full info: <a href="https://t.co/P2ZBSmUsCI">https://t.co/P2ZBSmUsCI</a> <a href="https://t.co/HRtig56hHy">pic.twitter.com/HRtig56hHy</a></p></div>— Exoprimal (@exoprimal) <a href="https://twitter.com/exoprimal/status/1809175429737062400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Exoprimal will also continue to offer all existing game modes, adding AI-controlled “Bots” to matches to fill out incomplete lobbies.</p>



<p>Although many things will remain intact, ranks for Savage Gauntlet will naturally “no longer be tabulated after Trial 41.” </p>



<p>In a corresponding <a href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/other_20240705_001/">blog post</a>, the devs also explained future events. Survival Passes will rotate every month through all four seasons. The post adds that “progression from the previous instance of that season will be carried over.” There will also be weekly campaigns and missions to complete.</p>



<p>Exoprimal only just launched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exoprimal-release-date-july-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in July 2023</a>, a dinosaur-themed shooter that still has “Mostly Positive” reviews on Steam. The game is available now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. </p>



<p>Capcom most recently held a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-next-showcase-announced-for-july-1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Capcom Next” showcase</a>, where it announced that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-confirm-new-resident-evil-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Resident Evil game</a> is in development.</p>

Despite various updates and crossovers with other Capcom franchises, such as Street Fighter, that attempt has not been as successful as hoped. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1286320/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, Exoprimal had a 24-hour peak concurrent player count of just 66 on Valve's platform, with only 41 concurrent players at the time of this article's publication.</p><p><a href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/important_240705_001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capcom said</a> that with the release of Title Update 4, all planned Exoprimal seasonal content has been finished. After Season 4, which concludes on July 11, Season 1 will return, marking the beginning of a recycling of already released content. From there, a new season will begin on the first of each month. In addition, Season Passes 1 to 3 will be available for sale again. “This will allow players to obtain items from all seasons,” Capcom explained. Essentially, Exoprimal will be put on a Season 1 to 4 cycle going forward.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Capcom - Exoprimal Slideshow</h3></div></output><p>Capcom insisted all online services will continue to be available, so Exoprimal will remain available to play despite the company essentially walking away from the game. All gameplay modes will remain available to play, including the main Dino Survival mode, as well as endgame content such as Savage Gauntlet and Time Loop Rebellion.</p><p>If you're playing alone or match with only a few other players, Bots will still be added “so that you can fully enjoy the Hammerheads' story and reach the ending,” Capcom added.</p><p>“The Exoprimal team appreciates your interest and support, and we hope to see you in the wargame!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Exoprimal’s announcement back in 2022 was seen as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dino-crisis-exoprimal-producer">death knell for a potential Dino Crisis revival</a>, but Capcom teased fans recently when it tweeted out a solitary image <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-celebrates-dino-crisis-25th-birthday-with-a-picture-of-a-bloody-dinosaur-foot">to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the much-loved dinosaur survival horror game</a>.</p><p>In August last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-delivers-early-verdicts-on-street-fighter-6-and-exoprimal-sales">Capcom admitted to “challenges” given Exoprimal is a new IP</a>, but pointed to the fact it had more than one million players as a “positive."</p><p>“Given that this game is an all-new IP, the situation is not without its challenges; however, we view the fact that the game has amassed over one million players to be positive,” Capcom said at the time. “Going forward, we will continue to release content for the game while monitoring player behavior with an eye toward expanding sales.”</p><p>Capcom insisted it expected Exoprimal would be a profitable project overall (it launched straight into Game Pass). Exoprimal does not currently feature on Capcom’s list of platinum-selling titles, which means it has sold less than one million copies.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exoprimal-review"><u>IGN’s Exoprimal review</u></a> returned an 8/10. “Exoprimal's unique take on the hero shooter genre is a bold one – with its best modes and surprises hidden deep within its goofy sci-fi story – but a variety of fun exosuits, the simple appeal of tearing through thousands of dinos, and great multiplayer design make that grind an easy one to recommend sticking with,” we said.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The rules of marketing apply to all!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/grim-reality-independent-game-developers-publishers-surviving-d%C4%99bek-6evke/">first part,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;I discussed what has happened in our industry recently.

It's also valuable to consider these options in the game development industry, as strategic marketing principles apply across all industries. We have four main market strategies&nbsp;at our disposal, but I will focus on the two most popular ones for this discussion.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Market penetration&nbsp;"><span>Market penetration&nbsp;</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A publisher or developer may choose to compete by utilizing existing game mechanics, features, and settings similar to those previously released by them, targeting the same player base. This&nbsp;approach is resource-intensive and&nbsp;challenging, often leading to price wars and intense competition among numerous rivals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The main advantage of this strategy is that it allows the developer or publisher to operate within their established comfort zone without the need to innovate.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's important to note that game development penetration in the console and PC market still ranges from 30% to 50%, depending on the country and measurement methods. This indicates that not everyone plays games, suggesting that there is still untapped market potential to explore.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Market development"><span>Market development</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regarding market development, a publisher or developer can expand their reach by targeting new segments of gamers or exploring new geographical markets. They might also opt for a more targeted approach, honing in on particular markets to serve local fans—be they Polish, German, British, or French enthusiasts. While this strategy may initially seem unconventional, it holds considerable merit upon closer examination.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Naturally, the allure of the vast American and Chinese markets is undeniable, with every enterprise vying to maximize sales in these lucrative arenas. However, therein lies the crux of the challenge: the fierce rivalry.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The battle for the attention of American and Chinese gamers is intense, necessitating colossal promotional budgets and rendering the prospect of making a significant impact increasingly slender.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a well-acknowledged fact that Europe's premier markets—namely the British, German, and French—command between 6 to 11% of the US market's valuation. Yet, in absolute figures, this translates to a substantial $4 to over $6 billion for each market. Securing even a fraction of this pie can spell success for the astute indie developer or publisher.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The essence of market development also lies in exploring new player segments. While unearthing untapped gamers in today's saturated environment might seem akin to finding a needle in a haystack, it is not only feasible but also a venture worth pursuing. The strategy pivots on diversifying communication to resonate with previously unengaged segments.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Consider&nbsp;forging connections&nbsp;with cultural mediums beyond gaming—films, television series, literature, and music. Such cross-pollination can pique the interest of non-gamers in the gaming universe.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To put it briefly, the current landscape calls for initiatives to captivate those distant from gaming—the individual whose last game purchase was a year prior or the daily mobile casual gamer. This endeavor extends beyond marketing tactics and omnichannel engagement; it necessitates reimagining game design to welcome not just the mid-core but also the casual gamer.&nbsp;This&nbsp;isn't a call for an influx of cozy or hypercasual games but an invitation to weave comfort into the fabric of expansive, serious games designed for major consoles and PCs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is this an arduous undertaking? Undoubtedly. But has it become imperative? It certainly has.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Market evolution also encompasses the adoption of novel distribution avenues. Increasingly, manufacturers, particularly the smaller entities, are contemplating this shift. A prime example is the burgeoning domain of subscription services like Xbox Game Pass and PS Now—potentially joined by streaming platforms—representing both a significant hurdle and a golden opportunity for developers. A veteran gaming journalist collaborating with us at Try Evidence encapsulated this sentiment: "My affinity for indie games is strong, yet I increasingly gravitate towards titles on Game Pass or those heavily discounted. Integrating indie games into these services while ensuring visibility and a steady revenue stream simultaneously exerts immense pressure on developers who remain outside these ecosystems."</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Seeking insights"><span>Seeking insights</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the quest for market insights, every marketing strategy hinges on recognizing strategic opportunities that emerge from the disparity between demand and supply.

<p>In an <a href="https://info.exoprimal.com/en/pages/important_240705_001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official announcement on its website</a>, Capcom says that "all planned&nbsp;<em>Exoprimal&nbsp;</em>seasonal content has been finished", and that from this point onward, the game's four seasons will begin to cycle, with Season 1 making a return after Season 4 concludes.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to buy&nbsp;<em>Exoprimal</em>'s first three Season Passes again, so if there was anything you missed the first time around, you'll get another opportunity to snag it soon.</p>

<p>Additionally, Capcom says that all of&nbsp;<em>Exoprimal</em>'s game modes, including the Dino Survival mode, the aforementioned Savage Gauntlet, and the Time Loop Rebellion mode, will remain available.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the game's player count dwindling, Capcom says that bots will continue to be added to multiplayer games if there aren't enough players to make up the numbers.</p>
<p>Still, from this point onward, if you were hoping for more&nbsp;<em>Exoprimal&nbsp;</em>events like the game's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/exoprimal-monster-hunter-crossover"><em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>crossover</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/exoprimal-title-update-1">new Exosuits</a>, then it looks like you're sadly out of luck.

			<p>The Playstation 4 emulator shadPS4 has made excellent strides in the past few weeks and is now capable of running, albeit in a very limited fashion, one of the best Playstation 4 exclusives ever made.</p>
<p>A new video shared today on YouTube by GeorgeMoralis shows the 0.1.1 version of the emulator running Bloodborne. While the game isn't playable yet, the fact that the emulator can boot it up and even get to the character screen bodes extremely well for the future. If Sony is never going to port the game to PC officially, emulation may, once again, save the day and allow PC players to finally venture to the hauntingly beautiful city of Yarnham.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadps4-v0.1.1 WIP bloodborne progress" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FWX0ziJNyew?start=31&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The shadPS4 emulator isn't the only <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-fpps4-can-now-run-multiple-commercial-games/">Playstation 4 emulator</a> in the works, but it is definitely among the most promising. The current version of the emulator is capable of running 3D games in some fashion, including <a href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/1808573859853205578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1808573859853205578%7Ctwgr%5E013c0016b56e002a617cfa2fe94b24555cd8392d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dsogaming.com%2Fnews%2Fplaystation-4-emulator-shadps4-v0-1-0-can-run-some-3d-games%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Piece Odyssey, Persona 5, and the Resident Evil Origins Collection</a>. Hopefully, these new developments will eventually lead to games becoming fully playable, which is probably not going to be as difficult as it was to get working Playstation 3 emulation due to the system's architecture.</p>

            <p>Actor David 'The Hoff' Hasselhoff - known for his roles in 80s TV series Baywatch and Knight Rider, as well as his music career (I still get Jump in my Car stuck in my head from time to time) - is the new face of an initiative which aims to fight climate change with video games.</p>
<p>It's called <a href="https://bit.ly/4b135Ib">Make Green Tuesday Moves</a> (MGTM). On the first Tuesday of each month, participating studios will launch a collection of 'green' items within their games, with these items being exclusive to the movement. MGTM will then invest proceeds from these items into "fully certified sustainability projects by not-for-profit digital platform PlanetPlay".</p>
<p>And, this month, it is all about that Hoff DLC, with other celebrities expected to follow in subsequent months.</p>

<p>The Hoff himself has starred in several promotional videos for July's initiative push, posing with Knight Rider's KITT and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Tg2nR45iuo">whipping himself up a healthy smoothie</a> all in the name of Planet Earth.</p>
<p>"Snag those pixel-perfect skins and lots of other great gear," he says, adding that each "piece of gear is a power up" for the planet. "Your play time turns into green time, zapping pollution and healing the Earth, one epic item at a time!"</p>
<p>Games involved this month are casual <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/editorial?id=mc_games_editorialmd_mgtm_july_fcp&amp;pli=1">Google Play store offerings</a>, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ar-pet-game-peridot-is-nothing-like-pokemon-go-and-more-interesting-for-it">Peridot from Pokémon Go developer Niantic</a> and Solitaire from Tripledot.</p>
<p>Projects this <a href="https://www.planetplay.com/mgtm">initiative will be supporting</a>, meanwhile, include the Hongera Clean Cookstove project - which is "working to improve the livelihoods of poorer families in Kenya, preserve indigenous forestry and reduce global CO2 emissions" - and the Teeny Tiny Truth.

Ubisoft's sparkling new version of the beloved Beyond Good &amp; Evil includes a touching tribute to Emil Morel, the veteran Ubisoft Montpellier developer who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-2-creative-director-emile-morel-dies">sadly died last year aged just 40</a>. 
</p>
<p>
A bouquet of flowers can now be found lying on a bench in Hillys' centre, with an envelope marked simply by the letter 'E'. 
</p>
<p>
I've checked with Ubisoft to see if this addition is indeed a tribute to Morel from the game's development team, and been told yes. 
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Morel served at Rayman and Beyond Good &amp; Evil studio Ubisoft Montreal from 2009, and helped craft the wonderful Rayman Legends as its lead game designer. 
</p>
<p>
More recently, Morel had taken on the role of creative director for Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 - the long-awaited successor which is referenced significantly via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evils-new-anniversary-edition-content-demands-bge2-is-made">new content added to Beyond Good &amp; Evil's 20th Anniversary Edition</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's fitting, then, that this new release also pays tribute, as we wait to see more of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, which remains in development. 
</p>
<p>
"For us, Emile was a close friend and a boundless source of positive energy," Ubisoft Montpellier <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ubisoft-montpellier_cest-avec-une-profonde-tristesse-que-nous-activity-7082727131201294336-I853/">wrote</a> last year. "We all valued his passion and the way he told stories.
</p>
<p>
"We will never forget Emile and his immense contribution to the BGE2 universe will forever endure."

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-official-reveal-trailer-ahead-of-gameplay-showcase/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will feature a ton of different armor options, and players will not be forced to sacrifice utility for looks, thanks to a "robust" transmog system.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/04/bespoke-armor-transmog-and-other-aspects-of-gear-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Game Informer</a>, the new entry in the series will feature tons of different armor options for both companions and the main character, Rook. Companions will have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot and a weapon slot, while the main character will also have a helmet slot, two weapon slots a belt, an amulet slot and two ring slots. Belts will play an important role, as they influence the potency of healing potions, and some of them can proc additional effects like invulnerability. The game will also feature plenty of bespoke gear that can only be equipped by certain companions or Rook's classes.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it seems like players won't be forced to equip gear in Dragon Age: The Veilguard they think does not look good. Game Director Corinne Busche confirmed the game will feature a robust transmog system that will allow players to apply the stats of a certain piece of gear to another with a different appearance. Both Rook and the companions' gear can be transmogrified as well, giving players the maximum amount of customization options for all their party members.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launches later this year on PC, Playstation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment will exhibit at Tokyo Games Show this year.</p>
<p>The PlayStation maker's presence at the convention was confirmed along with the launch of the <a href="https://tgs.nikkeibp.co.jp/tgs/2024/en/">Tokyo Game Show 2024 visitor's site</a> yesterday (4th July). Sony hasn't had a major presence at the Tokyo Game Show since 2019.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, 731 exhibitors have been confirmed to be participating in Tokyo Game Show 2024, with the likes of Sega, Square Enix, Bandai Namco and Nintendo all in attendance. </p>

<p>"The event will be held on the largest-ever scale and will host a total of 3190 exhibition booths, exceeding last year's record in TGS history," the Tokyo Game Show social media account shared yesterday.</p>
<p>As to what Sony will exhibit during this year's show - which runs from 26th September to 29th September - that for now remains a mystery. One of PlayStation 5's biggest upcoming releases, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-channels-the-pure-game-design-of-nintendo-as-playstation-turns-towards-families">Astro Bot</a>, would have already made its debut by that time, with the adorable-looking platforming set to arrive on 6th September.</p>
<p>Other Sony releases this year include its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc">God of War Ragnarök on PC</a>. Concord is scheduled for PS5 and PC on 23rd August. Ragnarök, meanwhile, will make its PC debut on 19th September.</p>

            <p>Obsidian have spent a lot of time tuning up Avowed's combat in response to negative reactions to the new action-RPG's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidians-first-person-fantasy-rpg-avowed-is-coming-this-autumn">initial reveal footage at an Xbox developer direct</a>, with gameplay director Gabe Paramo conceding that the team could have oiled the hinges and buffed the contacts a little more before showing the game off.</p><!--more-->
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/avowed-interview-2024#section-creating-the-best-obsidian-rpg-ever-with-avowed">Windows Central</a>, Paramo noted that Obsidian had always planned to give the game's sword-and-sorcery component some love, but were persuaded by the reaction to prioritise this aspect before showing Avowed off again at this year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/xbox-games-showcase">Xbox summer showcase</a>. "Sometimes you can lose sight on the importance of the prioritization of some things," he told the site, adding that "we thought [Avowed] was good enough to show as is... A lot of that stuff we knew we were going to get to before shipping." The developers took the feedback in their stride: "We just went 'Okay, let's look at this, this is a big deal, people are noticing this, we should polish this sooner,'" Paramo said. </p>
<p>So where and how have they added some jazz? "We really analyzed the feeling and moment when the player swings their weapon and the moment of impact," Paramo explained. "Were there any delays, was there any system that might have been preventing it from being immediate?" The developers also "looked at posing... to give that visceral, immediate feedback" - posing being, in my very dim understanding of videogame animation, the introduction of character poses that are designed to catch the eye and stick in the memory. "We really focused on that, and the blood impacts, and VFX feedback, and the audio," Paramo went on. "We basically went and looked at all the pieces that make [combat] feel more juicy." </p>
<p>I find this story interesting not least because I'm always interested, and alarmed, to hear about what developers can change after showing a videogame off without giving themselves tonnes of extra work and losing sight of what they're making. Paramo's description sounds like it could be as elementary as changing some speed values somewhere, but it probably isn't. In my experience, every videogame production is a Jenga tower where every last piece is somehow the one right at the bottom.</p>
<p>Here's one thing Obsidian likely couldn't have introduced in response to reveal trailer feedback: Avowed's choice of a first or third-person perspective, because no, it's not as simple as yanking the camera out of your character's head. "[Third-person perspective] is definitely something that requires work to be done after you solidify and understand what game you're making," Paramo commented elsewhere in the piece. </p>
<p>"If I make a swing in first person, I now need to make a swing in third person, in another type of view. They're not shared meshes or animations -- they are different, and our system supports playing them at the same time," he went on. "If you look at your shadow, you'll be able to see the same third-person animations as the first-person representative mesh is doing. So, we had to do it early, because we basically needed to double the amount of animations." </p>
<p>There's more in the full chat, including thoughts on whether Obsidian considered adding multiplayer given the success of Baldur's Gate 3 on his front, and given that Avowed was  <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidian-really-pushed-avowed-as-a-co-op-rpg-pivoted-to-single-player-in-eight-months">"really pushed" internally as a co-op RPG to begin with</a>. Tl;dr it would have messed with the game's storytelling, and Obsidian don't have Larian's long experience of mining the co-op coalface. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-release-date-details-everything-we-know">everything else we know about Avowed</a> at the time of writing.</p>

			<p>A modded Nintendo Switch with 8GB of RAM, instead of the vanilla 4, is almost the Pro model we never got, as it is capable of running multiple PC games rather well.</p>
<p>YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naga</a> recently released a new video showcasing multiple PC games running on this modded system with 8 GB RAM, CPU running at 2.6 GHz, and GPU at 1.26 GHz using Box64 + Wine on an L4T Ubuntu 18.04 with custom kernel OS. While the low resolution is obviously expected, some of these games running particularly well. Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, for example, manages to run at a respectable 30 FPS or close enough in most scenarios, as does Stray. An older game like Devil May Cry runs even above 30 FPS, which is definitely not ideal for a character action game but is impressive nonetheless. Despite some evident issues unrelated to the hardware, Fallout New Vegas even manages to run at 60 FPS in a small indoor location and at around 30 FPS in the more open areas.</p>
<p><iframe title="13 PC Games Tested on Nintendo Switch (8GB RAM)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GwLpznlR5s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have seen evidence of how the limited amount of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-overclocking-ram-performance/">RAM</a> impacted the Nintendo Switch the most, as the modded system showcased in today's video was also able to run <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-oled-modded-8-gb-ram/">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at 4K resolution.</a></p>
<p>Thankfully, Nintendo seems well aware of the issue and will likely ensure that the Nintendo Switch successor has enough RAM to run modern games smoothly. According to shipment data, the console should sport 12 GB of RAM, which could deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-12-gb-lpddr5x-ram-better-xbox-series-s/">better texture quality than the Xbox Series S.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-appears-to-be-teasing-another-secret-character<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
The Japanese website for Sonic x Shadow Generations appears to be teasing another possible playable character.
</p>
<p>
The Sonic Generations remaster includes both classic and modern Sonic characters, as per the original release, as well as a brand new campaign for nemesis Shadow the Hedgehog.
</p>
<p>
Under the <a href="https://sonic.sega.jp/SonicXShadowGenerations/character.html?sideQuery=0&amp;charaQuery=0">character section of the website</a> all three characters are shown, along with a blank box with the words "coming soon". But who could it be?

</figure>
<p>

Perhaps the most obvious suggestion would be some form of Classic Shadow character to match Sonic. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-the-best-of-00s-sonic-with-a-big-dash-of-nostalgia">Sonic Team's Takashi Iizuka previously told Eurogamer</a> the game would not include Classic Shadow levels, though it will feature 2D elements in the level design.

</p>
<p>
Presuming this is a playable character to fit in existing levels, could Super Shadow be included as a separate character? Or could we see Metal Sonic as an additional, playable nemesis? (He's already a boss in Sonic's campaign)
</p>
<p>
Maybe it's not a bad guy at all, which would open the door to anyone: Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Rouge, or even Trip from Sonic Superstars. Dare I say it: Big the Cat fishing minigame?
</p>
<p>
However, as fan account <a href="https://tailschannel.com/tailschannel/07-04-24-statement/">Tails' Channel</a> suggests, this may not be a playable character at all and just a featured character. In short, don't get your hopes up just yet.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-release-date-leaks-ahead-of-potential-summer-game-fest-reveal">Sonic x Shadow Generations will release on 25th October</a> across PS5, Xbox One/Series X/S, Switch, and PC. That's ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jim-carrey-returns-as-dr-robotnik-in-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film</a>, which will feature Shadow the Hedgehog.

Cut voice lines have been discovered for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree's final boss.
</p>
<p>
A dataminer discovered the lines in the game's internal files when comparing English and Japanese dialogue and shared to reddit.
</p>
<p>
The lines themselves don't offer any groundbreaking insight, but it's certainly an interesting decision to cut the lines. <strong>Major spoilers for the final boss follow</strong>.

The lines in question are attributed to Radahn, the DLC's final boss, who is completely mute in the final game.
</p>
<p>
The three lines read: "I am Radahn", "Born of red-maned Radagon, and Rennala of the Full Moon", and "A lion bred for battle".
</p>

Of course, we already know who Radahn is from the base game, so this doesn't add to his character. But the decision to remove the lines does link to his relationship with Miquella.
</p>
<p>
It might seem strange that Radahn is silent, but my own interpretation is that - as Miquella's Promised Consort - he is essentially Miquella's voiceless puppet. After all, this is the Land of Shadow and a separate realm from the base game where the player already defeated Radahn.
</p>
<p>
Having Radahn speak would have given him agency away from Miquella's "brainwashing", as a popular fan theory noted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-final-boss-cut-dialogue-lines/">Game Rant</a> suggests.

</p>
<p>
What's more, the item description for the Remembrance of a God and a Lord acquired by defeating Radahn and Miquella states Miquella saw Radahn's "strength and his kindness". Having Radahn roar that he's "a lion bred for battle" would have undermined this.
</p>
<p>
Have you finished Shadow of the Erdtree? What did you think of the final boss?
</p>
<p>
Many players have criticised the DLC for its high difficulty, but in subsequent patches FromSoftware has eased the challenge. Last week the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-revises-shadow-realm-blessing-balance">balance of Shadow Realm Blessings was revised</a>, while yesterday <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-1123">a couple of bosses were tweaked to make them easier</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dagon-by-h.p-lovecraft">Dagon: by H. P. Lovecraft</a> developers Bit Golem announced this week that they’ve raised 200,000 złoty (around $50,000) towards humanitarian aid charities aiding Ukranians, including the Polish Red Cross, Save the Children, and Voices Of Children. Dagon itself is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free game</a>, but has several pieces of paid DLC, all of which are currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481400/Dagon_by_H_P_Lovecraft/">on sale</a>.</p>

<p>The two-person Polish dev team - who have previously delved into less terrifying waters with work on Ultimate Fishing Simulator - have also hit 1,700,000 downloads of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-visual-novels-on-pc">visual novel</a> since launch in 2021. Which, as they say, is “kinda crazy”. But the good kinda crazy, not the kind where you start noticing gills on your neck while shaving in the morning.</p>

<p>“We debuted Dagon in 2021 as a narrative experiment and our first non-commissioned game,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1481400/view/4221643401484539056">write</a> Bit Golem. “It became a significant success, and as of the latest transfer, together with you - players from all over the world - we have collected over PLN 200,000 / 50,000$ for charity (organisations such as the Polish Red Cross, Polish Humanitarian Action, Save the Children, or Voices Of Children)! Thank you!”</p>
<p>Alongside a new DLC for Dagon to thank their community, Bit Golem are currently working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2873750/Pool_of_Madness/">Pool Of Madness</a> - quite literally, Lovecraftian pool. With balls and cues and tables. That pool, but with tentacles and roguelike elements. I wrote about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pool-of-madness-is-pool-by-way-of-lovecraft">demo here</a>, saying “I can only imagine someone said ‘Cue-thulhu’ by mistake and took it from there.” What a clever little sausage I am.</p>

		<p>We’re massive RPG fans here at TSA, and they don’t get much bigger than the Ys series. Ys X: Nordics is the long-awaited next entry in the series, and while it released in Japan last September, Western gamers have had to patiently wait for news of its release on these shores. Fortunately, they don’t have to wait too much longer, with the game’s release date set for the 25th of October, 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ys X: Nordics - Release Date Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iEK29mNDsI0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Releasing on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, you’ve got a host of places to play – sorry Xbox gamers – where you’re going to be exploring uncharted islands, engaging in fast-paced action combat, and experiencing adventures on the high seas with central protagonists Adol and Karj. Despite only releasing in Japan so far, it’s been well received so far, with an <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/15589/ys-x-nordics">Opencritic rating of 83</a>, and praise for its enjoyable storytelling and classic RPG styling.</p>
<p>A physical Limited Edition will be available to pre-order exclusively from the&nbsp;<u><a id="yiv0913458192LPlnk" title="https://store.nisaeurope.com/" href="https://store.nisaeurope.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">NIS UK &amp; EU Online Store</a></u>&nbsp;today at 10:00am BST.&nbsp;A special bundle will also be available to pre-order which includes the Limited Edition and a Lil’ Adventurer Adol Plush and a Lil’ Pirate Princess Karja Plush Set.</p>
<p>With this being the tenth release in the series, Ys has clearly found a legion of fans over the years, and that shows little sign of slowing down with the recent announcement that we would also see a remaster of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/02/ys-memoire-the-oath-in-felghana-announced-for-ps5-ps4-and-switch/">Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghast</a>, originally release as Ys III: Wanderers from Ys, in the near future.</p>


<p>The most recent Ys title to release here was Ys IX: Monstrum Nox in 2021, and once again it received high praise from Miguel, our resident Ys expert, who awarded it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/17/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-review/">8/10</a>, saying, “Ys IX: Monstrum Nox is the most ambitious Ys game to date, delivering a larger focus on narrative and a much more involved and organic world to explore. The game stumbles under its ambitions a bit, with a slow opening chapter and a consistently struggling framerate. Despite those issues, though, this is easily one of the best entries in the long-running franchise, and while veteran fans will get a lot out of the callbacks sprinkled throughout the game, newcomers are still in for one of the best action RPGs of the year.”</p>
<p>Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more on Ys X: Nordics as we get closer to October 25th!</p>

			<p>Modding group Team Luminescent is seemingly working on native unofficial decompiled PC ports of Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the team took to X with the "biggest news" in the history of its Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl mod. A video was shared showing the booting of Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. According to the modding team, not only do the games boot, but main menu can be accessed as well. "It may not look too pretty now, but in time, it will be the best base for fangames/romhacks", the team <a href="https://x.com/LuminescentTeam/status/1808700107820577272" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X.</p>
<p>With Nintendo being notorious for taking down fan projects, emulation, ROM hacks, and what not, the team will be implementing legal protections to make sure the project won't be taken down. As such, no assets of the game will be included with the project, and these unofficial PC ports will require users to have a legal rip of the Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl roms. As<a href="https://x.com/LuminescentTeam/status/1808721795845140898" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> noted</a> by the team, users can "only use created assets or ones from the game."</p>
<p>Interestingly, once finished, these unofficial native ports will offer vastly improved performance compared to running these games via an emulator. "Additionally, it will run 100% natively on whatever platform you export to. This means *exponentially* better performance than running it through an emulator. Not to mention, inserting assets will be MUCH easier than it currently is with a romhack."</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-brilliant-diamond-and-shining-pearl-remakes-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</a> were released back in 2021 for the Nintendo Switch. Both versions are remakes of 2006's Pokemon Diamond and Pearl for the Nintendo DS.</p>
<p>It's an interesting project for sure, and we're pretty sure that Pokemon fans will be excited by this news. Earlier this year, we already <a href="https://wccftech.com/second-native-zelda-majoras-mask-pc-port-released-recompiled-project-adds-analog-camera-support-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported on native <span>recompiled</span> PC port of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a>.</p>
