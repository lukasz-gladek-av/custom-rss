It wouldn’t be until 2019 that I’d pick up a Switch and still, it wasn’t until the summer of last year, 2024, that I’d put serious miles on it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76-is-currently-testing-the-one-thing-that-makes-every-game-better-fishing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Fishing! It's a feature that's been included in many games over the years, one that varies in quality from game to game. Sega Bass Fishing? Probably top of the line, as long as you have that unique fishing rod controller. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>? I like it, but I know plenty of people that hate it. Personally I normally find it quite a relaxing thing to do, particularly in games that are otherwise combat focused. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> is one such game that's more about shooting rather than chilling out, but over on the public test server you can now try out its version of fishing.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Those of you on the PTS (I hear that's what the cool kids call it) can now head to a new area in the boggy Mire region called Fisherman's Rest. There's three new characters here, Captain Raymond Clark, someone literally just called The Fisherman, and Linda-Lee, a giant hermit crab. A likely bunch in a world like Fallout's.
</p>
<p>
To get your probably not brand-spanking-new fishing rod you need to start the Casting Off quest. You'll find that by following a signal on your Pip-Boy in the Mire. A <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/FJGd9MX5Mkrg45M3eAoIk/inside-the-vault-fishing-in-appalachia-public-test-server">blog post</a> detailing the fishing patch notes that the way you know if you can fish somewhere is a simple mantra: "If I can swim, then I can fish."
</p>
<p>
When you actually get to fish, you'll need to use different kinds of bait, take weather conditions into consideration - Radstorms will help you find a glowing fish - though I can't tell you how the fishing part actually works other than the fact a fish command comes up in deep bodies of water. Sounds like it might be pretty automatic, which is a bit of a shame.
</p>
<p>
There's lots of different fish to catch, which you can eat to restore some health, but you can also turn them into fish bits (awful name), which lets you cook a new grilled fish recipe. This one "provides you with an effect that reduces the time to hook a fish for 20 minutes," something that feels quite messed up when you consider you're using the life of a fish to help you catch more fish. You'll also find daily fishing quests where you can unlock more recipes too.
</p>
<p>
Currently Bethesda is targeting a June release for those that don't play on the PTS, so you don't exactly have to wait that long if you want some bugs ironed out first.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/whats-the-best-starter-weed-recipe-to-sell-in-schedule-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re here, it’s almost certain that you’re trying to figure out what is the best weed recipe in Schedule 1. To start, it can be fairly complicated to start growing, but there’s big money to be had with some of the better recipes in the game. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-weed-recipes-in-schedule-1">Best Starting Weed Recipes in Schedule 1</h2>



<p>When starting off in Schedule 1, you won’t have the best ingredients and equipment to start, but luckily, you’ll be able to get all of the ingredients you need from the Gas-Mart. Unfortunately, though, these recipes do not create the highest quality strains of weed, but are a good way to build up cash to take your empire to the next level. Here’s some of our favourites: </p>



<h4 id="h-og-kush-strain-1">OG Kush Strain 1</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Donut, Mouth Wash, Cuke, Banana, Viagra</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $118</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Anti-Gravity, Jennerising, Balding, Thought-Provoking, Gingeritis, Tropic Thunder</p>



<h4 id="h-og-kush-strain-2">OG Kush Strain 2</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Donut, Mouth Wash, Cuke, Banana, Viagra, Flu Medicine</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $127</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Anti-Gravity, Jennerising, Balding, Thought-Provoking, Gingeritis, Tropic Thunder, Sedating</p>



<h4 id="h-og-kush-strain-3">OG Kush Strain 3</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Banana, Cuke, Banana</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $80</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Jennerising, Thought-Provoking, Energizing, Gingeritis</p>



<h4 id="h-og-kush-strain-4">OG Kush Strain 4</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Mouth Wash, Cuke, Viagra, Banana</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $103</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Anti-Gravity, Balding, Thought-Provoking, Tropic Thunder, Gingeritis</p>



<h4 id="h-sour-diesel-1">Sour Diesel 1</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Cuke, Flu Medicine, Banana</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $71</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Refreshing, Thought-Provoking, Sedating, Gingeritis</p>



<h4 id="h-sour-diesel-2">Sour Diesel 2</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Cuke, Flu Medicine, Mega Bean</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $81</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Refreshing, Cyclopean, Sedating, Foggy</p>



<h4 id="h-green-crack-1">Green Crack 1 </h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Viagra, Horse Semen</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $77</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Energizing, Tropic Thunder, Long Faced</p>



<h4 id="h-green-crack-2">Green Crack 2</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Gasoline, Viagra</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $65</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Bright-Eyed, Toxic, Tropic Thunder</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-weed-strain-to-start">The Best Weed Strain to Start</h2>



<p>One of the better strains from the list is <strong>OG Kush Strain 3</strong>, which only requires two ingredients that can be obtains from the very beginning. What’s even better is that the ingredients will only set you back a mere $6 with a sell price of $80, giving you a nice profit from the get-go. </p>



<p>Remember, that starting off with some of the cheaper strains is a good way to gain money fast, but conscious that you’ll need to continue on innovating and producing higher quality strains to keep your customers happy. </p>

          <p>Road trips with just two people always have their awkward silences. In&nbsp;<em>Dustland Delivery</em>, my character, a sharpshooter, has tried to break the ice with the blacksmith he hired a few towns back, with only intermittent success.</p>
<p>Remember that bodyguard, the one I unsuccessfully tried to flirt with at that bar? The blacksmith was uninterested. What about that wily junk dealer, or the creepy cemetery? Silence. She only wanted to discuss "Abandoned train" and "Abandoned factory," even though, in this post-apocalypse, abandonment was not that rare. But I made a note to look out for any rusted remains; stress and mood are far trickier to fix than hunger and thirst.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943280/Dustland_Delivery/"><em>Dustland Delivery</em></a>, available through Steam for Windows (and Proton/Steam Deck), puts you in the role typically taken up by NPCs in other post-apocalyptic RPGs. You're a trader, buying cheap goods in one place to sell at a profit elsewhere, and working the costs of fuel, maintenance, and raider attacks into your margins. You're in charge of everything on your trip: how fast you drive, when to rest and set up camp, whether to approach that caravan of pickups or give them a wide berth.</p>
<p>Some of you, the types whose favorite part of&nbsp;<em>The Oregon Trail</em> was the trading posts, might already be sold. For the others, let me suggest that the game is stuffed full of little bits of weird humor and emergent storytelling, and a wild amount of replayability for what is currently a $5 game. There are three quest-driven scenarios, plus a tutorial, in the base game. A new DLC out this week, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3559340/Dustland_Delivery_Sheol/"><em>Sheol</em></a>, adds underground cities, ruins expeditions, more terrains, and a final story quest for four more dollars.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-gameplay-trailer-drops-for-lost-skies-showcasing-floating-islands-more/">Lost Skies</a>, the upcoming survival adventure co-op game that involves flying from one airborne island to the next, has a date set for its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931180/Lost_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> early access release: April 18, 2025. The news came from developer Bossa Games with a release date trailer showing off more gameplay and beauty shots for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Skies | Release Date Reveal Trailer | Humble Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vt9IdgLkvWI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A playable build of Lost Skies was available during February's Steam Next Fest, and according to a press release from Bossa Games, it was one of the more popular titles during the festival. An uplifting note for the studio, to be sure, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/bossa-games-scales-back-team-focusing-on-lost-skies-development/">Bossa Games announced layoffs</a> at the top of the year.</p>
<p>It wasn't clear how many developers were laid off at the time, just that there were 40 team members left at Bossa Games to get Lost Skies across the finish line. It'll be interesting to see how the game's launch goes. Early access games are expected to not be perfect at launch, but it definitely couldn't have been easier to prepare Lost Skies for April 18th with fewer people working on the game.</p>
<p>At the time, Bossa Games co-chief executive officer Henrique Olifiers said that the layoff was so the team could focus on "<em>the late-stage production of Lost Skies and its upcoming launch, ensuring the game is successfully released and evolved for its players for the foreseeable future.</em>" A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-gameplay-trailer-drops-for-lost-skies-showcasing-floating-islands-more/">gameplay trailer</a> had been showcased for Lost Skies only two weeks ahead of the layoff announcement.</p>
<p>That said, its popularity during Next Fest adds to the proof that Lost Skies is striking a chord with players. For Bossa Games' sake, hopefully, the early access launch will continue the momentum the Next Fest demo kicked up. The team aims to launch version 1.0 before the end of the year, though of course, this will depend on player feedback.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-pro-subscription-dataminers-uncover/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-pro-%E2%80%98premium%E2%80%99-subscription-uncovered-by-dataminers.1156032/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-pro-subscription-dataminers-uncover/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts might be working on a fresh iteration of the old ‘Battlefield Premium’ membership, but this time around, it’s set to be called Battlefield Pro. In a recent batch of information uncovered by dataminers (allegedly), it was claimed that Battlefield Pro would come with a string of benefits that include persistent server hosting on Battlefield Portal.</p>



<p>Amongst the benefits sat items like ‘exclusive instant unlocks’, tier skips for the game’s Battle Pass, a permanent XP boost, and access to unique challenges. It makes sense on paper, but as with all datamined content, you’ll need to take it with a pinch of salt.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-premium-dude">Premium, Dude</h2>



<p>In a report from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/bf-labs-datamine-battlefield-pro-lets-players-host-persistent-servers-in-portal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, it was claimed that dataminers have uncovered references to a Battlefield Pro subscription from Battlefield Labs. No source was given for the ‘leak’, but it admittedly makes sense that something like this would eventually exist in the new Battlefield space.</p>



<p>After all, we recently covered the impending reveal of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-free-to-play-battle-royale-gamemode-has-been-datamined/">a free-to-play battle royale game</a> within the new Battlefield ecosystem. That kind of game is perfect for a ‘premium’ subscription model that includes access to a Battle Pass. </p>



<p>According to MP1st, the unidentified dataminers have claimed that the following content will be included with a Battlefield Pro subscription:</p>



<ul>
<li>Includes Battle Pass: Get all the perks and rewards from the Battle Pass in addition to extra exclusive content</li>



<li>6 Exclusive Instant Unlocks: Instantly access these BF Pro exclusive cosmetics</li>



<li>+10% Battle Pass XP</li>



<li>Portal: Host a Persistent Server</li>



<li>20 Tier Skips Included: Advance faster on the Battle Pass path to race to the final reward!</li>



<li>Exclusive Bonus Path: Gain access to this exclusive Bonus Path for additional exclusive content. Bonus Path will be released later this season.</li>



<li>BF Pro Challenges: Access to the BF Pro Challenges vault – Unlock exclusive cosmetics from this season’s new BF Pro Challenges. Includes access to previous season(s) BF Pro challenges. Listen to the Pro Radio Station</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s nothing too ‘out there’ on this list. I’m curious how the persistent server hosting would work, as in previous games, players had to <strong>pay </strong>to host private servers like that. Also, the ‘Pro Radio Station’ is interesting as it’s not revealed where that exists or what it includes.</p>



<p>Back in the day, Battlefield Premium was a one-time purchase that unlocked plenty of benefits, but it’s safe to assume that Battlefield Pro will be a monthly or seasonal purchase. Again, it’s unconfirmed at present and should be taken with a pinch of salt.</p>



<p>Would you purchase a subscription to Battlefield Pro? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, Bungie started posting cryptic messages about Marathon on social media. The upcoming extraction shooter has run a little silent in recent months, but something is about to be announced by the developer – we just don’t know what that is.</p>



<p>Marathon is a reboot of a 1994 title of the same name, but this time around, it’s a futuristic extraction shooter – because we just needed <strong>another one of those</strong>, right? </p>



<p>It was recently discovered that some players might be enjoying an alpha version of Marathon <strong>right now</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-are-they-playing-it">Are They Playing It?</h2>



<p>It was noticed by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jrnmit/marathon_alpha_test_begins_this_year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eagle-eyed Reddit users</a> that the Marathon Discord server has newly added channels about alpha feedback and discussions. There’s a section for ‘alpha bug reporting’, too. This leads us to believe that the team is either a) preparing to launch an alpha, and that’s the upcoming news, or b) content creators and the like are already enjoying Marathon’s alpha version.</p>



<p>I’d be willing to believe that the former is on the nose. Marathon has been in development for years at this point, and it’s hard to see it not being ready for a good old playtest.</p>



<p>It was suggested on social media that <strong>both </strong>of those possibilities are true. Users were claiming that some Destiny streamers had been granted access to the closed alpha of Marathon, which remains a mystery since its initial reveal in 2023. </p>



<p>It was also recently claimed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-news-being-teased-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie is preparing</a> to make a major announcement regarding Marathon later this month. That’s hardly a leap, given that social media takeovers are happening, and we’re seeing these alpha channels on Discord.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to trying out Marathon? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

To top it all off, pre-orders were set to open next week on April 9 until Nintendo issued a new statement to news outlets this morning. Pre-orders are being temporarily postponed due to the United States' recently announced tariffs, which will likely impact the console's price.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Nintendo issued the following statement to </span></span><span><span>Game Informer</span></span><span><span>:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.</span></span></p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqQG2xco8eI" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><span><span>On Wednesday evening, the White House announced its upcoming tariff plan, which would impose fees on goods imported from other countries. While the administration has been public about the incoming taxes, the exact rate has turned out to be much higher than anticipated, and in Nintendo's case, it will likely cost them a lot of money. Two common countries where products are manufactured, China and Vietnam, will have tariffs of 54% and 46%, respectively, placed on their exports to the US.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>After the Direct, we learned the base system would cost $449 while the Mario Kart World bundle would be $499, a pair of price tags that staggered many potential buyers. Despite that, Nintendo's delay implies it might raise the price even higher to offset the new tax. Regardless of whether the price will be adjusted, updates on the international trade situation are coming through every day, so Nintendo may also just be waiting for future developments.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The Nintendo Switch 2's launch date of June 5 remains unchanged.

That should make them a versatile entertainment hub, as they are well-equipped for both high-end gaming and a relaxing movie night.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nintendo-switch-2-price-preorders<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The big news of the week – aside from another ruinous attack from the United States <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/407053/trump-tariff-expensive-democracy-authoritarianism-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on its own economy</a> – was the long-awaited debut of the Nintendo Switch 2. It looks solid, with an intriguing salvo of early games (<em>Mario Kart</em>, <em>Donkey Kong</em>, a new FromSoftware game), but <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-price-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price tag</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/switch-2-preorder-tariff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preorder</a> shenanigans left fans wondering if they really <em>need </em>to fork over so much money for what is essentially an incremental upgrade to the first Switch. Now a question looms over the console: Will it be the next ubiquitous Nintendo knock-out hit, or the next Wii U?</p><p>On this episode of Aftermath Hours, we’re joined by special guest Mike Drucker, comedian and writer on shows like <em>Adam Ruins Everything</em>, <em>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</em>, and <em>Full Frontal with Samantha Bee</em>, to talk about his new book, <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/good-game-no-rematch-mike-drucker?variant=43103018024994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Good Game, No Rematch: A Life Made of Video Games</em></a>. We discuss how games and people’s relationship to them have changed over the years – and also the time Mike got shot in the dick with a paintball gun while working for Nintendo.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of Nintendo, we then move on to the Switch 2, which the company finally revealed in earnest this week with a handful of cool games and a price tag that’s giving would-be buyers serious sticker shock as a result of, well, everything else going on in the world right now. We also put out into the universe the idea of a new DK Rap – but this time they hire a legit rapper and play it totally straight. Please, Nintendo, fulfill our dreams.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can make an entire album of DK Raps.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The economy’s a smoking hole in the ground right now. Part of that’s not Nintendo’s fault, but also part of it is Nintendo’s fault because they’re like “Hey, we know you’re gonna do this. You know you’re gonna do this. Let’s just do this.” I don’t know how successful that’s gonna be long-term, particularly when not just Steam but also other console makers want a piece of that really badly. Nintendo will always be the leader, but by how much? And good of a deal is that? If Sony comes out with a handheld tomorrow that’s par-for-par and you can play your PlayStation 5 games on it, that’d be a good deal for a lot of people. That’d be a place where you buy PlayStation games.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, there is the context of, with the Switch and its massive success, Nintendo kind of brought the idea of a handheld back into vogue, and now they’re dealing with the world they created. The Switch 2 is an incremental upgrade that’s not as immediately earthshaking as its predecessor to sort of enter Nintendo back into their own market. And to what extent do they recognize right now that the pitch [in terms of price, at least] isn’t quite as thrilling as it could be? The week before this, they did a big Switch 1 Direct where they were like “Look at all this stuff we still have coming to Switch 1. We have not wound it down quite yet.”</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’s not even just “Will this succeed?” It will succeed, but in my heart of hearts, I think they’re gonna keep up the alternating-console-being-trash streak that they’ve had since the Gamecube. Like, OK, Gamecube sucked. Wii was a hit. Wii U–</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I liked the Gamecube!</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>But it didn’t do [well saleswise]. If you play <em>Smash</em>, it’s fantastic, but relative to its competitors, it was a dud. They fucked up. The cycle of Nintendo is that they have an incredible hit, and then they get hubristic and up their own ass a little bit, and then they’re like “You guys will buy anything.” And then it’s not always the case.</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>Having been inside there [working at Nintendo of America], I kinda feel sympathy. I know that this is Nintendo of Japan’s decision. I wasn’t there when the Wii U came out, but I was there in some of the naming meetings. And I think the thesis of every naming meeting was “Please don’t call it the Wii U.” And the main response from Japan was “We know what we’re doing. We’re gonna do it. We’re gonna name it the Wii U.” And we were like “OK, we tried.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/psycho-patrol-r-early-access-impressions-review-cruelty-squad-consumer-softproducts"><h3>Psycho Patrol R Is A Hilarious Dream Of A Brutal Future</h3></a><p>The follow-up to Cruelty Squad is a brilliant, euro-septic vision of a the future and one of the best immersive sims I've played in ages.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft has returned the boobs to far Cry 4 following a mistake which censored the game worldwide.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-4-censorship-patch-removes-nudity-10-years-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our report earlier today</a> which brought further light to the situation that Ubisoft had apparently censored the nudity in Far Cry 4, the official Far Cry account <a href="https://x.com/FarCrygame/status/1908168738886787356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied to our post</a> to clarify the situation.</p>



<p>“To clarify, the update was the result of a mistake during deployment. Content intended specifically for the Japanese version of the game was accidentally pushed to the global Steam version,” they said.</p>



<p>They continued, “The team has since corrected the error by reuploading the proper global files to Steam. If players are still seeing anything unusual, restarting Steam and checking for updates should resolve it. Just to reassure everyone: there are no plans to censor Far Cry. This was purely a regional packaging error and has now been fully addressed. Thank you“</p>



<p>So fear not, boobs have once again returned to Far Cry 4.</p>



<p>Ubisoft community developer Patricia Brochu-Gagné also took to Reddit to further clarify the situation saying, “This was simply an error tied to a specific regional build, and it’s now been corrected.”</p>



<p>Far Cry 4 went on to sell over 10 million copies during the PlayStation 4 / Xbox One generation and to some, is considered one of the better Far Cry titles in the series. </p>

The Internet, of course, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-can-play-as-the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-in-mario-kart-world-and-the-internet-is-thrilled">is thrilled about this</a>, already coming up with dozens of memes and fanart of the adorable Cow that, until recently, was nothing more prominent than a fun background character in a single Mario Kart track.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, as news of Cow spread throughout the land, fans began pointing out a potential, erm, problem, with another element of the Mario Kart World reveal. In the Nintendo Direct 2 trailer from Wednesday, Mario eats a burger. Burgers are (typically) made of beef. Would Cow, whose people are ostensibly a source of beef, consume beef herself? Fans really wanted to know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well at the Nintendo preview event, we found out. You see, the food items we saw in the trailer are obtainable in Mario Kart World at Yoshi's diner locations scattered across courses. They function like a drive-thru, allowing racers to drive up and grab a bag of take-out just like they would an item box. There are a lot of different food items that can be inside, including burgers, steak kebabs, pizza, and donuts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yes, Cow can eat them all.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, Cow CAN eat steak in Mario Kart World. <a href="https://t.co/qN5PZ9IIM4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qN5PZ9IIM4</a></p>— IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1908259261769003473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">During our session we also saw Cow eat a number of other items, including the burger. We're still a little hazy on what these items are actually doing for Cow — other racers change costumes when consuming them, but Cow doesn't seem to experience any effects. Could she be eating beef just because she enjoys it? Is there a secret power-up she gets from burger consumption that we just don't know about yet because Nintendo hasn't revealed it? Or perhaps are these veggie burgers and Beyond meat kebabs?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to Nintendo to try and clear all this up, but we haven't heard back yet. I'm sure it's because they're busy at their New York event, and not because this is an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5RRyyHsjoU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unhinged question to ask</a> their PR about. Yeah, that's probably it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway go check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">preview of Mario Kart World</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">video version of which</a> features an appearance by our friend Cow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>Movie Games has announced that Drug Dealer Simulator will be coming to Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S consoles on April 16, with a PlayStation 5 release to come at a later date.</p>



<p>In the new press release, it was said that Drug Dealer Simulator has already surpassed over “1 million buyers” on PC – a total amounting to some $16 million in revenue.</p>



<p>Originally, the announcement was made a few weeks ago, but the recent PR email seems, at least at face value, that they are also trying to capitalise on the highly-successful Schedule 1. </p>



<p>Schedule 1 released on March 29, and recently hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peak concurrent playercount of 414,000</a>, with a 24-hour peak of 329,000 concurrent players at the time of writing. At the moment, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1 is yet to announce a console release</a>, so it makes sense that a rival drug dealer simulator would try and get ahead with an Xbox and PlayStation release… I guess.</p>
