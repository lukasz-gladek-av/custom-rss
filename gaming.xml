            <p>
Valve has denied reports its pulled a controversial mod from Steam around the world at the request of the South Korean government, saying the mod was only blocked in South Korea and only because it broke local laws. The mod's author is said to be behind its global removal.
</p>
<p>
Over the weekend, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/valve-cooperates-in-banning-steam-mod-for-depicting-historical-revisionism/">Automaton</a> (citing several South Korean sources including the <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20250613133900017">Yonhap News Agency</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/news/nboard/4/?category=4&amp;n=214032">ThisIsGame</a>) reported Valve had agreed to a request by South Korea's Game Rating and Administration Committee (GRAC) to remove a mod for strategy RPG Mount &amp; Blade: Warband not just locally but overseas as well.
</p>
<p>
The mod, titled Gwangju Running Man, reportedly depicted the events of the 1980 Gwangju Uprising - in which student-led pro-democracy protests were violently suppressed by the South Korean military, resulting in significant civilian casualties - in a way that "distorted historical facts". It's said the mod (which featured military dictator Chun Doo Hwan as its cover), depicted protesters as "armed and violent criminals", framing the military's response as "justified".
</p>
<p>
As reports of Valve's response began circulating, some expressed concern that the company was now seemingly willing to remove content worldwide at the request of a country's government. Valve, though, has now provided clarification on the events leading to the Mount &amp; Blade mod's removal, saying access was restricted in March - but only in South Korea - after the company was informed it violated South Korean laws. Valve added the mod was then deleted from Steam in June by its original uploader, causing its worldwide disappearance.
</p>
<p>
Valve has, of course, been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-accused-of-allowing-the-proliferation-of-hate-as-report-finds-18m-instances-of-extremist-or-hateful-content-on-steam">heavily criticised for its lack of adequate content moderation</a> in the past, facing condemnation for allowing the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-steam-school-shooting-game">school shooting game Active Shooter</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-under-fire-as-sexually-explicit-game-glorifying-rape-is-listed-on-steam">Rape Day</a>, and, more recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk">non-consensual sex game No Mercy</a> onto its store.
</p>
<p>
In 2018, following the controversy caused by Active Shooter, Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-backs-away-from-content-policing-says-it-will-allow-everything-on-steam">announced it had decided to "allow everything" onto Steam</a>, provided it wasn't illegal, "or straight up trolling". While Valve has also been known to quietly remove titles when faced with significant negative public attention, it seems Gwangju Running Man specifically fell foul of its legality rules.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just in case you've been feeling like your shoe collection isn't cursed enough, Nintendo has announced a collaboration between&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>and Crocs. I'll let that sink in for a minute.</p>

<p>Per a Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/crocs-launches-first-ever-collaboration-with-animal-crossing/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, a new collection of&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>Crocs will be launching on August 26th, which is, coincidentally, the same date on which a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">trio</a> of previously console-exclusive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">games</a> cross the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">border</a> to join their rival ecosystems.</p>

<p>For adults, the&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>Platform Clog comes in size ranges of 4-13 for men and 6-12 for women. These shoes will set you back $69.99, but for your cash, you'll get Crocs decorated with&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-themed pastel shades and characters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animal-crossing-crocs-nintendo-clog.jpg?itok=SeHEE8v6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/animal-crossing-crocs-nintendo-clog.jpg?itok=mH3qm_8W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look upon these Crocs, ye mighty, and despair.</figcaption></figure><p>For kids, the Kids'&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>Classic Clog comes in sizes 11C to 6Y, and it'll set you back a slightly more modest $54.99. The aesthetic is pretty similar, so you could even buy them as a matching set if you want to hasten the coming of the great Croc God of Destruction.</p>

<p>In addition to the shoes themselves, Nintendo and Crocs will also sell sets of Jibbitz Charms themed around&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, and you can apply these charms to the Crocs as you see fit. A 5-pack will cost you $16.99, and you can buy individual charms for Rosie, Marshal, and Bunnie for $5 each.</p>

<p>These unholy shoes aren't the first collaboration between Nintendo and Crocs; the company also <a href="https://www.crocs.co.uk/c/collections/more-collections/pokemon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sells a set of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-themed clogs</a>, as well as sets of Jibbitz Charms based on the likes of Eevee, Togepi, and Pikachu, among others.</p>

<p>You can also find Jibbitz Charms themed around&nbsp;<em>Super Mario&nbsp;</em>characters, although no&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>-themed Crocs have appeared yet, so at the very least, we haven't reached that stage of Ragnarok yet.</p>

You'll be able to get them from the official Crocs <a href="https://www.crocs.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, as well as Crocs retail stores and "select Crocs retailers" worldwide.</p>

            <p>If you ever wanted the chance to adorn your feet with the island living vibe of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, then I have the news story for you.</p>
<p>Nintendo has announced an Animal Crossing collaboration with Crocs, yes the company of rubber footwear fame, which are admittedly not the most flattering of shoe options but I do appreciate their easy-drain functionality when it comes to post-water sport escapades.</p>
<p>This Animal Crossing collection sees Crocs' footwear dressed up with beachy waves and lush vegetation. Oh, and of course as with all entrepreneurial Animal Crossing endeavours, Tom Nook will also feature thanks to the new Jibbitz charms.</p>

<p>This Croc collaboration will be released on 26th August, and include the Animal Crossing Platform Clog for adults as well as the Animal Crossing Classic Clog for children. These will cost $69.99 and $54.99 respectively, with the shoes being available in the US via the official Crocs online store and select retailers (I have asked for clarification on UK pricing and availability).</p>
<p>Nintendo has also announced some individual Jibbitz charm packs. The first of these features the Able Sisters trio - Sable, Mabel and Label - as well as a shirt and backpack charm. The second pack is made up with charms of Blathers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a> and Pascal, as well as a fossil and a seashell. These packs will retail for $16.99.</p>
<p>Individual charms featuring Rosie, Marshal and Bunnie will also be available for $4.99 each.</p>

<p>"Animal Crossing lets players enjoy a relaxing, slow-paced life while interacting with a cast of unique animal characters. Since its debut in 2001, the games have been enjoyed by millions of players worldwide, becoming a cherished title for fans of all ages," reads <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/crocs-launches-first-ever-collaboration-with-animal-crossing/">Nintendo's official blurb on the collaboration</a>. So, do you fancy a pair of Animal Crocs-ing for yourself?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/romero-games-not-closing-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/romero-games-says-it-hasnt-closed-down-search-for-new-publisher-is-on.1238073/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Romero Games, the studio founded by legendary industry auteur John Romero, has clarified that it is not, in fact, shutting down, and that it's currently seeking a new publisher for its ongoing project.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/romerogames.bsky.social/post/3ltfjxsyavs23" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media, Romero Games says that while it's true funding for its game was pulled and that development on the game was halted, the studio is "not closed", and that "any suggestion otherwise is factually incorrect".</p>

<p>Romero Games goes on to say it held discussions regarding next steps just yesterday, and that while the studio will "reassess" its "entire staffing" structure, it's "doing everything in [its] power" to ensure closure doesn't happen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/romero-games-not-closing-down-doom.jpg?itok=inBt5iX- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/romero-games-not-closing-down-doom.jpg?itok=U1nTCsy9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Romero Games has created new levels for the original&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>, and until recently, it was working on a brand new game as well.</figcaption></figure><p>Technically, Romero Games has never disclosed the publisher for its now-canceled project, although the studio says readers "may infer it from public information".</p>

<p>Just as a reminder, Microsoft recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">undertook a massive layoff wave</a> that saw around 9,000 of its employees affected. As part of that layoff wave, in-development projects like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare's </a><i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Everwild</a>&nbsp;</i>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">Perfect Dark</a>&nbsp;</em>were canceled, with the latter also closing its doors for good.</p>

<p>It seems fairly obvious to me that Romero Games is referring to Xbox as the publisher for its game, although since the project itself was never officially announced, that hasn't technically been confirmed.</p>

<p>As for the future, Romero Games says it's "currently evaluating" the "opportunities" that the aforementioned publishers have provided, so it's entirely possible that the studio's project will be revived under a different banner. We'll have to wait and see what happens next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-everwild-xbox-layoffs-romero-games.jpg?itok=F-VOXCsi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-everwild-xbox-layoffs-romero-games.jpg?itok=Bt7CwhFc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox's recent layoff wave saw projects like&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>Amid cancellations and job losses at Xbox, Microsoft has <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly</a> claimed that every game shown during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">its showcase this summer</a> is safe, so to speak. Still, given how suddenly these layoffs appear to have happened, it's hard to take that assertion at face value.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens next, as well as whether Romero Games manages to find a new publisher for its game. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the industry's most respected creators has joined the chorus of praise for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the JRPG developed by French studio Sandfall Interactive. Neil Druckmann, president and creative director at Naughty Dog and creator of The Last of Us franchise, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLvd-3qh08Q/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Instagram</a>:</p>



<p><em>Rolled credits on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. I’m in awe. One of the most moving, creative stories I've played in a long time.</em></p>



<p>Druckmann, who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> he would leave his role as co-showrunner and director of the HBO adaptation of The Last of Us to focus solely on game development, certainly isn't the only one to rate the game so highly. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the highest rated new releases of 2025 so far, not to mention one of the most successful, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/">over 3.3 </a><a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">million </a><a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/">units sold in 33 days</a> despite also being available on Game Pass.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In his 9.5/10 review of the game on Wccftech</a>, Francesco De Meo similarly lauded the game's narrative:</p>



<p><em>Every little story development serves a purpose in the grand scheme of things, like the strokes from a brush. Everything comes together extremely well when the adventure ends, ultimately making the 40 or so hours needed to clear the game an enjoyable rollercoaster of emotions that is hugely satisfying, if not a little emotionally draining, like only the best of stories manage to do.</em></p>



<p><em>Besides the excellent pacing of the story, the characters are the reason Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is so enjoyable. Even though the members of the Expedition 33 and a few others met during the journey on the continent get the most development, which is greatly enhanced by the tapestry their relationships wove, even those that only appear briefly manage to leave an impact. For example, it is tough to forget about the characters met before the Gommage, and remain indifferent as the ritual concludes. The excellent writing and the stellar performance of the English voice cast, including performances from Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, and Ben Starr, are the cherry on top of the most interesting setting seen in RPGs in a long time.</em></p>



<p>Have you played the game yet, and if so, do you agree with all these compliments?</p>

But last week, Subnautica director and designer Charlie Cleveland and his fellow Unknown Worlds co-founder Max McGuire were reportedly forced out the company alongside CEO Ted Gill.

Krafton's announcement of Cleveland's departure suggested <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/subnautica-studio-leadership-gutted-by-krafton-which-outright-says-that-subnautica-2-needs-renewed-energy-and-momentum/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">that Subnautica 2 isn't ready for early access</a>, an assertion that the director denies.</p><p>"We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you're ready to play it," said Cleveland. "And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I'm no longer able to work at the company I started stings."</p><p>"Our priority is, and has always been, to make the best damned game we can for the best community in the world," added Cleveland. "With your Gorge plushies and your hand-drawn fish fan-art, and yes, your hard-earned dollars, you've supported us in every way, in every season, cold and warm, since Half-Life modding was even a thing. And I also want you to know that this is not where the story ends."</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/subnautica-2-studio-begs-rioting-fans-for-benefit-of-the-doubt-after-leadership-axed-by-owner-krafton-the-team-that-has-been-working-on-the-game-day-to-day-over-the-last-few-years-remains-completely-unchanged/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, some fans have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1lqzmon/boycott_subnautica_2_remove_it_from_your_wishlist/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">called for a Subnautica 2 boycott</a> and urged others to remove the game from their wish lists.

            <p>If you've played a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/need-for-speed">Need For Speed</a> game in the last decade, odds are you've seen plenty of cars with Speedhunters stickers slapped somewhere amid whatever delightfully tacky livery their driver's decided to rock. Now, though, it looks like the EA-owned car culture site has gone dormant, with reports claiming it might have been shut down.</p>
<p>This news comes as development of NFS at EA is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now">on a hiatus</a>, with devs at Criterion having been drafted in to help deliver the next Battlefield, though exec Vince Zampella has hinted that there are still plans for the racing series going forwards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/it-looks-like-speedhunters-is-dead">The Drive</a>, Speedhunters' site hasn't had any new stories published to it since April 3. Links to its store return an error message, and its Instagram account boasts an ominous black void as a profile photo.</p>
<p>The Drive reports having heard that Speedhunters might been shut down. We've reached out to EA for comment.</p>
<p>Founded in 2008 by <a href="https://rodchong.com/about/">Rod Chong</a>, Speedhunters have been <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/2024/02/the-need-for-speedhunting/">backed by EA</a> since "since day one", with the various car-related articles and photography they've delivered over the years having been interspersed with plenty of NFS coverage and promo. As recently as December last year, the site were writing about <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/2024/12/my-day-with-the-need-for-speed-bmw-m3-gtr/">the special Most Wanted BMW M3</a> that released in commemoration of the NFS series' 30th anniversary, having also covered <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/2024/08/everything-need-know-nfs-unbound-vol-8-cops-vs-racers/">updates</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/need-for-speed-unbound">NFS Unbound</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>As I alluded to earlier, Speedhunters has also been a regular presence in NFS games themselves via those ubiquitous stickers. One of its journalists, Dino Dalle Carbonare, even made a cameo in utterly forgettable mobile game NFS: No Limits.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shootingcars/comments/1lne5xv/comment/n0kzeg8/">Reddit comment</a> responding to chatter about Speedhunters' unclear situation, former contributor <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/author/2279972671/">Paddy McGrath</a> wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>I haven't been involved in any meaningful way with the site over the last few years (although my name is still listed as a contributor). I did have the intention of submitting stories when I could in the future, but that doesn't look like it's going to be possible anymore.</p>
<p>FWIW, there were so many times that Speedhunters was circling the drain over the last decade. We rarely knew ahead of time if our contracts would be renewed each year. A lot of brilliant and dedicated people put a lot of work in to keep things going as long as it did.</p>
<p>As you might know, Speedhunters was founded and supported by EA from day one. It wouldn't have existed without them. However, Speedhunters was such a small project in an otherwise massive company that it was never going to get the attention &amp; resources it needed to grow, IMO. Why would they spend time on a website selling some merchandise when they have multiple billion dollar video game brands to tend to? </p>
<p>As time passed, and the original EA people involved in the creation of Speedhunters moved onto other things, it became more and more difficult to keep the project afloat. I knew this day was inevitable, so made the decision years ago to diversify my client base and take all of my eggs out of the Speedhunters basket. I am genuinely sad that this does look like the end for it, it deserved so much better.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Here's hoping Speedhunters hasn't done its last set of doughnuts in front of some expensive cameras.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-need-for-speed-devs-working-on-battlefield-eas-beloved-car-culture-site-seems-to-have-shut-off-its-engine]]></content:encoded>

<p>Launching on Switch this September</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Spike Chunsoft has released a new gameplay trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shuten_order">Shuten Order</a>, the new title from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danganronpa_decadence">Danganronpa</a> / <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line</a> creator Kazutaka Kodaka. It provides our best look yet at the game's multi-genre mechanics, with the story branching off into five distinct paths.</p>
<p>You play as Rei Shimobe, the founder of Shuten Order who has been resurrected into a temporary body following his murder. You'll have to investigate one of Shuten Order's 'ministers', with each case presenting you with a completely unique gameplay hook.</p>
<p>For example, if you pursue Kishiru Inugami, you'll engage in a mystery adventure with point-and-click gameplay and puzzle-solving mechanics. Go after Manji Fushicho, however, and you'll be embroiled in stealth-action horror gameplay in which you need to avoid the wandering entity known as 'Nephilim'.</p>
<p>It looks awesome, and if Kodaka's previous work is anything to go by, then you can probably expect a whole bunch of unique story beats and twists as you work to solve your own murder.</p>
<p>Shuten Order launches on Switch on <strong>5th September 2025</strong> and includes an optional digital deluxe edition containing a digital art book and soundtrack.</p>

Duke Nukem and Tomb Raider's Lara Croft will be getting their own personalized tanks as they headline two separate Heroes' Paths chapters from July 10 to July 21. According the launch trailer below, Lara's chapter will have 30 stages while Duke's will have 40.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2wmRci2g_A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I2wmRci2g_A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Keeley Hawes is reprising her role as Lara Croft from a handful of Tomb Raider games that were released before the 2013 reboot, as well as Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. Although Lara isn't known for using a tank, her vehicle of choice in this game is a Tier VIII U.S. versatile medium tank that comes with a lot of Lara's archeology tools including her hatchet, ropes, cables, a winch, and more.</p><p>Jon St. John--the original and only voice of Duke Nukem--is also stepping back into his iconic role for this guest appearance. Unlike Lara, Duke riding in a tank feels very much in character. His ride is a nuclear-powered TS-6, a Tier IX U.S. assault heavy tank. Understandably, it comes with a lot of Duke's heavy ordinance including laser machine guns, grenade launchers, and other "enhanced weapons systems."</p><p>Duke and Lara's stages will include several nods to their respective histories with returning characters, cosmetics, and collectibles. A new Lara Croft theme was created for this event, while Duke Nukem's Grabbag theme will be used in his portion of the game.</p><p>Earlier this summer, Lesta Games--the Russian studio behind Mir Tankov, an offshoot of World of Tanks--was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-studio-seized-by-russia-accused-of-supporting-ukraine/1100-6532140/" data-ref-id="1100-6532140">accused by Russia of illegally funneling money from its title to Ukraine</a>.

However, Wargaming and Lesta Games are no longer tied together, despite the allegations.</p>

			<p>It’s a well rehearsed line from cat people that you don’t own a cat – instead they own you. Unlike a dog’s unending loyalty and affection, cats occupy your house and stereotypically seem to barely tolerate your presence, unless they’re after food of course. A pseudo-psychological reading could easily be made about what kind of relationship you prefer based on your choice of pet, but that’s outside the scope of this review. Copycat takes the idea of the feline/human dynamic and flips the script to see it through the cat’s eyes and ends up being a touching tale of belonging and rejection.</p>
<p><iframe title="Copycat / Out Now Trailer / PS5 &amp; Xbox" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DjXBLeI74Us?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You begin the game by choosing the appearance of your cat, Dawn. I chose the black and white as it most closely resembled my own little murder goblin, Tash. This choice takes place in the context of an animal rescue centre as your prospective owner selects you. The elderly human has just lost their own cat, and it soon becomes apparent that you are a dead ringer for the misplaced feline. This offers an interesting perspective on the relative replaceability of pets in our lives, but there is more at play here than the fickle affections of a cat owner. It turns out that Olive is experiencing the effects of old age and the inevitable diminishing of her mental capacity.</p>


<p>While Dawn is initially unwilling to be domesticated and longs to be out in the wild – even dreaming about being a majestic big cat hunting on the savannah – the slow process of accepting her place by Olive’s side is a touching part of the game. You get to play out the settling in period in which Dawn hides beneath the furniture and even lashes out in misplaced anger. This all makes the moment when Dawn bonds with Olive all the more emotionally resonant.</p>


<p>Mechanic-wise, Dawn has all the abilities you’d expect from a cat. You can run, climb, jump and swipe to your heart’s content and there are plenty of achievements/trophies to unlock through breaking things or causing chaos in Olive’s house. Once you venture out into the wider world there are rudimentary stealth and combat sections but the key thing here is the narrative with the game mechanics largely being employed to push the story along.</p>
<p>Just as Dawn begins to feel safe in her new home tragedy strikes as Olive is hospitalised and your twin nemeses appear. First there is Olive’s daughter who doesn’t feel that her mother has the capacity to care for a pet so tries to evict you, and later on, the titular Copycat – an exact replica of you who infiltrates the home and leaves you on the outside. While never fully revealed, it seems that this is actually the original Dawn and leaves you questioning ideas of who really belongs with Olive.</p>

<p>As the game progresses towards its emotional conclusion it takes in some surprisingly dark themes through Dawn’s reactions to her shifting circumstances. At one point there is even a harrowing scene where you have to control Dawn’s choice between crossing a road or giving up in front of a moving car. Your adventures in the dark alleys of the real world feel suitably hellish and are in stark contrast to both the comfort of Olive’s home and the vivid dreamworld of Dawn’s escapist fantasies.</p>
<p>Graphically, Copycat is decent but far from groundbreaking. The human characters have a real uncanny valley appearance that makes them pretty disturbing – an effect that actually plays into the game’s perspective so could certainly be deliberate. The juxtaposition between the bland real life environments and the bright dreamscapes is effective, though. The voice acting is good too, although the Australian suburban setting was far too reminiscent of classic Neighbours for this eighties kid.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Copycat is a short and focused emotional story that is well worth playing through for any fan of narrative games and/or cat owners. While the game itself is solid, it is really the writing and emotional impact of the story that elevates Copycat from being just another animal-based 3D platformer. I defy anybody not to be moved by Dawn’s turbulent experiences and the game as a whole forced me to pause and give my own cats a cuddle more than once.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Lobbying group includes Nintendo, Sega, and more in its membership</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure><a title="Stop Killing Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4b73b9a63f9e1/stop-killing-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Over the last couple of weeks or so, an online consumer movement has been doing the rounds that challenges the legality of publishers "destroying" video games sold to customers by revoking access following the cessation of online support. Dubbed <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">'Stop Killing Games'</a>, it consists of petitions to the European Citizens' Initiative and the UK government, with the former surpassing 1.2 million signatures at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Now, the European lobbying group <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/">'Video Games Europe'</a>, which includes Nintendo, Sega, Microsoft, Square Enix, and more within its membership, has responded to the movement with a <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/">statement</a>, making clear that it does not support the 'Stop Killing Games' proposals in the slightest.</p>
<p>Here's what it had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We appreciate the passion of our community; however, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable. We understand that it can be disappointing for players but, when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws.</p>
<p>"Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players as the protections we put in place to secure players’ data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable. In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create.</p>
<p>"We welcome the opportunity to discuss our position with policy makers and those who have led the European Citizens Initiative in the coming months."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has also released a <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VGE-Position-Discontinuation-of-Support-to-Online-Games-04072025.pdf">more extensive paper</a> providing further detail on its position. It stresses that forcing publishers to maintain online support indefinitely would "have a chilling effect on game design, and act as a disincentive to making such games available in Europe".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The right to decide how, when, and for how long to make an online video game services available to players is vital in justifying this cost and fostering continued technical innovation.</p>
<p>"As rights-holders and economic entities, video games companies must remain free to decide when an online game is no longer commercially viable and to end continued server support for that game. Imposing a legal obligation to continue server support indefinitely, or to develop online video games in a specific technical manner that will allow permanent use, will raise the costs and risks of developing such games.</p>
<p>"It will have a chilling effect on game design, and act as a disincentive to making such games available in Europe. It is far from a trivial modification or a simple addition to the game development phase. It would ignore material reputational, safety, and security concerns."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a complex situation, to be sure, and we should also point out that it's not Nintendo or any of the aforementioned publishers making this statement.</p>
<p>Ross Scott, a YouTuber who started the 'Stop Killing Games' movement, <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1941562023973883972">describes the arguments put forth by Video Games Europe as "flimsy"</a>, and has uploaded a fresh video talking about the topic in more detail.</p>

            <p>"Peerlessly satisfying," was how RPS guides editor and self-described "Anton Ego of factory games" Ollie Toms <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shapez-2-early-access-review">summarised Shapez 2 back at early access launch</a> in August 2024. Throwing caution to the winds, he suggested that it had "turned the holy trinity of factory games (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/satisfactory">Satisfactory</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dyson-sphere-program">Dyson Sphere Program</a>) into a holy quartet."</p>
<p>To tinker with such perfection is surely tempting the wrath of the gods, but nonetheless, developers tobspr Games have been meddling. They've just announced that they hope to release the automation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim into 1.0 this November, together with a new mode, proper modding support, and Steam achievements.</p><!--more-->
<p>To catch you up, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shapez-2">Shapez 2</a> is about manufacturing and feeding shapes to an insatiable cosmic sinkhole. Which is absolutely nightmarish, of course, but as regards the moment-to-moment, Shapez 2 is a laidback experience that  abstracts away many of the pressures of genre kingpins like Factorio.</p>
<p>Building space can be limited, but buildings don't cost resources and there are no outraged indigenous bug monsters to bother about. As such, you can throw up production chains and remove them without penalty, whether to free up real estate or dabble with new approaches. Going by tobspr's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2162800/view/526472884483263920?l=english">recent Steam post</a>, the ethereality of it all has perhaps carried the game a little too far into "pure" puzzling territory.</p>
<p>"The biggest complaint we get about shapez 2 right now is the persistency of factories," they write. "Many of you noted that having to tear down a factory you just built because the shape is no longer needed could feel bad. It also means that the game can feel more like a puzzle game than a factory/automation game at times - nothing is inherently bad about that in the first place, but we felt we are also missing something for the ones of you that are leaning more into the factory game direction."</p>
<p>Hence the planned new mode (teaser WIP image above), which is basically designed to ensure that "the factories you built in the beginning are still useful in the later stages of the game - so it's up to you to decide when you want to redesign, move or extend it, if at all." To put that another way, the developers are trying to avoid the issue of obsolescence. It's an interesting wrangle for a sim about mass production.</p>
<p>The developers may make this new game mode the default for new players, but they'll only do that based on playtesting and the existing mode will remain available as a "classic" option.</p>
<p>As for modding support, they're aiming to integrate mod.io directly into the game, so that you can access mods from within Shapez 2 using a browser. "I know that some of you highly prefer steam workshop, but the main issue for us is cross-platform compatibility," the devs comment. "If we ever would release shapez 2 on GOG for example, it would mean that that version wouldn't support mods for example."</p>
<p>Last but not least, they have some provisional plans for savegame compatibility as and when all of the above is introduced. Older "classic" mode saves will likely not be compatible with 1.0, but there will be a separate Steam branch where you can carry on playing those saves, the drawback being that you won't get Steam achievements or be able to use mods while playing on this older branch. Blueprints will remain compatible between modes.</p>
<p>Again, look out for all of that in November. Unless there's a bottleneck in production, anyway. "We hope we can get everything done in time so we can release it in November, but at this point we have no idea if we'll actually make it in time," the devs hedge. "So please don't be mad in case we don't."</p>
<p>Will that be reassurance enough for our guides editor Antoms Egollie, the cutthroat connoisseur of conveyer belts? Playing the analogy out, I really hope that the Shapez 2 developers are secretly rats, and that Ollie's first five minutes with the 1.0 version will trigger a flashback to the very first time his mum treated him to a nourishing bowl of gears.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/very-good-strategy-sim-shapez-2-to-get-10-release-in-november-including-a-permanent-factory-mode]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Contrary to previous reports, Romero Games has not closed, and the team is now in contact with a number of publishers which may be able to save its cancelled game.</p>
<p>Last week following layoffs at Microsoft, Romero Games - the studio set up by Doom creator John Romero and his wife Brenda - announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">its publisher had pulled funding for its game along with "other unannounced projects at other studios"</a>. While Microsoft was not mentioned as being involved, this much was inferred.</p>
<p>Since that initial statement from Romero Games, there have been rumblings the studio had been closed down. Thankfully though, this is not the case. In a new statement on social media, Romero Games again confirmed its funding had been pulled and its game cancelled, but the studio itself remains open.</p>

<p>"We want to address recent reports regarding the status of Romero Games. These reports have contained inaccuracies, and we feel it's important to set the record straight," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"Romero Games is not closed, and we are doing everything in our power to ensure that it does not come to that. Any suggestion otherwise is factually incorrect. Indeed, we were in the studio today to discuss next steps with the team."</p>
<p>While the studio remains open, recent events have meant Romero Games has had to "reassess the entire staffing" at the company. It also noted that due to previous confidentiality agreements, it is unable to share who its original publisher was.</p>
<p>There is still hope though, and Romero Games has already been contacted by "several" other publishers which are "interested in helping us bring the game across the finish line". This is now something Romero Games is evaluating.</p><p>

"We appreciate the outpouring of support and will share further updates as we are able," the studio closed.

</p><p>Resharing this statement, a defiant John Romero said this was a team and a game "worth fighting for".</p> <div>

			<p>MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries - Shadows of Kerensky is a new DLC coming soon to the mech shooter game. Developer Piranha Bytes announced that it will be released at some point in September for $19.99. The DLC will take place during the Clan invasion, although it is focused on the perspective of a mercenary company, unlike <a href="https://wccftech.com/mechwarrior-5-clans-is-out-on-october-3-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MechWarrior 5: Clans</a>, which launched in October 2024.</p>



<p>The player's mercenary group is hired by the Rasalhague Republic to hold the line against an overwhelming new enemy. What starts as a routine mission quickly becomes a desperate fight for survival. Secrets tied to the past and the Clans' origins are uncovered along the way. Players will experience a handcrafted, 12-mission story campaign that brings them face-to-face with the Clan invasion, fighting iconic factions. Piranha is promising cinematics, briefings, and high-stakes missions throughout the narrative campaign.</p>



<p>New contracts also emerge as the battle lines are redrawn, allowing the Mercs to take on high-risk missions near Clan territory, where constant patrols and danger lurk around every corner. In MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries - Shadows of Kerensky, players face off against 16 powerful OmniMechs, but they can then add cutting-edge firepower to their own hangar, unleashing Clan weapons and equipment to tip the odds in their favor. There are also going to be new Inner Sphere weapons, thirteen new variants, and the Bullshark. Lastly, players will be able to recruit brand new elite MechWarriors with unique abilities.</p>



<p>As a reminder, just like the base MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries, this DLC is powered by Unreal Engine 4, unlike MechWarrior 5: Clans, which was made with Unreal Engine 5.</p>

                <p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is one of the biggest releases of 2025 so far, earning positive reviews and selling over 3 million copies since arriving in March. If you’ve yet to check out the latest epic from Ubisoft, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows is getting its first big discount for Prime Day, and you can pick up the Amazon-exclusive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D47WHMQD,B0D47WTKPM&amp;tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Assassin’s Creed Shadows: Limited Edition</a> for $47.50 (normally $70). That’s the best price we’ve ever seen for the game, which has rarely dipped below $70. This Amazon-exclusive version includes the <strong>Sekiryu Character Pack</strong>, offering legendary gear and weapons, plus a mount and trinket. Prime Day runs from July 8-11, so you only have a few days to pick this deal up--assuming it doesn't sell out before then. The deal applies to the PS5 and Xbox versions.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-ref-id="1900-6418344">Assassin’s Creed Shadows review</a> gave it an 8/10, praising Naoe’s fluid movement system and engaging stealth gameplay. The world is also an absolute blast to explore, thanks to changing seasons and plenty of dramatic vistas.</p><p>“Naoe's gameplay is the best that the series has felt since the transition to a more action-RPG format--Assassin's Creed Shadows is an absolute blast to play,” wrote critic Jordan Ramée. “Shadows feels like a world that Ubisoft Quebec has made its own…Shadows keeps its open fields and winding roads interesting with picturesque views, amusing conversations from the odd passerby, and a world that feels more alive than Origins' Egypt or Odyssey's Greece, because it changes and evolves with the seasons.”</p><h2>Assassin’s Creed Books</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4521446-mixcollage-25-jun-2025-09-32-am-853.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521446" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4521446-mixcollage-25-jun-2025-09-32-am-853.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521446"></a><figcaption>Assassin's Creed Shadows Deluxe Guide and Deluxe Art Book</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4521446-mixcollage-25-jun-2025-09-32-am-853.jpg"></figure><p>Looking to dive deeper into the expansive world of Assassin’s Creed?
