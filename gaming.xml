            <p>
Everybody makes mistakes! That's life, really, a constant series of tiny mistakes that are sometimes good ones, sometimes bad ones, occasionally purposeful, often not. Here's one that was very much not purposeful: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pico-park-classic-edition">Pico Park: Classic Edition</a>, a delightful co-op puzzle platformery game you've almost definitely seen a bunch of Twitch streamers play during COVID lockdown, is now permanently free.
</p>
<p>
For some context, Pico Park: Classic Edition released almost 10 whole years ago in 2016, and despite the fact that up to 10 people can play together, it was an offline only game. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/461040/view/511841259183144976">August</a>, developer Tecopark said that they were thinking of updating the game soon to add in online support, an update that did in fact arrive in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/461040/view/563634739104186763?l=english">September</a>, and one that they thought they "might charge a small fee for." Come September, the update is released, and online play is added, with plans to keep it free for about a week.
</p>
<p>
Except, Steam apparently doesn't allow you to switch between a game being paid-for and free an infinite number of times, resulting in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/461040/PICO_PARKClassic_Edition/">this message</a> from Tecopark: "I was planning to switch to a paid plan after updating the online support. but I forgot that once you switch from paid to free, I can never go back to paid! :) If you enjoy playing this free version, be sure to try the series (Pico Park, Pico Park 2) too."
</p>
<p>
Welp! Truly seems like there's not much to be done there, but the matter of fact approach to the news that the game is permanently free does tickle me. What else can you do in a situation like that? I doubt that Pico Park: Classic Edition was making all that much for Tecopark in any case, particularly with Pico Park (2021) being as popular as it is.
</p><p>If you're wondering, "why didn't they just discount it to 100% off?" the answer is you can't! The maximum discount you can set on Steam is 90% off. Don't ask me why, it's just one of those weird Steam things that robs mostly inconsequential control from developers that release games on the platform.
</p>
<p>
In any case, unless you're someone who likes to keep their Steam library as lean as possible (you're not better than the rest of us), it's a fun little game to add to your library free of charge.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Baby Steps</i> is the latest hilariously difficult game from Bennett Foddy of <i>QWOP </i>and <i>Getting Over It</i>, here working in collaboration with Gabe Cuzzillo and Maxi Boch. And it’s not just in your efforts to put one foot in front of the other and make progress that the game finds ludicrous ways to punish you. Players have discovered that, should you dare to skip the cutscenes throughout your ordeal, you’ll be treated to an unskippable 28-minute cutscene. Congratulations to Foddy &amp; co. for innovating bold new ways for video games to fuck with you.</p> <p>The game loves to do that. Not only does it take the concept of a “walking simulator” to the extreme, making the act of placing one foot in front of the other wonderfully tricky and maddening, but it plays games with its cutscenes, too. Again, literally. Cutscenes taunt you with a mini-game that you must complete if you want to skip ‘em.</p>

 <p>And if you’re really so tempted to give the game the proverbial middle finger and skip all of the cutscenes by passing these mini-games, at the end of the game you’ll be confronted with an unskippable 28-minute cutscene featuring two characters talking about how much of a bummer it is that so much work went into these cutscenes and yet, there you are, just skipping them. Wow. I hope you feel bad about yourself.</p>

 <p>If you’re not up for making your own way, step by hilariously agonizing step, through <i>Baby Steps</i>, skipping the cutscenes all the while, you can watch the whole thing here:</p>   <p>Anyway, the anthropomorphic donkey is enough to sell me on this game. Just what I need, more 2025 gems to fill up my already dense-ass backlog.</p>

                <p>Literal walking simulator Baby Steps is already a punishing affair, but the game has one last trick up its sleeve that might make certain players fume with rage.</p><p>If you skip enough cutscenes in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/well-this-esrb-description-sure-is-a-wild-ride/1100-6534659/" data-ref-id="1100-6534659">wacky and raunchy Baby Steps</a>, you'll be treated (or penalized, depending how you look at it) with a meandering 28-minute long cutscene full of meta jokes and haphazard conversation topics, which user Cuttyflame shared on YouTube (per <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/skipping-all-baby-steps-cutscenes-unlocks-a-secret-28-minute-punishment-cutscene/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>).</p><p>Baby Steps, which was made by Ape Out developers Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and QWOP creator Bennett Foddy, actively discourages players you skipping story cutscenes, requiring you to complete minigames that increase in complexity each subsequent time you try to skip a scene.</p><p>Skipping around 30 cutscenes results in this shaggy dog story of a cutscene playing at the end of the story, according to Cuttyflame.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQahQACsvPU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mQahQACsvPU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The secret ending cutscene has protagonist Nate, voiced by Cuzzillo, reaching the cabin of donkey-human hybrid Moose, voiced by Foddy. Nate makes some fourth wall-breaking comments about the player skipping cutscenes, beginning a long-winded conversation with a spread of topics.</p><p>From their interest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-new-ip-intergalactic-has-the-deepest-gameplay-the-studio-has-ever-done/1100-6531793/" data-ref-id="1100-6531793">Naughty Dog's next game</a> to their favorite fictional clowns, Cuzzillo and Foddy go on and on, adding in additional jabs toward cutscene skippers and joking that they'll likely skip this scene as well.</p><p>The role of non-interactive cinematics in what is otherwise a very interactive medium of entertainment has always been a subject of debate, but this extended scene almost feels like Cuzzillo and Foddy putting a spotlight on their voicework and shaming players for missing out on it, though all in good fun.</p><p>Baby Steps is currently available only on PlayStation 5 and PC, along with being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baby-steps-is-steam-deck-verified-meaning-you-can-just-throw-the-whole-system-when-frustrated/1100-6534828/" data-ref-id="1100-6534828">verified for Steam Deck</a>.

                <p>Company of Heroes developer Relic Entertainment is keen to make and release games faster, CEO Justin Dowdeswell said in a new interview, but the company isn't banking on AI to get there.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-relic-entertainment-wants-to-make-games-more-quickly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>, Dowdeswell said one of the company's Achilles heels is that it has taken too long to release new games. "There's long stretches of time between game releases, and you lose touch with the players, people lose touch with what you're up to--and they generally cost a lot more, the longer they take," he said.</p><p>Part of what Relic will look to do in the future is "get to market more frequently," and that doesn't mean the company wants to lower the quality bar and simply ship things faster for the sake of it.</p><p>How can Relic achieve this? Already, the studio has improved how fast it can prototype new ideas, Dowdeswell said, noting that staffers can now get a prototype up and running in four weeks. The executive added that improving project management and specifically controlling scope is another way.</p><p>Could AI help Relic make games even faster, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">some developers are attempting</a>? Dowdeswell said businesses around the world today are "trying to figure out" how AI can help them, and right now, AI tools and systems are helpful for Relic in "workflows around the office."</p><p>"Even just reviewing something or summarizing something. I get more done. And I think that there's something in that concept of getting more done, that's part of where the power is," he said.</p><p>As for actual game development, Dowdeswell said humans will continue to be essential to the process. "We still need people making decisions, we still need people coming up with ideas, we still need people creating an architecture," he said. "And for me at least, it's not about replacing people, it's just [about taking] some of the slightly more annoying things off the list and getting them done more quickly. There's power in that."</p><p>Dowdeswell said AI may be able to be implemented in game development to help people with "augmenting skills" they already have.</p><p>Relic "can't ignore" AI, Dowdeswell said, but he's not ready to go all-in yet, either. "So I think understanding how it serves us and where it serves us is the starting point. And then as we gain experience with it, understanding where we want it to stop, I think that's important," he said.</p><p>Another area of concern around AI for Relic is regarding public perception. Right now, Dowdeswell said, "I don't think we have an answer for that," but it's something the studio is "in the middle of figuring out collectively."</p><p>People have concerns about AI for a variety of reasons, including the possibility of job losses, copyright and plagiarism issues, and a number of other elements. Thanks in part to AI, Nvidia's market cap has exceeded $4 trillion and the company is now the world's most valuable by a significant margin. Some have expressed fears of an AI bubble that could pop and lead to a number of negative consequences.</p><p>Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a> EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a> Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a></p>

He warned readers against falling into these cycles, providing a framework for both industry patterns and what he calls "fad audits." This sort of transparency is unusual for an executive, something Mahoney himself alluded to in the post itself, referencing an exchange with a Bloomberg reporter in 2015, in which he was advised </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to speak freely about his opinion on virtual reality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is easy to look back and ridicule everyone involved," Mahoney, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nexon-ceo-owen-mahoney-to-retire-after-a-decade-at-the-helm">who left Nexon in 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, wrote. "But the phenomenon of game industry hype cycles is actually serious business.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil">Stephen Totilo at Game File (paywalled)</a>, Ubisoft cancelled an Assassin's Creed game in 2024 that would have been set in the 19th century, specifically in a post-American Civil War era setting. Players would have taken on the role of a Black man who had been enslaved in the American South before the war, now living in the western regions of the country, looking to start a new life.</p>



<p>That is, until you would have been recruited by the Order of Assassins and sent back to the American South to face a growing Templar threat, which would have, according to Totilo's report, seen your character "<em>confront the emergence of the Ku Klux Klan</em>."</p>



<p>Totilo's report comes from a mix of five current and former Ubisoft employees who all spoke under anonymity, who claim that the game was cancelled for two main reasons.</p>



<p>The first was Ubisoft deciding it didn't want to go through the same online turmoil it went through <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-respectful-representation/">over the inclusion of Yasuke</a> in Assassin's Creed Shadows. The second reason was that Ubisoft management ultimately seemed to believe that releasing an Assassin's Creed game with this setting would have been like stepping on the third rail in the United States with regards to the game's political setting.</p>



<p>"<em>Too political in a country too unstable, to make it short</em>," a source reportedly told Game File. Another source added, "<em>I was terribly disappointed by not surprised by leadership. They are making more and more decisions to maintain the political 'status quo' and take no stand, no risk, even creative</em>."</p>



<p>This wouldn't have been the first time Ubisoft has broached atrocities like slavery in its historical settings. Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry was a spin-off to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, where you play as Adéwalé, a Black man from Trinidad who was a slave before his time on Edward Kenway's ship in the Black Flag campaign. Beyond your regular Assassin's Creed stealth and action gameplay, a core element of the story was freeing other Black people who had been enslaved by the Templars.</p>



<p>In fact, you could argue that making the kind of game described by the report here would be the next logical step if you wanted to continue exploring the idea of a character fighting back against those who enslaved him and those like him.</p>



<p>It's also worth pointing out that for all the 'backlash' Ubisoft received online for having Yasuke as one of two protagonists, Assassin's Creed Shadows had a stellar launch <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/assassins-creed-shadows/">from a critical</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-for-march-2025-while-fortnite-was-the-most-played-game-on-consoles/"> commercial perspective</a>, and even now <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-europes-best-selling-new-game-2025/">is still one of the best-selling games of 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Whether Ubisoft would have been able to execute on this story is another matter, but the fact that Ubisoft management allegedly deemed a story that would have, among other things, pointed out the very obvious fact that slavery is an awful, terrible, and disgusting stain on human history, "<em>too political</em>," is telling in its own way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There are a lot of</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-jump-button-battlefield-6-disc-2000632532"><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span> games</span></a><span> I haven’t played, but when I hear that Ubisoft’s historical fiction franchise is exploring an interesting moment in human history, my ears perk up. </span><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil"><i><span>Game File</span></i></a><span> has a new report about one game that didn’t make it out of Ubisoft, and everything from its fascinating concept to the maddening reasons it was canceled makes it sound like it absolutely should have been made.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The game would have reportedly been set during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, and put players in the shoes of a formerly enslaved Black man. This man would be recruited by the titular Creed and would return to the South to fight for justice for his people. The game would have even portrayed the founding of the white supremacist organization the Ku Klux Klan. </span><i><span>Game File</span></i><span>‘s sources say canceling this game in July 2024 was Ubisoft “bowing to controversy” after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-rant-yasuke-viral-cowboy-1851771346"><span>racist backlash</span></a><span> to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-who-is-yasuke-black-samurai-1851482754"><span>Yasuke</span></a><span>, the Black samurai in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/its-the-perfect-time-to-play-assassins-creed-shadows-2000624758"><i><span>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</span></i></a><span>, and concern that portraying a Black man’s life in the Reconstruction era would be “too political in a country too unstable.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The game was in the concept phase and had been approved by Ubisoft leadership, and though it was still years away, it was canceled because the company was already dealing with hostility over Yasuke’s inclusion in </span><i><span>Shadows </span></i><span>and, seeing the current political climate in the United States, was wary of releasing a game that may have been seen as divisive. Other sources also note that Ubisoft’s financial struggles after the pirate game </span><i><span>Skull &amp; Bones</span></i><span> underperformed and the free-to-play shooter </span><i><span>The Division Heartland </span></i><span>was canceled had made the company “risk-averse.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“I was terribly disappointed but not surprised by leadership,” a source told </span><i><span>Game File</span></i><span>. “They are making more and more decisions to maintain the political ‘status quo’ and take no stand, no risk, even creative.”</span></p> <p><i><span>Game File</span></i><span> goes on to emphasize that the broader U.S. political climate played more of a role in the cancellation of the Reconstruction-era </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span> than the Yasuke outrage campaign, and that the cancellation happened shortly after the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump on July 13. We’ve reached out to Ubisoft for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back.</span></p> <p><span>So, that sucks. </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span> has not always shied away from exploring difficult eras of human history, and has even knowingly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/henry-kissinger-assassins-creed-templar-brotherhood-1851061127"><span>woven its own mythology into real-world conflicts</span></a><span>. It’s even told stories involving Black slaves before in </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed III: Liberation</span></i><span>. It sounds like the team at Ubisoft was passionate about what they were working on, but while they were hoping to put something into the world that could maybe make an impact, someone up top got scared. What a shame.</span></p>

<p>A new report has outlined details about a now-cancelled Assassin’s Creed game that was in development and was set to take place after the Civil War.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/leaderboard?r=2ysgx9&amp;referrer_token=2ysgx9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game File</a>‘s Stephen Totilo, a post-Civil War Assassin’s Creed was in development at one point, but was ultimately cancelled.</p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed series has been going strong for almost two decades. With countless entries spanning multiple eras, the historical action games have been a staple for Ubisoft fans. The latest entry, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, finally releases after a lot of delays and some controversy regarding one of its characters, Yasuke. While it has subsided, it may have led to a new entry being scrapped altogether, according to Totilo.</p>



<p>They revealed that, at one point, a title set post-Civil War was in development. The game would have a former slave protagonist who returns to the South to confront the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. Development was progressing well, and the team seemed pleased with the project. Unfortunately, sources informed Game File that it ceased development due to several reasons. Key among them was the backlash of Shadows’ Yasuke and the political climate of the United States at the time.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-details-and-corroboration">More Details and Corroboration</h2>



<p>For those familiar with Insider Gaming’s coverage, you’ll be aware that we have extensively covered the Assassin’s Creed franchise and its future releases. Although not mentioned by Totilo, I can confirm that this project was known as Project Scarlet.</p>



<p>As Totilo mentioned, the game was cancelled following backlash over Shadows’ Yasuke. Still, before then, it was slated to be the next mainline RPG for the franchise, releasing in fiscal year 2028 (around October 2027).</p>

<p>The game was in development at Ubisoft Quebec, and from the information I was able to gather, it was led by Game Director Scott Philips, who had previously worked on Assassin’s Creed Syndicate and Odyssey. While the game was in a concept phase, everyone working on the project was seemingly thrilled.</p>

Now, that team has reunited to form an employee-owned studio, Sackbird Studios.</p><p>The studio shared the announcement on <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its official site</a>, and noted that Sackbird is self-funded "for multiple years" without the aid of outside investors. That will allow the team to retain full creative control of their own games.</p><p>"After years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets, said Sackbird Studios chief creative officer David Worley in a statement. "We're fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games."</p><p>"We're grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people," added Sackbird CEO Lee Ridout. "When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft--and our team--was to create a studio where creative independence isn't negotiable."</p><p>The announcement notes that there are under ten current employees in the studio. Sackbird isn't ready to disclose its first game yet beyond sharing that it will be an original project, which will be available on PC and consoles. The studio also reaffirmed the team's desire to craft "bold, character-driven experiences free from corporate compromises."</p>

            <p>
Are you able to picture things in your head? Try it, right now, we'll go for the classic thing to picture, an apple. If you can't see diddly squat, you've potentially got aphantasia, a condition which is essentially the inability to visualise an image within your head. It's interesting to me because I feel I'm on the opposite end of it, I can picture that apple pretty darn clearly. With that in mind, it makes me all the more curious about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/afantasia">Afantasia</a>, spelled with an f not a ph, a "surreal exploration game about a boy searching for identity in his hometown."
</p>
<p>
Afantasia, even with its stylistic misspelling, is a great name, I think, because it is a game I quite deeply enjoy looking at. There's a lo-fi quality to it, a pixel art point &amp; click game pushed into the third dimension. It's moody, a little grimy and grungy, with an appropriate amount of mystique around it. The game's Steam page gives very little away, but offers just enough to entice me.

As mentioned, it's point &amp; click, but there's also exploration in what looks like possibly second person, and what definitely is first person perspectives. One of the few bits of descriptive text explains that you can delve into memories and talk to local townsfolk. The untrustworthy nature of memory and recalled image is a topic I also love seeing explored in games, so I'm quite curious to see what Afantasia does with the theme.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, there's no release date in sight, however, a sliver of good news: there is a demo you can check out to give apparently 30 minutes of your time to, if Afantasia's atmosphere is pulling you in as it is me. And if you don't have time, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3336670/AFANTASIA/">you can always pop it on the ever-growing wishlist</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Sky the Scrapper</em> is a game about the untethered funk of early adulthood, punctuated by pulsing 2D high-score races to clean the sides of buildings. Succeed and you’ll collect just enough cash to keep your miserly solo life in a messy one-room apartment afloat. Fail and you’ll be forced to move back in with your parents. It’s an earnest mashup of twitchy arcade action and chill life sim that’s stayed with me long after I’ve stopped playing.</p> <p>Released on Steam by developer Ryo Kobuchi over the summer, <em>Sky the Scrapper</em> is divided into two parts. The first is a visual novel in which you navigate a weekly schedule from a menu screen that looks like its nestled inside an early 2000s ad for the PS2. You get text messages from your parents guilt-tripping you and updates from your boss at the window-washing company about whether you’re meeting expectations at work. If it’s your day off you can do stuff like take a nap, visit the museum, or go out to the club, each of which costs a certain amount of money and impacts your mood for the better or worse, which in turn affects your stamina recovery rate on the job. This is the <em>Persona</em>-like part of the game.</p>

 <p>When it’s not your day off, you spend your time mopping bird poop, graffiti, and other muck off the walks of urban highrises. You hang from a rope that acts like a 2D pendulum, letting you swing from one side of the building to the other. Hold down one button and you’ll be able to spend stamina to climb up the wall. Hold it down too long and you’ll lose your grip and plummet to the ground, leaving you with only partial pay and injuring yourself ahead of the next day’s work.</p>

  <p>A timer drives the action, and you only have a minute to clean up as much of each building as possible. Fail to wring out your tools at various times throughout the job and you’ll clean less effectively. There’s even an ultimate meter you can build to unleash a super-cleaning attack that lets you effortlessly wall-run without spending stamina. It’s an unusual amalgamation of arcade-y mechanics unlike anything else I’ve come across. After successfully completing certain jobs you earn points to unlock ability nodes along a sprawling network of skills, perks, and other buffs. You can also buy equipment to help you see at night or increase your stamina.</p>

 <p>There’s a lot of RNG in S<em>ky the Scrapper</em> and the difficulty ramps up surprisingly fast. Your changing work schedule dictates some of the hazards you’ll face, from barely lit night shifts to bad weather and birds darting at you. You might feel like you’re doing an okay job, only to realize you’re not scaling up your character fast enough to contend with the growing challenge, or you may find your ambitions clipped short by simple bad luck. There’s a poignancy to these moments as the mundanity of the rest of your daily city life builds up around them, but it can also feel a bit overly punishing.</p> <p>None of these systems or mechanics is as individually satisfying or polished as I’d like, but combine it altogether and <em>Sky the Scrapper</em><em>&nbsp;</em>offers a surprisingly unique and effective package. It feels like it establishes the template for a really neat, more fleshed-out sequel. Even so, I’m glad I stumbled upon <em>Sky the Scrapper</em> and still occasionally feel the call to go back and try to complete each of the different story scenarios and endings.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When Does The Battlefield 6 Review Embargo Lift?]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-does-the-battlefield-6-review-embargo-lift.1320172/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After years in the making, Battlefield 6 is here, and reviews are about to start coming in as the embargo on the game gets set to lift. Insider Gaming has learned when those with the game can start giving their thoughts on what they played, and showcase more gameplay from the upcoming release.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-battlefield-6-review-embargo">When Is The Battlefield 6 Review Embargo?</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/CGMagonline/status/1975992766296473618" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">multiple outlets</a> with early access to the game, the <strong>Battlefield 6 review embargo lifts at 11 am EST/8 am PST on Thursday, October 9</strong>. That means players will start seeing impressions go up around then and in the coming days and weeks</p>



<p>Expect articles and videos on gameplay, modes, features, visuals, audio, and, yes, the campaign to all start showing up around the same time. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-insider-gaming-have-a-review">Will Insider Gaming Have A Review?</h2>



<p>While Insider Gaming won’t have a review up for embargo, there will be plenty of coverage of the game from guides to general impressions. For thoughts on the game from Mike, Grant, Tom, and Albert, make sure to check out Insider Gaming Weekly, every Thursday at 4 pm ET <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over on YouTube</a>. That’s if Tom can be pulled away from playing it to record a show.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-review-score-predictions">Battlefield 6 Review Score Predictions</h2>



<p>The last game in the franchise, Battlefield 2042, wasn’t an overly well-received game from critics and fans. The game has a 68 on Metacritic and received “generally unfavorable reviews” from players on the platform. Fast-forward to today, and Battlefield 6 is one of the most-hyped games from EA in some time. After the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">success of the open betas</a> during the summer, it makes sense to think that the game could be generally well-received. </p>



<p>Both Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 1 are tied for the highest Metacritic score in franchise history with an 88. Will Battlefield 6 come close to it? It’s possible, but reviews will have to be blown away by not only the game’s multiplayer offerings but also how the campaign plays out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new indie studio formed from former ZeniMax employees, with leads from Elder Scrolls Online and Project Blackbird, has been revealed. </p>



<p>Zenimax Online Studios, formed in 2007, had a massive following thanks, in part, to The Elder Scrolls Online. The MMORPG has continued to bring in new players daily, selling almost $2 billion in sales since 2014. Unfortunately, due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-zenimax-online-mmorpg-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest Microsoft layoffs</a>, over 300 employees from the company were let go. This includes some who worked on a yet-to-be-revealed new IP called Project Blackbird, which Xbox cancelled. However, it seems some of the laid-off crew have come together to form a new, employee-owned indie studio.</p>



<h2 id="h-sackbird-studios-officially-announced-run-by-former-zenimax-online-leads">Sackbird Studios Officially Announced, Run by Former ZeniMax Online Leads</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hello, World. 👋<br>Today we’re proud to announce Sackbird Studios — an independent game studio based in Baltimore, Maryland, built by friends who’ve spent years designing worlds, systems, and stories for players everywhere.<a href="https://t.co/1jmlgteUM2">https://t.co/1jmlgteUM2</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/indiedev?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#indiedev</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/videogames?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#videogames</a></p>— sackbirdstudios (@sackbirdstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/sackbirdstudios/status/1975945947017564556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the new studio’s blog</a>, former leads at ZeniMax Online Studios have formed Sackbird Studios. The crew consists of 10 former employees of the Bethesda-owned studio. Many of them worked on The Elder Scrolls Online and the cancelled Project Blackbird. Furthermore, it is entirely employee-owned and has already been funded for multiple years. In a statement, Sackbird Studios COO David Worley said,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“After years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets,” states Worley. “We’re fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another statement, this time from CEO Lee Ridout, states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people,” said Ridout. “When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft—and our team—was to create a studio where creative independence isn’t negotiable.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the moment, the team is not ready to share its first title, but promises that it will launch on PC and consoles. While the team is grateful for the time they spent at ZeniMax Online Studios, it seems they aren’t pulling any stops to ensure its work gets out of the door. It’ll be excited to see what Sackbird Studios creates, especially if it takes from the cancelled Project Blackbird.</p>



<p>Are you happy to hear about Sackbird Studios? What do you think? Let us know in the comments, on the forums, and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/5f4cvU6G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has just greenlit an official <em>Clue</em> TV show. The major streaming platform's latest show will be an unscripted competitive experience where players will need to solve a murder mystery straight from the iconic social deduction board game.</p>

<h2>The Clue TV Show Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official report <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/clue-competition-series-netflix-1236571635/" rel="nofollow">by Deadline</a>, the <em>Clue</em> TV show will feature a competitive game show experience. Contestants will face physical and mental challenges to collect clues. Those clues will aid them in a real-life game of social deduction. Contestants will need to outwit their opponents and identify who killed whom, where, and with what.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clue-classic-game-board.jpg?itok=3eR3zsPv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clue-classic-game-board.jpg?itok=EdouKvqz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If the contestants guess correctly, money will be added a major prize pot. If they guess incorrectly, they are eliminated. The report does confirm that the usual suspects from the Clue board game, Colonel Mustard, Professor Plum, Mrs. White, and Miss Scarlett, will be present for these sections. The show will be produced by&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Like so many families and friends over the years, we’ve gathered around the table trying to figure out who did it—making Clue a source of nostalgia that everyone shares,” said Jeff Gaspin, VP of Unscripted Series, Netflix. “Thanks to the incredible vision of our partners at Hasbro Entertainment, IPC, and B17, we’re delivering a fresh, imaginative whodunit competition that will invite today’s audiences into that iconic world.”</p>

<p>The Netflix <em>Clue</em> TV show is a notable departure from the board game's roots. It was originally a broad tabletop experience imitating posh Agatha Christie murder mysteries.</p>

There was the 1985 feature film directed by Jonathan Lynn starring major stars like Tim Curry and Christopher Lloyd. The film was a dark murder mystery satire,, complete with outrageous murder methods, convoluted character motivations, and farcical slapstick. It even had three different endings, meant to invoke the replayability of the <em>Clue</em> board game.</p>

<p>The <em>Clue</em> TV show is in keeping with company Hasbro's recent stint of adapting their various properties to film and tv. Those projects include another game show based on Monopoly and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-screenwriters-have-been-summoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">feature film</a> based on the iconic card game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/baby-steps-punishes-serial-cutscene-skippers-with-a-28-minute-long-cutscene</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's a cutscene about nothing.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Baby Steps, the literal walking simulator recently released from Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett Foddy is silly, absurdist, and often just plain weird...in a good way. But one of it's goofiest gags is one that few players are likely to see: a 28-minute long cutscene that plays only if you successfully skip all or most of the game's other cutscenes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I say successfully, I do mean that. Skipping cutscenes in Baby Steps isn't just a matter of pushing a "Skip" button. Each cutscene skip forces you to play a weird little minigame of sorts with the Skip button, where it's almost as though the Skip button is trying to actively stop you from doing the skip. You can fail these skips too, and if you don't skip enough of them, you won't trigger the ridiculous, lengthy reward (or punishment) that ensues from being a skip-a-holic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The cutscene itself occurs when Nate visits Moose at the cabin at the end of the game. If the player skipped everything else but doesn't skip this last cutscene, the cutscene proceeds with Nate breaking the fourth wall to tell Moose about the cutscene skipping, and express that he's not really up to performing the final scene as a result. The two sit outside and chat as their actors, Cuzzillo and Foddy, shoot the breeze about everything from broccolli sandwiches to the fact that their characters can't raise their eyebrows individually to the challenges of audio recording under a busy flight path. At one point they try to take a nap, but that proves awkward, and they get sidetracked talking about mold, the human need to pee as a useful writing device, and localization struggles. They repeatedly lambast the player's incessant cutscene skipping and their feelings about it, then grow frustrated when the player doesn't skip this particular one, forcing them to continue recording dialogue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cutscene goes on for around 28 minutes of silly, inane discussion between the two before they finally decide it's important to show the credits and a cat starts meowing at them to hurry things along. Beautiful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players who just want to watch all this without skipping every other scene can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQahQACsvPU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find the whole thing on YouTube</a>. Whether or not you see this sort of thing as a punishment or a reward for your or someone else's abuse of the skip button is entirely up to you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baby-steps-review">gave Baby Steps a 9/10</a> calling it "an infuriating ordeal of intentionally awkward physics that’s brutal, unbelievably stupid, and downright awesome."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/hautepad-c16-and-c16-s-arcade-controllers-for-switch-1-and-2-affordable-and-unique-in-equal-measure</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-hautepad-c16-c16-s-arcade-controllers-for-switch-1-2-affordable-and-unique-in-equal-measure.1320097/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="d24447042aaa7"><a title="C16 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d24447042aaa7/c16-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A short while back, I looked at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/hautepad-x-arcade-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-a-modular-masterclass-at-a-premium-price">Hautepad X</a>, Cosmox Gaming’s premium arcade controller that boasts modular components for a highly customisable experience - with an equally high price to boot.</p>
<p>For those who might not be on board with such an ambitious product but still want to see why Cosmox has been garnering praise in the fighting game community, the C16 and C16-S might be more up your alley.</p>
<p>Coming in at just under <strong>$90</strong> (roughly <strong>£67</strong>) each, these new wired models are roughly the same price as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-arcade-controller-for-switch-plus-switch-2-the-best-way-to-play-street-fighter-6">8BitDo Arcade Controller</a>, yet neither skimps on quality or features. Compatible with Switch and Switch 2 after you follow the instructions and set the right profile (PS5 and Xbox owners will need to spend more on a converter like the <a href="https://www.brookaccessory.com/products/wingmanfgc/index.html">Brook Wingman</a>), the C16 and C16-S weigh in at 789g. Slim yet sturdy.</p>

<p>You’ve got hot-swappable key caps with <a href="https://www.kailh.net/">Kailh Wind Engine switches</a>, which feel tactile without making too much noise. Just like the Hautepad X, however, you can swap out the switches for something more to your liking with the included switch puller. There's a function bar at the top, and this is where you’ll find a small OLED screen to display real-time button inputs, lights and tournament toggles, and buttons like 'start', 'select', 'capture', and 'turbo'. These all come with their own light-up labels, too, provided you have tournament mode turned off.</p>
<p>What’s the difference between the C16 and C16-S? Functionally, the two are identical; they look similar, the function bar remains the same, and the USB slots are in the same positions.</p>
<p>They both have 16 switches on the top, but the key difference is the layout. The C16 is what I’d deem a more ‘traditional’ layout; it’s the same as what you’d see on the Hautepad X, 8BitDo’s Arcade Controller, and many other models making the rounds. The C16-S, meanwhile, boasts a ‘split’ layout that shifts a few of the switches around for something more unique.</p>
<p>So essentially, if you lay your hands on top of the C16-S, all 10 fingers will rest comfortably on the switches, with your pinkies sitting on the pill-shaped buttons on the far sides, and your thumbs on the same buttons located toward the lower middle.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with a more traditional layout, this can take a bit of getting used to; with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, for example, the macro for Drive Impact would be on the far right, so you’d whack your pinky down to activate it. On the C16-S, the same macro has moved over to the middle, requiring you to shift your right thumb over to hit it.</p>
<p>Naturally, you can remap the buttons however you like via the web configuration tool, so if you want to simply move the Drive Impact macro back over to the right, you can. It’s worth keeping in mind, however, that if you’re keen to just plug in and play, you’ll need to spend a bit of time getting used to the layout. One key downside is that the OLED screen doesn't match the layout on the C16-S, so you can't really use this as an accurate guide.</p>
<p>Ultimately, neither option is 'better' than the other here; it really comes down to personal preference. If you’re a complete beginner to the world of leverless arcade sticks, then consider the C16; its tried-and-tested layout is used widely across all arcade stick manufacturers, so moving from one to another is relatively painless. If you’re after something different, then the C16-S is a pretty cool little setup - one that you won’t easily find elsewhere.</p>

<p>Whichever model you opt for, the switches themselves feel great. The spacing is appropriate, so unless you have really tiny hands, you’ll find that all of the buttons are within easy reach, and combos on the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive-</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> will feel effortlessly natural. Down on the bottom, the surface curves downward slightly, which makes for a lovely space on which to rest your wrists while boasting a pretty sweet pixelated design that shimmers in the light.</p>
<p>On the back, you’ll find two basic non-slip strips on either side to prevent the controller from sliding about on smooth surfaces, while a button labelled ‘push’ is on the right. Pressing this in produces a pin on the other side which pushes the magnetic acrylic cover away from the main body for easy customisation – kind of like how the magnetic Joy-Con 2 work.</p>
<p>As standard, Cosmox includes four design templates for each model, with an additional two blank sheets in case you want to create your own little masterpiece. Aluminium covers have also been released which add a nice bit of extra weight to the controller, but these are sold separately. As for the acrylic cover, the frosted matte design feels lovely and repels nasty fingerprints, but it does slightly blur the artwork underneath.</p>

<p>Finally, both controllers feature some really lovely RGB lighting. All main buttons come with their own light-up rims around the outside which change colour by default. Pressing the buttons results in a white light to indicate the input, but you can also disable this completely via the function bar.</p>
<p>Around the outside of the controller, you'll also find an RGB strip, and this looks awesome when laid on a flat surface in a dark room. It really helps the controller stand out in the crowd, and this combined with some custom artwork allows for some self-expression. Of course, you can take this a step further by customising the lights to your liking via the configuration tool. You can make it so the buttons and RGB strip present specific colours, or you can simply prevent them from changing on their own.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The C16 and C16-S are both great options if you're after an affordable arcade controller that punches well above its weight. Which one you opt for ultimately comes down to personal preference: the C16 offers a more traditional layout, while the C16-S goes for something more unique that experienced players might want to try out.</p>
<p>Otherwise, minor quibbles aside, these are feature-rich controllers with remapping available via the web configuration tool, and the ability to easily swap out custom artwork makes for a tempting prospect for those who like to showcase their personalities via their hardware.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, the gaming industry was rocked by two big announcements: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive 50% Xbox Game Pass price hike</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leveraged buyout of EA for $55 billion from a Consortium of investors</a>. With both likely to influence the industry in their own ways, we have contacted MIDiA Research Games Analyst Brandon Sutton to get his opinion on what will happen to Electronic Arts and the Xbox brand.</p>



<p><strong><em>Brandon, what's your take on both news?</em></strong></p>



<p><em>While the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debt burden is notable</a>, Saudi Arabia and its partners purchasing EA makes sense on several levels. Financially, EA owns some of the most profitable gaming franchises with proven monetization models. Culturally, its partnerships with leading sports and entertainment brands give it a rare connection with global audiences that its new owners can leverage. Technologically, video game development offers a powerful testing ground for emerging tools like generative AI. This creates a natural compatibility for investors who are already invested in that space as well.</em></p>



<p><em>The increase in Xbox Game Pass prices are part of a wider pattern of rising costs across the industry. Inflation and rising costs of operation are certainly factors, but so is the growing consolidation of the market. This has emboldened major industry players to increase prices. The risk, however, is that consumers will still see gaming as a luxury and steep increases from larger companies could ultimately push them toward cheaper, indie alternatives</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Do you think EA will soon implement layoffs or even studio divestitures to reduce costs, and if so, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-devs-reportedly-worried-55-billion-ea-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is BioWare the main candidate</a>?</em></strong></p>



<p><em>Prior to the acquisition news, EA was already enacting layoffs, with Respawn being hit especially hard earlier this year, so the acquisition could slow some of that down. However, new ownership will likely be taking stock of where workers and teams can be cut, perhaps replaced with generative AI, in order to trim costs once the deal is finalized. Post-acquisition, it wouldn't be surprising to see studio divestitures or the sale of IP to recoup costs. BioWare is certainly a strong candidate, given the recent underperformance of Dragon Age: Veilguard.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Is there a risk that Microsoft will alienate some of its oldest Xbox fans with such a steep increase in Game Pass pricing and the fact that they have walked back on some promises? For instance, they have now removed Call of Duty from the Premium tier, so only the Ultimate tier will get access to the popular game.</em></strong></p>



<p><em>I think the move will alienate many longtime Xbox fans. However, Microsoft is likely calculating that an increase in negative sentiment will not translate into a meaningful amount of canceled subscriptions. That said, consumers are feeling a financial crunch right now and so rising prices combined with a sense of broken trust will likely have lasting consequences for the wider Xbox brand and Microsoft ecosystem even if Game Pass subscription revenue remains strong.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></em></p>

<p>Many are hoping to see these "open" playlists stick around for launch, and in fact, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1974646289347575911" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one report said that is indeed the plan</a>. However, Activision has yet to make any official announcements.</p><p>SBMM is a hot-button issue in a lot of multiplayer games, including Call of Duty.
