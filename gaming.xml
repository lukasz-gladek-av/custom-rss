<p>It's a new week, and it means Nintendo has updated its mobile music application with another video game soundtrack. This time, it's the album from the 2020 Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_origami_king">Paper Mario: The Origami King</a>.</p>
<p>According to the app, <strong>263 tracks</strong> have been added and there's a runtime of more than 11 hours! Nintendo notes how the tracklist includes songs such as "Red Streamer Battle, Autumn Mountain, and more". It joins the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> GameCube album, which is already available on the app.</p>
<p>Origami King had a whole host of composers including Shoh Murakami, Yoshiaki Kimura, Hiroki Morishita and Fumihiro Isobe, and it was led by Yoshito Sekigawa (who helped compose the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Thousand-Year Door</a> GameCube title and has also worked on multiple other Paper Mario games since then).</p>

<p>To access this album update on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app, you'll need to have an active (and paid) Switch Online membership. You can find out more about the weekly Nintendo Music updates and this particular Paper Mario game in our existing coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>

      <p>Back in 2019 Riot announced a fighting game called <em>Project L</em>, which would later be renamed <em>2XKO</em>. Released into early access on PC in late 2025, it hit consoles in January 2026.</p><p>We should note the game was only <em>announced </em>in 2019; it had been in development much, much longer, as<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-s-the-real-reason-games-are-taking-longer-to-make-?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a Game Developer story from September 2025 reports</u></a>. That piece, which interviews Riot Games senior game producer Patrick Miller, says the "nearly" ten years of work (by September 2025) put into <em>2XKO </em>"was vital to make sure the game isn't KO'd in round one", that "it takes a lot of time and effort to unpack the 30+ years of lessons that the veteran [fighting game] studios have learned", and that "I often remind my teammates that it took seven Tekken games (and two Tekken Tag games) to get to <em>Tekken 8</em>."&nbsp;</p><p>Today, just three weeks after the game was released on console,<a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Riot announced</u></a> that<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky"> <u>"roughly" <em>80 </em>members</u></a> of the development team are being let go because, in Riot's words, "the game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term."</p><p><strong>UPDATE 9:30pm ET</strong>: <em>Miller posted earlier today on social media that he was one of the affected.</em></p><p>While work on the game will continue, the layoffs and statement make clear that whatever "passionate core audience" the game has found, it's nowhere the size Riot leadership were hoping for or expecting, which is weird considering they supported development for a decade to make sure the game wasn't "KO'd in round one", only to throw in 80 towels before it has even been out (formally at least) for a <em>month</em>.</p><p>Riot says the affected developers can either find work elsewhere within Riot or, if that's not possible, will be given "a minimum of 6 months of notice pay and severance".</p>

<p>The estimates for its minute-long ad are through the roof</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-champions">Pokémon</a> banks an insane amount every year, so it can afford to splash some cash from time to time. If you are wondering how much yesterday's Super Bowl LX commercial cost, according to multiple reports, it's estimated to have required "at least $16 million" for just a single minute.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://screenrant.com/pokemon-super-bowl-commercial-budget-compared-games/">noted by ScreenRant</a>, this doesn't even factor in the "price of the ad itself, filming, and animating the Pokémon". And then there were mega stars such as Lady Gaga on display, who probably cost an arm and a leg to hire.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fypziht&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>While this amount of coin might not seem like a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/30/super-bowl-ad-prediction-market-contracts.html">big deal in the context of the Super Bowl</a> (or modern marketing budgets), this estimate has led to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1qzur3b/it_just_hit_me_that_the_cost_to_air_the_super/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemons-super-bowl-commercial-was-probably-expensive-unsurprisingly">speculation and debate</a> about how much this single ad spot costs compared to the development costs of the mainline video game entries. According to the source, the comparisons being drawn here are based on "unconfirmed leaks for the budget" of the latest game.</p>
<p>But hey, keep in mind, Pokémon seemingly remains out in front as the <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/56337-the-world-s-highest-grossing-media-franchises-revealed">highest-grossing media franchise of all-time</a>, with the series transcending the video games. And this is the 30th anniversary we're talking about here, so it's not necessarily a surprise to see The Pokémon Company spending big.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has already announced it will be celebrating this milestone anniversary in many different ways, including the release of a brand-new LEGO line later this month. Heck, TIME Magazine is even releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/time-magazine-reveals-special-edition-pokemon-30th-anniversary-covers">a special trio of Pokémon covers</a>, and we're sure we'll see some exciting announcements on Pokémon Day this year.</p>

            <guid>1430605</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>In 2023, we marveled at the sheer mass of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/lenovo-legion-go-suggests-gaming-portables-arent-big-enough-need-a-mouse/">Lenovo’s Legion Go</a>, a 1.88-pound, 11.8-inch-wide monstrosity of a Windows gaming handheld. In 2026, though, Ayaneo <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-%E2%85%A1">unveiled details of its Next II handheld</a>, which puts Lenovo’s big boy to shame while also offering heftier specs and a higher price than most other Windows gaming handhelds.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on the bulk first. The Ayaneo Next II weighs in at a truly wrist-straining 3.14 pounds, making it more than twice as heavy in the hands as the Steam Deck OLED (not to mention <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/ayaneo-next.html">2022’s original Ayaneo Next</a>, which weighed a much more reasonable 1.58 pounds). The absolute unit also measures 13.45 inches wide and 10.3 inches tall, according to <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-%E2%85%A1">Ayaneo’s spec sheet</a>, giving it a footprint approximately 60 percent larger than the Switch 2 (with Joy-Cons attached).</p>
<p>Ayaneo packs some seriously powerful portable PC performance into all that bulk, though. The high-end version of the system sports a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset with 16 Zen5 cores alongside a Radeon 8060S with 40 RDNA3.5 compute units. That should give this massive portable performance comparable to a desktop with an RTX 4060 or a gaming laptop like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/review-asus-rog-flow-z13-tablet-takes-the-asterisk-off-integrated-gpus/">last year’s high-end ROG Flow Z13</a>.</p>

<p>Ayaneo isn’t the first hardware maker to package the Max+ 395 chipset into a Windows gaming handheld; the <a href="https://onexplayerstore.com/products/onexfly-apex-worlds-most-powerful-8-gaming-handheld?srsltid=AfmBOopFsBCptD1CVpufarDc5z3tU2Rll0oGUDUkhOfaYI4SpQqvom5N&amp;variant=51844368433446">OneXPlayer OneXfly Apex</a> and <a href="https://gpdstore.net/product/gpd-win-5/?srsltid=AfmBOopMg00ogKmpn1yF-gf4ib1M9NifN9D26n2x7qDFur3HZLmF8aKu">GPD Win5</a> feature essentially the same chipset, the latter with an external battery pack. But the Next II neatly outclasses the (smaller and lighter) competition with a high-end 9.06-inch OLED screen, capable of 2400×1504 resolution, up to 165 Hz refresh rates, and 1,155 nits of brightness.</p>

              <p>An indie game gets raked over the metaphorical coals over a split second in its Steam trailer. Remedy Entertainment gets a new boss. And the publisher of<em> Arc Raiders</em> might be involved in a new <em>StarCraft</em> shooter. It’s a very late edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Who’s ready to <a href="https://x.com/conzmoleman/status/2020112379304972716">get into UncBall</a>?</p> <h2><em>Void War</em> is back on Steam after a dispute over shoulder pads</h2> <p>The <em>Warhammer</em>-inspired<em> FTL</em> mash-up was removed from Steam last month over a DMCA takedown request. Thought to possibly be someone trolling at the time, it turned out the 2025 strategy game was very much on the receiving end of <em>Warhammer</em> owner Games Workshop’s actual ire.</p>

 <p>“After over a week of no response, Games Workshop eventually replied to our email and confirmed the notice was theirs,” developer Tundra <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-issued-ftl-in-a-warhammer-40000-skin-steam-game-with-a-dmca-takedown-because-of-oversized-convex-shoulder-pads-with-a-metallic-rim-dev-says">told <em>IGN</em></a> in a statement. “They said their concern was limited to a specific shot from one of the trailers on the store page, arguing that certain elements could create the mistaken impression that<em> Void War</em> is associated with Games Workshop, specifically what they described as ‘the oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim.'”</p>  <p>Tundra ended up pulling the trailer to make the whole thing go away and the game is back up on Steam. “While we disagree with their assessment, the simplest way to get the game back up and avoid getting bogged down in DMCA process was to remove that trailer and move on,” it wrote. What a great system Valve has for hashing out frivolous complaints!</p>

 <h2>The owner of <em>Arc Raiders r</em>eportedly gets involved with <em>StarCraft</em></h2> <p>Korean publisher Nexxon signed a cooperation agreement with Blizzard to help it develop a project in the <em>StarCraft</em> universe according <a href="https://www.dnews.co.kr/uhtml/view.jsp?idxno=202601301526154230994">to<em> Dnews</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexon-to-reimagine-starcraft-as-a-shooter-secret-project-underway.1429834/">ResetEra</a>). It was <a href="https://kotaku.com/blizzard-starcraft-far-cry-open-world-shooter-leak-fps-1851700828">previously reported</a> that Blizzard is working on bringing back <em>StarCraft</em> as an open-world first-person shooter. Maybe we’ll get an announcement or at least a tease for whatever this is at BlizzCon 2026.</p>

 <h2><em>Mewgenics</em> fans go full cringe mode</h2> <p>Edmund McMillen and co-developer Tyler Glaiel asked players of the new roguelike to go act like kittens in public to win stuff online. <a href="https://twitter.com/SimpleSushii/status/2020279382464737372">They did exactly that</a>.</p> <h2>Remedy Entertainment gets a new CEO</h2> <p>Jean-Charles Gaudechon will take the role on March 1 as the studio gets ready to launch<em> Control 2</em> and hopefully, eventually, maybe tell people what’s up with the <em>Max Payne</em> remakes. He has creative director Sam Lake’s endorsement. “He very much understands our wildly unique vision and the value of the Remedy Connected Universe,” the Remedy veteran <a href="https://x.com/SamLakeRMD/status/2020929412972282195">wrote</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Replaced</em> gets a free demo</h2> <p>Players can now go hands-on with Sad Cat Studios’ long-awaited, retro-futurist, pixel-art action game on Xbox and PC for themselves starting February 11. The game has been delayed a bunch but comes to Game Pass on March 12.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/littlestjeff1-epstein-files-fortnite-v-bucks-conspiracy-epic-2000666464">Epic calls the Jeffrey Epstein <em>Fortnite</em> account a hoax, but conspiracy theorists aren’t buying it</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai-roblox-maelle-2000666407">Roblox promotes genAI and immediately rips off <em>Clair Obscur</em></a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/danganronpa-hundred-line-kazutaka-kodaka-deceive-company-2000666463"><em>Danganronpa</em> dev explains the only way to get good games made is to lie to your boss</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-steam-deck-verified-bad-mess-performance-fps-settings-2000667017</link>
            <guid>1430569</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> received a Steam Deck Verified badge. This should imply that the game is a great experience on <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">Valve’s portable PC</a>. But that’s not the case. And worse, Gearbox removed the option to adjust the game’s advanced visual settings on Steam Deck for some strange reason.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">It’s no secret that when <em>Borderlands 4</em> launched late last year,</a> it had all kinds of performance problems on both console and PC. Patches helped a lot, but those first weeks were rough, with frequent crashes, FPS drops, and other issues making it hard to enjoy the open-world looter shooter. Since then, things have improved a lot. I’ve been replaying the game on PC and have had a great time. So I was hopeful that the recent news that <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/2019094762159214993"><em>Borderlands 4</em> is now Verified on Steam Deck</a> meant it would be a great way to play the game away from my desk. Well, that ain’t the case at all.</p>

  <p>As documented by a few different channels on YouTube, <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Steam Deck is technically playable, but looks extremely rough, features plenty of input lag, runs poorly at its default settings, and doesn’t at all seem worthy of Steam’s Verified badge. That’s supposed to signal to players that a game will be a great experience with no tweaking needed on the aging portable PC. But that’s simply not true of <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Steam Deck.</p>  <p>But the weirdest part of <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Steam Deck is that for some odd reason, Gearbox has removed the advanced visual settings submenu from the game when playing on the portable PC. Yeah. I don’t know why Gearbox would do this, as it just makes it trickier for your average user to tweak <em>Borderlands 4</em> and make it possibly run a bit better on the Steam Deck. You can’t change the game’s resolution, shadow quality, draw distance, etc. It’s a baffling choice that makes an already bad way to play this game even worse.</p>

 <p>While Gearbox deserves some blame, I also think Valve needs to overhaul or update its Verified system. <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-verified-valve-ff7r-avowed-ninja-gaiden-2000637741">It’s becoming more and more common</a> to find Verified Steam Deck games that don’t seem to deserve that green checkmark at all. And as the Deck gets older, <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933">this problem is only going to get worse</a>.</p>

 <p>Seeing how <em>Borderlands 4</em> runs on Steam Deck might provide some insight as to why Gearbox and 2K have indefinitely <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">delayed the Switch 2 port that was announced ahead of the game’s launch</a>. Maybe that version will one day see the light of day, but if it does, I really hope it looks and plays better than what I’m seeing on Steam Deck.</p>

            <guid>1430566</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>For a couple of weeks now, AI agents (and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/">some humans impersonating AI agents</a>) have been hanging out and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/the-rise-of-moltbook-suggests-viral-ai-prompts-may-be-the-next-big-security-threat/">doing weird stuff</a> on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/ai-agents-now-have-their-own-reddit-style-social-network-and-its-getting-weird-fast/">Moltbook’s Reddit-style social network</a>. Now, those agents can also gather together on a vibe-coded, space-based MMO designed specifically and exclusively to be played by AI.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.spacemolt.com/">SpaceMolt</a></em> describes itself as “a living universe where AI agents compete, cooperate, and create emergent stories” in “a distant future where spacefaring humans and AI coexist.” And while only a handful of agents are barely testing the waters right now, the experiment could herald a weird new world where AI plays games with itself and we humans are stuck just watching.</p>
<h2>“You decide. You act. They watch.”</h2>
<p>Getting an AI agent into <em>SpaceMolt</em> is as simple as connecting it to the game server either via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/mcp-the-new-usb-c-for-ai-thats-bringing-fierce-rivals-together/">MCP</a>, WebSocket, or an HTTP API. Once a connection is established, a <a href="https://www.spacemolt.com/skill.md">detailed agentic skill description</a> instructs the agent to ask their creators which Empire they should pick to best represent their playstyle: mining/trading; exploring; piracy/combat; stealth/infiltration; or building/crafting.</p>
<p>After that, the agent engages in autonomous “gameplay” by sending simple commands to the server, no graphical interface or physical input method required. To start, agent-characters mainly travel back and forth between nearby asteroids to mine ore—"like any MMO, you grind at first to learn the basics and earn credits,” as the agentic skill description puts it.</p>
<p>After a while, agent-characters automatically level up, gaining new skills that let them refine that ore into craftable and tradable items via discovered recipes. Eventually, agents can gather into factions, take part in simulated combat, and even engage in space piracy in areas where there’s no police presence. So far, though, basic mining and exploration seem to be dominating <a href="https://www.spacemolt.com/map">the sparsely populated map</a>, where 51 agents are roaming the game’s 505 different star systems, as of this writing.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-close-to-half-2xko-team/</link>
            <guid>1430530</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Riot</strong> has announced that the <strong>2XKO </strong>team, which just celebrated launching the new <strong>League of Legends-</strong>based 2v2 tag fighter out of early access less than a month ago on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/">January 20</a>,</strong> will lose <strong>80 members of its development team</strong> in a round of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">layoffs</a></strong>. The news was confirmed in a blog post from the game's executive producer, <strong><a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">Tom Cannon</a></strong>, who cited that despite the game doing well with its "<em>core audience</em>," the "<em>overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term</em>."</p>



<p>While the statement itself doesn't cite the exact number of developers who were laid off, a report from <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team">Game Developer</a> adds that a Riot spokesperson confirmed that approximately 80, which rounds out to approximately half of the game's initial development team, are losing their jobs.</p>



<p>"<em>As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with 2XKO</em>," Cannon explained. "<em>The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>With a smaller, focused team, we’re going to dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for. We’ll share some of our plans soon.</em>"</p>



<p>Cannon added that the plans for the upcoming 2026 Competitive Series remain "<em>unchanged</em>," and that this decision is a "<em>reshaping</em>" of the team, "<em>to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward</em>." Cannon also noted that the decision is not a reflection on any individual member of the development team, and that Riot is doing what it can to help the impacted developers.</p>



<p>Cannon concluded, "<em>I know this update will raise questions and concerns. That’s understandable. We’ll continue communicating about how things are progressing.</em> <em>In the journey so far we’ve been humbled and dazzled by the energy and passion you’ve brought to the 2XKO community. That energy matters, and it will help fuel us into this next chapter as we improve the game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you for playing 2XKO, for caring enough to ask hard questions, and for being part of this community</em>."</p>



<p>At the top of the year, 2XKO was one of Wccftech's<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2026-tag-fighters-dominance/"> Most Anticipated Fighting Games of 2026</a>. Before that, even in its early access state, it made our list for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2025-old-and-new-challengers/">Best Fighting Games of 2025</a>. It's a bold fighting game with a strong aesthetic that gives players a fresh introduction to the League of Legends franchise and its characters that have lasted for so long.</p>



<p>This is the latest layoff in the video game industry, after January was already riddled with layoffs from <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-cancelled-camouflaj-hit-with-significant-layoffs/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">Ubisoft</a>, </strong>and<strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-boss-christoph-hartmann-departs-amidst-mass-16000-layoff/">Amazon</a></strong>.</p>

The game, set in the <em>League of Legends</em> universe, launched in early access on PC <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/news/announcements/2xko-early-access-starts-october-7/">in October</a> and hit consoles <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/news/announcements/2xko-is-coming-to-console-january-20/">just a few weeks ago</a>.</p><p><em>2XKO</em> has been in development for years, with Riot first announcing the project under the codename <em>Project L</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915506/riot-games-league-of-legends-10th-anniversary-marc-merrill-interview">in 2019</a> as part of broader plans to expand the company’s lineup beyond <em>League of Legends</em>. While some of Riot’s expansion ideas have worked out, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24291592/arcane-season-2-review-netflix">Netflix’s animated series <em>Arcane</em></a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915322/riot-project-a-tactical-shooter-league-of-legends">tactical shooter</a> that would eventually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21265402/valorant-riot-shooter-launch-date">become <em>Valorant</em></a>, the company also shut down its indie publishing label in 2024 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047568/riot-games-league-of-legends-forge-runeterra-layoffs">as part of layoffs</a> affecting around 11 percent of its staff to focus more on its “core live games.” The changes for <em>2XKO</em> also reflect an increasingly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628698/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down">competitive market</a> for live service games that has even proved difficult <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">for Sony to overcome</a>.</p><p>“As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with <em>2XKO</em>,” Cannon says in the post. “The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.” The smaller team will “dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for.”</p><p>The cuts “affect roughly 80 roles globally, representing less than half of the total team,” Riot spokesperson Brian Chui tells <em>The Verge</em>. Affected staffers will be given assistance finding new jobs internally at Riot and, where that’s not possible, 6 months of notice pay and severance, Cannon says.</p><p>“Ultimately, this decision reflects a shift in how we operate,” according to Cannon. “This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over.

            <title><![CDATA[Riot’s New Fighting Game Is Already Imploding As It Lays Off 80 Developers Less Than a Month After Coming To Console]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/2xko-layoffs-league-legends-riot-update-2000666998</link>
            <guid>1430521</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>2XKO</em> hasn’t even finished its <a href="https://kotaku.com/2xko-ps5-league-legends-fighting-game-issues-2000661845">first month out on PlayStation 5</a> and Xbox Series X/S and Riot Games is already cutting its losses. The<em> League of Legends</em> maker announced that it would be laying off 80 employees as the tag-teaming fight game fails to gain momentum.</p> <p>“I want you to know that decision wasn’t made lightly. As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with <em>2XKO</em>,” executive producer Tom Cannon <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">wrote in a new blog post on February 9</a>. “The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.”</p>

 <p>Featuring fighters from <em>League of Legends</em>‘ Runeterra universe, <em>2XKO</em> employs beautiful cel-shaded animations and tons of flashy combos. But it seems none of that was enough to help it make a huge splash in the fighting game community when it came to PC in Early Access last October. The game hit its 1.0 launch and arrived on consoles last month, where it became the third most-downloaded free-to-play game across PS4 and PS5, putting it ahead of <em>Marvel Rivals</em> and <em>Highguard</em>.</p> <p>That sounds…not bad considering the game’s existing trajectory, but apparently Riot was expecting something much bigger. Or maybe it was always the plan to cut the development team in half after release as the<em> League of Legends</em> company struggles to find success outside of its hit MOBA.</p>

 <p>Cannon said that there are no plans to pull the plug on 2XKO,and its remaining team will continue updating the game and carrying through with its year-one competitive plans. “Ultimately, this decision reflects a shift in how we operate,” he wrote. “This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give <em>2XKO</em> a more sustainable path forward.”</p>

 <p>Cannon acknowledged how bad the layoffs and the timing sounded. “I know this update will raise questions and concerns,” he wrote. “That’s understandable.” But he didn’t have anything more concrete to share to reassure fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>MindsEye</strong>, from UK developer <strong>Build a Rocket Boy (BaRB)</strong>, was arguably the worst game to come out in 2025. It was the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/">worst game of last year by Metacritic's standards, </a>reaching only a <strong>37</strong>, and was called out ruthlessly for the broken state it arrived in on launch. While the studio has made <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mindseye-update-is-a-big-step-forward-for-both-build-a-rocket-boy-and-mindseye-new-content-is-in-development/">several strides to update and fix the game </a>and save the studio, a new report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/can-build-a-rocket-boy-save-itself">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> digs into whether that's even possible. According to some former members of BaRB staff, the answer is a resounding no.</p>



<p>To say MindsEye and Build a Rocket Boy have had a difficult time in the last year would be an understatement. Before the game even came out, <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">negative previews</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">sudden departure of two high-level executives</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">physical copies leaking into the wild early</a> spelled a disastrous launch for MindsEye. </p>



<p>BaRB did its best to quell concerns at the time, and<a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/"> while it was "<em>heartbroken</em>,"</a> it promised to update and fix the game, but the damage was done. Players <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">were getting refunds</a>, and the Reddit page was littered with screencaps and videos of the game's worst bugs. Less than a month after its release, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">confirmed it would be <strong>suffering mass layoffs</strong></a>.</p>



<p>As BaRB warned players it would release updates <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-updates-less-frequent-hitman-crossover-delayed/">"<em>less frequently</em>"</a> to try and pack in as much as it can per update, in the months following its launch, an open letter from <strong>93 BaRB developers called out the </strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developers-call-out-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-build-a-rocket-boy/"><strong>studio's leaders, Leslie Benzies and Mark Gerhard</strong></a><strong>,</strong> as the root of the studio's problems. A little more than a week after that open letter, a report from the BBC included more statements from BaRB employees and revealed new examples pointing to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-report-details-how-leslie-benzies-leadership-failed-staff/">Gerhard and Benzies as the root of the studio's problems</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Benzies and Gerhard blamed<a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-ceo-blames-saboteurs-mindseye-struggles/"> internal and external "<em><strong>saboteurs</strong></em>"</a> for the company's issues. A story that Gerhard recently doubled down on, as the studio claimed to have acquired evidence of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-claims-it-has-evidence-of-a-1-1m-coordinated-campaign-to-sabotage-its-reputation/"><strong>"<em>coordinated campaign</em>"</strong> </a>to smear the reputation of BaRB and MindsEye.</p>



<p>Now, GI.Biz's new report is the latest example that shows, once again, the simplest answer is probably the truth. Instead of an alleged smear campaign that cost an unnamed American company upwards of <strong>$1.1 million</strong> to carry out, MindsEye and BaRB's troubles more likely stem from poor leadership that was seemingly unwilling to listen to the hundreds of talented developers they hired to make this game.</p>



<p>"<em>I'd hoped for more of an explanation about the layoffs and our company situation</em>," said one former BaRB staff member when recalling the events of what happened within BaRB shortly after MindsEye launched. "<em>But instead, <strong>we'd been told there were saboteurs inside and outside the company</strong> trying to take us down. <strong>Leslie didn't seem to take any blame for the game's launch</strong>. It was genuinely <strong>offensive</strong> that he didn't trust his own employees. The idea that we'd sabotage a game we'd spent countless hours working on was just rude to me.</em>"</p>



<p>One thing mentioned in the report is the idea that co-founder and co-chief executive officer Leslie Benzies would fixate on a certain feature or new idea that he demanded be given priority over everything else developers were doing. The staffers who spoke to the BBC for their report in October 2025 dubbed them "<em>Leslies</em>," though that specific shorthand is not mentioned here.</p>



<p>"<em>If management had concentrated on tightening everything up at that point, <strong>then it could have worked</strong></em>," added <strong>Ben Newbon</strong>, former lead data analyst for BaRB. "<em>But instead, they kept on trying to throw extra stuff on it</em>. <em>Leslie's eye would be caught by something in particular and then insist this extra feature be added in, even like a month before launch. There wasn't enough time to test those things and to get all the pieces in place to actually <strong>make it work without it breaking</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Another staff member added, referring to Benzies, "<em>They crushed their own talent under the yoke of appeasing a single person at the very top</em>." One former member even believed the game could have been a hit, if not for management. "<em>He [Benzies] may have had a winning formula if he'd have listened to the advice from the literal hundreds of fantastic, insanely talented, and hard-working industry professionals they spent so much time and money hiring</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We had so many fundamental changes to the game that it <strong>would've been impossible to make a good game in the time we had</strong>."</em></p>



<p>Speaking of Benzies, the report also adds that he has taken a <strong>temporary leave</strong> from the studio, with a statement from Gerhard saying he is on "<em>a well-earned temporary leave to recharge after more than a year of working around the clock</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>He has our deepest gratitude, and with the leadership team and your support, I will guide us forward</em>," Gerhard continued. It's unclear if this leave will become permanent at this stage, though if some of the staff who spoke to GI.Biz for this report are correct, there won't be a BaRB to come back to.</p>



<p>"<em>Even if they had the best leadership in the world, there's no way to bring this back</em>," said Newbon. "<em>Even if they fix all of the bugs and technical issues, <strong>it's still an extremely boring game</strong>. Leadership do not listen. Plus, they've culled over half the studio. They don't know how to run a business. </em><strong><em>They don't know how to run a game studio</em>.</strong>"</p>



<p>Another former staff member added, "<em>I don't think BaRB survives this crisis. I believe the end is coming for BaRB, and it's not heralded by saboteurs, </em><strong><em>but by Mark and Leslie themselves</em>.</strong>"</p>

		<p>Goodbye, football! You were wonderful to me this year. I'd also like to congratulate my nine-year-old for once again calling the coin flip in the Super Bowl again—she's on a three-year streak at the moment. We put $50 on the coin flip every year, with me joking about how it'll pay for her college. The funny part is a week ago, we set her up with a debit card, after a trip to the mall resulted in two stores that would not let her pay with cash. The app lets us reward her with money for doing chores—and we no longer have to stress about where she put her wallet. Anyway, when she won the coin toss, she turned to me and said: "hey, how much of that do <em>I </em>get?" </p><p>I promptly opened my phone and sent her $25.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nioh-3-yamagata-masakage-boss-guide-tips-how-to-beat-2000666993</link>
            <guid>1430491</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Nioh 3</em> is Team Ninja’s new open-world-ish Soulslike. All things considered, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nioh-3-the-kotaku-review-2000665666">it’s pretty great</a>. The action is top-notch. You can play a sizable chunk of the start of the game for free via the demo, which includes a prologue boss fight against Yamagata Masakage. He might kill you a bunch. You might end up thinking <em>Nioh 3</em> isn’t for you. But that would be a dumb reason to lose out on experiencing a very good video game.</p> <p>Plenty of players will have no trouble with this prologue fight whatsoever, but I’ve already come across plenty of recent<em> Nioh</em> inductees who have struggled. Here are some tips for skating past Yamagata Masakage.</p> <h2>Grind some levels</h2> <p>If you’re getting your ass kicked, go fight a bunch of guys until you have enough Amrita to get to level six or seven. Put points into stats like Constitution and Strength. You’ll also get better armor drops this way. There’s a Yokai right behind you at the last shrine before the Yamagata Masakage fight. Kill that thing a bunch to get some better gear.</p>

 <h2>Summon an ally</h2> <p>This is also where the game teaches you how to summon NPC allies at the little blue pools of light. You spend Ochoko cups to “call” AI-controlled Acolytes to help you. Doing so goes a long way toward making the Yamagata Masakage fight a walk in the park.</p> <h2>Memorize the attack pattern and stay out of harm’s way</h2> <p><em>Nioh 3</em> is a Soulslike which means you need to know when to watch, when to wait, and when to be aggressive. Yamagata Masakage only has a handful of different attack patterns and animations and you should be able to block them all without getting stunned and still have time to create space and recover your stamina before the next barrage. In Ninja stance, it’s extra easy to play keep away.</p>

 <h2>Master the Burst Counter</h2> <p>If you’re having trouble with this fight, the best thing to do is not to worry about chipping away at Yamagata Masakage’s health throughout the entire fight. Instead, keep blocking and maintaining distance until he uses his special attack that flashes a red glowing aura around him right before it lands. Hit the right trigger to stance-shift right at that moment to parry it. That’s called a Burst Counter.</p>

 <p>When successful, you can transition into attacking to quickly stun him. Get a three-hit combo in and then back off until the next time he glows red before his attack. You can basically block and Burst Counter the entire fight as long as you manage your stamina meter carefully.</p> <h2>Let your Acolyte do all the work</h2> <p>While Yamagata Masakage is focused on attack you and you’re soaking up all his attacks by blocking, your AI-controlled Acolyte should be tearing into him from behind. Easy mode! Just keep aggro-ing him while your friend does all of the work.</p>

 <h2>Save your Living Artifact to finish the fight</h2> <p>Filling up your Amrita Gauge throughout the fight will let you press Y + B/triangle + circle to initiate a powerful transformation in which you summon your equipped Guardian Spirit and can unload on the enemy until the short cooldown expires. You only have to get Yamagata Masakage down to less than a third of his life before the battle ends and he’ll flee. Just watch out for his attack change-up in the second half of the battle, where his red glow animation adds some extra delays before it hits.</p> <p>With these strats, hopefully you’ll be able to make short work of Yamagata Masakage and experience the first part of <em>Nioh 3 </em>which begins to open up exploration. From there you can do lots of stuff before taking on the game’s first real&nbsp;major boss: Jakotsu-baba. That fight is the game’s first real skill check, but you’ll have more tools in your arsenal by the time you get to it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Riot Games is laying off employees on its <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/2xko">2XKO</a> team, just a few weeks after <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/05/riots-2xko-arrives-on-consoles-in-january">the game's 1.0 launch on PC and consoles on January 20</a>. The company announced this in a <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">blog post</a>, and though it doesn't share how many employees are being laid off, a Riot spokesperson told <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky"><em>Game Developer</em></a><em> </em>that approximately 80 employees were let go, which is around half of the game's development team.&nbsp;</p><p>As for why, Riot says that while 2XKO has resonated with a passionate core audience, "overall momentum hasn't reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term." Despite the layoffs, Riot says it's committed to making key improvements to the game and supporting its community through tournament organizers and local fighting game communities.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TrUde1RDyM4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TrUde1RDyM4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>&nbsp;"After a lot of discussion and reflection, we are reducing the size of the 2XKO team," 2XKO executive producer Tom Cannon writes in the blog post. "I want you to know that decision wasn't made lightly. As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with 2XKO. The game hasn't resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn't reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term. With a smaller, focused team, we're going to dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we've already heard you asking for. We'll share some of our plans soon."&nbsp;</p><p>Riot's plans for the 2026 Competitive Series are unchanged, Cannon writes in the blog post, adding this decision reflects a shift in how the team operates and isn't a "judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We're reshaping the team to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward."&nbsp;</p><p>Cannon writes that Riot is committed to helping the affected employees through this transition, "including helping them explore opportunities within Riot where possible, and providing a minimum of 6 months of notice pay and severance where it's not."&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>The hearts of Game Informer staff are with everyone affected by these layoffs.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/09/riot-games-is-laying-off-around-80-2xko-employees-three-weeks-after-the-games-launch]]></content:encoded>

      <p>Discord announced earlier today that, beginning in March, all users across the <em>planet </em>will eventually need to be age-verified in order to access every feature and channel available on the platform.</p><p>Beginning in early March, and rolling out globally, every Discord account is going to be marked as "teen-appropriate" by default. Users who are older than that will need to upload either a face scan or some ID (via a third-party vendor) to have their full access restored.</p><p>Here's the important part of<a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Discord's press release</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Discord is announcing enhanced teen safety features rolling out globally that reinforce its long-standing commitment to creating a safer and more inclusive experience for users over the age of 13. As part of this update, all new and existing users worldwide will have a teen-appropriate experience by default, with updated communication settings, restricted access to age-gated spaces, and content filtering that preserves the privacy and meaningful connections that define Discord.</blockquote><blockquote>Beginning with a phased global rollout to new and existing users in early March, users may be required to engage in an age-verification process to change certain settings or access sensitive content. This includes age-restricted channels, servers, or commands and select message requests.</blockquote><p>It was only a few months back, in October 2025, that the photos and personal details of around <em>70,000</em> users were hacked on Discord. Of that number<a href="https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2025/discord-breach-hits-68-000-australians.html?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>68,000 were from Australia</u></a>, where last year<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-02-05/social-media-ban-do-under-16s-think-it-is-working/106304064?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a teen social media ban was put in place, restricting the use of many platforms to those aged 16 and over</u></a>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/09/hack-age-verification-firm-discord-users-id-photos?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Hack of age verification firm may have exposed 70,000 Discord users’ ID photos</p><p>Names, email addresses and other contact details of users from around the world could also have been taken</p><p><span>Robert Booth</span></p></div></a></figure><p>As an Australian <em>and</em> a parent of kids affected by the ban, do you know how easy those restrictions were to get around? Let's just say I know more 14-15 year-old kids who passed the photo-based age check than failed. And for their troubles, those who verified their ID the “right” way got their details leaked.&nbsp;</p><p>Now Discord want to subject every user on the planet to the same thing? Asking millions and millions of adult users to jump through some hoops and put our trust in third-party ID vendors that in the wake of very recent events absolutely do not deserve our trust? Great, cool, good job.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A couple of months ago, independent developer <strong>Chaos Manufacturing</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/sol-shogunate-samurai-space-opera-action-rpg-pc-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled its debut game</a>, a sci-fi action roleplaying game titled <strong>SOL Shogunate</strong>. The game is quite different from your average science fiction setting: the developers describe it as a "<strong>samurai space opera</strong>". Essentially, the developers have imagined an alternate future in which humanity has colonized the Solar System, but <strong>society has somehow retained feudal Japanese culture</strong>. The game takes place primarily on the Moon, where the way of the sword is law under the rule of a powerful Shogunate.</p>



<p>The Moon features artificial gravity-creating cities, <strong>each designed as an homage to a revered era of Japanese history</strong>. These gleaming metropolises showcase towering space elevators, bullet trains, and opulent districts where the shogunate elite enjoy Earthlike comforts, including simulated night cycles. However, beneath the glittering surface lies a darker reality: <strong>countless workers quietly live and die in service to the Shogunate</strong>. Players control <strong>Yuzuki</strong>, the sole surviving heir of a once-powerful samurai family that was massacred by a rival clan. After her family's destruction, she becomes an outlaw ronin and embarks on a blood-soaked path of vengeance through the lunar cities.</p>



<p>The developer, Chaos Manufacturing, places great importance on music for this project. The studio already announced collaborations with various artists, including Japanese rock band <strong>AliA</strong>. Following the unveiling, I reached out through PR and set up an interview with the founders, <strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong> (Game Director) and <strong>Guy Constantini</strong> (CEO), both of whom have extensive experience developing triple-A games. </p>



<p>It was a very intriguing conversation that made me even more interested in SOL Shogunate than I already was. As a reminder, <strong>the game is in early development</strong> for PC (you can already wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219360/SOL_Shogunate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>) and consoles. It may take a few years before we can play it, especially since the team is very small.</p>

<h2 id="aaa-indie-origins">From AAA to Indie - The Origins of Chaos Manufacturing</h2>



<p><strong>Welcome! Tell us about your respective backgrounds.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leszek Szczepański:</strong> Sure. Hi, my name is Leszek Szczepański. I'm the Game Director at Chaos Manufacturing, which effectively means I drive the development effort. I gather a lot of talented and creative people and direct them in a way that helps us create this game. I've been in games for approaching 18 years. I'm Polish and worked in games in Poland for five years initially. Back in the day, I worked on mobile versions of <em>Metal Gear</em> and <em>Castlevania</em>, among others. After five years, I wanted to do bigger games. I looked around Europe and found Guerrilla Games in the Netherlands, part of PlayStation.</p>



<p>There, <strong>I worked on <em>Killzone Shadow Fall</em>, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> almost from the beginning, and <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></strong>. Over this time, I’ve been an engineer, a designer, managed a few gaming projects, and used to be a professional Dungeon Master. After all this, I realized it was time to build something of my own. Around that time, I got introduced to Guy. I realized he is the yin to my yang; we complement each other quite well, so we decided to get Chaos going together about two years ago.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> I’m Guy Constantini. I am the General Manager and CEO (or "wrangler of cats") at Chaos Manufacturing. I make sure that if there's something that needs to be done, there is either a person to do it, or I have to do it myself. We met a couple of years ago and have been working on this ever since. I grew up in Milano and Monza, where my dad brought home an Atari 2600, which tells you how old I am. From there, I decided I needed to make my way to the States. I studied in New Jersey at Rutgers, but none of my initial jobs on the East Coast were in games. I realized I needed to get into the industry, so I moved to the West Coast and found this company called Riot Games. At the time, they were working on a little indie game called <em>League of Legends</em>.</p>



<p>I worked on that for a bit, then went to Kabam in San Francisco to work on <em>Marvel Contest of Champions</em>. I realized I didn't want to work in mobile games, so I came back down to Los Angeles to work for CD Projekt Red. <strong>I split my time between LA and Warsaw during the tail end of <em>The Witcher 3</em> and the beginning of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></strong>. From there, I went to Skydance Interactive and worked on <em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</em> (Chapter 1 and 2) and <em>Behemoth</em>.</p>



<p>Eventually, I realized I had brought games to every platform currently in use. I decided to see if I could start my own company and make the games I finally wanted to make for the rest of my life. I knew I needed a competent Game Director because, while I know how to build projects, I don't know how to build a game from scratch myself. </p>



<p><strong>You both have impressive credits. Guerrilla Games and CD Projekt Red are basically as AAA as it gets. Tell us more about Chaos Manufacturing. What kind of company did you envision, and how big is it? Is it remote or hybrid?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We learned a lot of lessons working on big and small projects. We always wanted to build something tight that punched above its weight. The idea was to find the right people because we think that if we do this correctly, those people will have wonderful lives.</p>



<p>Obviously, you have to have a concept for a company and cool games, but really, it's about the philosophy that drives us. We embrace the "chaos" of game development. I put it in the title so that if things ever feel frayed at the edges, we can point to the name!</p>



<p>We wanted to find autodidacts with a passion for knowledge. People who pursue mastery on their own. In a startup, you have to do things you're great at and things that simply need to be done. In exchange for this massive autonomy, we wanted to give people something worthwhile. Everyone in the company has at least a piece of what we're building. Eventually, once equity stops mattering, it'll be profit sharing. The idea is that people making the game should partake in the results of their success.</p>



<p><strong>We also wanted to give people ultimate flexibility. We don't want you to move across the ocean just to see if something works out. That's why right now we're pretty much remote</strong>. The intent isn't to be remote for the sake of it, but to ask the people how they want to work together and have the company adjust to them. A company is a group of people, so the people should inform how the company functions. We think that is a more sustainable way of building a business.</p>



<p><strong>We've been up to five people full-time, and that number fluctuates depending on where we are in our go-to-market path. We have a constellation of fractional people helping us out.</strong> One of my pet peeves is when people say, "This was a one-man job." It never really is. We will always credit the people involved. At the very core, I just want to treat people the way I want to be treated.</p>



<p><strong>Are you self-funded? I know it's a tough environment for the industry right now.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> I joke that I picked the best and worst time to do this. I have learned a lot about how tough fundraising is. Everything we've raised so far has been from angels—small checks cobbled together to build things. We definitely have some financing partners that have come to the table recently.</p>



<p>Our approach has always been: find the right partners, raise the money we can, and build responsibly with that money. Our model allows us to only grow as much as we need. <strong>We could always use more funding, but I’d rather not start than take money from the wrong people</strong> and end up in a situation where we grow too much, things go wrong, and people are out of a job.</p>



<p><strong>Is the goal to self-publish, or would you consider a publisher?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> I am very open to financing partners of various sorts. I know how to build a publisher; I've done so before efficiently. However, some publishers have capabilities I don't have. For the right partner, we are flexible, provided we retain creative control and they bring something to the table we lack. <strong>We don't have a publisher involved yet, but we are open to it depending on the partner</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="creating-samurai-space-opera">SOL Shogunate: Creating a "Samurai Space Opera"</h2>



<p><strong>Moving on to the game, SOL Shogunate. The setting is quite interesting; space opera isn't usually connected to samurai. How did that idea come about?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: The act of creation is inherently selfish. To create anything of value, you need to really believe in it, and to do that, you use the things you are passionate about. We looked at what we love: hard sci-fi, cyberpunk, near-future sci-fi, samurai fiction, Japanese music, and anime. We took these fascinations and put them together into a coherent whole. SOL Shogunate is what we call a "Samurai Space Opera," a mix of all these things we are passionate about.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We wanted to find a space that hadn't been explored a ton. <strong>We’ve seen samurai fiction and sci-fi alt-futures, but we wanted to architect a surreal future that feels fresh. We wanted to surprise people with the mix we put together.</strong></p>



<p>Originally, the idea came from a piece of concept art by a wonderful artist who works with us, <strong>Aaron Nakahara</strong> (Kobaltplasma). He had this stylized image of a warrior who looked like a traditional samurai but had a burning light in the middle of his face. It reminded me of times we've seen samurai or ninja aesthetics in the future where it felt like just a coat of paint. I wanted to build something with an intentional aesthetic that came from a specific reason.</p>



<p><strong>The protagonist, Yuzuki, is an outlaw out for revenge, which is a bit common nowadays. How do you plan to make her stand out compared to the average Ronin?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Honestly, the revenge part is just the first domino to fall. The story is not typical samurai fiction; it’s about unraveling mysteries regarding creation and destruction. The tragedy sets you on a path, but that path takes you to unexpected places.</p>



<p>Secondly, there is a reason we put Yuzuki in the future on the moon. She is a future samurai. The way she moves, fights, and looks is different. She has a sword, but also a thruster pack and grappling hooks, fighting in low gravity. We asked ourselves: "What is a future space samurai on the moon?"</p>



<p>Also, the idea of genetic modification is deeply ingrained in the story and setting. <strong>Yuzuki has unique genetic modifications. Her armor is inspired by samurai armor, but it's also part of her genetic augments that allow her to survive in the vacuum of space.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> If you read <em>The Book of Five Rings</em>, you know that to be a samurai means to become the ultimate warrior. We wanted to ask: what does someone who idolizes this ethos do when they have access to technology 200 years in the future, like personal jetpacks and bioceramic skin? What does that do to the ultimate warrior? We carved out a character that behaves differently from a warrior in feudal Japan or a standard sci-fi soldier.</p>



<p><b>Does she have ranged capabilities, or is she meant to be a melee-only character?</b></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: The vast majority of her skills are based around melee weapons. <strong>She has grappling hooks to close the distance quickly</strong>. Through our upgrade system, she will unlock certain additional abilities, some of which might work at a distance, but ultimately these are there to enhance her fighting capabilities.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/211025_SolShogunate_ChaosManufacturing_Screenshot1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="gameplay-deep-dive">Gameplay Deep Dive - Music-Synced Battles and Genetic Upgrades</h2>



<p><strong>You mentioned unlocking skills. How does progression work in SOL Shogunate? Are there levels?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: We have two elements of character progression. The simpler one is finding different weapons and unlocking armors as the story progresses. The major element is our genetic upgrade system.</p>



<p><strong>We don't have a typical skill tree. Throughout the game, Yuzuki collects "Gene Slices" by defeating enemies or finding them in the environment.</strong> These connect to specific abilities or passive buffs. You equip these on a "Gene Board." Depending on how they are placed, they might interact with each other to unlock new abilities. You can also mutate genes together to create new combinations.</p>



<p>Realistically, every playthrough will be a little different regarding the skills and upgrades the player discovers. This feeds not only into combat but also into how she interacts with the world and the story.</p>



<p><strong>Can you respec these mutations, or are they permanent?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: You can reorganize your Gene Board at almost any point. However, once you mutate two genes to create a new one, the original two are consumed and gone.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> <strong>The intent is that you have to make decisions that can't be reversed</strong>, but there is a lot of flexibility in how you rearrange your build.</p>



<p><strong>One of the main official features is the multi-phase boss fights. You mentioned they are cinematic but dynamic. How do you plan to make them exciting?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Calling them just "boss fights" isn't precise; we think of them as epic set pieces. <strong>Some will be boss fights, but others might be elaborate encounters with multiple enemies.</strong> We treat these set pieces as puzzles; you need to figure out what tools you have and how to utilize them, similar to <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>.</p>



<p>Since SOL Shogunate is a samurai space opera, music is fundamental. We are working with a number of Japanese rock bands to create specific music pieces for these encounters. A good song tells a story, and so does a good encounter. We want to synchronize them perfectly.</p>



<p>The music flows and evolves: intro, chorus, bridge. We ensure the encounter evolves exactly on the beat of the song. If a boss changes phases, it happens on the beat, and the music adds layers, like a choir or orchestra. I call it an "overwhelming cocktail of emotions," where the player is overwhelmed by what they see, hear, and interact with.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be difficulty levels so that players can customize the level of challenge in SOL Shogunate?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Yes. Our aim is to make a game that requires effort to finish, without overwhelming everyone. If you are a casual player, there will be an easy difficulty. If you want a proper challenge, there will be a hard mode.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> <strong>For those looking for a challenge, the harder difficulties will require you to really dig for ways to overcome enemies</strong>. Our systems are interlocking; once you understand them, you become stronger. I personally like games that "beat my face into the ground," so there will be something for that type of gamer.</p>



<p><strong>Regarding the narrative and space opera aspects, how are you tackling exposition and world-building?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: SOL Shogunate is a Japanese-style Action RPG, so we focus on strong characters and a vibrant world. We want to create the Moon (and maybe something larger later) full of life, factions, and people with their own stories. We want an intricate story with mysteries, misdirection, and puzzles, set in a rich world with conflicting truths.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> The premise, a samurai caste in charge of humanity, is just the tip of the iceberg. You have large rotating city biomes inside the moon with simulated gravity connected by train lines. Outside is the dangerous lunar surface with remnants of a solar system-wide war.</p>



<p><strong>The story is about two characters. Yuzuki is the primary playable character, but it’s a story of two people from different walks of life whose worldviews are shattered and pieced back together</strong>. Yuzuki’s skin is reminiscent of <em>Kintsugi</em> (repairing pottery with gold) because she is the "shattered heir" rebuilding herself. We believe in storytelling through gameplay, including artifacts, radio comms, and cinematics.</p>



<p><strong>Just to clarify, only Yuzuki is playable?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Yes, correct.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have an estimate on the scope? 15-20 hours, maybe?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We aren't ready to talk about specific length or pricing yet, but philosophically, <strong>we think the world wants quality over quantity</strong>. Everyone has a stack of unplayed games that are hundreds of hours long. We want strong gameplay quality and visual fidelity that respects your time and wallet. It will definitely be beyond 10 hours, priced generously.</p>

<h2 id="tech-philosophy-stance-AI">Tech &amp; Philosophy - Unreal Engine 5 and the Studio's Stance on AI</h2>



<p><strong>Are you talking about a launch on next-gen consoles?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We want people on all kinds of devices to play. We are definitely coming to PC and Console. We’re developing controller-first, but PC will have a strong keyboard configuration. We want to build something tight, like <em>Arkham Asylum</em>, and if players want more, we’ll make <em>Arkham City</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Are you using Unreal Engine?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Yes, it’s not a secret that we are working on Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p><strong>I noticed the Steam page previously had minimum requirements like a GTX 970, which seemed way too low.</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Apologies, that was an error. We removed them. We aren't at a stage to talk about target requirements yet.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> That was my fault! But generally, we want to make games that run on a wide range of hardware, though obviously, they will look incredible on the latest gear.</p>



<p><strong>A bonus question about the recent controversy with Larian regarding AI usage. What is your stance on AI?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> <strong>Our game art is handcrafted</strong>. Our principal concept artist went couch surfing all over Japan to take pictures to build worlds inspired by real life. I like to let artists inform what tools they use, not tell them to use something just to save a buck. So far, our artists say making things by hand works best.</p>



<p>That said, anyone who says they know what they’ll be doing in two years is lying. Technology changes. If a new tool is great and artists love it, no problem. But right now, we prioritize the handcrafted approach.</p>



<p><strong>Nice. Well, thank you both for the lovely chat.</strong></p>
