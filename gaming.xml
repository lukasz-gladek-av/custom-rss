One is very functional and will make certain gameplay elements easier, while the other is all about overhauling the look of your outfits. So let’s dive into how to upgrade your threads to explore new heights of style.</p><h2 id="h147594"><a id="glow"></a>Glow-Up</h2><figure id="" data-id="390642dd3d9916641a080a9f56243be6" data-recommend-id="image://390642dd3d9916641a080a9f56243be6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Glow-Up upgrade screen for Nikki’s Bubbly Voyage Ability Outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Glow-Up upgrade screen for Nikki’s Bubbly Voyage Ability Outfit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="390642dd3d9916641a080a9f56243be6" data-recommend-id="image://390642dd3d9916641a080a9f56243be6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Glow-Up upgrade screen for Nikki’s Bubbly Voyage Ability Outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>One way to upgrade clothing in <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is with a Glow Up, which will improve its stats.</strong> A piece’s best stat will see the most improvement, so you can rest assured that your Elegant hair will come out with a much higher Elegant stat. The primary reason to interact with this mechanic is to increase how many points your clothing scores during Styling Challenges.</p><p>Each Glow Up will require a certain amount of Bling, Threads of Purity, and Shiny Bubbles. The amount needed for each will increase each time you go through with an upgrade. Furthermore, a piece’s rarity will also affect how many resources are required.</p><h2 id="h147595"><a id="evolution"></a>Evolution</h2><figure id="" data-id="d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-recommend-id="image://d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Clothing Evolution screen with the Bubbly Voyage: Spring outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Clothing Evolution screen with the Bubbly Voyage: Spring outfit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-recommend-id="image://d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Clothing Evolution screen with the Bubbly Voyage: Spring outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Another method of upgrading is called Evolution, and its sole purpose is to unlock a recolor of an outfit.</strong> There isn’t a gameplay advantage for doing this as stats remain the same as the original look. Any 4-star outfit will only have a single recolor to evolve into, but those with a 5-star rarity have three.</p><p>The requirements to go through an Evolution are dependent on a few factors. Ability Outfits you craft during the main quest line need the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>A duplicate of each item that makes the outfit</li><li>Bling</li><li>Threads of Purity</li><li>Calm Thoughts</li></ul><p>Any Ability Outfits you acquire from a banner can also evolve, but they’ll just need a duplicate set. That might sound easy at first, however, you’ll need to get these duplicate items from the banners as well. Time and a little bit of luck will be necessary to get enough of the items. Don’t be surprised if you’re suddenly tempted to fork over a bit of cash to get crystals and make more pulls on the banner.</p><p><strong>Outfits with a 5-star rarity are the most difficult to evolve.</strong> They can go through the process a total of three times, with only the final recolor requiring a set of duplicates. The first two evolutions will instead require a Heartshine to unlock the new duds. Heartshines are solely unlocked through the Deep Echoes mechanic of each banner, which rewards you with items for making various amounts of pulls. You can look forward to getting them after making around 180 pulls. Additionally, Heartshines are unique to each banner. If you complete a 5-star outfit and then decide to go for their evolved versions, you’ll need to grind out or pay for a lot of crystals.</p><hr><p><br><em>Infinity Nikki</em> can be downright overwhelming with its many systems, especially if you’re new to Gachas. Hopefully you have a better understanding of how to upgrade outfits so you can ace those Styling Challenges and look damn good while doing mundane activities. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was a surprise reveal that came alongside confirmation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-at-microsofts-xbox-developer-direct-2025">Microsoft is set to publish Ninja Gaiden 4</a> across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S (including Game Pass day one) later in 2025. For more, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-2025-everything-announced">everything announced during Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb on Ninja Gaiden 2 Black:</p><blockquote>In Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, players assume the role of Ryu Hayabusa, a deadly ninja who wields the legendary Dragon Sword while embarking on a global battle against a series of formidable foes. The beautiful and bloody remaster utilizes Unreal Engine 5 to significantly enhance the graphic expression, elevating everything from character visuals to environmental backgrounds. In fact, the stages, characters, effects, and lighting have all been completely redesigned and remastered to fully immerse gamers into the story’s dark ninja world.</blockquote><blockquote>Gore elements such as dismemberment and blood have also been remastered to enhance the action experience. The high-speed, violent fights play out in brilliant brutality, utilizing a variety of weapons and techniques including Japanese swords, shurikens, Kusari-gamas, and tonfas. Meanwhile, those looking for a more toned-down experience can simply toggle the dismemberment feature on and off in the Options menu.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black includes extra elements from the spin-off titles released after the original game’s debut, including the ability to control three additional characters: Momiji, Ayane, and Rachel. The remaster also includes “HERO PLAY STYLE”, a mode for beginners that provides automatic support in the most difficult situations, making the notoriously challenging title more accessible for those who may not be so confident in their action skills.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/ninja-gaiden-4-developer-direct-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Xbox Wire</u></a>, Team Ninja boss Fumihiko Yasuda explained the decision to remaster Ninja Gaiden 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This simultaneous announcement and same-day release alongside Ninja Gaiden 4 might have caught some people by surprise,” he said. “The biggest reason for developing Ninja Gaiden 2 Black was to address the concerns of core fans who might be wondering, ‘What’s going to happen to Ryu Hayabusa?’ We also wanted to give players something to enjoy as they wait for the release of Ninja Gaiden 4. We chose Ninja Gaiden 2 because it stands as one of the most solid action games in the series. We added ‘Black’ to the title to signal to fans that this is the definitive version, much like Ninja Gaiden Black was for the first game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yasuda continued: "This version is crafted to satisfy both those who played the original and newcomers discovering it as a current-generation action game. We’ve meticulously incorporated some of the additions of Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 while staying true to the challenge and feel of the original 360 version, including its signature gore and violence. We’ve also adjusted the weapon upgrade system to more align with the original release.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Ninja’s infamously challenging Ninja Gaiden series has a long association with Xbox. The developer’s reboot of the action series launched first on Xbox in 2004, propelling master ninja Ryu Hayabusa into the mainstream. Ninja Gaiden Black, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-ninja-gaiden-black-is-the-best-pure-action-game-of-all-time"><u>considered one of the greatest action games of all time</u></a>, launched the following year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 2 came out in 2008 published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360. Ninja Gaiden 3 followed in 2012 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Since then, fans have had the critically panned spin-off Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, and, more recently, Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection, a compilation of Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The Tomb features a fan-favorite Wonder Weapon, which deals elemental damage and provides an additional way to heal downed teammates.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the Citadelle des Morts final cutscene, Gabriel Krafft tells the crew to take the amulet they've acquired to an excavation site in France. As seen in the trailer below, the crew finds itself at the dig site, which features underground tombs and a subterranean temple.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlvFuhlYRMg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tlvFuhlYRMg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Gameplay for The Tomb shows off all these various layers of the map, and it gives us an even better look at the map's Wonder Weapon in action. The Tomb features the Staff of Ice Wonder Weapon, which is familiar to those who played the popular Origins map from 2012's Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">The Staff of Ice is capable of firing icy blasts at enemies, slowing or freezing them in place, as well as dealing a more devastating area-of-effect attack. It also has the ability to heal, and the trailer shows a crew member using the Wonder Weapon to fire a restorative blast to revive a downed teammate.</p><p dir="ltr">Origins is one of the most beloved Zombies maps of all time, and while this is only one of the four elemental staffs featured in the original Black Ops 2 map, it's really nice to see the staff return after all these years. Plus, having another way to heal teammates is always a bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 also adds the Death Perception perk from Black Ops 4, and augments will be available to unlock to upgrade the perk. Three more Gobblegums are introduced, including one Whimsical Gobblegum that dresses all the zombies with rubber ducky flotation devices.</p><p dir="ltr">All the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-roadmap-details-terminator-event-new-mp-maps-and-warzone-improvements/2900-6155/#1">highlights of Season 2's content can be found here</a>, which includes brand-new multiplayer maps, a Terminator crossover event, and ninja-themed operators.</p>

Such is the case with the <em>Sniper Elite</em> franchise, which continues to embrace the stealth and sniping experience with increasingly realistic mechanics. If you’re new to the series and want to know what you’ve been missing, here’s a brief rundown of <em>Sniper Elite</em> and all of the games released so far.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195734" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195734,196411,195189" data-current="195734"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21246.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h156796"><a id="expect"></a>What to expect from the Sniper Elite franchise</h2><p>With the exception of two VR titles, the <em>Sniper Elite </em>franchise stars American OSS operative, Karl Fairburne, a deadly sniper with a penchant for getting shit done. As Karl, players infiltrate various Nazi strongholds during World War II in his quests to take out high-ranking officials, gather important intel, and work to stop the Nazis from gaining nuclear power. </p><figure id="" data-id="d89ed65c4400496900964317254b0f10" data-recommend-id="image://d89ed65c4400496900964317254b0f10" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A first-person perspective of a sniper scope shows a soldier getting shot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A first-person perspective of a sniper scope shows a soldier getting shot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d89ed65c4400496900964317254b0f10" data-recommend-id="image://d89ed65c4400496900964317254b0f10" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A first-person perspective of a sniper scope shows a soldier getting shot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Sniper Elite</em>’s gameplay is built around intense stealth, letting players loose in medium-sized sandbox levels where they’re tasked with completing various main and side objectives without being caught by Nazi forces. Doing so requires distracting enemies, knocking out or killing them, and even hiding their bodies.</p><p>And while much of this can be completed with some melee takedowns and a wide selection of traps, sometimes you just have to resort to popping noggins with a sniper. This is where things get the most fun, too, as the franchise takes a relatively realistic approach to sniping, requiring you to mask your shots using lightning or loud nearby events, as well as learn how wind and bullet drop will affect your shots.</p><figure id="" data-id="101b6aad1015d9818363d68608aa16d3" data-recommend-id="image://101b6aad1015d9818363d68608aa16d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An X-ray image shows a bullet entering a soldier's body." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An X-ray image shows a bullet entering a soldier's body." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="101b6aad1015d9818363d68608aa16d3" data-recommend-id="image://101b6aad1015d9818363d68608aa16d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An X-ray image shows a bullet entering a soldier's body." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Perhaps most thrilling of all, though, is the series’ famous X-ray kill cam, which will often slow down time to show your bullet travel from your rifle to its target, then give you a view of their innards as the bullet penetrates their organs in graphic detail.

Luckily, <strong>each game has a standalone story, meaning you don’t need to have played any previous titles to understand what’s going on</strong>. A vague reference to past events here or there may catch the ears of the most dedicated fans, but rest assured you’re not missing any pivotal information by jumping into the series wherever you’d like.</p><p>The release order of the mainline series is as follows:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Sniper Elite </em>(2005)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite V2</em> (2012)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite III</em> (2014)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite 4</em> (2017)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite VR</em> (2021)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite 5</em> (2022)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite VR: Winter Warrior</em> (2023)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance </em>(2025)</li></ul><p>In addition to the mainline franchise, a spin-off franchise known as <em>Nazi Zombie Army</em> uses similar mechanics (including the beloved X-ray kill cam) while pitting players against an onslaught of zombies. This alternate history series contains four games so far, with the first three being bundled on modern platforms under the title <em>Zombie Army Trilogy</em>. Meanwhile, the most recent game, <em>Zombie Army 4: Dead War</em>, can be purchased separately.</p><p><br>Clearly, there are plenty of games in the <em>Sniper Elite</em> series that are waiting to be enjoyed, but if you just want to dive into the latest and greatest, you can start with <em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> on January 30. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5090 starts at $1,999 before you factor in upsells from the company's partners or price increases driven by scalpers and/or genuine demand. It costs more than my entire gaming PC.</p>
<p>The new GPU is so expensive that you could build an entire well-specced gaming PC with Nvidia's next-fastest GPU in it—the $999 RTX 5080, which we don't have in hand yet—for the same money, or maybe even a little less with judicious component selection. It's not the most expensive GPU that Nvidia has ever launched—2018's $2,499 Titan RTX has it beat, and 2022's RTX 3090 Ti also cost $2,000—but it's safe to say it's not really a GPU intended for the masses.</p>
<p>At least as far as gaming is concerned, the 5090 is the very definition of a halo product; it's for people who demand the best and newest thing regardless of what it costs (the calculus is probably different for deep-pocketed people and companies who want to use them as some kind of generative AI accelerator). And on this front, at least, the 5090 is successful. It's the newest and fastest GPU you can buy, and the competition is not particularly close. It's also a showcase for DLSS Multi-Frame Generation, a new feature unique to the 50-series cards that Nvidia is leaning on heavily to make its new GPUs look better than they already are.</p>

<p>We won’t spend too long talking about the specific designs of Nvidia’s Founders Edition cards since many buyers will experience the Blackwell GPUs with cards from Nvidia’s partners instead (the cards we’ve seen so far mostly look like the expected fare: gargantuan triple-slot triple-fan coolers, with varying degrees of RGB). But it's worth noting that Nvidia has addressed a couple of my functional gripes with the 4090/4080-series design.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The first was the sheer dimensions of each card—not an issue unique to Nvidia, but one that frequently caused problems for me as someone who tends toward ITX-based PCs and smaller builds. The 5090 and 5080 FE designs are the same length and height as the 4090 and 4080 FE designs, but they only take up two slots instead of three, which will make them an easier fit for many cases.</p>
<p>Nvidia has also tweaked the cards’ 12VHPWR connector, recessing it into the card and mounting it at a slight angle instead of having it sticking straight out of the top edge. The height of the 4090/4080 FE design made some cases hard to close up once you factored in the additional height of a 12VHPWR cable or Nvidia’s many-tentacled 8-pin-to-12VHPWR adapter. The angled connector still extends a bit beyond the top of the card, but it’s easier to tuck the cable away so you can put the side back on your case.</p>


<p>Finally, Nvidia has changed its cooler—whereas most OEM GPUs mount all their fans on the top of the GPU, Nvidia has historically placed one fan on each side of the card. In a standard ATX case with the GPU mounted parallel to the bottom of the case, this wasn’t a <em>huge</em> deal—there’s plenty of room for that air to circulate inside the case and to be expelled by whatever case fans you have installed.</p>
<p>But in “sandwich-style” ITX cases, where a riser cable wraps around so the GPU can be mounted parallel to the motherboard, the fan on the bottom side of the GPU was poorly placed. In many sandwich-style cases, the GPU fan will dump heat against the back of the motherboard, making it harder to keep the GPU cool and creating heat problems elsewhere besides. The new GPUs mount both fans on the top of the cards.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>Nvidia’s Founders Edition cards <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=geforce+founders+edition+heat+problems&amp;oq=geforce+founders+edition+heat+problems&amp;gs_lcrp=EgRlZGdlKgYIABBFGDkyBggAEEUYOdIBCDQxMzhqMGoxqAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">have had heat issues in the past</a>—most notably the 30-series GPUs—and that was my first question going in. A smaller cooler plus a dramatically higher peak power draw seems like a recipe for overheating.</p>

  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>At least for the 5090, the smaller cooler does mean higher temperatures—around 10 to 12 degrees Celsius higher when running the same benchmarks as the RTX 4090 Founders Edition. And while temperatures of around 77 degrees aren’t hugely concerning, this is sort of a best-case scenario, with an adequately cooled testbed case with the side panel totally removed and ambient temperatures at around 21° or 22° Celsius. You’ll just want to make sure you have a good amount of airflow in your case if you buy one of these.</p>
<h2>Testbed notes</h2>

<p>A new high-end Nvidia GPU is a good reason to tweak our test bed and suite of games, and we’ve done both here. Mainly, we added <a href="https://thermaltakeusa.com/products/toughpower-gf-a3-gold-1050w-tt-premium-edition-ps-tpd-1050fnfagu-l">a 1050 W Thermaltake Toughpower GF A3 power supply</a>—Nvidia recommends at least 1000 W for the 5090, and this one has a native 12VHPWR connector for convenience. We’ve also swapped the Ryzen 7 7800X3D for a slightly faster Ryzen 7 9800X3D to reduce the odds that the CPU will bottleneck performance as we try to hit high frame rates.</p>
<p>As for the suite of games, we’ve removed a couple of older titles and added some with built-in benchmarks that will tax these GPUs a bit more, especially at 4K with all the settings turned up. Those games include the RT Overdrive preset in the perennially punishing <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>and <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> in Cinematic mode, both games where even the RTX 4090 struggles to hit 60 fps without an assist from DLSS. We’ve also added <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, a recent release that doesn’t include ray-tracing effects but does support most DLSS 3 and FSR 3 features (including FSR Frame Generation).</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>We’ve tried to strike a balance between games with ray-tracing effects and games without it, though most AAA games these days include it, and modern GPUs should be able to handle it well (best of luck to AMD with its upcoming RDNA 4 cards).</p>
<p>For the 5090, we've run all tests in 4K—if you don't care about running games in 4K, even if you want super-high frame rates at 1440p or for some kind of ultrawide monitor, the 5090 is probably overkill. When we run upscaling tests, we use the newest DLSS version available for Nvidia cards, the newest FSR version available for AMD cards, and the newest XeSS version available for Intel cards (not relevant here, just stating for the record), and we use the "Quality" setting (at 4K, that equates to an actual rendering version of 1440p).</p>
<h2>Rendering performance: A lot faster, a lot more power-hungry</h2>
<p>Before we talk about Frame Generation or "fake frames," let's compare apples to apples and just examine the 5090's rendering performance.</p>
<p>The card mainly benefits from four things compared to the 4090: the updated Blackwell GPU architecture, a nearly 33 percent increase in the number of CUDA cores, an upgrade from GDDR6X to GDDR7, and a move from a 384-bit memory bus to a 512-bit bus. It also jumps from 24GB of RAM to 32GB, but games generally aren't butting up against a 24GB limit yet, so the capacity increase by itself shouldn't really change performance if all you're focused on is gaming.</p>



<p>And for people who prioritize performance over all else, the 5090 is a big deal—it's the first consumer graphics card from any company that is faster than a 4090, as Nvidia never spruced up the 4090 last year when it did its mid-generation Super refreshes of the 4080, 4070 Ti, and 4070.</p>
<p>Comparing natively rendered games at 4K, the 5090 is between 17 percent and 40 percent faster than the 4090, with most of the games we tested landing somewhere in the low to high 30 percent range. That's an undeniably big bump, one that's roughly commensurate with the increase in the number of CUDA cores. Tests run with DLSS enabled (both upscaling-only and with Frame Generation running in 2x mode) improve by roughly the same amount.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          


<p>You could find things to be disappointed about if you went looking for them. That 30-something-percent performance increase comes with a 35 percent increase in power use in our testing under load with punishing 4K games—the 4090 tops out around 420 W, whereas the 5090 went all the way up to 573 W, with the 5090 coming closer to its 575 W TDP than the 4090 does to its theoretical 450 W maximum. The 50-series cards use the same TSMC 4N manufacturing process as the 40-series cards, and increasing the number of transistors without changing the process results in a chip that uses more power (though it should be said that capping frame rates, running at lower resolutions, or running less-demanding games can rein in that power use a bit).</p>

      Power draw under load goes up by an amount roughly commensurate with performance. The 4090 was already power-hungry; the 5090 is dramatically more so.

      </figure>

<p>The 5090's 30-something percent increase over the 4090 might also seem underwhelming if you recall that the 4090 <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review/3">was around 55 percent faster</a> than the previous-generation 3090 Ti while consuming about the same amount of power. To be <em>even faster</em> than a 4090 is no small feat—AMD's fastest GPU is more in line with Nvidia's 4080 Super—but if you're comparing the two cards using the exact same tests, the relative leap is less seismic.</p>
<p>That brings us to Nvidia's answer for that problem: DLSS 4 and its Multi-Frame Generation feature.</p>

<h2>DLSS 4 and Multi-Frame Generation</h2>
<p>As a refresher, Nvidia's DLSS Frame Generation feature, as introduced in the GeForce 40-series, takes DLSS upscaling one step further. The upscaling feature inserted interpolated pixels into a rendered image to make it look like a sharper, higher-resolution image without having to do all the work of rendering all those pixels. DLSS FG would interpolate an entire frame between rendered frames, boosting your FPS without dramatically boosting the amount of work your GPU was doing. If you used DLSS upscaling and FG at the same time, Nvidia could claim that seven out of eight pixels on your screen were generated by AI.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>DLSS Multi-Frame Generation (hereafter MFG, for simplicity's sake) does the same thing, but it can generate one to three interpolated frames for every rendered frame. The marketing numbers have gone up, too; now, 15 out of every 16 pixels on your screen can be generated by AI.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>

      Nvidia might point to this and say that the 5090 is over twice as fast as the 4090, but that's not really comparing apples to apples. Expect this issue to persist over the lifetime of the 50-series.

<p>Nvidia provided reviewers with a preview build of <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>with DLSS MFG enabled, which gives us an example of how those settings will be exposed to users. For 40-series cards that only support the regular DLSS FG, you won't notice a difference in games that support MFG—Frame Generation is still just one toggle you can turn on or off. For 50-series cards that support MFG, you'll be able to choose from among a few options, just as you currently can with other DLSS quality settings.</p>
<p>The “2x” mode is the old version of DLSS FG and is supported by both the 50-series cards and 40-series GPUs; it promises one generated frame for every rendered frame (two frames total, hence "2x"). The “3x” and “4x” modes are new to the 50-series and promise two and three generated frames (respectively) for every rendered frame. Like the original DLSS FG, MFG can be used in concert with normal DLSS upscaling, or it can be used independently.</p>
<p>One problem with the original DLSS FG was latency—user input was only being sampled at the natively rendered frame rate, meaning you could be looking at 60 frames per second on your display but only having your input polled 30 times per second. Another is image quality; as good as the DLSS algorithms can be at guessing and recreating what a natively rendered pixel would look like, you'll inevitably see errors, particularly in fine details.</p>
<p>Both these problems contribute to the third problem with DLSS FG: Without a decent underlying frame rate, the lag you feel and the weird visual artifacts you notice will both be more pronounced. So DLSS FG can be useful for turning 120 fps into 240 fps, or even 60 fps into 120 fps. But it's not as helpful if you're trying to get from 20 or 30 fps up to a smooth 60 fps.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>We'll be taking a closer look at the DLSS upgrades in the next couple of weeks (including MFG and the new transformer model, which will supposedly increase upscaling quality and supports all RTX GPUs). But in our limited testing so far, the issues with DLSS MFG are basically the same as with the first version of Frame Generation, just slightly more pronounced. In the built-in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> benchmark, the most visible issues are with some bits of barbed-wire fencing, which get smoother-looking and less detailed as you crank up the number of AI-generated frames. But the motion&nbsp;<em>does</em> look fluid and smooth, and the frame rate counts are admittedly impressive.</p>
<p>But as we noted in last year's 4090 review, the xx90 cards portray FG and MFG in the best light possible since the card is already capable of natively rendering such high frame rates. It's on lower-end cards where the shortcomings of the technology become more pronounced. Nvidia might say that the upcoming RTX 5070 is "as fast as a 4090 for $549," and it might be right in terms of the number of frames the card can put up on your screen every second. But responsiveness and visual fidelity on the 4090 will be better every time—AI is a good augmentation for rendered frames, but it's iffy as a <em>replacement</em> for rendered frames.</p>

<h2>A 4090, amped way up</h2>

<p>The GeForce RTX 5090 is an impressive card—it's the only consumer graphics card to be released in over two years that can outperform the RTX 4090. The main caveats are its sky-high power consumption and sky-high price; by itself, it costs as much (and consumes as much power as) an entire mainstream gaming PC. The card is aimed at people who care about speed way more than they care about price, but it's still worth putting it into context.</p>
<p>The main controversy, as with the 40-series, is how Nvidia talks about its Frame Generation-inflated performance numbers. Frame Generation and Multi-Frame Generation are tools in a toolbox—there will be games where they make things look great and run fast with minimal noticeable impact to visual quality or responsiveness, games where those impacts are more noticeable, and games that never add support for the features at all. (As well-supported as DLSS generally is in new releases, it&nbsp;<em>is</em> incumbent upon game developers to add it—and update it when Nvidia puts out a new version.)</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>But using those Multi-Frame Generation-inflated FPS numbers to make topline comparisons to last-generation graphics cards just feels disingenuous. No, an RTX 5070 will not be as fast as an RTX 4090 for just $549, because not all games support DLSS MFG, and not all games that&nbsp;<em>do</em> support it will run it well. Frame Generation still needs a good base frame rate to start with, and the slower your card is, the more issues you might notice.</p>
<p>Fuzzy marketing aside, Nvidia is still the undisputed leader in the GPU market, and the RTX 5090 extends that leadership for what will likely be another entire GPU generation, since both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/new-radeon-rx-9000-gpus-promise-to-fix-two-of-amds-biggest-weaknesses/">AMD</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/review-intel-arc-b580-is-a-compelling-if-incredibly-tardy-250-midrange-gpu/">Intel</a> are focusing their efforts on higher-volume, lower-cost cards right now. DLSS is still generally better than AMD's FSR, and Nvidia does a good job of getting developers of new AAA game releases to support it. And if you're buying this GPU to do some kind of rendering work or generative AI acceleration, Nvidia's performance and software tools are still superior. The misleading performance claims are frustrating, but Nvidia still gains a lot of real advantages from being as dominant and entrenched as it is.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Usually 30-something percent faster than an RTX 4090</li>
<li>Redesigned Founders Edition card is less unwieldy than the bricks that were the 4090/4080 design</li>
<li>Adequate cooling, despite the smaller card and higher power use</li>
<li>DLSS Multi-Frame Generation is an intriguing option if you're trying to hit 240 or 360 fps on your high-refresh-rate gaming monitor</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Much higher power consumption than the 4090, which already consumed more power than any other GPU on the market</li>
<li>Frame Generation is good at making a game that's running fast run faster, it's not as good for bringing a slow game up to 60 Hz</li>
<li>Nvidia's misleading marketing around Multi-Frame Generation is frustrating—and will likely be <em>more</em> frustrating for lower-end cards since they aren't getting the same bumps to core count and memory interface that the 5090 gets</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can buy a whole lot of PC for $2,000, and we wouldn't bet on this GPU being easy to find at MSRP</li>
</ul>

However, seeing a Glaceon Tera ex deck in action would be very entertaining.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Eevee Elite Trainer Box Promo 173</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-10-1737718374095.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to its stunning full artwork, this one will likely be in trainers' binders rather than their decks. It's still the standard Eevee card in this set, allowing trainers to evolve it as soon as it's played. It certainly makes playing an Eeveelution deck a lot easier.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mela Trainer SAR 140/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-11-1737718394762.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mela is a powerful trainer card that can be used at the right time. Trainers can grab a fire energy from their discard pile whilst topping up their hand with 6 cards, which would come in handy mid to late game. Again, this is one for a trainer binder, with the usual Mela trainer card being fairly easy to pull.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Pikachu ex 028/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-12-1737718521837.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Prismatic Evolutions also addresses Surging Sparks FOMO with Pikachu ex, although it's not a Tera ex. Thanks to Thunder, it's a relatively straightforward basic ex, with the possibility of one-hit knockouts in three turns. It's a high energy cost, but it's a lovely card to build up from the bench to switch in and out, thanks to its one energy retreat cost.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Max Rod Ace Spec 116/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-13-1737718545967.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This card can literally flip a battle on its head. Imagine having Tyranitar's ex knocked out alongside its four energy cards, then using this Max Rod to get it all back and start building it again from the bench. Probably one of the most useful Ace Specs cards we've seen.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Espeon ex 034/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-14-1737718572842.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Espeon ex decks are going to be very hard to combat thanks to their ability to both discard from an opponent's hand and de-evolve all opposing Pokémon, shuffling the evolution cards into their deck. This one card can drag a battle out and whittle down opponents, so imagine a deck built around four of them. Insane.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tyranitar ex 064/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-15-1737718597512.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At first glance, Grind makes Tyranitar ex very playable. But it's a different story when I consider it a second-stage evolution with a minimum of three energy cards attached to stretch its legs. I love Tyranitar, but this ex-card ain't it, chief. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Prismatic Evolution Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a given that we all want the Eeveelution SIR cards from Prismatic Evolutions. Still, some seriously cool overlooked artwork in this expansion might be worth snapping up if you see a bargain.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dragapult ex SAR 165/131</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-16-1737719041103.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragapult ex SAR 165/131 is one of my favorite artworks from this set, and I'm very tempted to build a deck around Phantom Dive. Two energy costscosts for a combined 260 damage, 60 of which can be spread on your opponent'sopponent's bench. It's an insane move; watch for this card creeping up in value just because trainers want it in their deck.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Roaring Moon ex SIR 162/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-17-1737719796337.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another heavy hitter with Roaring Moon ex-SIR with stunning artwork. A triple hit energy spend for its attacks is brutal, but this basic Pokémon card could be the final push in a tight battle. Loading a deck up with Stadium cards and building support around Roaring Moon ex sounds like a fun deck to build, that's for sure.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Umbreon ex SIR 161/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-18-1737720000986.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, ​I doubt anyone will use an $1200+ Umbreon ex SIR in their decks, but if you take a look at that mental moveset, you'd surely be tempted. Like Roaring Moon ex, this card has the chance of flipping a Pokémon TCG battle on its head in the 11th hour with both of its moves. Yes, it needs three different energy types. Still, there's some fun to be had building out an Eeveelution deck around Umbreon ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, with all things considered, is Prismatic Evolutions worth the hype? In short yes. There are plenty of awesome cards to add to your binder and more playable cards. Still, you'll be waiting for stock to appear without brilliant timing. Eeveelution-based sets will always be cool, but the chances of pulling one of the elusive Eeveelution SIRs is 1 in 900 booster packs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the addition of God packs and Master Ball cards, which is very cool. Imagine pulling every SIR in one booster pack? The problem is it's very unlikely to happen, so strap in and get ripping packs and boxes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Pokémon TCG: Prismatic Evolutions in 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Stock has been hard to come by for Pokémon TCG: Prismatic Evolutions, and things are only now starting to even out a little. Pokémon is at the height of popularity again, between TCG Pocket, investors buying up stock, and general increased demand for sets such as Surging Sparks, it's a crazy time to get into the hobby. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-company-breaks-silence-on-prismatic-evolution-shortage">The Pokémon Company's efforts to restock shelves ASAP</a>, Prismatic Evolutions also represent a turning point of going online or in-store to buy stock instead of resorting to the questionable secondary market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Prismatic Evolutions collection offers a range of products for collectors and players, each celebrating the beloved Eeveelutions. At the top, the Elite Trainer Box provides nine booster packs, an exclusive full-art Eevee promo, and useful extras like sleeves, dice, and condition markers—ideal for anyone building their collection or deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a simpler option, the Surprise Box includes a few booster packs and a random Eeveelution ex promo with a Prismatic Evolutions stamp, offering an affordable way to dip into the set. Similarly, the Mini Tin is a compact choice with two booster packs, a collectible Eevee coin, and an art card, doubling as a neat storage solution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collectors will appreciate the Binder Collection, which pairs four booster packs with a sturdy Eevee-themed binder for organizing prized cards like Master Ball foils or Special Illustration Rares. The Tech Sticker Collection adds a playful touch with Eevee stickers and two booster packs, perfect for younger fans or casual fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, the Poster Collection combines display-worthy content with collectibility, featuring three booster packs, a fold-out Eevee poster, and exclusive holo promos of Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon. Each product highlights the magic of the Prismatic Evolutions set, offering something for every kind of Pokémon fan, whether you're chasing rare cards, organizing your collection, or simply enjoying the Eevee hype.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod is now available for download, introducing ultrawide support to the newly released PC version of the game.</p>
<p>The current work-in-progress version of the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Fix mod, which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/Lyall/FF7RebirthFix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, aims to improve the PC version of the game over time by introducing a variety of improvements. As of now, the mod only introduces ultrawide support by supporting any aspect rations with corrected FOV and centered 16:9 HUD. As the mod is still in a very early version, issues are expected.</p>
<p>Among some of the essential settings that the PC version of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth lacks is in-game FOV settings. Thankfully, user dammy63 from the FearLess Cheat Engine forums came to the rescue with a <a href="https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?p=389117#p389117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheat Engine table</a> that allows users to change the game's FOV value. As the modding tools evolve, a proper mod should also be released for those who do not want to use Cheat Engine for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the Remake trilogy by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 release.</p>
<p><em>If there’s one word to describe&nbsp;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <p>My favourite genre of YouTuber is: "person who hyperfixates on one mundane detail of a blockbuster video game and gets strangely poetic about it".  When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69u_Pxb_8zI">where the rivers in Skyrim go</a>, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a>. This is vital work. This is important work.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkdqIFg860" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>This act of, uh, "research" has been performed by YouTuber Allie Meowy, who spends an hour taking the viewer step-by-step through the various bathroom belt unbucklings and musing on each urination with a critical lens that absolutely nobody deemed necessary. That's great. I won't spoil exactly how many pees you can pee in the choice-heavy crime thriller. You'll have to watch the video (or skip through it) to find out. I will say it's not a huge or impressive number. It is a very plain amount of pees for a story that follows four people over four days. But it's not the number of pees that's important, it's the stains we found along the way. </p>
<p>"We will build on our knowledge of the piss mechanics throughout this video," says Alllie, with an alarming amount of straight-faced  professionalism. "In most games you shoot people and it means nothing. In Heavy Rain, you piss and the narrative is very slightly enhanced. And you know what? I think that's beautiful."</p><p>As anyone who has ever yelled "Jason" in a shopping mall can attest, Heavy Rain is a magnet for irony. It is impossible to enjoy this (or arguably any game by Quantic Dream) without cackling out loud at certain moments. For all their desire to be grand, meaningful works of art, these games are laden with nonsense, both intentional and unintentional. </p>
<p>Yet the video is not just a litany of gags at the expense of 2010's best and worst choose-your-own-misery game. As the piss countdown progresses, Allie's intense scrutiny results in some weirdly interesting observations. For example, Madison, the only playable woman in the story, flushes the toilet automatically, whereas all male characters require the player to activate the flush themselves. In many instances, you will pee and be unable to wash your hands. You will often eat or rub your face soon afterwards. </p>
<p>The piss is not dynamically tracked by the game, she also notes. You can drink carton after carton of orange juice and you will never become bursting to go. And some of the bathrooms in the game's US setting (not-quite-Philadelphia) lack a sink because that's how some bathrooms exist in real life France, where the game's designers were based. </p>
<p>"You can easily go the whole game without taking a piss even once," observes Allie. "I don't know why you'd want to do that but it technically is an option for players who prefer a pissless play style."</p>
<p>And just like that "pissless playstyle" has become one of my favourite phrases of the year so far. </p>
<p>The video also acts as a surprisingly thorough breakdown of the game's storyline. If you have never played Heavy Rain, and can't face doing a whole playthrough yourself, I can now recommend this as the definitive way to have the story summarised. Yes, the focus is on urine. Yes, the word piss occurs approximately 150 times in the course of the video. But I have probably learned more about this Cage game in the past hour than I did after two playthroughs when it first released. </p><p>Pee is on the brain here at RPS, it seems. I recently reviewed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a>, a mechanic sim in which you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-summer-car-review-a-sordid-sim-of-piss-and-pistons-that-wont-hold-your-disgusting-little-hand">drink your own wizz</a> to reduce both your thirst bar and urine bar at the same time. Meanwhile, first-piss-on-shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/urge">Urge</a> got Edwin's attention for being "the most interesting open world shooter in a long while, and also, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/urge-is-the-most-interesting-open-world-shooter-in-a-long-while-and-also-the-most-revolting">the most revolting</a>". Anyway. That's all the piss we have for the moment, reader. Now, wash your hands.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Here's your feelgood story for the weekend, possibly: the creators of megahit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-pals-ranked">Palworld</a> are using some of their Palbucks to set up a new publishing arm, and their first project as publisher is an untitled horror game from Surgent Studios, the struggling developers of Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Intriguingly, this doesn't appear to be the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-tales-of-kenzera-devs-are-making-a-gothic-horror-rpg-beat-em-up-where-two-characters-fight-over-one-body">"Project Uso"</a> Surgent revealed last October, which founder Abubakar Salim described as both a reflection on the experience of fatherhood and "a cross between an RPG and a beat 'em up power fantasy". According to Salim, that game was set in the same world as the studio's debut Afrofuturist platformer. Their new game for Pocketpair isn't. Instead, it's being positioned as a game "about" the entertainment industry.
</p>
<p>
"Both Surgent and Pocketpair are well-versed in taking risks," Salim comments in statements shared with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/pocketpair-launches-publishing-arm-partners-with-surgent-studios-for-first-title">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "We noticed a pattern in the entertainment industry, and Pocketpair has given us the opportunity to make a horror game about it."
</p>
<p>
This doesn't mean there won't be another Kenzera game, mind. "We're still in an earnest conversation about further projects set in the Tales of Kenzera universe, but this will be a standalone piece: a mile marker between where we've come from and where we're going," Salim added.
</p><p>
It's certainly a timely turn of events for Surgent. While pretty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review">well-reviewed</a>, Tales Of Kenzera appears to have sold much worse than hoped. Surgent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-studio-founded-by-assassins-creed-origins-actor-lay-off-staff-less-than-three-months-after-debut-game">laid off around a dozen staff</a> in July last year, just three months after release, and subsequently put their whole games division on hiatus. 
</p>
<p>
It's also a timely turn of events for Pocketpair, who are currently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">being sued by Nintendo for patent infringement</a>. In case you've been living under a boulder since last winter, the studio's reputation-making poach-me-do has plenty in common with the Pokémon series, though Pocketpair <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-palworld-break-pokemons-copyright-we-asked-a-lawyer">appear secure, at least, against the separate charge of copyright theft</a>.</p>
<p>Salim's canned statements about Pocketpair "taking risks" ring true here, though I'm not sure they accurately describe the game's design. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> ain't too bad as monster-bagging base-builders go, but it won't be winning any awards for imagination.
</p>
<p>
All of which leaves me curious about the above "pattern in the entertainment industry" Surgent intend to target. Salim has been outspoken on the subject of racism in the games industry and community, so perhaps that'll be the focus. Or perhaps the Pal-published game will pit you against some rotund, mustachioed lawyers who are accompanied by cuddly electric pissmonsters that look absolutely nothing like Pikachu.

At least, that’s how its most recent patch notes read. <em>The Veilguard </em>just got its fifth big update, mostly consisting of bug fixes, and it sounds like BioWare is happy with the state of the game and will now be monitoring it for game-breaking bugs.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

But in the intro text, BioWare writes, “With the game being in a stable place, we are moving to monitor for any game-breaking bugs should those occur. Dareth shiral!” That last bit is the elvish phrase for “farewell,” which hasn’t been included in the sign-off for any of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s previous patch notes. That sounds final, and if the game isn’t getting any DLC, it’s not too surprising that BioWare would wrap up patches and move on to the next <em>Mass Effect</em>. While <em>The Veilguard </em>is divisive for both good- and incredibly bad-faith reasons, it’s probably the most polished game in BioWare’s portfolio, so I wouldn’t think it needed a ton of maintenance. We’ve reached out to BioWare for comment and will update the story if we hear back. In the meantime, here are the full patch notes:</p><p><strong>Quality of Life Changes:</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Recommended levels have been added to side quests that players may receive at significantly lower levels.</li></ul><p><strong>Bug Fixes: </strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed an issue where Rook could only flirt with Lucanis in a specific conversation. </li><li>Fixed an issue with the Regrets of The Dread Wolf quest not triggering properly or stopping Rook with an invisible wall in the Crossroads. </li><li>Fixed a blocking issue with a puzzle in the Converged City area of the Crossroads. </li><li>Fixed an issue with the “Imperium’s Resolve” armor causing negative damage instead of the intended zero fire, cold, necrotic, and electric damage. </li><li>Fixed excessive clipping on Taash’s “Rivain’s Legacy” armor. </li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented some Rooks from changing the runes on their lyrium dagger. </li><li>Fixed an issue with the Medium Armor Mastery skill for Warriors. </li><li>Fixed a spot on Rivain’s beach where Rook could get stuck in a cycle of drowning, never to be pulled out of the water by their companions. </li><li>Fixed a typo on a note Rook can find in Dock Town. </li><li>Fixed an issue that caused photo mode screenshots to be noticeably worse quality when HDR was turned to “On.”</li><li>Fixed an issue that was causing the photo mode screenshot location to still be shown on screen. </li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the fireflies in the opening area of the Crossroads to flicker at an alarming rate on specific settings. </li><li>Fixed a lighting issue in one of the conversations with the whole team in the Lighthouse.</li><li>Fixed an issue in the Mirror of Transformation that blocked players from zooming in and out with the mouse scroll wheel. </li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed an issue where the Objective Marker Visibility was not updated when the exploration preset was changed with the other options in the Exploration sub-category. </li><li>Some adjustments to the game credits.</li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’d spent years relying exclusively on my PC to experience the current generation of games, but I <em>needed </em>to play <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> as soon as humanly possible. No exclusivity window would dissuade me. I would finally and ruefully eat the cost of a new console. Then I blinked, a year passed, and <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> came to PC.</p><p>This is not to say that I never played my PS5 copy of <em>FFVII Rebirth</em>, to this day the only PS5 game I own. I <a href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-queens-blood-card-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became obsessed with Queen’s Blood</a> and made it all the way to chapter eight of the main story. I even managed to figure out how to <a href="https://aftermath.site/chiaki-chiaki4deck-moonlight-playstation-portal-sunshine-streaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stream the game to my Steam Deck</a> using Chris Person tech magic. But as happens with a great many games, life intervened, and I fell off playing it before I could reach the (<a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ending-aerith-black-materia-1851310221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apparently-controversial</a>) ending. One thing led to another – by which I mean 2024 led to 2025 – and now we’re here.</p><p>This is especially galling because of the trouble I went through to obtain my PS5. Originally I ordered one off Amazon, but when I received the notification that it had arrived, I couldn’t find it. Turns out, it had been stolen from my building’s mailroom – pilfered, apparently, at random alongside several other boxes, but I have to imagine that the thief felt like he’d hit the jackpot when he realized what he’d nabbed. I ended up going to my building’s super to pull security footage, but by that point the thief was long gone.&nbsp;</p><p>I learned only one thing of note from the footage: For whatever reason, the thief had chosen to wear a weirdly ostentatious jacket that day – not the precise jacket from <em>Drive </em>(2011), but one with a similar coloration and pattern. I spent weeks wondering why somebody would dress up in such identifiable clothing before going on a stealing spree. I swore that if I ever saw that jacket, guy in tow, walking around my neighborhood, I’d fire off some stern words like “Hey man, what gives” or “Please return my PS5; you’ve made me very sad.” Nothing ever came of it.</p><p>Finally, options exhausted, I decided to just buy a PS5 in-person at my local GameStop. If The Jacketed Man wanted to steal this one, he’d have to fight me for it. Fortunately, my second attempt at purchasing a PS5 proved uneventful. I took it home, plugged it in, and downloaded a pre-release review copy of <em>Rebirth</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, that’s right: I managed to get my hands on a copy of the game slightly before everybody else, and even then, I failed to finish it in a timely fashion. It’s embarrassing! All the more so because even though I can now play it on my platform of choice – with bleeding-edge graphics on my PC and wherever I want on my Steam Deck (not just in my home via Chris Person tech magic) – I’m not going to because I’m <em>just </em>far enough in the PS5 version that I have no desire to do it all over again.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, I am a weak-willed fool, a stain on my family’s legacy. That said, I think there’s a small silver lining to all of this: I played plenty of other games last year, large and (mostly) small. There’s such an abundance of great stuff coming out all the time that even games you’ve been anticipating for years can fall by the wayside. And so, in a sense, you don’t <em>need </em>those games – or rather, you are more capable of waiting for them than you might think. Exclusivity windows, like time, are an illusion, and both will pass before you know it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/youtube-inspiration-tab-ai-slop"><h3>YouTube’s New AI Is Inspiring Content Creators To Make Their Videos Boring</h3></a><p>Once again asking, begging, perhaps even pleading the question "Who is this for"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pathfinder-kingmaker-sales-officially-reach-the-2m-mark.1091199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-kingmaker-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Knights Peak and developer Owlcat Games have announced that their CRPG&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>has hit a brand new sales milestone over six years after its initial launch.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>sales have now hit the two million mark. It seems the milestone may have been reached a little too late for the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-kingmaker-delays-its-rule-until-september-25th" rel="nofollow">sixth anniversary</a>, which fell in September last year, but it's still an achievement for Owlcat and Knights Peak to be proud of.</p>

<p>At last count, Owlcat's followup&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-wrath-of-righteous-sales-reach-1-million" rel="nofollow">reached a million sales</a>, and earlier this week, the studio revealed that its grimdark futuristic CRPG&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">hit the same number</a>. That puts&nbsp;<em>Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>out in front as the studio's best-selling game to date.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-kingmaker-sales-2m-dragon.jpg?itok=cJyjxrMi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-kingmaker-sales-2m-dragon.jpg?itok=yIlmD9Dx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>has hit the two million sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>It does mean that the game is trailing behind genre rivals <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-has-way-over-10-million-players-mod-support-has-been-in-works-since" rel="nofollow">like&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, but given that Owlcat's games are arguably much more niche than Larian's big hit, that's probably not a big surprise.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em>, it's a CRPG that serves as both Owlcat Games' first title and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-crpg-pathfinder-kingmaker-announced-chris-avellone-to-contribute" rel="nofollow">first video game</a> to be set in the&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder&nbsp;</em>world. The game sees you building and managing your very own kingdom, navigating courtly intrigue and seeing off threats to your rule as you do so.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a modern CRPG, the game lets you create your own hero and meet a range of diverse companions, as well as iconic figures from the&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder&nbsp;</em>mythology. It also allows you to choose between real-time and turn-based combat depending on your personal preference, which is always nice.</p>




<p><em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/640820/Pathfinder_Kingmaker__Enhanced_Plus_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2047-CUSA14853_00-KINGMAKER00000US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/pathfinder-kingmaker-definitive-edition/BPHQQN22GB7L" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and you can also play it on current-gen consoles thanks to the magic of backwards compatibility. Stay tuned for more on all other things Owlcat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24350575/hironobu-sakaguchi-interview-fantasian-neo-dimension<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The release of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"><em>Fantasian</em> on Apple Arcade in 2021</a> was meant to be an end to the illustrious career of Hironobu Sakaguchi — but it seems like he can’t stay away.</p><p><em>Fantasian</em> was a return to Sakaguchi’s roots, a throwback roleplaying game from the creator of the <em>Final Fantasy </em>series, which added some innovative gameplay ideas and an incredibly charming world made of handcrafted dioramas. And in December, his Mistwalker studio released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24312363/fantasian-xbox-ps5-switch-pc-launch-hironobu-sakaguchi">a new version dubbed <em>Neo Dimension</em></a>, which brought the game to more platforms and added new features like voice acting. It was even published by <em>Final Fantasy</em> company Square Enix. While Sakaguchi says he “intended <em>Fantasian</em> to be my final project before I retired,” he now wants to make another game in the same mold, one he hopes can be seen as “a successor to <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>.” The sixth <em>Final Fantasy</em> game is particularly notable as the last to feature pixel art before the series shifted to 3D.</p><p>Following the launch of <em>Neo Dimension</em>, I had the chance to ask Sakaguchi a few questions about making <em>Fantasian</em>, the enduring popularity of turn-based RPGs, and what comes next.</p><p><em>This interview has been edited for clarity and length. </em></p><p><strong>There have obviously been a lot of comparisons to <em>Final Fantasy</em>, and you were inspired in part to make this game because of <em>FFVI</em>. Do the comparisons bother you? Do you ever worry people are missing what makes <em>Fantasian</em> unique?</strong></p><p>Not really, since my approach to creating <em>Fantasian</em> was different from my previous works. For this project, I aimed to tap into my inner creativity to earnestly craft an RPG once more, so because of this, drawing comparisons with existing games felt pointless to me. I intended <em>Fantasian</em> to be my final project before I retired, so it was somewhat of a farewell note from me.</p><p>With the production and release of <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> — a definitive director’s cut version — I believe that the game has become complete. In the distant future, or maybe after I have already left this world, I imagine this game will find its meaning if someone chooses to look into the legacy of either myself or <em>Final Fantasy</em>.</p><p><strong>What was it like working with Square Enix again? That feels like an interesting full-circle moment.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It’s the place where I started my career, so coming full circle through the game I envisioned to be my final work was definitely a fascinating experience. There are times in life when we encounter coincidental full-circle moments or experience deja vu, but this particular instance felt very significant and comforting.</p><p><strong>The big change for this game is the addition of voice acting. What do you think that adds to the experience, and what was it like finding the right casting for these existing characters? Did you already have an idea in your head of how they would sound?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Since I wasn’t well versed with voice acting in games, I trusted Square Enix’s expertise and the artistic vision of director Takuto Nakamura. As a result, the voice actors — some of whom, for the Japanese version, were cast in consideration of&nbsp;their connection to <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> — were all wonderful. Establishing how the characters would sound involved extensive collaboration as well as trial and error with the voice actors, which I believe is a testament to the numerous ideas and inspirations contributed by all the staff who took part in the voice recording&nbsp;process.</p><div><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy VI.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Square Enix</cite></p></div><p><strong>Both <em>Neo Dimension</em> and </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review"><strong>the <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> remake</strong></a><strong> came out around the same time to very positive reception. What do you think it is about this style of RPG that makes them still relevant today?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Games that employ cutting-edge technology are very appealing. Improved graphics are a given, but I’m anticipating that future games will likely also incorporate AI in innovative ways, and I’m personally very intrigued by these games. However, apart from these advancements, I also believe there is an intrinsic desire associated with gaming experiences to immerse oneself in virtual worlds.</p><p>With games that have a similar style to <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>, players can explore the virtual world and gain a sense of fulfillment that they have mastered everything that occurs within it. I think another factor is how these games allow developers to utilize energy created from this extraordinary technology to come up with unique mechanics that enable players’ total immersion in virtual worlds. It goes without saying that realizing both is feasible, and I do think that would represent the best kind of game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"><strong>I spoke to you ahead of the Apple Arcade launch</strong></a><strong>, you said you only wanted to work on games that brought you “genuine joy.” Now that you’ve wrapped up <em>Fantasian</em>, what does that joy look like for you moving forward? Do you think you want to stick to familiar styles and genres like this or explore new&nbsp;things?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I was thinking of making <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> my final work, but the fantastic team that was assembled to complete this project was so enjoyable to work with that I found it hard to part ways. Humans are greedy creatures, aren’t we? For that reason, I’m currently working on a new project with the same team that&nbsp;worked on <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>. It’s generally going to follow a similar style to my previous works, and it’ll be something that can be a successor to <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> in a good way — our goal is to create something old but new at the same time. It’ll be part two of my farewell note.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Palworld’s update version v0.4.14 is live now, bringing new Spring Festivals skins, specific adjustments, balancing changes and bug fixes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palworld has introduced 5 new Spring Festival Skins in this update, each featuring unique elements reminiscent of the Chinese New Year. However, players should have the corresponding Pals to equip the skins. The new collection includes Lucky Cattiva, Fortune-Bringer Lyleen, Fortune-Bringer Lyleen Noct, Lion-Dancer Chillet and Lion-Dancer Chillet Ignis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the new skins, Palworld has introduced some specific adjustments that change Pals’ behaviours and add new elements to some world regions. After the latest adjustments, Pals will attack the nearest enemy after being summoned. The behaviour of large pals at bases has been made the same as that of small pals to allow them to pass through narrow areas. Lastly, earth and water elements were added in various places.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding balancing, Palworld has adjusted rewards, expanded the range of area near the reticle, and made some enhancements to crude oil production, along with other changes. In terms of bug fixes, a game-crashing bug was fixed. Also, some issues with UIs, treasure chests, PS5s and more have been resolved. Interested players can check out the <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1882627804296261984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full patch notes</a> for Palworld’s update version v0.4.14 to learn more about balancing and bug fixes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Palworld revealed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-reveals-new-roadmap-for-one-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new roadmap for their first anniversary</a>.

Previously, players would get a 15-day ban on their first offense, but according to the game's devs, those days are over.</p><p dir="ltr">The new anti-cheat efforts were caught in action during a livestreamed match on popular Rainbow Six Siege content creator JessGOAT's Twitch channel. In the clip, an obvious cheater is promptly kicked and banned. JessGOAT shared the footage on X (formerly Twitter), and the official Rainbow Six Siege account responded, "Y'all thought we were playin'?"</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft also <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1882459530228912563" rel="nofollow ">shared more details</a> about the game's new anti-cheat efforts.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've heard your feedback and are updating our sanctioning systems for players detected for botting," the developer stated. "Players will now be permanently banned on their first botting offense, rather than an initial 15-day ban followed by a permanent ban on the second offense. This stricter and more aggressive sanctioning has been made possible by an improved detection system that drastically reduces false positives."</p><p dir="ltr">"As of now, cheaters sanctioned by our systems will be kicked from their ongoing match and the match will be automatically cancelled," the statement continued. "Along with Y9S4.2, we are shipping a new round of hardening and security updates, as we did in each patch (4.0, 4.1, 4.1.1) with major disruption and impact on the most prevalent cheat providers."</p><p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-cheats-made-hackers-hundreds-of-/1100-6470879/">sued Rainbow Six Siege cheat-makers</a> in the past (and has always <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-team-investigating-cheat-that-ki/1100-6477610/">taken cheating seriously</a>), but the latest update is arguably the strictest anti-cheat effort the game has ever seen.</p>
