            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/horrified-dungeons-dragons-brings-iconic-monsters-to-horror-board-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ravensburger has announced a new entry in the Horrified series. The latest installment, Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons, is courtesy of a licensed partnership with Wizards of the Coast, bringing certain iconic dungeon-dwelling beasts to the board game series.</p>

<h2>The Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons Announcement</h2>

<p>In a press release, Ravensburger provided more details on <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons. </em>As the name implies, the game will combine the core gameplay of the Horrified board game with the world's most popular TTRPG. This will be the fifth official entry in the <em>Horrified</em> series behind 2023's <em>Horrified: Greek Monsters</em> and 2021's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/horrified-american-monsters-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Horrified: American Monsters</em></a>.</p>

One of those monsters is the legendary Beholder, the many-eyed aberrations that have doomed many adventuring groups over the decades.</p>

<p>In addition, they will need to handle other game mechanics inspired by the RPG. Players will work together, encounter puzzle-like obstacles, gather item tokens, protect citizens, and avoid attacks. Also to immerse players into a detailed setting and story, each monster will have unique thematic challenges.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The extensive lore and world-building of D&amp;D enables players to embark on epic journeys as they quest to battle deadly foes, uncover secrets and make memories together,” said Dan Rawson, Senior Vice President, D&amp;D, RPG and Hasbro Direct at Wizards of the Coast. “Connection and storytelling are at the core of D&amp;D, and we’re always looking for new ways for players to immerse themselves in the fantasy realm. Bringing the franchise’s rich characters to something like Horrified, which features narrative-driven adventure and cooperative gameplay, just feels natural.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> will be available Summer 2025 at an MSRP of $29.99.</p>

And before we go any further, let me just be clear: Unless you have a spare Steam Deck to break open, don’t do this to your portable device. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Crastinator-Pro</a></span>, the impetus for creating the Steam Brick might not be what you expect. As explained on GitHub, the Steam Brick was created because the Steam Deck is too big to fit in Crastinator-Pro’s backpack. And since the Steam Deck was usually plugged into a TV or AR glasses when the modder was using it, they wondered how much smaller the device could be if it didn’t have a screen or built-in controls. To find out, they ripped one open and started gutting all the unneeded bits.</p><figure id="" data-id="007c6346bd87e729c0b84568dbcd07ad" data-recommend-id="image://007c6346bd87e729c0b84568dbcd07ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="007c6346bd87e729c0b84568dbcd07ad" data-recommend-id="image://007c6346bd87e729c0b84568dbcd07ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After some tinkering, the modder realized that they could remove all the inner boards and components related to the touch pads, analog sticks, buttons, and other controls and the Steam Deck would still work. They also removed the screen and any components and bits connected to it and it still worked. Next they printed out a small, basic plastic case and shoved what was left of the Steam Deck’s carcass into the box, sealed it up and added a USB port and power button and...there you go! A Steam Deck console.</p><p>Now, Crastinator-Pro makes it very clear that you probably shouldn’t do this yourself, calling it a “very bad idea” and further explaining that they were “honestly surprised” this worked. They say not to think of the GitHub post as a guide but instead as more of a “How I Did It” post. And while the end result works for the modder—they now have a tiny device they can toss in their backpack—they aren’t sure how long the Steam Brick will keep working after all the modifications. </p><p>If you’re really wanting a Steam console, don’t do this.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/everything-we-know-about-valves-fremont-console-and-rumored-steam-devices-2000536791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/everything-we-know-about-valves-fremont-console-and-rumored-steam-devices-2000536791"> Instead, just wait for Valve to make one</a></span>. Rumors are swirling that Valve is currently working on a TV-based device that will run SteamOS and will operate like a Steam Deck for your TV. That sounds safer than using power tools on a Steam Deck to make it smaller. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/phoenix-labs-layoffs-closure/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-50-more-employees-with-studio-likely-to-close.1093191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/phoenix-labs-layoffs-closure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The remainder of Phoenix Labs developers have been laid off, with the studios game ‘Dauntless’ and it’s studio likely to close.</p>



<p>Speaking with now past-employee’s at the studio, it’s understood that around 50 employees have been made redundant today. Several of those employee’s now believe that the Dauntless game is now dead, and that Phoenix Labs is likely to shut down, although Parent company Forte has yet to make such an announcement.</p>



<p>According to those familiar with the situation, no one at Phoenix Labs still has a job with one person saying it was “surprising” that it was announced as round of layoffs instead of a studio closure.</p>



<p>Forte, a blockchain company, acquired Phoenix Labs around summer 2023 and in May 2024 made more than 100 of its staff redundant. Forte was asked to comment, but did not supply one in time ahead of publication. </p>



<p>Following the internal announcement, Phoenix Labs staff took to their Dauntless Discord server to make the announcement of redundancies, where it was said that “Earlier today, the majority of our development team was impacted by significant reductions at Phoenix Labs. This has been a heartbreaking decision for us, and we are deeply saddened for the talented individuals who are affected.”</p>



<p>The statement continued, “We know you may have questions about what this means for Dauntless and its future. While we don’t have all the answers at this time, we are committed to keeping you informed and will share updates as soon as we can.”</p>



<p>“Your support means the world to us, and we are truly grateful for this incredible community. Thank you for standing with us during this challenging time,” it concluded.</p>



<p>Phoenix Labs was founded in April 2014 and is best known for Fae Farm and Dauntless, with the company also having had multiple games in development before being cancelled by Forte after the studios acquisition. </p>



<p>The latest rounds of layoffs put 2025’s count well over&nbsp;<a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">500 known jobs lost</a>, with estimates having it over 700.

                <p>Earlier this month, Larian Studios announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> will be receiving one last major update in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-introduces-cross-play-photo-mode-and-more/1100-6528863/" data-ref-id="1100-6528863">Patch 8</a>. And while select Baldur's Gate 3 players will be invited to a stress test for Patch 8, the update has been mistakenly released for some PlayStation 5 players ahead of the scheduled time. Larian confirmed the mistake in a post on social media.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1883903199687631144" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">No, the Patch 8 stress test hasn’t yet begun.<br>Yes, PS5 players do currently have access to Patch 8.<br>While we work with our partners to understand what’s going on, please note that any new saves made while on Patch 8 will not be compatible with Patch 7.<br>How’s your Monday going?</p>  — Larian Studios (@larianstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1883903199687631144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Larian subsequently shared <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/unintentional-ps5-update-and-how-to-return-to-patch-7_133" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a longer update about the situation</a>, which acknowledged that Patch 8 was mistakenly available for a few hours to PlayStation 5 players in Europe and Asia. The studio also warned that Patch 8 is not compatible with Patch 7, and urged players to uninstall and reinstall the game to return to the previous patch. Players who don't revert to Patch 7 may risk losing their saves.</p><p>Additionally, Larian indicated that receiving the Patch 8 by itself was not intended as an invitation to the stress test. Players who were selected to take part in that should receive a separate email--if they haven't gotten one already--and the Patch 8 stress test will go on as scheduled later this week.</p><p>Patch 8 will introduce cross-play between all consoles, PC, as well as a Photo Mode, in-game bug fixes, and mod improvements.

Here, the open-world RPG ostensibly improves its arguably disappointing technical performance and presentation issues on console by way of more powerful CPU and GPU combos available in the PC gaming world. It also launched as a Steam Deck-verified game, bolstering an alluring green checkmark on the Steam store page and even saw a promotional video from developer Square Enix touting Steam Deck playability with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/2kQnT3tADKw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/2kQnT3tADKw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a cute, feathery chocobo-themed Steam Deck</a></span>. But as many have found since release, while the game certainly “runs” on the Deck, it’s far from an ideal experience. This prompts two questions: Should you bother playing <em>Rebirth</em> on Steam Deck? And, perhaps most importantly, is this what we should expect from a “Verified” Steam Deck game?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196131" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="328" data-playlist="196131,195905,195189" data-current="196131"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21668.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’ve spent about half a dozen hours with <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> on Steam Deck, using the default settings (with one notable tweak to the framerate). I’ve played up to the Junon section, the game’s second open-world environment, as I felt this would take me through enough combat, exploration, dungeon crawling, and cutscenes to establish an opinion on how well (or poorly) this game runs on Valve’s handheld. </p><p>In motion, I’m averaging a decent-enough 30 frames per second, often a bit more as I lifted the 30 FPS cap in the default graphics settings (which sets all visuals to “Low” on first boot and doesn’t feature any AI upscaling tech). Performance will dip into the teens at worst from time to time (moreso when I tried nudging some graphics settings up to “Medium”). Overall, the experience reminds me of what it was like to play your average AAA game on the Xbox 360 or PS3 during the tail end of their lives: Playable, but it certainly left you wishing your gaming box had a bit more digital horsepower. (Though admittedly, even at their worst, PS3 games typically had cleaner image quality in comparison.) I seem to be getting about two-and-a-half hours of battery life, too.</p><p>At an average of 30-40 FPS, the performance might just be good enough for you. But unfortunately, the image quality really struggles. More often than not, the game looks like…well, it’s just ugly. Here, have a look: </p><figure id="" data-id="7cad40c8a31e6612b65b5a41ce4e7ac3" data-recommend-id="image://7cad40c8a31e6612b65b5a41ce4e7ac3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth shows Cloud standing in front of a chocobo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth shows Cloud standing in front of a chocobo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7cad40c8a31e6612b65b5a41ce4e7ac3" data-recommend-id="image://7cad40c8a31e6612b65b5a41ce4e7ac3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth shows Cloud standing in front of a chocobo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s not always this bad, mind you. Sometimes the game looks quite good for the form factor it’s running on. Have a look at a better shot:</p><figure id="" data-id="1a8709db17282172d822f5b2f5074328" data-recommend-id="image://1a8709db17282172d822f5b2f5074328" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Red XIII looks up at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Red XIII looks up at the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1a8709db17282172d822f5b2f5074328" data-recommend-id="image://1a8709db17282172d822f5b2f5074328" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Red XIII looks up at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But then you’ll move the camera and things will look fuzzy, jaggy, smeary, blurry, blocky, or whatever descriptive term you prefer. Draw distances look funky and dull, diminishing the bold natural beauty of the game’s world, which is unfortunate not just because it denies you the incredible visual spectacle the game is aiming for but also because that beauty has thematic meaning in-game: it is, after all, the beauty of the very in-game world the protagonists are fighting to save. On top of all this, I find the UI to be a bit too busy and small. And in <em>Rebirth</em>, you’ll spend quite a bit of time menu-diving as you spec out your characters.</p><p>Still, <em>Rebirth</em>’s somewhat reliable framerate performance on the Deck has kept me playing the game, and I’ll likely keep playing this way for a while as, right now, I’m just looking to dust off my rusty combat skills for a run at Hard Mode in the future (when I’ll almost certainly play the game on a more powerful machine). </p><figure id="" data-id="a2a06bd584e978699a40b10b7967587b" data-recommend-id="image://a2a06bd584e978699a40b10b7967587b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloud walks along a beam in the town of Kalm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cloud walks along a beam in the town of Kalm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a2a06bd584e978699a40b10b7967587b" data-recommend-id="image://a2a06bd584e978699a40b10b7967587b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloud walks along a beam in the town of Kalm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I find the game’s fusion of real-time fighting and command-based action in combat comes through well enough on the Steam Deck for me to keep going. In fact, given how much combat is in the game, and how much time you may wish to spend grinding the open world and Chadley’s training simulations, the Steam Deck version isn’t a bad portable companion to a proper PC experience, if you switch to that better hardware for the game’s more impactful narrative sequences. I could easily see myself grinding out some new weapon skills while playing on the train, only to switch over to my more powerful gaming machine to move the story along and enjoy those far better visuals once I get home.</p><p>If you travel a lot and have a high tolerance for visuals that range from “meh” to “oh, god,” the reliable performance of <em>Rebirth</em> on Deck might be a compromise you’re willing to make—especially if you’re an <em>FF7</em> super fan who will be won over by the story, music, and characters. </p><p>I do worry, however, about how well said performance will hold up across the rest of the game. Later combat sequences, such as one featuring multiple opponents in a large arena, or the more climactic, physically larger boss battles that feature way more flashy visual effects, could result in dips that might test your patience.</p><p>And despite being technically playable, <em>FF7 Rebirth</em>’s messy visuals yet again call into question what Valve is communicating by slapping the “Verified” green checkmark on a game. </p><h2 id="h3041"><a id=""></a>What should our expectations be for Steam Deck performance?</h2><p><em>Rebirth</em> isn’t the first game to usher in a conversation about whether or not Steam’s “Verified” status is as trustworthy as it should be. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/nLLiYXpFAHU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/nLLiYXpFAHU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023’s <em>Remnant II: From Ashes</em></a></span> brought up similar issues as it received a Verified status only to be a miserable experience for almost everyone who tried it on Valve’s portable gaming PC.</p><p>Valve has three tiers to indicate how playable a game is on Steam Deck. A white “no” sign with “Unsupported” means that the game most likely will not run on the Deck (though many Steam Deck users have found ways around this). This can be because the game is simply too graphically intensive, or something about it simply doesn’t play well with the Deck’s behind-the-scenes Linux magic that tricks Windows games into thinking they’re on Microsoft’s operating system. A yellow exclamation sign with “Playable” means that the game will almost certainly run, but either features text and icons that are just too small for the device’s screen or it’s a kind of game that really needs a full keyboard and mouse to enjoy. And then there’s the green checkmarked “Verified” status, which in theory should be an open invitation to enjoy the game on Steam Deck with no issues.</p><figure id="" data-id="e99beff2356bf7cdbd08fd05341ca97b" data-recommend-id="image://e99beff2356bf7cdbd08fd05341ca97b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith stand in the town of Under Junon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith stand in the town of Under Junon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e99beff2356bf7cdbd08fd05341ca97b" data-recommend-id="image://e99beff2356bf7cdbd08fd05341ca97b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith stand in the town of Under Junon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That said, most gamers with at least some knowledge of CPU and GPU limitations probably do (and should) expect compromise on something as portable on Steam Deck. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, for example, will run on Deck, but no reasonable person should expect it to do so with high graphics settings across the board and ray-tracing turned on. And while <em>2077</em> might run into some framerate troubles here and there on Deck, its visuals are way cleaner than what <em>Rebirth</em> offers on Valve’s mini-PC. During my time with <em>Rebirth</em> on Steam Deck, I also compared it to the visuals found on Kojima Productions’ <em>Death Stranding</em>, which immediately offered a stark contrast to <em>Rebirth</em>’s fuzziness with much clearer depictions of its landscapes and highly detailed character models.</p><figure id="" data-id="31cde9c7b3024610a2d92b9b18a73c9d" data-recommend-id="image://31cde9c7b3024610a2d92b9b18a73c9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam Porter Bridges carries a dead body in Death Stranding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sam Porter Bridges carries a dead body in Death Stranding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31cde9c7b3024610a2d92b9b18a73c9d" data-recommend-id="image://31cde9c7b3024610a2d92b9b18a73c9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam Porter Bridges carries a dead body in Death Stranding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If we are to accept <em>Rebirth</em> as being worthy of the Verified status on Steam Deck, it seems clear that this is the very minimum of what we should consider acceptable, and such games should leave us asking just what kind of “Verified” a given game might be when we choose to purchase it. Why couldn’t <em>Rebirth</em> have been awarded “Playable” status instead? To many, including myself, that would be a more accurate description and is certainly how I’d describe <em>Rebirth</em>’s portable experience. Then again, without that Verified status, Square Enix wouldn’t be able to advertise the game as such and Valve would have one less AAA title to proudly display as Verified on their popular device. It’s hard not to worry that “Verified” status can play too much of a marketing role for all parties involved when ideally, it should perhaps be a more scientific, objective assessment of what any given game is like on the Deck.</p><figure id="" data-id="6675bba95ac88cca3374297a69240123" data-recommend-id="image://6675bba95ac88cca3374297a69240123" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chocobos stand in Junon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chocobos stand in Junon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6675bba95ac88cca3374297a69240123" data-recommend-id="image://6675bba95ac88cca3374297a69240123" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chocobos stand in Junon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-13/playstation-5-pro-shows-futility-of-video-game-graphics-race&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-13/playstation-5-pro-shows-futility-of-video-game-graphics-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video game graphics</a></span> in general have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/arts/video-games-graphics-budgets.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/arts/video-games-graphics-budgets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an increasingly complicated subject</a></span> of late.

<strong>UPDATE 8pm:</strong> Following the unintentional release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s upcoming Patch 8 on PS5, Larian has provided additional details and a recommended fix for affected players.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/unintentional-ps5-update-and-how-to-return-to-patch-7_133">post on the Baldur's Gate 3 website</a>, Larian offered more context for today's error, explaining, "Our partners have confirmed that some regions mistakenly received the Patch 8 build as an update to their live game version, in preparation for the Patch 8 stress test." The update, it said, was "only accessible for a few hours" and is no longer available.
</p>
<p>
For those that <em>did</em> receive today's download, Larian warns this version is unsupported and won't be updated until after the stress test, when Patch 8 is ready for its full release. It also notes affected players will likely experience compatibility issues with mods, and won't be able to access multiplayer when attempting to join users on Patch 7. As such, it recommends reverting to Patch 7 by uninstalling and reinstalling Baldur’s Gate 3.

<p>
Unfortunately, the studio also confirms saves made with Patch 8 installed won't be compatible with Patch 7, and it "cannot guarantee saves made in this version will remain compatible when Patch 8 is released." As such, players will need to return to an earlier save if reverting to Patch 7.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the studio notes players that received today's unintentional update aren't necessarily guaranteed access to the stress test. The test itself is due to begin this week, with invites going out to successful applicants in waves.

<p>
<strong>ORIGINAL STORY 6.45pm:</strong> Baldur's Gate 3's eagerly awaited Patch 8 is now live on PlayStation 5 - which has seemingly left developer Larian Studios a little perplexed, seeing as it definitely shouldn't be.
</p>
<p>
Patch 8, officially Baldur's Gate 3's final content update, isn't due to arrive until Larian has held its upcoming closed stress test. As such, Baldur's Gate 3 players on PlayStation 5 were more than a little surprised to see the game update to version 1.800.00 earlier today - and it turns out the studio was equally caught offguard by this turn of events.
</p><p>"No, the Patch 8 stress test hasn't yet begun," it confirmed in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/larianstudios.com/post/3lgqbpk3knc26">quietly exasperated post on Bluesky</a>. "Yes, PS5 players do currently have access to Patch 8. While we work with our partners to understand what's going on, please note that any new saves made while on Patch 8 will not be compatible with Patch 7... How's your Monday going?".
</p>
<p>
Patch 8 might be Baldur's Gate 3's final major content update, but it's still a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-new-subclasses-cross-play-and-more-next-year">big one</a>, introducing 12 new sub-classes, cross-play, new camera features, and more. Given its scope, Larian previously explained it would be holding a pre-launch stress test in order to "help us catch things before they can become an issue once a patch has been released."
</p>
<p>
As such, Patch 8's premature launch on PlayStation 5 clearly isn't an ideal situation, saddling players with a version of the game that isn't yet ready for release, while putting the studio in a potentially tricky situation - seeing as reverting Baldur's Gate 3 to an earlier version could leave PS5 players with non-functional saves. We've asked Larian for comment.
</p>
<p>
Despite today's Patch 8 snafu, Baldur's Gate 3's stress test - which doesn't yet have a start date - is still on the horizon, and registrations <a href="https://larian.com/stress-test-register">remain open</a>. And for those players on other platforms who don't yet have access, there's always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-gives-baldurs-gate-3s-withers-a-pair-of-big-naturals-to-celebrate-100m-mod-downloads">Withers "big naturals"</a> to keep them amused.

<p>Intel is one of the largest computer technology companies in the world. When it comes to consumer CPUs, it’s often in a neck-and-neck battle with competitor AMD for the processor market. </p>



<p>Because of that, Intel’s earnings reports are closely watched by investors, analysts, and consumers alike. That makes it important to know when the next one is, what time it starts, and how you can listen to it live. These quarterly updates provide insights into a company’s financial health, performance across key divisions, and general outlooks for the months ahead. </p>



<p>What is the health of Intel’s business? What are investors looking for in terms of revenue? Are there any concerns or roadblocks in various sectors? All that gets answered with each call.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-intel-earnings-report-date">When Is The Next Intel Earnings Report Date?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/intel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intel</a> is currently scheduled to deliver its fourth quarter (Q4) earnings for fiscal year (FY) 2024 on Thursday, January 30.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some companies run an April-March fiscal year, Intel’s fiscal year goes from January to December, and ends on the last Saturday of the month. That means its fiscal year ended on Saturday, December 28th. The company’s quarters are structured as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Q1: January – March</li>



<li>Q2: April – June</li>



<li>Q3: July – September</li>



<li>Q4: October – December</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-next-intel-earnings-report-start-time">Next Intel Earnings Report Start Time</h2>



<p>The next Intel earnings report is scheduled to start after trading closes for the day at 5PM ET/2PM PT on January 30, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-listen-to-intel-s-earnings-report">How To Listen To Intel’s Earnings Report?</h2>



<p>If you want to listen to Intel’s quarterly earnings report—or just look over the numbers—you can do so via the company’s website. Simply do the following:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to Intel’s <a href="https://www.intc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Investor Relations webpage</a> </li>



<li>In the hero section, there will be an option to select “Webcast”</li>



<li>If you want specific financial results, hover over (or select if on mobile) “Financial Info” in the menu bar</li>



<li>Then select “Financial Results”</li>



<li>This will take you to a page with recent earnings calls, presentations, infographics, remarks, and more.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you want more than just the most recent earnings call and data, the “Financial Results” page will have a catalog of the reports from past years, going back—as of writing—as far as 2002.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-intel">What To Expect From Intel</h2>



<p>When Intel releases its latest earnings, it will provide a number of updates on the state of the overall business. Details such as where things stand with its restructuring efforts, early returns from the release of its new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-core-ultra-9-285k-review-a-new-era-for-efficiency-but-is-it-right-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Core Ultra S CPUs</a>, the launch of its Intel Arc <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/intel-battlemage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlemage graphics cards</a>, its growth in the AI space, and more will be discussed.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-intel-earnings-report">The Last Intel Earnings Report</h2>



<p>When Intel announced its earnings for Q3 FY2024, it announced that it’s year-over-year net revenue fell by 6.17% to $13.28 billion from $14.16 billion. Intel said that the decline in revenue was due to restructuring costs after laying off 15% of its global workforce along with more investments into different areas of research and development.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-company-earnings-calls">What Are Company Earnings Calls?</h2>



<p>Quarterly earnings calls are meetings held publicly traded companies to provide updates on their overall financial performance. Typically, these calls are open to shareholders, analysts, and media to call in and ask questions. The public, regardless if they’re a shareholder or not, is also able to listen to these calls live as they happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the calls themselves, companies will often put out a press release and presentation with important details included ahead of the call taking place. This allows investors, analysts, and media to prepare coverage or questions based on the information provided.</p>

                <p>Nvidia remains one of the world's largest companies by market cap, but the chip-maker is having a tough day on the stock market today. The company's share price slid by nearly 17% today, wiping out more than $500 billion in market cap. Should this hold through the end of the trading day, it would be far and away the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/01/27/biggest-market-loss-in-history-nvidia-stock-plunges-15-as-deepseek-shakes-ai-darling/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">biggest single-day trading loss for a company in history</a>. Nvidia's previous $279 billion one-day dip is the existing record-holder.</p><p>Why is Nvidia stock tanking? The stock price had been surging for the past two years as investors felt bullish on the company's fortunes due to excitement in the market about artificial intelligence. Nvidia sells the necessary GPUs to train large-language models and for general AI use, after all.</p><p>But at the end of last week, Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek launched a new model, R1, that the company claims is far cheaper than other models out there, including Open AI's o1. The fear from investors, it seems, is that AI companies may not actually require as much computing power as it was once believed. This, in turn, could have spooked investors and sent Nvidia's stock price down.</p><p>Some of Nvidia's rivals in the AI space, including Arm and Broadcom, also saw their share prices slump on Monday. Stock prices regularly move, sometimes dramatically so, in response to relevant market announcements.</p><p>DeepSeek is not new, but instead was founded after a spin-out from hedge fund High-Flyer in 2023. <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-LLM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DeepSeek's own paper</a> said its R1 model was trained for a cost of about $5.6 million, which is just a small percentage of what OpenAI and others are said to have spent on their systems. Because DeepSeek's systems have made strides in <em>software</em>, they could be less reliant on <em>hardware</em> like the GPUs that Nvidia sells, and some experts believe DeepSeek might signal a sea-change in the AI landscape.</p><p>The emergence of DeepSeek's new model comes not long after President Trump announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure program, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-ai-openai-oracle-softbank-son-altman-ellison-be261f8a8ee07a0623d4170397348c41" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stargate</a>, led by investments from OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. At least some of that appears to consist of existing investments that were previously announced.</p><p><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/01/27/chinas-deepseek-ai-model-shocks-world-sell-nvidia/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">As Motley Fool points out</a>, there are some that believe DeepSeek is not being totally honest in explaining the true costs of its systems. AI researcher Nathan Lampert estimates DeepSeek's true training costs as being as high as $1 billion. Other AI experts, like Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, believe DeepSeek and others actually have more Nvidia chips than they may be allowed to disclose given export rules.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/MorningBrew/status/1883901050010395123" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">From last week: Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang says that DeepSeek and other Chinese AI labs have more Nvidia chips than they can talk about because of current US export controls <a href="https://t.co/tPzmdEvvik" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/tPzmdEvvik</a></p>  — Morning Brew ☕️ (@MorningBrew) <a href="https://twitter.com/MorningBrew/status/1883901050010395123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The launch of DeepSeek hasn't gone totally smoothly for the company. <a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/sign_in" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DeepSeek's own website</a> states that it's facing "large-scale malicious attacks" on its services just days after releasing.</p><p>Nvidia is the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 3 company worldwide based on market cap</a>, only trailing behind Apple and Microsoft.

		<p>Ubisoft has announced a round of layoffs, cutting 185 jobs from across its European studios, and closing one studio down completely.</p>
<p>UK-based Ubisoft Leamington is being shut down, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">Eurogamer reporting</a> that almost all of its 50 team members are being laid off. Beyond that, there’s also “targeted restructuring” that will affect Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections.</p>


<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-cuts-185-jobs-in-a-bid-to-prioritise-projects-and-reduce-costs">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, a Ubisoft spokesperson said:</p>
<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to prioritise projects and reduce costs that ensure long-term stability at Ubisoft, we have announced targeted restructurings at Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections and the permanent closure of Ubisoft Leamington site.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this should impact 185 employees overall. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this transition.</p>

<p>The news comes less than two months after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">Ubisoft announced the closure of XDefiant</a>, laying off team members from San Francisco, Sydeny and Osaka.</p>
<p>There’s no end in sight, it seems, for the struggles being faced across the industry. Earlier this month a Transformers game was cancelled, affecting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/08/transformers-reactivate-has-been-cancelled-staff-to-be-laid-off/">Splash Damage</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/people-can-fly-suspend-project-and-layoff-120-employees/">People Can Fly also laid off 120 in December</a> after a project cancellation.</p>
<p>As always, our thoughts are with those affected by these layoffs, and we hope they can find new work soon.</p>

Games and Avalanche Software have confirmed plans to launch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy"><u>Hogwarts Legacy</u></a> mod support for PC, opening the floodgates for players to add whatever their hearts desire to the Harry Potter video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team announced the addition with a special video presentation, below, revealing a release date of January 30, 2025 for a free update that includes the highly requested feature. It’ll only be for PC for now, with the team sharing no news about when or if players can expect to see modding come to consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve made it easy for everyone. It’s all simplified with official tools provided by us,” Avalanche community manager Chandler Wood said. “For mod creators, you’ll be able to get the official Hogwarts Legacy creator kit, free on the Epic Games Store. The creator kit provides powerful tools right at your fingertips, allowing you to flex your inner developer like the ones here at Avalanche and conjure the magic with custom mods that other players can enjoy, too.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hogwarts Legacy mods will almost certainly devolve into chaos immediately as players rush to add Shrek, Thomas the Tank Engine, and more nonsense to the open-world Harry Potter game. Thankfully, Avalanche is here to help fans get a head start. The studio said it’s been working with members of the community to make a few mods available on day one, including creative broom options like dragons and a vacuum cleaner as well as unique cosmetics, an endless dungeon experience to test your combat skills, and a magical creature fetch quest. More community-generated content will no doubt appear in the months ahead, giving players more than enough content to keep them busy as Avalanche looks ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hogwarts Legacy launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S in February 2023, with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions following in May and the Nintendo Switch version following in November. That means it’ll celebrate its two-year anniversary next month with full-on mod support, but the free update is far from the only post-launch support the project has received since it arrived.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year alone saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-will-soon-give-all-players-access-to-playstation-exclusive-content"><u>previously PlayStation-exclusive content coming to other platforms</u></a> as part of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-update-adds-photo-mode-hogsmeade-quest-and-more-next-week"><u>summer update</u></a> that also added photo mode, new cosmetics, and more. Hogwarts Legacy has sold an incredible 30 million units as of November 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for mod support to drop, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-video-game-sequel-hogwarts-legacy-2-one-of-the-biggest-priorities-at-warner-bros"><u>why Avalanche says Hogwarts Legacy 2 is one of its “biggest priorities.”</u></a> You can also see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-coordinating-big-picture-storytelling-with-harry-potter-tv-show-storylines"><u>how the sequel may share a few elements with the upcoming Harry Potter TV show</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-issues-warning-against-cheating-ahead-of-trading-feature-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> is warning players of the consequences for cheating, just ahead of the expected release of in-game trading later this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an announcement pushed to the app yesterday, players were warned about violations of the Terms of Service that specifically relate to cheating:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are aware that some players have engaged in data tampering, real money trading, and other behaviors that violate the Terms of Use," reads the in-game notice. "If we confirm that a player has engaged in behavior that violates the Terms of Use, we will warn them, suspend their account, or take other action."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">No further details were offered as to what behaviors, specifically, are being targeted. Players on r/PTCGP have been speculating that this warning is related to a few different behaviors. One of these, referred to as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ib23b8/wonder_pick_farming_is_definitely_part_of_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wonder Pick Farming</a>, is a practice where individuals mass-create new accounts to take advantage of the many free packs available for new players, and try to roll a "god pack," or a super rare pack of cards with five very rare cards. Then, they offer their friend code to others for money, so that buyers can add them as friends and then see the "god pack" in the game's Wonder Pick function and be guaranteed a very rare card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another behavior speculated to be the target of a crackdown is a practice where players will grind accounts to level 50 with plenty of banked currency by participating in PvP battles over and over, using the game's timeout function to stall games until the opponent concedes so they can win repeatedly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, it's possible that the warning was simply published because of the game's upcoming trading feature release, which could potentially kickstart a new wave of inappropriate behavior, especially where "real money trading" is concerned. The trading feature, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-trading-unveiled-but-is-so-poorly-received-the-developers-had-to-respond">which was panned by fans upon announcement</a>, allows players to trade cards of one star rarity and below with friends. Players have expressed frustration with both the rarity limit on trading, as well as the need to spend some sort of currency to make the trade happen in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The feature is planned to go live later this week on January 29, alongside the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pockets-next-set-is-a-diamond-and-pearl-themed-booster-called-space-time-smackdown">new expansion Space-Time Smackdown</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

		<p>Rockfish has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/everspace-2">Everspace 2</a>: Wrath of the Ancients, a major expansion to their space adventure that adds a new post-game story, more star systems, side quests and more when it launches for PlayStation, Xbox and PC this summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="EVERSPACE 2 | Wrath of the Ancients — Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jij3a23hx3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Apparently the community has bugged Rockfish about the Aethon system long enough – to be fair, Rockfish were the ones teasing it – but Aethon will be just one star system within this expansion, in which you’ll explore several star systems from the Okkar civilization.</p>
<p>But who are the Okkar? Well, they’re an emerging faction appearing just as attacks using weapons from the Ancients have sparked a fresh conflict in Cluster 34, using these attacks ostensibly by the Ancients as justification for their own possible hostilities. You and your crew have to head to the Okkar Homeworlds to try and defuse the situation.</p>
<p>This expansion will push the game’s lore ahead, but it will also bring new twists to the combat. You’ll be able to snag an Okkar Wraith ship and use it’s various new abilities against challenging new enemies. Existing ships will also be compatible with the new weapons and gear, including new upgradable Okkar equipment – more details on those at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Everspace 2 was a big change from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/03/18/everspace-stellar-edition-review/">the original game</a>. That had been a roguelike space adventure, but the sequel morphed into a more traditional narrative led space shooter. We loved the change, with Ade saying in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/27/everspace-2-review/">Everspace 2 review</a>, “I started Everspace 2 deeply unsure about a space looter shooter. Tens of hours later I don’t want to play anything else. Everspace 2 is a towering achievement of space-based thrills and spills. It absolutely deserves your attention.”</p>

			<p>Today, Techland <a href="https://youtu.be/CvqFjEILJao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> many announcements as part of its celebrations for the tenth anniversary of the Dying Light franchise. Firstly, the numbers: over 45 million users have played either the first or the second game in the first-person open-world zombie series that originally debuted in 2015, an increase of 15 million since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-franchise-sold-30-million-copies-to-date-techland-busy-on-new-open-world-fantasy-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous announcement from two years ago</a>. During this decade, they have racked up 67 billion zombie kills and over 1 billion hours of total playtime.</p>
<p>To commemorate the tenth anniversary, the first and second games will feature a series of events over four weeks. In the first week, Dying Light will get HyperMode with a double XP bonus, while the sequel will enjoy the biggest discount ever (up to 67%, depending on the platform and region). In the following weeks, the original game will be refreshed with the Low Gravity, Super-Crane, and Viral Rush events, while Dying Light 2 players will be able to take advantage of new bounties via the Pilgrim Outpost website. In the fourth week, the sequel is also finally receiving the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-tower-raid-open-beta-is-out-now-introducing-a-brand-new-co-op-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tower Raid cooperative roguelike mode</a> as a permanent addition to the game, following several playtest rounds.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/10th-Anniversary-celebration-roadmap-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg revealed today for the franchise. The first Dying Light will soon receive a new patch that improves visuals and adds a remastered soundtrack with new music from the original composer Paweł Błaszczak. Of course, most of the content is coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-2-stay-human-apocalypse-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light 2 Stay Human</a>, which is roughly in the middle of its promised five-year post-launch support. The updated roadmap for 2025 shows co-op gameplay and matchmaking improvements, new playable Tower Raid characters, improved Community Maps support, new firearms and melee weapons, an entirely new weapon class, improvements to the Prologue, graphical and technical improvements, and, of course, free gear and outfits.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Dying-Light-2025-Roadmap-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>That's still not everything Techland talked about today. The Polish developer confirmed they've got <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, which will mark the return of original game protagonist Kyle Crane, slated for the Summer season. Moreover, there are some unannounced Dying Light projects in the works, as well as new board games, exclusive merchandise, and an original webcomic series.</p>

			<p>Today, Hazelight released a new trailer for Split Fiction, a title that was announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/split-fiction-announced-at-the-game-awards-releases-march-6-2025/">The Game Awards</a>. This is the new game coming from the ambitious studio that made It Takes Two. This game is set to push the boundaries of a co-op adventure, where players can jump between sci-fi and fantasy worlds while exploring their own side stories in a journey of discovery. If you want to see the new trailer for Split Fiction, you can find it down below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | Official Co-op Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TlySOphMuo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As you get glimpses into the story, Josef Fares, the founder of Hazelight walks you through the co-op scenarios that you can participate in and the varying gameplay that you'll get to experience. In addition to the co-op gameplay that you'll get to see in Split Fiction, the trailer also talks about a special feature called Side Stories. These are one-off adventures that you can do that are hidden throughout the main story levels, providing a shake-up to the mechanics and allowing you to learn more about the personalities and stories of Mio and Zoe.</p>
<p>As explained in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/an-introduction-to-side-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> on the EA website, Side Stories happen as a result of Mio and Zoe being stuck in the same simulation. The portals that appear are attempts to steal Mio and Zoe's unfinished stories from when they were younger. As a result, this leads to a lot of wacky situations that they will get to traverse together. These include riding Sandfish across a desert and performing tricks while under heavy fire. Others include becoming pigs and finding out how sausages are made. With these Side Stories, it's set to provide a lot of laughs and questionable moments as you get to explore the game.</p>
<p>Much like A Way Out and It Takes Two, Hazelight Studios' has promised that the Friend's Pass will be back for Split Fiction, too. This means that one player who owns the game can invite a friend to play the game for free. In addition, Hazelight also has plans to add crossplay, allowing friends to play across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on March 6, 2025. The game will be priced at $49.99.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Split Fiction when it releases? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>
In regular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon 2</a>, your mind, body and soul are fixed upon the points of a horrible mountain, looming over the inn at the end of every foetid wagon ride. It's sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/journey">Journey</a> for plague doctors, or possibly <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hobbit">The Hobbit</a>: Cosmodick Turpin Edition. I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it's nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that's launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  
</p>
<p>
Over <em>here</em> is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over <em>there</em> is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

I spent around an hour with Kingdoms today ahead of launch, and while I'm not sure it'll rejuvenate your interest if you're absolutely sick of Darkest Dungeon 2, it feels well-wrought. Briefly, it's a turn-based digital boardgame with a worker placement element, in which you travel back and forth between upgradeable inns to stave off sieges and complete quest objectives in the face of an escalating threat. It begins with a choice of layouts and difficulty settings (see below). Then you compose a starting party at the Crossroads and set off through a relatively laidback borderlands region, as in vanilla Donkey's Dingdong 2.

<p>
Having reached and liberated the inn at the end of that trail, you're cut loose upon the full playing board. Pretty much every turn, at least one of the map's inns comes under siege from dark forces (that's the berserking Beastmen at first, with other factions to be unlocked). It'll fall in a handful of turns, depending on how much you've strengthened it using construction resources gathered on the road. You can rumble over to assist the inn, which means surviving any hazards enroute, or you can send one of the supporting heroes you've stationed at other inns to rally the defenders and drag out the siege. 
</p><p>
The trips between map nodes are similar to the regions of the main game - you steer your stagecoach with WASD according to a murky minimap, attempting to siphon loot from roadside nasties without stressing or damaging your heroes too much - but the paths between inns seem much shorter, with fewer branches, encounters and bosses. </p>
<p>This is compensated by the fact that you might have to string together a few regional runs to reach your destination. Some roads lead to campsites, which afford you rest but don't offer progression facilities or protection against nocturnal ambush. There's also what I think is a new fatigue mechanic that lowers hero max health based on how far they've travelled. As such, you'll want to shuffle people out of your hand now and then, stationing exhausted party members at inns to recuperate.</p>
<p>In amongst all this, you'll need to complete those quest objectives before all the inns fall and the map's threat level becomes unmanageable. During my opening game, this started with transporting a telescope to a watchtower so that I could map out the Beastfolk menace.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
The ability to leave heroes at the inn together with the campsites recalls the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>'s town/dungeon format, but this isn't just a DD1 mode within DD2, obviously. It reminds me more of the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/armello">Armello</a>, in that you have some pervading strategic capacity but are fundamentally lost within a large, weird world.
</p><p>
The Kingdoms map has all of Red Hook's usual thickly etched floridity, but I could do with, dare I say, a bit more illumination. I'm not asking for Dirkest Dragon to suddenly come over all Wind Waker, but after hundreds of hours in this setting, I'm ready for some refreshed presentation. IDK. What would a Lightest Dungeon look like? How would you maintain the essential dungeoniness in a universe without shadow? It's a deeply perverse question, and one I will therefore be asking Red Hook as and when they fail to avoid encountering me at an expo.

I've enjoyed what I've played of Kingdoms. If you don't, the better news is that it's launching alongside a new regular (paid) Darkest Dungeon 2 DLC pack, Inhuman Bondage. This adds the underground Catacombs region and a new hero, the Abomination, whose air of self-loathing and Hulkish tendencies you may again recognise from Darkest Dungeon 1. The OG Abomination was one of my favourites. He's pretty reliable even in sulky human form, chain-whipping skulls and spewing gastric juices from the midline. Mind you, I would always overdo it with his monster transformations and cause another party member to freak out. I'm not sure how the DD2 incarnation differs.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Inhuman Bondage additions will also be available in Kingdoms. I haven't encountered them yet myself, but there are underground shortcuts to discover between certain inns, and I imagine that's where you'll get your fill of Catacombing.
</p>
<p>
What's next for Dankest Sturgeons? Anything and everything and nothing and something. "We've spent over a decade working on Darkest Dungeon," the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1940340/view/503940938959159876?l=english">write on Steam</a>. "We've delighted in our explorations and iterations, and we're nowhere near done."

		<p>First of all, congratulations to Austin's Eagles. </p><p><em>Please</em> go beat the damn Chiefs.</p><p>I am writing this wondering if danger is on the horizon. This morning, my four-year-old woke up with a sniffle. She seemed fine otherwise—but you never know. It's a dangerous time of year to be a parent, where those pesky germs are always afoot. I recently joked to my wife that we're due to get sick—we have dodged everything that's taken down our kids this winter season—but I'm crossing my fingers, folks!</p><p>-pk, who cannot believe how boring <em>Gladiator 2</em> was, what the heck</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Interview</em> — Ah, this one is a delight. I'm glad this game together, and hope we have Chris on in the future, as well. When Chris got on the call, he started by saying some version of "Ah, man, I'm sorry" and I was confused on why. Turns out I've tuned out so much of the early Trump bullshit that I wasn't even aware that I'd booked a recording time with the inauguration that was happening at the same time moment. I preferred this version of events, even if we were also talking about a lot of awful things here, too.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>New on Steam</em> – We'll probably change the title of this, but I experimented with this idea recently, where there is <em>so much stuff</em> added to Steam on a daily basis—and so much goes unnoticed. Yes, a lot of it isn't very good and <em>a shocking amount</em> is porn, but my hope is that we can find some diamonds hidden about. Join us as we scroll through Steam and find games!</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Remap Recommends</em> – It's the end of the month, which means we'll run through some of the games that have stuck around our brains.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Motorsports Manager</em> – Once more, into the racing breach.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – Yep, we're doing a third GOTY pod. My hope is that half of the podcast will also be a normal Remap Radio podcast. Stay tuned!</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – There will be words exchanged between myself and Rob. I need to figure out what the idea is for this week. This is also...stay tuned!</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
