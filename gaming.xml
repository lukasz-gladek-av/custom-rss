		<p>Warner Bros. is holding up the cartoon white flag and saying “That’s all Folks!” to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>, with support for the character-filled brawler coming to an end after Season 5 on 30th May 2025. On that date, the game will be removed from online stores and servers will be shut down, but it will still be playable offline.</p>
<p>All online features will run up until 30th May at 9AM PST (5PM UK time), after which point the game will be playable offline only, with solo AI battles or couch multiplayer with up to four players.</p>


<p>In order to keep the game accessible, you must play and log in at some time during Season 5 – from 4th February to 30th May – which will create the necessary save file and online account links to allow you to play offline with all earned and purchased content.</p>
<p>As a precursor to the game’s shutdown, real money purchases have been taken down from today. You can no longer purchase Gleamium, though it and character tokens can be used through to the server shutdown.</p>
<p>For more information, you can visit the <a href="https://go.wbgames.com/MVSFAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MultiVersus Season 5 FAQ.</a></p>

<p>The MultiVersus team at Player First Games wrote a little thank you at the end of the announcement:</p>
<p>Most importantly, we want to thank every player and person who has ever played or supported MultiVersus. All of us on the Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games teams have poured our heart and soul into this game. We will be forever grateful for the incredible support of the MultiVersus community throughout this journey.​</p>
<p>&nbsp;​We hope that you all enjoy the final Season of MultiVersus.</p>
<p>MultiVersus burst onto the scene in 2022, offering a Super Smash Bros. contender filled with characters drawn from across the Warner Bros. media empire. However, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/27/multiversus-open-beta-already-smashing-steam-records/">after an initial surge of popularity for the open beta</a>, the rapidly growing community started to highlight gameplay deficiencies and developer Player First Games struggled to keep up, while also producing all the regular content that a free-to-play live service needs.</p>
<p>So the game was pulled from storefronts, instead of trying to roll through to a full release, and only reappeared last year.&nbsp;While the revamp has certainly benefitted MultiVersus in some respects, Miguel wasn’t overly enamoured by the game’s return last month <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/multiversus-2024-preview-back-but-is-it-better/">in his write-up</a>. On one hand some of the game’s rough edges have been rounded off and the inclusion of singleplayer/co-op content helps bolster the overall MultiVersus package. However, the reduced tempo of combat has proven divisive and when it comes to monetisation, the game is no less aggressive.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. admitted in financial reports that MultiVersus’ revival had underperformed expectations, so alongside <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/">the end of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, the writing was on the wall.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping Player First Games get the opportunity to craft something new and fun.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/games-market-to-grow-by-4-6-in-line-with-inflation-boosted-by-gta-6-civ-7-midia-research-reports/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's not been a secret that the games market has been struggling for a while now, with there being constant layoffs and studio closures all across the globe, whether it be from people not playing the games, not wanting them, or just simply being unable to afford them. It's becoming increasingly common that games are getting more expensive, meaning people may not be able to find the money to purchase them, especially in a cost-of-living crisis. Despite these factors, it's been said that the games market will grow by 4.6% in one with inflation. This information comes from <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MiDiA Research</a>'s Global Games Forecasts.</p>
<p>One of the key points that is mentioned is that the games market is mature, so it is highly unlikely that it will ever experience double-digit growth, and instead, the industry will only see slight growth during this period. It's also estimated that software revenues will continue to grow thanks to massive premium releases coming out this year. This includes Grand Theft Auto 6, Monster Hunter Wilds, and the games that will be released for the Nintendo Switch 2 when that inevitably releases.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, there are a ton of live-service games, with major developers deciding to try their luck with live-service games and not having the expected outcome. This has happened with multiple titles, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">Concord</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/">MultiVersus</a>. However, it's predicted that instead of developing live-service games, developers will go back to premium games, with in-game spending decreasing to 67% near 2031.</p>
<p>"It is time to say goodbye to "survive 'til 25" and hello to "stick 'til 26" and beyond, but with tempered expectations for future growth in this mature market. The market (again, also including hardware, software, and subscriptions) will grow from $236.9 billion in 2025 to $280.1 billion in 2031," says Rhys Elliott, Games Analyst at MiDiA Research.</p>
<p>While there will always be a debate within the gaming community about whether mobile gaming makes you a gamer, mobile continues to do a significant amount of lifting for software revenue, with 54% of all software revenue coming from mobile games. The significant premium games being released this year will also be a huge boost for revenue, especially with games like Monster Hunter Wilds, Civilization VII, and Assassin's Creed Shadows all being released in Q1.</p>
<p>"Things will continue to be difficult in the games market, and these challenging market conditions mean developers are being forced to think smarter to succeed. Luckily, the industry is teeming with some of the smartest, most creative, and passionate minds in the world," says Elliott.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since James Gunn became the new boss of DC studios, it feels like he sticks to one formula: everything looks like his Suicide Squad.&nbsp;</p><p>2008, the year of the housing crisis and the subsequent Great Recession, is as good a time of death as any for the fiction of the American Dream. Economic forces manipulated by kleptocrats have completely unbalanced our received wisdom that anyone, regardless of their station and prestige, was afforded the opportunity to rise to success. But you can’t really kill a dream in America; you can only commodify it. That same year, the American Dream was reborn, repurposed, and repackaged by corporate America. Not for people, but for a new promise that any <em>property, </em>afforded the opportunity, could rise to prominence.&nbsp;</p><p>Marvel Studios’ “Avengers Initiative” was a project built from necessity. Facing bankruptcy in the 90s, Stan Lee and pals found themselves selling off the film rights to their most successful characters<em>—</em>Spider-Man, X-Men, the Fantastic Four<em>—</em>just to stay afloat. All they were left with once they had the chance to make a go of it themselves were the B-Stringers: an alcoholic tech bro, an Allied Propaganda mascot, a technically public domain anyway Norse god, a Hulk. To everyone’s multi-billion dollar surprise, they made it work. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They made it work so well that it kind of ruined movies.</a> But, significantly, it defeated the conventional comic book movie wisdom that to make a huge runaway hit, you needed a Superman or a Batman. Maybe you could build your empire on some weird little freak nobody’s even heard of. But how weird, how freaky, can we really get here?</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>James Gunn became one of the most successful men in Hollywood today answering that question. Coming up with the proudly sophomoric and sloppy underdogs of Troma Entertainment (think <em>Toxic Avenger</em>), he made his studio bones on a couple pretty decent <em>Scooby-Doo </em>movies, and proved his superhero bona fides on the pitch black Rainn Wilson and Elliot Page comedy <em>Super, </em>which does a better job of being a <em>Watchmen </em>movie than Zack Snyder’s <em>Watchmen</em>. So it was only a matter of time before Marvel Cinematic Universe mastermind Kevin Feige, known so well today for his modus operandi of taking promising, unique independent filmmakers and chaining them like Prometheus to his studio system, tapped him to make something Marvel.&nbsp;</p><p>Feige had been talking in public about adapting the rather obscure ragtag Marvel space heroes, the “Guardians of the Galaxy,” since at least 2010 during that year’s San Diego Comic-Con. Though the team had existed in some form or another since 1969, the version of the team that Feige was interested in—the one we’d see at the movies—was brand new. The Guardians as we know them, Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket Raccoon, didn’t actually exist as a team anywhere until 2008, in a series relaunch by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. No stranger to working as the underdog, it was just the project where James Gunn would thrive.</p><p>How DC got their hand on that ball was a matter of some cancel culture serendipity. During the space between the second and third <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>movies, <a href="https://deadline.com/2018/07/james-gunn-fired-guardians-of-the-galaxy-disney-offensive-tweets-1202430392/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some outrageously tasteless tweets</a> James Gunn wrote ten years prior resurfaced. Disney, the owners of the Marvel Studios brand since 2009, cut ties with Gunn over it for about a week<em>—</em>just long enough for DC’s own parent company, Warner Bros., to swoop in with their own Guardians-caliber offer. But who were DC’s equivalent to Marvel’s scrappy Guardians of the Galaxy?</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="THE SUICIDE SQUAD – Official Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jz1FrtMIh5c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That was was a puzzle DC had already solved, poorly but accurately, with the Academy Award winning 2016 <em>Suicide Squad </em>(Best Makeup and Hairstyling). The influences Gunn had on what Warner Bros. wanted their Suicide Squad to be were apparent to anyone with eyes, ears, or a short term memory: the needle dropping soundtrack, the gleeful gore, the often puerile comedy. But without Gunn himself, the film had none of the heart, or sense of character. Unlike the Guardians, the Squad as we know them today—give or take a Harley—has existed with its current premise since 1986. And as fortune would have it, they’re even better suited to Feige’s original hail mary casting of the Guardians for unleashing the spigot on that IP-flowing fountain. Because that’s exactly what they were designed for 40 years ago.</p><p>Here’s something I often find myself writing when we’re talking about comics: let’s go back to <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths. </em>In 1985, DC Comics published their first major crossover event to clear the decks on 50 years of crufted up comic book continuity, all to present a less intimidating face to new readers. One benefit of this was, with nearly every character starting over on equal footing, it didn’t just have to be Batman and Superman rising to the fore. There were new opportunities for the thousands of characters starting fresh right alongside them. It was to this end that John Ostrander and Len Wein created a new vehicle to showcase the obscurities of DC’s roster, giving them new cause to get in front of readers’ eyes: a new, Post-Crisis incarnation of the Suicide Squad.</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>The original Suicide Squad, a team which appeared in issues of <em>The Brave and the Bold </em>in the late 50s and early 60s, wasn’t much more than a riff on Jack Kirby’s Challengers of the Unknown. But in the 1986 <em>Legends </em>miniseries, setting up much of the early status quo for the Post-Crisis DC Universe, Wein and Ostrander took the concept in an entirely new direction—one which, under the complex, authoritative figure of Amanda Waller, would feature a rotating team of cast-off villains, forgotten heroes, and former supporting characters. Not just the likes of lesser Batman and Flash villains like Deadshot and Captain Boomerang, but heroes like Vixen, whose own solo title was preemptively aborted in a 1978 industry crunch; Bronze Tiger, blaxploitation martial arts sidekick to Dennis O’Neil’s <em>Richard Dragon, Kung-Fu Fighter</em>; Enchantress, a former backup feature to Supergirl; and Nightshade, part of a collection of characters recently acquired from the defunct Charlton Comics which DC sought to integrate into their own Post-Crisis universe.</p><p>The resulting spin-off, 1987’s <em>Suicide Squad, </em>thus became one of the most versatile titles in DC’s catalog. Amanda Waller’s nuanced morality allowed for the team, depending on its roster, to take on missions from either side of the morality spectrum at any level of scale, from quelling small town white nationalists to grappling with the forces of Darkseid on Apokolips. Following in the tradition of the Golden Age Justice Society of America, whose <em>All-Star Comics </em>in the 1940s was functionally a home for heroes to stay in the spotlight without titles to call their own, <em>Suicide Squad </em>literally served as a rehabilitation clinic not just in fiction as sentence-reducing labor for its incarcerated members, but for the images of those characters themselves, elevating what might have once been a C or a D list character as high as a B. As Iron Man—nobody’s favorite superhero before 2008—would prove to the world, a B is really all you need.</p><p>So, James Gunn does <em>The Suicide Squad, </em>a loose sequel to the previous non-definite articled <em>Suicide Squad </em>that doesn’t require you to watch the first film at all. Not a lot of people watched this one either, but most were charitable in affording that to the continued horrors of a deadly pandemic, and HBO Max’s short-sighted year long “Same Day Streaming” policy which had filmmakers none too pleased. Critically, it was the fifth-best reviewed DC film of all time.</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>If anything made <em>The Suicide Squad </em>work, it was the massive number of weirdos at play. Some pulled from the deepest benches of DC history, like Javelin and The Weasel; some invented for the story, like The Detachable Kid and Ratcatcher 2. Like the first movie, much of it revolved around Harley Quinn—a character who was at first controversially associated with the Suicide Squad franchise in the 2011 “New 52” comic relaunch, and 14 years later is still more often than not the series star. Unlike the previous film, <em>The Suicide Squad </em>gave emotional arcs to its less prominent players. The likes of Polka-Dot Man, King Shark, and even the generally Squad-ubiquitous but dry-toast-bland Rick Flag all got their own beats that elevated them into new favorites.</p><p>One character, a comic relief turned third act villain, would be the focus of Gunn’s next DC project. John Cena’s Peacemaker was credibly both hilarious and threatening, but we never got to know the man under the helmet like we did the other central members of the team. The legend goes that Gunn spent one week during production of <em>The Suicide Squad </em>banging out a full 8 episode script for a <em>Peacemaker </em>TV show. It was greenlit right away.</p><p>The internet loved <em>Peacemaker</em>, with its <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/peacemaker-dance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modern dance intro</a> and stream-of-consciousness dialogue. But despite the title, Gunn always insisted that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/peacemaker-was-a-comic-book-show-in-all-the-right-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Peacemaker </em>was an ensemble piece</a>. And it was! Just as important as Peacemaker’s own story arc reckoning with his Neo-Nazi father who pushed him into vigilantism is his brilliant supporting cast of Amanda Waller’s estranged daughter, Leota Adebayo; put-upon Belle Reve warden turned problem asset babysitter John Economos; disguised alien agent on the side of humanity, Clemson Murn; James Gunn’s wife, who is fine; and an autistically swagged up incarnation of Marv Wolfman’s Vigilante. James Gunn had created another Suicide Squad.</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>In 2022, as we were all still doing the <em>Peacemaker </em>cast’s “Do You Wanna Taste It” dance, Warner Bros. did something extremely rare: they made a good decision. With the future direction of the DC cinematic universe in shambles after power plays from Zack Snyder, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and a seemingly endless cascade of otherwise bad reviews, the corporate leadership turned to the one guy who, if you at least looked at it accepting the outside influence of a pandemic, hadn’t fucked it all up. Along with his established business partner Peter Safran, James Gunn was put in charge of what would now be called “DC Studios.” Where none had really existed before, Gunn and Safran would be DC’s own Kevins Feige.</p><p>James Gunn got to work announcing a full slate of new DC projects. The very first would be an animated series which just wrapped up on HBO Max: <em>Creature Commandos</em>, a series about a team of misfit monsters embarking on a suicide mission for Amanda Waller<em>. </em>It was yet another Suicide Squad. He announced a film adaptation of Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch’s <em>The Authority, </em>a team of morally ambiguous superhumans who do the things heroes won’t. Another Suicide Squad. Even <em>Superman</em>, the live action film DC has pinned all its hopes on as the ground claimed by superhero movies for a decade gives way to video game movies, is full of weird superheroes: Hawkgirl, Metamorpho, Mister Terrific, and Guy Gardner, the most obnoxious Green Lantern. Anyone familiar with the mythology of the Justice League can recognize what Gunn is doing: setting up his own simulacrum of Keith Giffen and JM DeMatteis’ most irreverent vision of the team, Justice League International, a collective of third-stringers cast in the shadow of the more famous heroes they couldn’t get. That’s right. It’s another Suicide Squad.</p><p>So why does this keep happening? Is it the only move Gunn has? I don’t think so. He’s proven himself a more versatile filmmaker than that. But imagine you’re wagering hundreds of millions of dollars on the success of a film. That’s going to make it difficult to break the mold, and make a risky decision. You’re going to stick with what works until it doesn’t. And so far, at least critically, what seems to work for Gunn is Suicide Squads. We’ll see if that bears out in real dollars, but it’s a better bet than a complete unknown.</p><p>From a creative standpoint, it’s not a bad thing either. The best thing about DC Comics, when it gets out of its own way, is that it’s not actually the Batman and Superman Company. It’s a publishing house filled with strange, imaginative, often contradictory characters and concepts, which really buzzes at its best when you get those A-Listers out of the way. There are 30,000 freaks and weirdos who live together in this universe created by hundreds of creative voices over 90 years of work, and the absurdity of their coexistence compounds that exponentially. This is comics. It’s Suicide Squad.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/does-elon-musks-gaming-rig-suck-or-not"><h3>I Am Disgusted By Elon Musk’s Gaming Setup</h3></a><p>Watching these streams hurt me but I have to know: is one of the wealthiest men on earth using a mediocre streaming setup?</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/god-is-a-geek-calvin-robinson-nazi-salute-elon-musk"><h3>God Is A Geek Staff Quits Following Ex-Priest Owner’s Nazi Salute</h3></a><p>"It will be hard to start again ... but this is the right thing to do"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Fortnite OG has officially entered the next phase, going into Chapter 1, Season 2. There have been some re-added points of interest that are bound to get the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-og-sees-a-million-active-players-in-first-20-minutes/">nostalgia flowing</a> for those long-term Fortnite players, while others will get to experience the beginning of Fortnite for the first time. This, of course, includes places like Tilted Towers and Shifty Shafts. <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/go-full-tilt-into-fortnite-og-chapter-1-season-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other memorable areas</a>, such as Junk Junction, Haunted Hills, and Snobby Shores, have returned to the game after being gone for a while. If you want to see what to expect from the new season, you can check it out in the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Go Full Tilt - Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 2 is Live!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9b543Z6aus?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since it's a new season, a new battle pass comes along with it. The all-new OG Pass is out, offering players 45 tiers of rewards that are based on iconic moments throughout Chapter 1 Season 2. This includes items that are inspired by Sparkle Specialist and Black Knight, which were outfits that OG players would have been able to get in the original Chapter 1 Season 2 Battle Pass. It also includes the Cuddle Team Leader, which was an outfit that first came out during Chapter 1 Season 2.</p>
<p>This battle pass functions exactly the same as the other battle passes that are available in the game. You just have to play the game and get XP in any Fortnite experience, which will then add up and allow you to claim rewards across the battle pass. The OG pass is a single track combining both free and premium rewards. You can either purchase the pass for 1,000 V-Bucks or get it by subscribing to Fortnite Crew. The Season ends on March 25, giving you plenty of time to get your games in and unlock the rewards on the pass.</p>
<p>The loot pool has been expanded, introducing gear from the classic Chapter 1 Season 2, including items such as Cozy Campfire, Chug Jug, and Suppressed Pistol.</p>
<p>Alongside this event, the Valentine 2025 update has gone live in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life, where you can wander around town spreading love and gaining the ability to earn a Cupid's Surprise. You can also get Flowers, Love Letters, and Heart Wands as gifts to give out. This update also comes with new daily activities that you can participate in. The<a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-brick-life-the-valentines-2025-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> full details</a> have been posted on the official Fortnite website, where you can read all about it. The Valentine's event is due to end on February 21.</p>

                <p>Just over four years ago, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-acquires-esports-tournament-platform-smashgg/1100-6485077/" data-ref-id="1100-6485077">purchased the esports tournament organizing platform</a> Start.gg, which was then known as Smash.gg before its rebranding. Now, Start.gg has announced that Microsoft no longer owns the site and stated that it will "be returning to its roots as an independent company supporting grassroots and professional esports communities."</p><p>Chris Ogle--the co-founder of Smash.gg--shared the news on <a href="https://blog.start.gg/start-gg-returns-to-its-roots-816f31962d3b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Medium</a> and thanked Microsoft and Xbox for their support. He also noted that the site will continue with members from the original Smash.gg team alongside "grassroots tournament organizers, and engineers who are passionate about improving the platform for the communities we support."</p><p>One of the biggest changes going forward is that starting on February 14, Start.gg will be charging a registration fee to support the expenses of running the site. In addition to making that change for the sustainability of the business, Start.gg will be upgrading its user interface and tournament support.</p><p>"Since our inception back in 2015, our goal has always been to foster esports communities around the games people love to play," wrote Ogle. "This goal remains at the heart of everything we do, and we look forward to continuing our journey with you."</p><p>Despite some downward trends in the gaming industry, esports remain popular. Last year's Evo 2024 was officially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evo-2024-is-officially-the-largest-esports-competition-ever/1100-6524526/" data-ref-id="1100-6524526">the largest esports competition ever</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evo-2025-lineup-includes-street-fighter-6-marvel-vs-capcom-2-and-the-next-fatal-fury/1100-6528830/" data-ref-id="1100-6528830">Evo 2025</a> will look to maintain that momentum when it returns to Las Vegas between August 1-3.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/optic-shotzzy-wants-more-eu-majors-thanks-to-madrid-crowd/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty League’s Major I tournament is unravelling in Madrid as we speak. It’s the first major CDL event in Europe in several years, and the fans are <strong>electric</strong>. One player who wants to see more events in Europe is OpTic Texas’ Shotzzy, who I caught up with after OpTic’s close win over LA Guerrillas M8.</p>



<p>It has been <strong>many years </strong>since Call of Duty esports (outside of Warzone) landed in London, but that’s a fan – and a player – favourite for a future event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-love-the-eu-crowd">‘I Love The EU Crowd’</h2>



<p>Speaking after a 3 – 2 win over LAG that was closer than many people expected, Shotzzy revealed his love for the EU crowd:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I love the EU crowd, they’re insane. I love y’all.</p>



<p>I will say you guys are definitely the better crowd than NA, but obviously we love NA, so.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When I probed and asked if Shotzzy wanted to go anywhere else in Europe, he revealed: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d say London. I had a really bad interview back then, in London, so I’ve got to get my get back.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>OpTic’s Huke, who started with the team following Pred’s sudden departure last year, mirrored Shotzzy’s sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think the EU crowd is crazy, I’m not going to lie – in a good way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>OpTic Texas came into Major I as the first seed, but a 2 – 3 loss handed down by the Miami Heretics (damn that curse) sent the team into the elimination bracket. Following a win over LAG M8, OpTic now moves forward to face the Carolina Royal Ravens.</p>



<p>At the first CDL Minor tournament, the Royal Ravens forcefully ejected OpTic Texas from the running, before being promptly eliminated by FaZe. Could this be an opportunity for OpTic Texas to, as Shotzzy puts it, ‘get their get back’?</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more of the latest news from the CDL Major I tournament in Madrid.</p>

Just put your reticle directly on the enemy’s upper head to ensure you splatter their brain matter.</li><li><strong>Eye</strong> - Since you’re probably going to be aiming for the head frequently, you’re almost certain to hit some eyeballs along the way. If not, this is pretty self-explanatory, so just line up a soldier’s peeper and blast away.</li><li><strong>Heart</strong> - It might come as a surprise that Nazis have a heart, but you should still explode ‘em.

Also, gross.</li><li><strong>Stomach</strong> - The stomach holds all the bile that Nazis spew, so let’s burst it. You can find this one in the upper left abdomen. If you aim a bit too high, you’ll score a lung shot, though, so this one may take some practice.</li><li><strong>Liver</strong> - The liver is located in the upper right abdomen. As with the stomach, aiming too high can result in a lung shot, so just keep at it until you figure out just the right spot.</li><li><strong>Kidney</strong> - The kidneys are located on the left and right sides of the lower abdomen. These are tiny little organs and require a pinpoint shot. Just aim right above the butt on either side and you’ll eventually get one.</li><li><strong>Testicle</strong> - Yes, you can shoot Nazis in the balls. Aim directly at their crotch and fire away. Since Nazis have such pathetic little baby nuts, this one could take a bit of time to perfect, but it’s worth it for the killcam.</li></ul><p>When you’ve shot every organ in the game, you’ll earn yourself the “Open Surgery” trophy or achievement for being such a damn good sharpshooter. Reward yourself by shooting more Nazis.</p><hr><p><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> is available now on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Windows PCs via Steam.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/does-elon-musks-gaming-rig-suck-or-not<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>One of two shots of Elon Musk’s rig, it has probably been updated since. Via: Elon Musk</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Over the last few weeks, Elon Musk admitted to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/29/elon-musk-video-games-diablo-path-exile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheating at video games</a>. While the entire story is supremely embarrassing for him, I am also offended on a fundamental level as a gear guy. Even if Musk were good at games, what I’ve seen of his streaming setup sucks – either through poor choices or bad implementation. This would be excusable if he was 12 years old and streaming <em>Minecraft</em> in his spare time, but he’s one of the richest men on Earth.</p><p>I do not know Musk’s current gaming setup, and it very well could have improved recently. Sometimes he appears to stream remotely on a laptop, such as on <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1879565812878741574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 15th, 2025</a>, when he streamed from Mar-a-Lago or on <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1876697674264813998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 7th</a> when he mentions the laptop. Musk used to appear on camera, but in the last half year or so has stopped. Most of my speculation stems from “test” streams he did on his annoyingly named gamer <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1831927900255490289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alt</a> @cyb3rgam3r420 in 2023 and 2024.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>His lighting situation at one point was a giant candle like a fucking vampire.</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>Elon had a guy move the big candle in the background. Source: @cyb3rgam3r420</figcaption></figure><p>The first thing that strikes me about Musk’s streaming setup is the atrocious lighting and camera situation he had when appearing on camera. He appeared to be lit almost exclusively by the glow of his monitor and at least one large child-sized candle, which he calls a “gaming candle.” You can see it being lit by an assistant in the background at one point during a <a href="https://x.com/cyb3rgam3r420/status/1743041116415590613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stream on January 4th, 2024</a>. During the same stream, which has at least 400,000 views according to X’s metrics, he spent a decent amount of time<a href="https://x.com/Papapishu/status/1884859938746274232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> arranging this candle in the background.</a> It is one of the most severely uncomfortable things I have ever seen the man do, which is impressive. A candle is historically not a particularly good source of light for a camera, but maybe he was trying a really elaborate ketamine Dracula bit. If that’s the case I wish him luck in his goal to be the first pro gamer illuminated entirely by candelabra ala <em>Barry Lyndon</em>.</p><h4><strong>He center-aligned his taskbar at least once.</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>Unserious task bar setup just generally. Source: Elon Musk</figcaption></figure><p>In one test broadcast on <a href="https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1MYxNMNwmPzJw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 17th, 2024</a>, you briefly see his dock in Windows which is center-aligned. This is the default for Windows 11, and I’m sorry if this offends but it’s incorrect. I understand using Windows 11 since Microsoft is going to make Windows 10 end of life soon, but for god’s sake bare minimum align your taskbar left, it’s not that hard to change in the settings. Also, he uses Streamlabs OBS, which I have never personally liked over regular OBS.</p><h4><strong>He appears to be sitting in an awful gaming chair.</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>A Razer chair and a different, unidentifiable gaming chair. Source: @cyb3rgam3r420</figcaption></figure><p>I know that a lot of people like gaming chairs, but for the most part they are not well-made objects. They disintegrate quickly, provide awful support and heat regulation and are not easy to repair. Gaming chairs are attractive to a lot of people because they’re flashy and generally cost less than 500 dollars new.&nbsp;</p><p>At one point in 2023 Musk appeared to have a <a href="https://x.com/cyb3rgam3r420/status/1708708034396951029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Razer chair (not good)</a> but later he uses another chair that I cannot identify no matter how many times I attempt to put it through Google Reverse Image search. Perhaps that chair is custom made, but if that’s the case it looks like custom made garbage.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you are super attached to the idea of a gamer chair, they <a href="https://store.haworth.com/collections/gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make really </a><a href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/logitech-g-and-herman-miller.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high end gaming chairs now</a>. Or, I don’t know, just get a nice office chair. Musk is worth hundreds of billions of dollars and he’s dicking around with something that looks like you’d find by a dumpster at Best Buy that would give you a hernia, which deeply offends my sensibilities as someone who has literally <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-best-gaming-chair-is-a-used-office-chair-from-craigslist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> thousand dollar Herman Miller and Knoll chairs in a dumpster.</p><h4><strong>He does not appear to always understand how HDR works.&nbsp;</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>A lot of the video clips he posted just look like this. Source: Elon Musk.</figcaption></figure><p>Something that happens quite frequently when I get clips for my show Highlight Reel is that people send me washed-out footage. This is usually because they’re playing a game in HDR. If you’re a streamer, color space is something you have to account for when you’re setting your stream up or are recording video, otherwise your video will look like low contrast, desaturated garbage.&nbsp;</p><p>This is how some of Musk's streams and videos look (for example <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1822802959404835108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1846766563090743297" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1848966938451710318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1846706027137323008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1844533711506899115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1849695413215035775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1846712787684241533" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>), which is forgivable if you’re just an amateur, but if you’re rich you can also pay someone to make your videos halfway decent. He even technically owns a streaming platform, albeit one overwhelmingly used by losers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>He often uses a gaming headset instead of a decent pair of headphones and a real mic.</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>My gut says that's a corsair headset, but if you're committed to the pro gamer bit just get a real mic and headphones. Source: @cyb3rgam3r420</figcaption></figure><p>For a lot of first time streamers, a gaming headset seems ideal: it radically simplifies your setup by combining a basic mic with a basic headset. If you’re just shooting the shit with your friends on voice chat it’s not a terrible compromise, but most of the time you end up with the worst of everything: bad audio quality, cheap construction and an ugly product.&nbsp;</p><p>Musk appears to be using some consumer-grade Corsair headset with an awful-looking RGB light at the mic tip in some of his videos. At one point during a <a href="https://x.com/cyb3rgam3r420/status/1743041116415590613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 2024</a> stream it sounds like he attempted to place some kind of mic on his desk, but it was poorly-positioned and aimed squarely at his keyboard. Roughly 30 minutes in you can see him quickly ask the candle assistant to switch back to his headset mic.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of his more recent streams where he does not appear on camera are done remotely on a 3-year-old laptop while traveling, according to a steam on <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1876697674264813998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 7th, 2025</a>, which might help explain why the audio quality is atrocious.</p><figure><figcaption>This is the laptop Elon says he is streaming from while traveling. The audio on those streams is unbearable. Source: Elon Musk</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>He looks like he’s sitting too close to a corny, curved screen.</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>Corny, and probably too close! Source: Lex Friedman/Elon Musk</figcaption></figure><p>I do not have a curved screen, but I understand the appeal: the feeling of being swaddled in a cocoon of gaming seems intoxicating. As a part of a nice system that’s fine, but coupling it with an otherwise mid battlestation and room is deeply corny.</p><p>There’s also some basic ergonomic rules you need to follow if you’re going to game with a big ass monitor. Distance is important; you need to be able to see what is happening on the entire screen. In videos, he appears to be way too close (you can see him engaging with the screen in the “candle guy” <a href="https://x.com/cyb3rgam3r420/status/1743041116415590613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stream on January 4th, 2024</a>). That said, my main objection is to someone pairing a meme monitor with a bad keyboard.</p><h4><strong>His keyboard situation has been dire.</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>Two posts from Musk and Lex Friedman showing his keyboard situation at one point. Source: Lex Friedman/Elon Musk</figcaption></figure><p>I don’t know what Musk’s current keyboard setup is, but based on what I’ve seen and heard from his various streams, it has been largely bad. The clearest photos of his setup were in response to a Twitter post by <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1708300774500102541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lex Freidman in September 2023</a>. In it he appears to be using an OK but not great Logitech mouse. He also appears to have a pretty solid SteelSeries mousepad. If I had a billion dollars I would have gone with something nicer like an <a href="https://www.artisan-jp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Artisan</a>, but I understand 3,400 yen is breaking the bank for most people.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>He may have gotten a better keyboard since then, but these are my best guesses for his keyboard situation. If I am right, that's just unacceptable. Sources: Lex Friedman, Elon Musk, Logitech</figcaption></figure><p>What really gets me is the totally mediocre keyboard setup. At one point he uses something that looks like a <a href="https://www.rtings.com/keyboard/reviews/logitech/signature-k650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Logitech K650</a> (or a <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k740-backlit-illuminated.920-000914.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Logitech K740</a> in the photo posted by Lex), which is a garbage, wireless rubber dome keyboard that’s barely acceptable for office work. In another video filmed by Shivon Zilis on Christmas Eve in December of 2023, you can hear Musk <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/drewharwell.com/post/3lgv7a7wy7c25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slamming on his keyboard and mouse</a> and producing whatever the direct opposite of ASMR is. I have spent a lot of time listening to the sounds of various key switches and caps, I have soldered several keyboards from scratch, and that is by far one of the worst-sounding keyboards I have ever heard in my life.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong><strong>Gear doesn’t matter, but this is embarrassing.</strong></strong></h4><p>If you’re reading this blog and take streaming or competitive play even halfway seriously, you probably have a better setup than what you’ve seen here. None of this stuff is out of the reach of the average person any more, and there has never been more information out there about how to start streaming correctly.</p><p>Musk might have other gaming setups than the one shown in these videos, and I’m sure he could spend a bunch of money to have someone with taste fix his busted-ass setup so it looks and sounds halfway decent. And while I do admit that gear mostly does not matter that much if you have a limited budget but know what you’re doing, it does when you are one of the richest men on Earth. Musk constructs his gaming setup the way he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1528955104463814656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">builds his characters in <em>Elden Ring</em></a>: poorly optimized.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>This is the moment everyone realized he was probably full of shit gaming wise. Source:Elon Musk</figcaption></figure><p>I am aware that this is one of the most frivolous things I could be writing about in a time when many of my friends' lives are at risk, but this is also a thing I take very seriously as a tech writer, a video producer, a gamer and a person who tries to live their life deliberately. Musk wants to be perceived as intelligent and epic, but his gaming setup looks like something put together by someone without the patience or self-awareness to learn to do things correctly. If he has the capacity for shame left in him, he should at least try interrogating how mid his battlestation is and seeing where that leads.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics"><h3>James Gunn Can’t Stop Making Suicide Squads</h3></a><p>Groups of freaky little guys are the stuff of comic book history, and maybe the future of comic book movies.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/god-is-a-geek-calvin-robinson-nazi-salute-elon-musk"><h3>God Is A Geek Staff Quits Following Ex-Priest Owner’s Nazi Salute</h3></a><p>"It will be hard to start again ... but this is the right thing to do"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-1-and-2-are-coming-back-to-pc-this-week-with-all-original-expansion-packs-says-report">rumoured</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> 1 and The Sims 2 have returned to (official) PC stores. Kindly Uncle EA has taken a break from his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">busy layoff schedule</a> to rustle up a pair of Legacy collections that include a bunch of DLC. It's the very first time the original Sims has graced a digital retail platform, I believe - it was first released in 2000, back when people used to access the internet using smoke signals and semaphore. Anyway, here's the reveal trailer.</p>

<p>The Sims Legacy Collection includes the following DLC packs - sorry, just let me take a deep breath, OK let's go: The Sims Livin' Large, The Sims <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/house-party">House Party</a>, The Sims Hot Date, The Sims Vacation, The Sims Unleashed, The Sims Superstar, and The Sims Makin' Magic. You also get a bonus Throwback Fit Kit for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>.</p>
<p>The Sims 2 Legacy Collection, meanwhile, harbours the following - sorry, just let me preemptively hook myself up to a defibrillator. OK, here we go: The Sims 2: University, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sims-2-nightlife">The Sims 2: Nightlife</a>, The Sims 2: Open for Business, The Sims 2: Pets, The Sims 2: Bon Voyage, The Sims 2: Seasons, The Sims 2: FreeTime, The Sims 2: Apartment Life, The Sims 2: Holiday Party Pack, The Sims 2: Family Fun Stuff, The Sims 2: Glamour Life Stuff, The Sims 2: Happy Holiday Stuff, The Sims 2: Celebration! Stuff, The Sims 2: H&amp;M Fashion Stuff, The Sims 2: Teen Style Stuff, The Sims 2: Kitchen &amp; Bath Interior Design Stuff, and The Sims 2: Mansion &amp; Garden Stuff. You also get a Grunge Revival Kit for The Sims 4.</p><p><em>Why</em> is there so much Sims 2 DLC? It's like some kind of Cambrian explosion of licensed boondoggles. I'm speaking from a position of blessed ignorance here. The only thing I know about The Sims 2 is that games journo extraordinaire Steve Hogarty once got blacklisted by EA for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/29gllx/the_sims_2_hm_fashion_stuff_review/">this PCZone review of the H&amp;M one</a>. I doubt his subsequent <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/the-sims-2-ikea-home-stuff-review/">review of an IKEA-themed pack</a> did much to heal the breach.</p>

			<p>The Chinese Room has just <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-advanced-combat-and-weapons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> the latest developer diary focused on Bloodlines 2 combat. It's a bit late on the schedule (it was originally meant to go live on January 29), but its content is well worth the wait, as the UK-based studio has provided several glimpses of what combat will look like when the first-person roleplaying game <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releases later this year</a>.</p>
<p>To begin with, Senior Game Designer Max Bottomley revealed that the team has taken care to make dedicated melee animations for each of the playable clans. Banu has a sharp and quick style, Ventrue's is firm and precise, Tremere has a greater reach since they like to have some space between them and their foes, and Brujah is more brutally straightforward.</p>

<p>Regardless of which clan you'll pick, a Dashing ability is always available to Phyre. Not only is it useful to dodge attacks, but it can even be utilized aggressively, as dashing just as an enemy is attacking will break their attack and set them up for a counterattack.</p>
<p>Kicks are available, too, and there are even multiple types. Players can opt for a big swinging roundhouse if they're dealing with a group of enemies, while a powerful back-kick is ideal to send a single enemy flying, as shown below.</p>
<p><iframe title="2. counter attack" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1051169861?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media"></iframe></p>
<p>Telekinesis is also an extremely useful tool in the Bloodlines 2 combat system. Phyre can employ it to grab an enemy and feed upon them, as shown below, or to manipulate the environment. Things like bottles and ashtrays can be thrown to make a noise to distract enemies as part of the stealth toolset, while throwing explosives such as a gas tank is a more destructive way to deal with enemy groups.</p>
<p>Telekinesis can also pick up weapons from the dead, from knives to sniper rifles. This is where things can get interesting if mixing in Discipline abilities. For example, Brujah's taunting ability, when used with mass manipulation, lets Phyre force enemies to drop their weapons and literally turn on them. When using Possession, the lead character can take control of a foe and drop them from a building.</p>

<p>The Bloodlines 2 combat system will be augmented by four Elixirs that can be found and collected by playing the game. The Mending Elixir instantly restores health, while the Blood Elixir restores Blood Points to Phyre's abilities, which is particularly useful for combo chains. The Strength Elixir boosts damage done for some time, while the Fortitude Elixir reduces damage taken.</p>
<p>When the game launches, there will be three difficulty settings available to players: Easy, Normal, and Hard. The next developer diary, which will focus on the Masquerade in Seattle, is due on February 12.</p>
