You might assume its just a bog-standard shooter, but it actually plays more like a weird, small open-world RPG inspired by Bethesda games like <em>Fallout 3</em>. Yeah, not what I expected at all going into it back in 2023, but it turned out to be a great game with a lot of heart. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-robocop-game-rogue-city-sequel-expansion-2025-pc-1851768472?_gl=1*fuo3tu*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzAwMzc5Ny4zOC4wLjE3NDMwMDM5NTkuNTcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-robocop-game-rogue-city-sequel-expansion-2025-pc-1851768472?_gl=1*fuo3tu*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzAwMzc5Ny4zOC4wLjE3NDMwMDM5NTkuNTcuMC4w">And we just recently learned that it’s getting a sequel</a></span> (or at least a standalone expansion), so it’s a great time to play the original and catch up before<em> RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business</em> launches on consoles and PC sometime later this year. </p><p>And let’s not forget that earlier this month Sony added some great games for PS Plus members to grab, and they’re still available right now.

These are temporary transformations that only a handful of Pokémon get that alter their look and give them a major power boost. However, when Game Freak finally showed the game in action, it didn’t reveal any new forms it would add when <em>Legends: Z-A </em>launches later this year. A leak is circulating online that may have revealed all or most of the new Mega Evolutions, so if you’re interested in knowing what Pokémon could be getting a new form later this year, read on.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196452" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="149" data-playlist="196452,196805,196572" data-current="196452"><div><p>Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22004.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The leaks originate from 4chan and have since been shared by prominent leak accounts like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1904355656284381316&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1904355656284381316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centro Leaks</a></span>, so take them with a grain of salt.

The list includes 25 Pokémon, but there will reportedly be 27 new Mega Evolutions across the whole game. So if this list is true, it’s not complete. Cross all your fingers and toes for Mega Raichu.

But hey, if we see <em>Legends: Z-A </em>in the coming months and any of these Pokémon are revealed to have Mega Evolutions, we’ll know what we’re working with.</p><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>seems like a pretty big departure from both the mainline <em>Pokémon </em>games and <em>Legends: Arceus</em>. The entire game takes place within Lumiose City, seems to have done away with the open-world exploration of recent entries, and adds real-time elements to its turn-based battles.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Xbox exclusives like Indiana Jones, The Great Circle, and Forza Horizon 5 are at the top of PlayStation Store’s pre-order section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-forza-horizon-5-best-selling-playstation-5-ps5-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, if you head over to the PlayStation Store’s pre-orders <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/3bf499d7-7acf-4931-97dd-2667494ee2c9/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page</a>, it is visible that Xbox exclusives are dominating the PlayStation Store. Moreover, it’s not just one edition of these games; both standard and premium editions of Indiana Jones and The Great Circle and Forza Horizon 5 are the most pre-ordered games on the PlayStation Store right now.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-exclusives-have-overtaken-playstation-exclusives-in-pre-orders">Xbox Exclusives have Overtaken PlayStation Exclusives in Pre-Orders</h2>



<p>Interestingly, in pre-orders, Xbox exclusives have overtaken PlayStation exclusive Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. The game’s digital deluxe edition stands at the 6th position in the pre-order charts, and the standard edition barely reached the top 10 (at the time of writing). Third-party title, The First Berserker: Khazan’s standard edition is 5th in the PlayStation Store’s pre-order charts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at their performance, it seems like Xbox made the right decision by bringing their exclusives on PlayStation. Players are ready to invest money not just in the standard editions of the game but also shell out more to get access to additional content for these titles. Interestingly, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle’s pre-orders opened just a few days ago, and they have already beaten every other game on the PlayStation Store within such a short period.</p>



<p>In other news, an Xbox blog post accidentally leaked a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-blog-post-accidentally-leaks-steam-tab-in-user-interface/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam tab in its UI</a>. Also, PS5 is outpacing PS4 sales, while Xbox Series <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-is-outpacing-ps4-while-xbox-series-trails-xbox-one-in-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trails behind</a> Xbox One.

<p>The second annual Triple-I Initiative takes place on April 10, 2025, and will feature 37 game announcements from 36 studios. Games like Enshrouded and Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core are confirmed to be involved, but they won’t be the only titles on the show.</p>



<p>Like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-game-shown-at-the-triple-i-initiative-2024-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year’s debut</a>, this year’s event wont include any hosts or general advertisements. Instead, it focuses solely on games and those who make them. The showcase will feature revealed, new gameplay, demo announcements, and release date details.</p>



<p>While we don’t know all of the games making an appearance, we do know all of the studios involved with the this year’s showcase. And, based on the studios appearing, certain games could be expected to make an appearance like Endless Legend 2 from Amplitude and Outbound from Square Glade Games. Even Unfrozen is part of the showcase as they work on the new Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era. The rest is up to speculation and guessing. </p>



<p>The original Triple-I Initiative featured games like Slay the Spire 2, The Rogue Prince of Persia, The Last Spell, Flintlock, V Rising, and more. If that’s any indication of what to expect, than fans should be in for quite a treat.</p>



<p>You can check out the full list of studios involved in the 2025 Triple-I Initiative below. And stick around on the day of the event for full coverage from Insider Gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-director-says-overture-dlc-isnt-connected-to-base-games-massive-final-cutscene-reveal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But fans can study the base game for clues about what they might expect.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since the upcoming DLC for Lies of P, Overture, was announced, fans have been speculating about what mysteries it might contain. And at the Game Developers Conference last week, IGN learned at least one mystery it won’t explain: the base game’s buck-wild twist of a final cutscene.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who haven’t yet finished Lies of P, here’s the spoiler-free version: there’s a cutscene that plays at the end of the game that seems to suggest where Neowiz might be taking the Lies of P universe next. It’s a pretty wild twist of a scene, which has left fans speculating how it might be implemented and whether we’ll get an explanation in the DLC. However, Lies of P director Jiwon Choi confirmed that this cutscene isn’t DLC-related. All he’d say beyond that was, “Please stay tuned for additional announcements in the future.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/26/lies-of-p-overture-conceptart-glasshouse-wm-1743004263842.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Concept art for Lies of P: Overture</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Neowiz has already announced a full-blown sequel to Lies of P, which means it’s likely this cutscene is instead related to that. But we don’t really know any details about Lies of P 2 either, just that it’s being worked on. And Choi wouldn’t share any sequel hints in our chat with him, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I can certainly tell you is when we share such news or media and assets with you, you'll know for sure that we are ready to present it to you. And that follows very our strict focus on quality [amid] all the pressure that we talked about in the past. So that is the one promise that I can share with you, that when we actually share those contents with you and the news, we will be ready to share that with you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE ENDING OF LIES OF P. READ BELOW THE VIDEO AT YOUR OWN RISK.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The scene we’re referring to that we asked Choi about is, of course, the Dorothy scene. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spoiler-warning-lies-of-ps-post-credits-scene-hints-at-a-surprising-sequel"><u>wrote about this in detail here</u></a>, but the short version is that the game’s final cutscene depicts Paracelcus speaking to someone on the phone, eventually mentioning that he will “find her, for sure. Another key of ours: Dorothy.” We’re then shown the unmistakable striped sock legs and ruby slippers of Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, suggesting that whatever comes next for Lies of P, it will tie into other public domain “fairy tales”. But we still don’t know how or why, and we now also know it won’t be in Overture.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>SPOILERS END HERE.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We did manage to glean a few hints about what <em>will</em> be in the DLC. Choi recommends that while they want for Overture, Lies of P fans should replay the base game, as there are clues in the world of the game already that suggest what might be coming:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you play through the base game again, you'll see many hints that we scattered throughout the whole experience,” Choi said. “A lot of hints and a lot of windows into the world, and you'll be able to actually see that and experience that in expansion…There are many things that I actually wanted to accomplish when we were working on the base game. It didn't get put into the base game, and all of that, at least key elements of that are going to be included in expansion.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/26/lies-of-p-overture-conceptart-carnivaltent-wm-1743004238316.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Concept art for Lies of P: Overture</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He adds that some fans are already onto Neowiz’s tricks, saying that he regularly reads fan theories online and that “some of them are quite close.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also learned a few other tidbits: Choi told us that the DLC should take roughly between 15-20 hours to complete “for experienced players” and will become available to players once they’ve passed a “certain” chapter of the game, and then accessible all the way to the end. And we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-overture-revealed-during-sony-state-of-play-2025"><u>know from the game’s announcement</u></a> that the DLC is technically a “prequel”, with the main character getting transported back in time to Krat just before its fall. The DLC will feature new locations, new enemies and bosses, new characters, and new weapons – though again, Choi was keen on keeping the details on these a surprise for the release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It doesn't have a release date as of yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Goodwin describes it, "You travel by bicycle through a foggy rural landscape filled with eerie secrets and monsters lurking in the dense mist. The game's atmosphere and themes draw inspiration from Stephen King's works and iconic horror films of the '80s and '90s." Check out the announcement trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Quite a Ride - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Your phone's battery drains over time and must be recharged by continuing to pedal your bike. And that phone will keep sending you strange messages that might help or hurt you. Meanwhile, as you go, you'll encounter oddities like deserted towns and bizarre laboratories. The road is always changing, but Goodwin says there's a unique pseudo-multiplayer twist: "Players' collective global efforts can change the environment, unlocking new locations, hidden characters and secret quests over time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3166050/Quite_a_Ride/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wishlist</a> Quite a Ride on Steam if you're interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

But what happens if you speed through that process with your character and then find it’s subpar in gameplay?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-is-returning-to-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-is-returning-to-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1145556/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-is-returning-to-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new claim states that a Star Wars collaboration is planned for Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Season 2 ends on May 2, 2025, and post that date, according to a post by <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1904930387219874285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FNBRintel</a> on X (via <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1904931354669691269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hypex</a>), Season 3 will kick off with a Star Wars collaboration. The Star Wars collaboration will arrive as a mini-season that lasts approximately 30-35 days. The update will include a new POI based on the series, new mythics, skins, and other content.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1904931282011758877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Loolo_Wrld</a>, who recently leaked a Fortnite x <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-collaborating-with-dragon-ball-daima-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daima collaboration</a>, also corroborated the Star Wars Season 3 rumour while adding more details. Players should expect new Star Wars Bosses, NPCs, POIs, and items in Fortnite accounting to their posts. Moreover, the battle pass will seemingly feature 4-5 themed skins as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite and Star Wars have been collaborating since 2019, with new content arriving each year. Fortnite is known to have a new Star Wars collaboration or content ready for players each year on May 4, also known as Star Wars Day. Some of the most popular characters from the franchise, like the Mandalorian, Darth Vader, Han Solo, and a bunch more, have already been introduced to the game. </p>



<p>Last year, we saw the likes of Chewbacca, Dagobah Luke, Lando Calrissian, and AWR Trooper join the game. The collaboration was across several of Fortnite’s game modes, including Battle Royale, LEGO Fortnite, Fortnite Festival, and Rocket Racing. It will be interesting to see what Star Wars property Fortnite brings over this year, whether a new game, TV show, or movie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a Fortnite leaker has confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaker-confirms-mortal-kombat-content-is-finally-koming-to-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat content</a> is finally coming to Fortnite. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sabrina-carpenter-might-be-the-next-playable-fortnite-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter</a> could also be the next Fortnite Festival Icon.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-lies-of-p-overture-details-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-lies-of-p-overture-details-revealed.1145553/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-lies-of-p-overture-details-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Lies of P: Overture is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-overture-prequel-announced-its-not-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to release</a> sometime later this summer, and new details on what players can expect have come out.</p>



<p>Thanks to a recent interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-remain-single-player-despite-refreshing-elden-ring-nightreign-says-director" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Lies of P: Overture director Choi Ji-won gave insight into where the upcoming prequel stands in terms of experience and in relation to the original Lies of P.</p>



<p>According to Choi, the story of Lies of P: Overture will be “accessible seamlessly from around chapter nine of the base game.” That means the new story is integrated into the original as opposed to being a completely standalone tale.</p>



<p>“We never really saw the development of Overture as a separate entity,” said Choi to Eurogamer. “With the base game and the expansion together, we believe that the whole entire thing delivers the game of Lies of P as how it was supposed to be experienced. We just couldn’t do that earlier on.”</p>



<p>As far as length is concerned, Lies of P: Overture will take “experience players” roughly 15-20 hours to complete. It features new locations, enemies, bosses, weapons, and characters. Two of those new weapons are a bow and claws, though not much else was given away by Choi.</p>



<p>Lastly, when it comes to what the DLC will actually be, Choi told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-director-says-overture-dlc-isnt-connected-to-base-games-massive-final-cutscene-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> in a separate interview that players should replay the base game. He says that there are various clues throughout that give hints as to what you’ll get with Overture. He also made it clear that the final cutscene of the game is unrelated to what will be in Overture. That scene—don’t worry, no spoilers here—is a tease for future adventures from the developer.</p>

                <p>Much like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/#:~:text=As%20confirmed%20previously%2C%20the%20six,This%20remains%20unknown." data-ref-id="1100-6530369">the state of The Witcher 4</a>, Naughty Dog’s recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> won't be released until 2027 at the soonest as well, apparently. Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier took to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot45-game-of-the-year-edition.1093518/page-284#post-137487981" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a> to say in addition to the next Witcher, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will be out in 2027 at the soonest.</p><p>In the thread, Schreier corrected a commenter about what he said during the Game Awards after "teasing" that both games would be released in 2026, saying that was inaccurate.</p><p>"I'm pretty sure I said they were both going to be very early teases," he said. "Neither of those games will be out next year."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGy63pt9vA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VLGy63pt9vA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If Intergalactic ends up straight to the PS6, Naughty Dog will have skipped the PS5 generation in terms of new games completely. So far, the studio has released ports, remasters, and remakes, including The Last of Us Part II, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, The Last of Us Part I, and The Last of Us Part II Remastered. At the very least, it could likely end up a cross-gen game.</p><p>"Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic puts players into the role of Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria - a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago," the official synopsis reads. "Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit."</p><p>Naughty Dog revealed Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet at The Game Awards in 2024. It features a fully loaded cast with Tati Gabrielle (Uncharted) as Jordan, Kumail Nanjiani (Eternals) as a man called Colin Graves, and Tony Dalton (Hawkeye), with The Last of Us alumni Ashley Scott and Troy Baker in unrevealed roles.</p>

		<p>While the F1 season is just getting started – or perhaps finishing if you’re Liam Lawson – Codemasters have timed things perfectly with the announcement of F1 25, the next instalment in the long-running series, coming to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles on the 30th of May, 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 25 Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5rWBgBjDsc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>2025 is set to be one of the biggest years for F1. Alongside the on-track action that of course lies at the heart of it, we’ve also just had the latest season of Netflix’s smash hit Drive to Survive, and later this year we’re getting the F1 movie, starring Brad Pitt as a washed up racer given one more shot at F1 glory.</p>
<p>Lewis Hamilton, in his first season with Ferrari, will be the cover star for the game’s special Iconic edition, which makes sense as to why he’s the star of this reveal trailer, with it showing him getting his elbows out and winning a hard fought race in the game.</p>
<p>The fan-favourite story mode, Braking Point, will return in F1 2025, with Konnersport now battling for championships, as a dramatic event throws the team into chaos. Braking Point now comes with multiple difficulty settings which will cater to both returning players and rookies alike, ensuring that everyone can get in on the story-based action.</p>

<p>My Team will be getting a major overhaul, with players calling the shots as the owner of their F1 team, taking on ‘new responsibilities’ before getting behind the wheel as either of the team’s drivers. The EGO engine has also been tuned even further, with increased circuit authenticity made possible through LIDAR technology, and several tracks and their surroundings have been transformed with a more realistic look and feel, building on last year’s already-impressive visuals. More details on the gameplay features and innovations will be revealed shortly through a new entry in the F1 25 Deep Dive series.</p>
<p>“F1 25 delivers more ways for players to experience Formula 1 and race their way, from the drama of Braking Point to making headlines in the pursuit of World Championship glory,” said Lee Mather, Senior Creative Director at Codemasters. “This year, there are new opportunities for players to connect, collaborate, and compete than ever before. We look forward to sharing more in the coming weeks.”</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/ea-sports-f1-24-review/">greatly enjoyed F1 24</a>, saying “EA F1 24 is the best rendition of the sport yet, and a fantastic simulation of the iconic motorsport. If you want to forge your own Drive To Survive-style superstardom, this is the perfect place to start. If it’s good enough for Max Verstappen and Lando Norris, then it’s good enough for the rest of us.”</p>
<p>EA Sports F1 25 will release on the 30th of May for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Who knows, maybe there’ll be a speedy Switch 2 launch as well!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/triple-i-initiative-indie-showcase-2025-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Evil Empire has announced the date and time for this year's Triple-i Initiative presentation, which will showcase around 45 minutes of information about new and yet-to-be-revealed indie games.</p>

<p>The first Triple-i Initiative <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/indie-creators-come-together-for-triple-i-initiative-showcase-this-april" rel="nofollow">took place last year</a>, and it's during that show that we got the first reveals for games like&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>, as well as updates on games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors" rel="nofollow">Vampire Survivors</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/v-rising" rel="nofollow"><em>V Rising</em></a>.</p>

<p>Stunlock's vampire survival game makes a return this year to show off its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-sales-top-5-million" rel="nofollow">upcoming 1.1 update</a>, and it'll be joined by fellow indie stalwarts like open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/enshrouded" rel="nofollow">Enshrouded</a>&nbsp;</em>and dwarven shooter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/deep-rock-galactic" rel="nofollow"><em>Deep Rock Galactic</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/enshrouded-triple-i-initiative-2025.jpg?itok=ZjOdf86- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/enshrouded-triple-i-initiative-2025.jpg?itok=O9QmJoox 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>joins the list of indie games being showcased at this year's Triple-i Initiative.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Evil Empire, this year's Triple-i Initiative will feature over 30 announcements, and as well as the aforementioned games, you can also look forward to new info about the likes of&nbsp;<em>X4: Foundations</em>, plus new info from publishers like&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s Playstack and&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>' Hooded Horse.</p>

<p>The full list of studios also includes&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>developer 11 bit,&nbsp;<em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>studio Sloclap, and&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>outfit Digital Sun, who may well be showcasing more of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em>sequel</a>.</p>

<p>As well as new game reveals, Evil Empire also says that this year's Triple-i Initiative will mark the beginning of a week-long sale across Steam and other platforms, with various games from both this year's show and last year's getting discounts.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that this is an indie show, I wouldn't get your hopes up for news on, well,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow"><em>that&nbsp;</em>hotly-anticipated indie game</a>. Team Cherry's name isn't on the list of studios to be featured during the show, so adjust your expectations accordingly. Nobody likes&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>spam in the chat, after all.</p>




<p>You can check out this year's Triple-i Initiative on April 10th at 9am Pacific (that's around 12pm Eastern and about 5pm GMT). Stay tuned for more.</p>
