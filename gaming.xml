            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/shadow-of-road-preview-different-take-on-japanese-history<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shadow of the Road</em> is an upcoming tactical, turn-based RPG from Another Angle Games. Set in an alternate version of 19th-century Japan, you’re pitted against an Emperor who has embraced outside influences and aims to destroy the Shogunate. Interested in the blend of steampunk weaponry and myth, I took part in a gameplay presentation and hands-on preview of the alpha.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Shadow of the Road Preview - Steampunk vs. Samurai Showdown</em></h2>

<p>You begin playing as two ronin in this traditional Japanese setting, where hints of steampunk weaponry from the West have invaded the land. That’s the overarching story of <em>Shadow of the Road</em>, Civil War. The Emperor has declared the end of the Shogun, using fierce weapons like flamethrowers to take out his enemies. The Shogun don't just lie down and die, however, as they recruit all warriors, even Ronin, to face the Emperor.</p>

<p>During the war, layers of personal missions, mystical experiences, and character developments impart additional tiers of narrative. Additionally, there are tie-ins with mythology, giving the title further story layers to discover. During your explorations, you can encounter yokai, who are both friendly and aggressive. While the spirits are based on Japanese lore, they are modified to fit the alternate world built by Another Angle Games.&nbsp;</p>

Medicinal items, like reishi mushrooms, are found throughout the land. These are important in keeping you alive in tough battles. Lootable items are marked with a pillar of falling blossoms making them easy to distinguish and collect. This is great for those who have issues picking out items in a realistic setting.</p>

<p>When it comes to the tactical part of&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, I played through three different combat scenarios. The first is your basic tutorial combat. This mainly involves how to break an enemy’s concentration, destroy cover, attacks of opportunity, and shifting. I really enjoyed how the timeline displays turns for the whole battle, not just a single round.&nbsp;</p>

Even as a tutorial, you can lose the game if Akira or Satoru dies. Initially, I thought if one of them survived the game would continue. But I was wrong and soon the game over graphic was on my screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following combats were completely different, tactics-wise. In the second, you're tasked with protecting a young boy and fending off multiple waves of enemies. In the third, you face fire, a yokai, and exploding eyeballs. By the end of the battle, almost my whole field was an inferno. I drastically had to change how I moved my party to try and avoid getting burned, making the fight more drawn out than I would've liked. However, none of my units fell, and I was able to utilize some new ranged options I acquired in the skill tree.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-of-the-road-enemy-backup.jpg?itok=9qmNxwTI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-of-the-road-enemy-backup.jpg?itok=FEZLlGak 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>By the end of the playable demo included with the presentation, I was hooked. Not only do I want to learn more about how yokai appear and potentially partner with humans, but I also want to know more about these characters. How do the choices you make ultimately impact the story later on in the game?</p>

<p>These all have me wanting to fully explore the world of <em>Shadow of the Road</em>. I want to see how my choices change characters throughout the story. I want to see how yokai further alter combat and what they add to the traditional samurai combat experience.&nbsp;</p>

The new Onyx dark mode is part of a number of UI <a href="https://discord.com/blog/player-release-q12025">updates to the Discord desktop app</a> that make it closely match the mobile version of the app, alongside a much-improved overlay.</p><p>The Onyx dark mode is also joined by a Dark theme in the Discord desktop app, so there are now four options in total for free users. Discord has made the channel list resizable, improvements to overall spacing throughout the app, and there’s a new bar in the call interface that makes it easier to see if you have your microphone enabled and if your camera is on or off.</p><p>Discord has also tweaked the colors and illustrations throughout its desktop app as part of this refresh. “All of these updates are meant to enhance legibility, reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed by visual noise, and maintain consistency across desktop and mobile devices,” says Peter Sellis, senior vice president of product at Discord.</p><p>While the UI improvements are immediately obvious, Discord has also added a new game overlay to its desktop app that no longer hits your frame rates. “Previously, the Overlay worked best by ’“hooking’” itself directly into your game’s window, sacrificing game performance in the process,“ explains Sellis. ”This new version of the Overlay delivers a snappier, faster experience, focused around what you care about most.“</p><p>Discord has implemented individual widgets in its overlay, much like Microsoft’s Xbox Game Bar or the separate sections of Steam’s overlay. You can now watch Discord streams directly inside this overlay, so they can float above the game you’re playing. All of these new widgets can also be placed wherever you want them on a screen, and this updated overlay should also work with a lot more games and not be picked up by anti-cheat engines.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You would think that with a game that is pretty much all about driving like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a>, the prospect of an update that promises "endless" driving wouldn't be all that exciting or interesting. In this case you'd be wrong, though, as the game's upcoming Endless Expeditions patch sounds like a pretty solid one. Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ironwood-studios">Ironwood Studios</a> revealed the update with a new trailer yesterday, showing off all the changes and additions coming to the game, the most notable one being expeditions, described as "new continuous drives" that are a bit more dangerous than you might be used to.
</p>

<p>
Outside of offering "unique rewards", Ironwood kept quiet on what this new mode will be like, but that makes the mystery of it all the more intriguing, no? On top of that there's also a few quality of life improvements coming. There's a new feature called cluster spawning, though I couldn't tell you what that is right now. The thermal vacuum and plasma scrapper are seeing some improvements too. As well as all that, a new zone trader, Ida's Exchange, can be discovered too.

<p>
A suspend run feature is being added in too, meaning if you need to quit out of the game because you realised you forgot to file your taxes or something, you can save mid-trip and go do that without sacrificing progress.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and there's more cosmetics you can unlock for your garage, more than an hours worth of new music to listen to on the radio while you're on the aforementioned endless expeditions (and anywhere else), and more lore too - Ironwood described this one as their "biggest" update yet, unsurprisingly.
</p>
<p>
You've not got long to wait for the update either, as it's due out in a little over a week's time on April 3rd.

If you play without any assists, you won’t get objective markers or clearly defined tasks. Instead, you’ll need to suss out things entirely on your own, figuring out where leads are asking you to go by following written clues and your own intuition.</p><figure id="" data-id="a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-recommend-id="image://a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options for Atomfall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options for Atomfall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-recommend-id="image://a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options for Atomfall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If this doesn’t sound up your alley, that’s totally okay! <strong>You can make the game feel a bit more forgiving by heading into Options &gt; Game &gt; Playstyle and turning on various assists.</strong> You can even set it up so that there are waypoint markers and hints.  This dramatically reduces how much additional work you’ll need to put into figuring out how to navigate Atomfall’s sprawling world.</p><h2 id="h66610"><a id=""></a>Thorough exploration is the key to your success</h2><p>Regardless of how you’ve customized your playstyle, exploration remains among the most significant parts of <em>Atomfall</em>. You’ll need to check every nook and cranny of the post-nuclear English countryside for leads that will direct you to side-quests, helpful crafting materials to improve your survivability, and all-important Training Stimulants and skill manuals to bolster your skill tree.</p><figure id="" data-id="b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-recommend-id="image://b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player comes across a Training Stimulant in a dark environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player comes across a Training Stimulant in a dark environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-recommend-id="image://b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player comes across a Training Stimulant in a dark environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s worth noting that a lot of these things are easy to miss, so thorough observation remains key. Check for spots you can climb over or under to reach hidden rooms, and thoroughly examine every desk, shelf, and box in an area so as not to miss anything. Even just finding a few extra bullets or a piece of food can make all the difference in a game where resources are so scarce. </p><h2 id="h66611"><a id=""></a>Stealth is your friend</h2><p>Ammo is hard to come by in <em>Atomfall</em>, so you’ll spend a lot of time in melee combat. However, this means that facing off against tons of foes at once can be extremely overwhelming. <strong>When you’re trying to conserve ammo (or simply don’t have any), you’ll want to resort to stealth.</strong> Sneaking around an enemy encampment while slowly taking out unsuspecting foes and looting their goodies keeps more ammo in your magazines and more health in your, uh, health bar. </p><figure id="" data-id="6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-recommend-id="image://6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player sneaks up on a robot from a distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player sneaks up on a robot from a distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-recommend-id="image://6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player sneaks up on a robot from a distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re not prepared with adequate resources when all hell breaks loose, though, just run far away and try again later. There’s no shame in regrouping and taking things slowly in a game designed around tense survival mechanics. Your goal is to live to see another day, after all.</p><hr><p><br><em>Atomfall</em> is available on March 27 for PS5 PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.   </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can follow along with the quests given to you by various NPCs, or you can choose to slaughter everyone in your path and figure things out for yourself. Moreover, the game doesn’t do a lot of hand-holding, so you’ll need to spend a lot of time paying close attention to details,studying your environment to find important items and locations. </p><p>All of this freedom helps make the overall experience of <em>Atomfall</em> fairly unique for each player. As such, each person’s playtime will differ based on how they approach the story and the options available to them. Because choices and ingenuity play such a large part in how long the game can last, it’s somewhat difficult to say exactly how long it will take someone to beat. </p><p>Generally speaking, though, if you’re the kind of person who doesn’t venture too far off the beaten path and plans to just focus on pushing through the narrative beats of the game, <strong>you’re likely to get anywhere from 10-20 hours out of your journey through <em>Atomfall</em></strong>—again, largely depending on which choices you make along the way.</p><figure id="" data-id="b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-recommend-id="image://b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player holds a mine detector while walking through an overgrown wasteland." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player holds a mine detector while walking through an overgrown wasteland." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-recommend-id="image://b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player holds a mine detector while walking through an overgrown wasteland." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But, if you’re looking to see and do everything <em>Atomfall</em> has to offer, you’ll be able to squeeze quite a lot more out of this post-apocalyptic outing. Doing as much as possible in a single run can easily score you many, many more hours of gameplay than a strictly narrative-focused outing. And <strong>if you’re looking to grab every trophy/achievement in the game, you’ll need to beat it various times while following different paths</strong>. You’ll even be rewarded for finding a way to complete the game in under five hours!</p><p>There’s a ton of replay value in <em>Atomfall</em>, so you’ll be able to play through it as many times as you’d like while always seeing something new. This choice-driven, post-nuclear survival game is available on March 27 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. </p><p>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-gets-esrb-rating-suggesting-launch-might-be-near/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 had been rated by the ESRB. In that article, I predicted it would be released within six months, as most games rated by regulators do. Today, Paradox Interactive has unveiled that's exactly the timeframe they have in mind, as the long-awaited roleplaying game sequel is now scheduled to launch in October.</p>
<p>The message was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rzc1Ow18qhY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered</a> by Marco Behrmann, Executive Vice President of the World of Darkness IP (and Executive Producer on Bloodlines 2), who explained that the game is essentially done with only polishing left to do. Here's the full statement:</p>
<p><em>Since our last update, we have added more content to the game more narrative depth character development and we have also evolved Fabien's role in the storyline. Over the past couple of months we have invited you all to see the development of Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 in the form of <a href="https://wccftech.com/phyres-role-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-explained-in-latest-developer-diary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Diaries</a> focusing on various areas from the game including the Camarilla, the Anarchs, the Hunters, and many many other things. I implore you to check it out, and learn more about the game. The status of the game right now is that the game is done.</em></p>
<p><em>We are currently focusing on bug fixing,&nbsp; stability and performance so that we can deliver the best experience to you guys once it releases. Bloodlines 2 will release in October this year.</em></p>
<p>It also looks like PC Gamer was the first publication to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-first-hands-on-a-gory-undead-power-fantasy-that-im-desperate-to-play-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get hands-on with a preview build of the game</a>, and their report is quite enthusiastic, minus some concerns, such as dialogue animations that need to be polished. They also <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-wont-have-typical-rpg-romantic-relationships-but-it-will-feature-romantic-feeding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> the developers, revealing that the game would feature 'romantic feeding' rather than relationships, as confirmed by Creative Director Alex Skidmore:</p>
<p><em>So there are some romantic options. But vampire romance isn't the same as human romance. So we have—this is probably awful and I don't want to give this soundbite—a kind of romantic feeding. So there are points with named vampires where if you have played your card rights, you can do a romantic feed.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>A vampire's bite in VTM is called 'the kiss', so the humans don't scream, and they're left afterwards sort of dazed, and probably when they snap out of it they'll go, 'That was awesome. Where did that person go?' So that's the romanticism, whereas we didn't have that for the combat feeds. We want the combat feeds to be lethal, horrible.</em></p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-to-october-2025.1144344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox and developer The Chinese Room have announced that&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed yet again. It's now set to come out later this year.</p>

<p>In a new development update trailer,&nbsp;<em>World of Darkness&nbsp;</em>executive VP Marco Behrmann reveals that&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>won't be meeting its previously-announced release window; the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-yet-again" rel="nofollow">set to come out in the first half of this year</a>.</p>

<p>However, the two aforementioned studios believe that "ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date", and so they've admitted that&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>"will not be ready for release" before the fall.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025-shadows.jpg?itok=Lzb2Q_8V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025-shadows.jpg?itok=a7cfqcn3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed again. Who'd have thunk?</figcaption></figure><p>According to Behrmann, however, the game is "done", and The Chinese Room and Paradox are currently focusing on bug fixing and testing, placing&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>in a "late development stage".</p>

<p>The developer is apparently currently working to "ensure [<em>Bloodlines 2</em>] is stable and free of bugs that could disrupt the player experience", hopefully guaranteeing that the game "meets the technical quality standards that [fans] rightfully expect and deserve".</p>

<p>As such,&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>will now be launching in October 2025, although Behrmann stopped short of announcing a new release date for the game. The wait goes on, it seems.</p>

<p>In case you're unfamiliar,&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has a very long and arduous development history. The game was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-announced-mitsoda-returning-as-writer" rel="nofollow">announced back in 2019</a>, at which point original game writer Brian Mitsoda was set to return.</p>




<p>After numerous delays, Mitsoda was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-kicks-out-narrative-designer-brian-mitsoda" rel="nofollow">removed from the project</a>, and its future was relatively uncertain until the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" rel="nofollow">returned in late 2023</a>, now being developed by <i>Dear Esther&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Everybody's Gone to the Rapture&nbsp;</em>studio The Chinese Room.</p>

<p>We can only hope that this new release window for&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>is accurate, but given the game's long and storied history, I will believe that when I see it. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Please, please, please keep an eye on Fortnite in the immediate future, as pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter appears to be heading to game soon. The breakout musical artist will seemingly be the next face in the massive roster of characters and real-life people to become playable Fortnite characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-have-you-ever-tried-this-one">Have You Ever Tried This One?</h2>



<p>The Fortnite leakers are the first to report Sabrina’s seemingly imminent arrival. Multiple leakers have claimed that Sabrina Carpenter is likely the next to arrive, and the @FNBRintel account <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1903101976147095629" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> last week that an inside source confirmed that the “next Fortnite Festival artist is female.”</p>



<p>Another Fortnite leaker, @ShiinaBR, posted today that some Sabrina-themed cosmetics have appeared in the game files already. This includes a glittery microphone with a heart-shaped base and a red, sequined heart-shaped sticker that she regularly uses.</p>



<div><article><p><span>SABRINA CARPENTER IS THE NEXT FESTIVAL ARTIST 🔥

Fortnite accidentally added some of her cosmetics to the files earlier than intended! </span></p></article></div>



<p>Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg, and The Weeknd have all been featured as the primary Icon in each season of Fortnite Festival. The rhythm game developed by Harmonix, developers of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, launched in Fortnite in December 2023. Each season features its own seasonal pass complete with songs, poses, and instruments related to the season’s Icon. Each Icon typically releases with playable outfits that can be used in various other games modes, like Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Whether or not Sabrina’s more risqué poses from her performances of “Juno” make it into the game remains to be seen. But a number of her most iconic songs should be playable in Fortnite Festival. Almost certainly, “Espresso” and “Please Please Please” will be featured, with one or both likely to be outfitted into an emote. The current Fortnite Festival season, featuring pop idol Hatsune Miku as the Icon, is scheduled to end on April 8th.</p>



<p>Will Sabrina’s arrival in Fortnite Mountain Dew it for you? Let us know down in the comments below! Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

There's also a Barrel Bowling mini-game, which you can obtain vouchers for through various activities, and more rewards to be earned through it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Grand Hub can be unlocked once you're Hunter Rank 16 by talking to Tetsuzan in Suja, the Peaks of Accord.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mizutsune Arrives</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-15-1742912686820.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As confirmed, the big addition for Title Update 1 is the bubbly monster Mizutsune. It's got swift tail strikes, water jets, and many other moves ready to burst your bubble when it arrives in Title Update 1. Once you've reached HR 21 or above, head to the Scarlet Forest and talk to Kanya for the quest. And of course, there's some new gear to make from the hunt.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Additional Hunts on the Way</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Event Quest will bring Arch-tempered Rey Dau to Monster Hunter Wilds. Arch-tempered is a scale above the usual Tempered fight, making this a potentially challenging bout. You'll have to be HR 50 or above to challenge it, and new armor awaits those who can clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zoh Shia is also getting its own fight. Previously, you'd only fight Zoh Shia once, as part of the main story. With the new update, you'll be able to re-fight Zoh Shia through new quests after reaching HR 50, and craft new armor from it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arena Quests</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Speedrunners get their own challenge to tackle in Arena Quests, which will allow hunters to compete for the fastest clear times. Both Challenge Quests and Free Challenge Quests will be available, with pendants given out for participation and achievement alike. You can access them through the counter in the new Grand Hub.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Change Alma's Outfit</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the hardest-working handlers around is finally getting some cosmetic options. You'll be able to change Alma's attire through an appearance menu in camp, and one new outfit is being given out for free. After completing a certain side mission, you can also change out Alma's glasses.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-21-1742913507424.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">More DLC is on the way</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A mix of free and paid DLC is arriving in tandem with Title Update 1. Some additions, like some classic gestures from Monster Hunters prior, will be made freely available for hunters in the store. Others, like those in the Cosmetic DLC Pack 1, are available through the store, or for those who picked up the Cosmetic DLC Pass or Premium Deluxe Edition. New stickers, looks for Alma, and even more are on the way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-23-1742912586790.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">More Event Quests and Seasonal Events</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even more Event Quests are on the way, alongside Seasonal Events. The latter are special windows of time where the Grand Hub will change appearance, and available meals will also change. LImited equipment, gestures, decorations, and more are available during these Seasonal Events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Seasonal Events kick off with the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance on April 23, adding pink cherry blossoms and some new decor to the game. Capcom confirmed that most previously available events and Event Quests should return in the future, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Roadmap Ahead</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-24-1742912549128.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's how Title Update 1 and its related content will roll out over the coming months. Title Update 1 arrives on April 3 for U.S. players, with the Blossomdance starting on April 22. On April 29, the challenging new Arch-tempered Rey Dau arrives, and by end of May, some other features and a Capcom collaboration will debut.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-26-1742912521189.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To end the show, we also got a tease of the upcoming Title Update 2, due to arrive this summer.

            <p>The second season of HBO's The Last of Us is almost upon us, and finally more about Catherine O'Hara's new character has been revealed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">O'Hara's casting was announced in February of last year</a>, although at this time who she was playing remained a mystery. There were rumours her character was called Gail, and these have ultimately been proven correct. But, who exactly is Gail?</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers for The Last of Us (both games and the show) below</strong>.</p>

<p>In an interview during The Last of Us season 2's premiere, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Neil Druckmann confirmed O'Hara is playing a therapist living in Jackson, but also that she is - somewhat of a surprise to me - Eugene's wife. This marks a significant change from the games, and has made me curious about what this will mean for season two's story.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-additions-reveal-how-show-is-expanding-upon-the-game">it was announced Joe Pantoliano had joined The Last of Us' cast as Eugene</a>, a character mentioned in Part 2 but who doesn't appear in person, barring collectables.</p>

<p>In the game, Eugene is a patrolman who lived in Jackson before dying of a stroke aged 73. Prior to his death, he formed a close relationship with Dina (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-dina-and-alien-romulus-have-an-unexpected-connection">played in the show by Isabel Merced</a>). Little else is really known about Eugene, but players can find a letter in the game which reveals he had a wife and daughter, however he left them to join the Fireflies, where he served with Joel's brother Tommy.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Catherine-O-Hara-is-Gail-artwork-for-The-Last-of-Us.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
</figure>
<p>The showrunners previously said Eugene's story was going to be expanded upon for the show, with an episode akin to season one's Bill and Frank episode, so I assumed this meant they would be telling Eugene's story of leaving his family to join the Fireflies. Maybe it still will, and maybe O'Hara plays Eugene's second wife but… how will the fact that Joel killed a load of the Fireflies at the end of the first season impact those therapy sessions?!</p>
<p>Ooh, I am looking forward to finding out. You can check out a clip of O'Hara as Gail with Pedro Pascal's Joel in the second season of The Last of Us below.</p>

<p>During the same The Last of Us premiere event, <a href="https://x.com/Variety/status/1904351105447809242">Druckmann also teased some of the show's impactful moments</a>, noting during the filming of episode six of season two: "Our actors...left a piece of their soul in this episode."</p>
<p>The second season of The Last of Us will kick off next month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">on 13th April</a>, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprise seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length. Spores have been confirmed for The Last of Us' second season, with the showrunners <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-promises-viewers-a-different-evolution-of-infection-plus-spores-make-a-return">promising viewers "a different evolution" of infection</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/popular-guessing-game-geoguessr-comes-to-steam-in-april.1144296/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geoguessr-steam-april<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Popular geographical guessing game&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>is making its way to Steam, so you'll soon be able to completely fail to guess where on earth a random muddy field is through Valve's platform.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/geoguessr/status/1904516547806150715" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the game will be launching via Steam Early Access sometime in April, and the Early Access version will include both Solo Duels and Unranked Team Duels.</p>

<p>Playing Unranked Team Duels will be free, but the Solo Duels mode will require a&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>Steam Pass. If you've got a subscription on the browser version of the game, that won't translate to the Steam edition, so you'll have to fork out some more cash if you want to play Solo Duels on Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/geoguessr-steam-guessing.jpg?itok=K37JT8aw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/geoguessr-steam-guessing.jpg?itok=UILe_i1s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam, but there are a few catches.</figcaption></figure><p>You won't be able to use your&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>browser account to play the game on Steam; it's technically a new game, so it'll require a new account as well, although it sounds like you'll just be able to use your regular Steam profile.</p>

<p>You will, however, be able to access crossplay between&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>on Steam and the browser version of the game, so even if your buddies aren't playing via Steam, you should still be able to play with (or against!) them.</p>

<p>If you do intend to play Solo Duels, you'll rise through the ranks gradually in order to prove yourself as a&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>champion. It promises to be exactly as addictive as the regular browser version of the game.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr</em>, the clue is in the name; it's a game that shows you a random picture from somewhere around the world, and it's up to you to use context clues (or just wild guesses) to figure out where the picture might show.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/geoguessr-steam-map.jpg?itok=7TeJ8DT0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/geoguessr-steam-map.jpg?itok=elLMmcdn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>can get pretty competitive.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>on Steam when it launches via Early Access sometime in April.

While they all had slightly different answers and thoughts, the general consensus was that nobody wanted to directly compete with Rockstar’s juggernaut. </p><p>“We don’t want to be anywhere near [<em>GTA 6</em>].

If it arrives in late October, that means you either have to launch early—which a lot of people seem to be doing with the recent glut of summer release dates.

If that happens, that means all the games that moved out of 2025 to avoid it would end up jumping right into its blast radius, unless they quickly delayed again or can move releases dates forward. According to the Dring, publishers he spoke to have multiple plans in place just in case. </p><p>“If we move out of 2025, what if Rockstar do, too?” said one exec. “Will we have time to push our game up? Or will we have to delay further? It’s stressful.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Goat Simulator developers Coffee Stain North has announced the debut of its inaugural Goat Direct showcase on April 1, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-goat-direct-arrives-on-april-1">Goat Direct Arrives on April 1</h2>



<p>The highly anticipated Goat Direct is being hosted on April Fool’s Day, and many fans are wondering if this is all just an elaborate prank. However, the developers have explicitly stated that they “promise the ‘Goat Direct’ is real. The showcase is indeed happening, and all the announcements we see during the presentation “are legitimate. “&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Goat Direct will be hosted on April 1, the original Goat Simulator’s launch anniversary. During the event, fans should expect world premiere reveals for Goat Simulator 3 and some announcements from Coffee Stain North’s partner. The devs will also feature an update on the recently revealed Goat Simulator: The Card Game and more “top secret news.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-and-where-to-watch-goat-direct">How and Where to Watch Goat Direct?</h2>



<p>The Goat Direct will be hosted through a virtual live stream on the Goat Simulator YouTube channel. Interested players should tune in on April 1 at 15:00 BST / 16:00 CEST / 07:00 PDT / 10:00 EDT to hear all the new announcements first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Santiago Ferrero, Creative Director at Coffee Stain North, has stated, “We do realise that announcing lots of new things on April Fool’s Day isn’t always the best of ideas, but we think we’ve truly outdone ourselves this year, so please believe us and tune in to ‘Goat Direct’!”</p>



<p>In other news, a recent claim states that a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-direct-expected-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Direct is expected this week</a>.

Its release looms so large that some publishers are apparently considering delaying their games to avoid a clash.</p><p>Three anonymous "major" video game publishers told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> that they are "ready" to delay upcoming projects due to GTA 6. The report didn't say what these companies are, but an anonymous boss of "one of the world's biggest game publishers" told TGB that Rockstar's releases "always suck a lot of money, and more importantly, time out of the market."</p><p>"We don't want to be anywhere near that. We are working up multiple different plans for our titles," the anonymous executive said. Another unnamed senior executive at a publisher said even without GTA 6 coming to market, it's become "immensely difficult to find free time for new games to shine. Time is the real scarcity for us, not money. It's tough out there."</p><p>Two anonymous developers of "top 10 live-service games" told TBG that they are not planning any major updates to their titles around the time of GTA 6's launch.</p><p>One unnamed studio boss told TGB that GTA 6 is "basically a huge meteor and we will just stay clear of the blast zone." A different developer said there is "no point" in trying to compete with GTA 6 and it might be smarter to "prepare to win players back once the excitement has started to die down."</p><p>GTA 6 is officially set for release in Fall 2025 on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but every Rockstar Games release going back a decade has been delayed, so it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">would be notable if GTA 6 is <em>not </em>delayed.</a> Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">GTA 6 could be delayed</a>.</p><p>Publishers being wary of launching near GTA 6 is not a new concern.

More recently, an analyst said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-not-being-revealed-yet-could-be-disastrous-for-some-analyst-says/1100-6530312/" data-ref-id="1100-6530312">some companies might not survive if they don't properly plan their launch timings around GTA 6</a>.</p><p>GTA 6 coming to market could also help lift the overall video game industry, as a game of that magnitude is expected to draw in new or lapsed players.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-will-launch-this-june-primarily-with-first-party-titles-%E2%80%93-rumor.1144245/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to launch this June, and the new system will be accompanied primarily by first-party titles, according to a new report.</p>
<p>Earlier today,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a> reported that during this year's GDC, there was much talk centered on the next-generation Nintendo console, which is expected to launch this June, as has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">rumored</a> for a while. The most interesting reveal, however, is regarding a three-phase games launch strategy, which will begin with a first phase featuring primarily first-party titles, followed by a second phase which should begin in October and November featuring games from third-party studios that should receive a development kit in June and a third phase that will coincide with the Holiday period.</p>
<p>Up until now, we have only heard rumblings and rumors regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, so it's nice to finally hear something about games, although today's report didn't provide any information regarding which games are expected to launch together with the highly-anticipated system. Thankfully, it won't be long until we will finally see something other than a new entry in the Mario Kart series running on the system, as a Nintendo Direct focused on the new system will air next week, on April 2nd. Hopefully, the presentation will also provide some information on what is expected to launch on the system beyond its release window.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will receive its first proper title update on Thursday, April 3rd PT and Friday, April 4th in the UK. The update adds a new social hub to the beast-bashing action-RPG, together with a new monster you might recognise from previous games, some tougher varieties of existing monsters, and a bunch of additional quest types and outfits. Plenty to chew on, once you pick out the bones. Here's a trailer.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LryxlqiIi1A" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
Let’s start with the monsters. These include the “dazzling and dangerous” Mizutsune, a returning face from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, which will be available in both standard and eight-star Tempered varieties. It’s a big frilly rainbow lizard that “moves almost as if it’s dancing, and skillfully attacks foes with debilitating bubbles”, according to a PlayStation blog post. Hands up if you now wish there was a real-life dancing school that involved bubbles. (There probably is.) 
</p>
<p>
As with all of Monster Hunter’s apex predators, Mizutsune is a source of materials for new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-get-layered-armor">armour</a> sets. Where is my bubblesuit, Capcom? How am I supposed to do dancing emotes without a bubblesuit? To hunt (or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-capture-monsters">capture</a>) the Mizutsune, talk to Kanya in the Scarlet Forest Base Camp at Hunter Rank 21 or above. 
</p>
<p>
The first title update also begins Capcom’s rollout of “Arch-tempered” monsters - the toughest monster variations yet. First on the menu is the Arch-tempered Rey Dau, which will be available at Hunter Rank 50 or above as part of an event quest on Tuesday 30th April. 
</p>
<p>
Title update 1 also sees the return of the Zoh Shia in High Rank play, this being a critter that you could hitherto only fight once as part of the story. As of 3rd/4th April, you’ll be able to battle the Zoh Shia repeatedly. Look out for the High Rank Zoh Shia quest in the environment overview. You might also stumble on the poor dear during the Wyvern’s Wakening in the Ruins of Wyveria. Fell it and you can craft some new High Rank hunter and Palico equipment that, to my eye, makes you look like you’ve been tarred and feathered.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>That’s it for new monsters. But what about the <em>real</em> monsters here – other human players? Well, title update 1 introduces the Grand Hub, a majestic social space that has “long served as a place of worship for the people of Suja”, where carved totems rear above the tents and you might occasionally hear the songs of the faithful after dark. Also, it’s got a bowling alley where you roll barrel bombs at targets to win items and pedants. 
</p>
<p>
To do this, you’ll need Barrel Bowling Vouchers, which you can earn via login bonuses among other means. It’s a retention mechanism, in other words. The Grand Hub will be available from Hunter Rank 16 – just chat to Tetsuzan in Suja, the Peaks of Accord.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Capcom</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
What else? Well, they’re bringing back arena quests, which challenge you to complete a hunt as fast as possible using pre-determined equipment, together with limited-time Challenge Quests and Free Challenge Quests, where you can earn pendants. There’s a new free outfit for Alma, and some other cosmetic DLC gubbins. Read more on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-a-new-monster-challenges-and-more-content-arrives-on-april-4/">the PlayStation blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
Capcom are already teasing the game’s second title update, which lands this summer – there’s a glimpse of another new predator in the video above. There is, as yet, no word of any significant overhaul for the PC version’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">technical tribulations at launch</a>. I’m not sure how bad it is right now – have you had any frame rate issues lately?
