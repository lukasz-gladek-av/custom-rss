            <p>I'm a little sheepish about how much I'm looking forward to Cat Quest 3. It's neither big budget and mainstream, nor a conceptually thrilling indie. If the first two games are anything to go by, it'll be a paint-by-numbers action-RPG with simple combat, lots of grind, and endless cat and dog puns.
</p>
<p>Yeah. That's why I like it, though. Now it has a release date: August 8th.

<p>The cats are the problem. Plenty of other games feature melee combat with dodge rolls and dopamine-tickling levelling systems, but it's the presence of cats and cat puns that throw up a red flag. They're the warning sign that you're approaching something creatively shallow, a game which has opted to court the most tired of internet memes in lieu of developing its own personality.
</p>
<p>Yet I don't feel that way about Cat Quest. Its cat puns are so relentless, so laboured, they loop back around to being charming, and its combat has a reliable, does-what-it-says-on-the-tin sort of appeal. I feel the same way about Cat Quest that I do about the similarly-named Beast Quest children's books, which likewise have a straightforward fantasy world where there's always a monster, always a magical item, always a victorious final battle. I read those books to my son, and Cat Quest 2 introduced co-op which my son and I played together.
</p>
<p>And Cat Quest 3 adds sea combat! No guilty pleasure, only pleasure - right?
</p>
<p>I'm going to buy this and I'm going to like it, I can tell. It's out on August 8th, but there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305840/Cat_Quest_III/">Steam Next Fest demo if you want to play it now</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/caves-of-qud">Caves Of Qud</a> has been under development for over 15 years, but it's finally reaching a 1.0 release later this year. Ahead of that happening, it's received a final major content update which seeks to make the complex, detailed roguelike more approachable. The Spring Molting update, which is out now, makes the user interface work with both mouse and gamepad, adds Steam cloud saves, and more.

<p>The new interface does look pretty friendly, with the previously overwhelming amount of text now joined by illustrative quest maps, character build layouts, and so on. It's enough - when combined with no longer needing to remember umpteen keyboard bindings - to convince me I need to give Qud another go.</p>
<p>The update also refreshes the starting town, giving it "the same lived-in texture as the rest of the world", according to the press release. There are also hundreds of new sound and visual effects, 40 new achievements, performance improvements, bug fixes, and new narrative elements. There are a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/333640/view/4169849469500823121">full patch notes over on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>Caves Of Qud is the work of Freehold Games, but they've partnered with the publisher Kitfox to help get the game ready for its 1.0 release. Kitfox seem to be the de facto choice for making hardcore roguelikes playable to masses, given their work on Dwarf Fortress's 2022 Steam release.
</p>
<p>We haven't made a proper appraisal of Caves Of Qud since nearly ten years ago, when Marsh Davies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-review-early-access">covered it for our Premature Evaluation early access column</a>. Marsh found plenty to excite him in Qud's procedural generation and systemic flexibility, but ultimately felt it required "more persistent, self-flagellating or forgiving gamers" than he to really scratch beneath its surfaces. Hopefully this update, and 1.0 to follow, will change that - for my sake, if not for Marsh's.</p>

This will trigger the Radahn Festival back at Redmane Castle. With that underway, you can go to the castle and make your way to the plaza where you’ll find an NPC just up the stairs. Speak to him, then continue forward and down a lift to a wide-open desert arena. On the other side of the teleporter is the fight against the hulking Starscourge Radahn.</p><p>Since Starscourge Radahn rides on a horse and can maneuver around the arena very quickly, you can also use your steed, Torrent, to match his momentum. The fight is rather difficult solo, but if you’ve advanced through some of the many optional character storylines during your adventure, you’ll find summon signs throughout the arena that will grant you help from NPCs.</p><p>When Starscourge Radahn falls, it’s now time to make your way to Mohgwyn Palace to take on Mohg, Lord of Blood.</p><h2 id="h19956"><a id=""></a><strong>Step Two: Defeat Mohg, Lord of Blood</strong></h2><p>There are multiple ways to reach Mohgwyn Palace, but the most direct way is to follow White Mask Varré’s questline.

The patch notes include a major nerf to the crossbow in battle royale, while there are some bug fixes and killstreak adjustments in multiplayer.</p><p dir="ltr">The crossbow has been a popular choice in Season 4 of Warzone, and now the developer has nerfed the Blastcap 20" bolts attachment, which was making the weapon so powerful. The stuck damage of the bolts is decreased from 200 to 110, the inner damage is decreased from 150 to 110, and the outer damage is reduced from 50 to 35.</p>

Hot off his run to a near-victory in Super Bowl LVIII comes San Francisco 49er running back Christian McCaffrey.</p>

<p>The reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year will grace the standard and Deluxe Editions. You can view both covers in the gallery below.</p>



<p>EA has yet to detail Madden 25’s gameplay but teases the next evolution of current-gen/PC exclusive features such as FieldSense, new commentary and presentation, and updates to Franchise and other modes. A press release states EA plans to announce gameplay details "soon."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Madden NFL 25 launches on August 16 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

<p data-characters="286" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Apple and PocketPair have confirmed that the <em>Pokemon</em>-esque open world survival crafting game <em>Palworld</em> will be heading to Mac later this year. This was revealed during Apple’s WWDC2024 and is slated for a launch in August 2024 alongside the new Mac operating system, Apple Silicon.</p> <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true"><em>Palworld</em> is one of the biggest games coming to Mac in terms of sheer player <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-has-just-one-game-to-beat-to-become-the-most-played-release-on-steam-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numbers and popu</a>larity. It quickly racked up players after its initial launch, and now, instead of coming to PS5 first, it’s coming to a platform that many people use, but few actually play games on. However, <em>Palworld</em> fans don’t seem to mind, and they are happy that there will soon be more new players hopping in to enjoy the game they all love. </p>
 <h2 id="h-palworld-s-mac-release-will-make-the-most-of-apple-s-latest-technology" data-injectable="false"><em>Palworld</em>‘s Mac release will make the most of Apple’s latest technology</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Pocketpair</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">User Hoak-em on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Palworld/comments/1dcs4s7/palworld_is_coming_to_macos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Palworld</em> subreddit</a> commented, “I’m so excited. I wonder if this means that it will also be coming to other platforms like iPhone and iPad as well, since they share a universal games platform for other games like the new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>.”</p>
 <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="272" data-injectable="false">The feel from the community is that they’re happy more players are about to join them. There are, of course, some disgruntled comments about how the Mac launch is happening before crossplay, and the inevitable discussion of how some Macs just can’t run games. </p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">As a Mac user myself, I like how this will make <em>Palworld</em> a bit easier to play for more people. Yes, it’s always been possible to use Boot Camp to run Windows and play the game, but running it natively will be such a massive step forward for those of us who do game on the platform. </p>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">Apple boasts that when <em>Palworld</em> arrives on Mac, it’ll make use of systems such as HDR and MetalFX Upscaling. At the time of writing, Mac users need nothing to do to secure their copy on launch day. However, pre-order information will be released soon. </p> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="false">Also launching this summer is Palworld’s first expansion, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-adds-a-new-island-pals-and-more-in-just-a-few-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sakurajima Update</a>. It’ll hit the game on June 27, 2024, and will add a new island, more Pals, an oil rig filled with enemies to attack, and a new raid. Between this and the Mac version, there’s never been a better time to get into the game and build up your collection of Pals to work tirelessly crafting every item under the sun for you. </p>

<p data-characters="111" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>This article is sponsored by War Thunder, <a href="https://warthunder.com/play4free?r=gamurs&amp;utm_source=destructoid&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=warthunder&amp;utm_id=branding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">get it on PC for free here</a> or through the PlayStation and Xbox store.</em></p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">If you truly love military games and are looking for a community to match that energy, then <em>War Thunder</em> is the game for you. The free-to-play combat MMO boasts over 70 million players, so not only are you likely to meet your new best friend on the battlefield, but you might learn a thing or two about some real-world weapons of war while doing it.</p> <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="841" data-injectable="true">With all manner of historic and modern vehicles to command, you can take the fight to some of the most passionate players on the planet on land, in the air, and at sea. Perhaps your new teammates are incredibly knowledgeable about the armor structure of the Challenger 2 tank, and the turret rotation speed of the Leclerc, or perhaps you’ll learn some interesting facts about the Apache helicopter. Either way, there will be plenty to talk about while you send rounds downrange at the enemy.</p>
 <p data-characters="552" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">You can experience the thrill of combat and the adrenaline rush of victory in some of the greatest feats of military engineering that mankind has ever devised, with access to over 2500 separate, highly detailed, and expertly modeled vehicles that cover over 100 years of warfare. More than 140 maps representing different theaters of war are waiting for you to devise cunning tactics and implement your battle plans. For those players who might be a little shy about some PvP action, there are rich PvE campaigns and solo missions for you to dive into.</p>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">The remarkably passionate team of developers at Gaijin Entertainment has gone to great lengths to offer fans a challenging, exciting, and detailed experience, allowing them to feel what it is like to take on the ultimate combat challenge from the comfort of their own homes.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">And that passion is met by the most uniquely enthusiastic community that sees millions of people from all over the world take part in battles every day. Remember, you don’t need to know the ins and outs of every aspect of every vehicle in the game to have fun. You definitely don’t need access to any classified documents to take advantage of everything these vehicles can do in the game, but we guess it couldn’t hurt.</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">If you find yourself caught up in a heated debate about the ins and outs of jets, helicopters, tanks, or battleships, remember that it’s best to believe the person you are talking to. They may just have the evidence to back up their point. Remember, <em>War Thunder’s</em> passionate players will go to great lengths to win a match, but they’ll go even further to win an argument.</p> <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="false">To join in the fun, you can <a href="https://warthunder.com/play4free?r=gamurs&amp;utm_source=destructoid&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=warthunder&amp;utm_id=branding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">download War Thunder here</a> for free or head to the PlayStation and Xbox stores.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="218" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">When I read the description for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2640300/Evolution_Survival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Evolution Survival </em>demo</a> on Steam’s Next Fest page – “a survival game where the universe evolves around you” – I thought it might be a bit like <em>Spore</em>. It was not like <em>Spore</em>.</p> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true">The game is scheduled for release this December, and it takes place on a solitary planet inhabited by bizarre creatures and surrounded by a stunning array of stars. You wake up on an island, unclothed, unhoused, and hungry. You start gathering wood and rocks to build campfires, tools, and a primitive shelter. Or, if you’re like me, you run into an overly aggressive animal and die immediately. No worries, there’s always the next generation, though without a shelter, it’s forced to spend the night wading through darkness.&nbsp;</p>

Time is sped up in <em>Evolution Survival</em>, and it doesn’t take long for you to notice that the planet you’re trying to survive on isn’t all that stable. Sometimes,w a massive sun floats overhead, roasting you and all the other blocky little creatures alive. Occasionally, a gleaming white dwarf takes center stage in the sky, and even though it looks pretty nice, it’s not warm enough to keep the planet alive. The oceans freeze over, but wave sound effects still drift up from beneath their icy surface. Your character dies, respawns, and groans in pain as the environmental damage saps its life away over and over again until a more stable sun rises.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true">The game’s evolution system doesn’t just affect the stellar bodies above you and the weather around you. As each day progresses, the animals and even the landscape start to shift. Seeing each wave of creatures take on a new shape is exciting, but I’d also find myself chasing a rock for my latest tool, only to have it vanish with the sudden passage of time. Even when it frustrated me, there was something delightful about seeing the world slowly change to take on new forms.&nbsp;</p>

In <em>3 Body Problem</em>, the characters exist in an ever-changing world, and their only hope for building a sustainable civilization is to mathematically determine their planet’s orbit between its suns. <em>Evolution Survival</em> lets you host a server for your friends, so you are trying to gather resources to build sprawling structures and form a civilization together. Unlike <em>3 Body Problem</em>, though, there’s no solution to be found and no promise of survival. </p>
 <p data-characters="627" data-current-count="627" data-injectable="false">In stable periods, <em>Evolution Survival </em>plays like a pretty straightforward survival game. When everything falls apart, and the chaos stretches on for what feels like years, the game feels a bit like an exercise in existentialism. You might be able to build a fledgling society with a server full of friends, but eventually, a rogue star will wipe you all out of existence. Still, there’s something oddly satisfying about struggling against the inevitable. At least your ruins will remain for your future generations to discover. I’ll be excited to see what the game has in store when it releases sometime in December 2024.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-directors-hope-omnimovement-will-become-a-new-standard-not-just-for-the-series/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cod-black-ops-6-directors-hope-omnimovement-will-become-a-new-standard-not-just-for-the-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="518" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We all knew this year’s <em>Call of Duty</em> would be another entry in Treyarch’s <em>Black Ops</em> subseries, simply titled <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>. However, one interesting and exciting new addition that was kept under wraps until the recent <em>Call of Duty</em> Direct was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-multiplayer-reveal-omnidirectional-movement-traditional-prestige-system-perk-categories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">omnidirectional movement</a>. This means players will be able to sprint, slide, and dive in any direction, and the team at Treyarch not only hopes fans will like it, but that it’ll be popular enough to become a mainstay for future <em>Call of Duty</em> games.</p> <p data-characters="562" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">On June 10, associate design director Matt Scronce and senior director of production Yale Miller answered questions from the press (including <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/interview-how-treyarch-wants-black-ops-6s-new-movement-system-to-change-the-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>) about <em>Black Ops 6</em>. Naturally, the topic of omnidirectional movement (or Omnimovement as they’re calling it) was brought up, and Miller admitted he hopes it will become a new standard for the <em>Call of Duty</em> series when asked. He added, “I think if it’s really good, it won’t just become the standard for other <em>Call of Duty</em> games,” suggesting other developers could pick it up for their games too.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="792" data-injectable="true">Of course, that’s dependent on how well Omnimovement is received; something Miller is acutely aware of too: “If it’s great, people are going to want it. … So we hope we do a great job at it…” He and the rest of the team won’t need to wait too long for feedback since there will be a beta session in a few months time. There’s no exact date for it yet, but frequent <em>Call of Duty</em> leaker BobNetworkUK has said <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1800153990354837582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitter</a> it could start from August 28.</p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">Once <em>Black Ops 6</em> is in players’ hands, the team will be able to tweak Omnimovement when needed, especially since Miller is expecting particularly skilled players to figure out ways of exploiting the mechanic: “We’re going to continue to tweak as we get different skill levels, really good players. People who’ll find ways to exploit it. We want that, so that we can just continue to polish it.”</p>
 <p data-characters="737" data-current-count="737" data-injectable="false">It will be interesting to see if Omnimovement proves so popular with fans that Activision will want to see it present in whatever Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games, the other two major <em>CoD</em> developers, work on next. There is precedent for this; the Zombies mode in Treyarch’s <em>Call of Duty: World at War</em> was such a hit that it’s not only a mainstay of the <em>Black Ops</em> games, but it was also included in Sledgehammer’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-vanguard-ps4-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Vanguard</a></em> and Infinity Ward’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a></em>. There’s also Prestige Mode, which was introduced in the original <em>Modern Warfare</em> from 2007 and would go on to appear in almost every mainline <em>CoD</em> game ever since (though it was ironically absent in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2019 <em>Modern Warfare </em>reboot</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-gets-ray-tracing-16-months-after-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Our most loyal readers might recall that Atomic Heart suddenly <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ditches-ray-tracing-on-pc-at-the-very-last-minute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> its promised ray tracing features practically the day before its February 2023 launch on PC. At the time, the development team at Mundfish only said it would re-evaluate the potential addition of ray tracing after launch.</p>
<p>Nearly sixteen months after the game's release date, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/668580/view/4178857302249724169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today's 1.14.4.0 update</a> has finally introduced ray tracing to the PC version of Atomic Heart, albeit in a beta state. Here's what the update log says:</p>
<p><em>Added Ray Tracing (beta) support in 3 modes**:</em><br>
<em>Performance</em><br>
<em>Quality</em><br>
<em>Balanced</em></p>
<p><em>**Requires a graphics card supporting DXR with at least 12 GB of memory for proper operation. When these modes are activated, the enabled Fidelity FX Super Resolution setting is automatically disabled. When this mode is enabled, the player’s character is not reflected in mirror surfaces.</em></p>
<p>The PC version also gets a couple of bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed crashes that occurred when disabling the Fidelity FX Super Resolution setting.</em></li>
<li><em>Removed the ability to assign multiple actions to one key at once.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, all version of Atomic Heart will receive several new accessibility features:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Colorblind mode (deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia)</em></li>
<li><em>Special contrast mode</em></li>
<li><em>Black and white mode</em></li>
<li><em>Highlight of various elements and objects</em></li>
<li><em>Disable camera shake</em></li>
<li><em>Auto QTE</em></li>
<li><em>Puzzles auto-solve</em></li>
<li><em>Auto-heal</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Following the launch of the base game, Mundfish released the Annihilation Instinct DLC and the Trapped in Limbo DLC. There are supposed to be two additional DLCs, but the developers still have to reveal any concrete details about them, including their release dates.</p>

The term at least partially stems from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/explore-the-haunting-world-of-animal-well-and-read-some-tips-from-the-developer/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/explore-the-haunting-world-of-animal-well-and-read-some-tips-from-the-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this list of tips from the game’s developer Billy Basso</a></span>, in which Basso discloses that “<em>Animal Well </em>is designed with three different layers.” Layers that lay over one another, revealing themselves as you play and your perspective grows. Confused? We’ve got you.<br></p><h2 id="h16650"><a id=""></a>What are <em>Animal Well</em>’s three layers?</h2><p><em>Animal Well</em>’s three layers refer to three specific goals that you can chase sequentially. The first layer of <em>Animal Well </em>is a straightforward journey that involves collecting the four Flames listed on your map and descending into a distinct final area, and played on its own will offer a very satisfying experience. The second layer involves continuing on, uncovering roughly 99% of the game’s map, hunting down collectibles and uncovering secret areas with new bosses, items, and more. The third layer of <em>Animal Well </em>is designed for hardcore puzzle solvers, featuring yet another set of collectibles that require exploiting the game’s mechanics and cross-referencing information with other players.<br></p><p>For trophy and achievement hunters, <strong>know that you only need to complete layer two to technically achieve 100% completion</strong>. Layer three is reserved for those who are determined to see everything in the game, and don’t mind looking up guides or community resources to help out. That said, can you figure out which layer you’re on in <em>Animal Well</em>? And moreover, why do some players refer to a “fourth layer” when Basso himself says there are only three? We’ll dive into those topics below.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-recommend-id="image://0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The four animal statues wanting their flames." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The four animal statues wanting their flames." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-recommend-id="image://0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The four animal statues wanting their flames." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As mentioned above, <em>Animal Well</em>’s first layer is its most straightforward. After progressing through the opening area and obtaining your map, you’ll see four flame icons hidden in each corner of the world. These correspond with four distinct biomes, each of which has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-chameleon-boss-tips-guide-how-to-beat-1851485336&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-chameleon-boss-tips-guide-how-to-beat-1851485336">a boss animal</a></span> that you’ll have to deal with. Along the way, you’ll need to collect at least six items that will help you solve puzzles that block your path, and you may as well grab as many eggs as you can find. It’s standard metroidvania stuff, but just <em>so</em> much fun to play.<br></p><p>Once you collect the four flames, you can place them in the center of the map, where the statues of the four boss animals hang over you. This will unlock the “final” area of the game, which will lead you to a boss encounter that, once completed, will trigger a credits sequence. Congratulations!

If you’ve successfully completed a speedrun, you can also collect a figurine at the clock in this last location to commemorate your achievement. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f8916d766ab76dbfc6f99e1b2ca2e005" data-recommend-id="image://f8916d766ab76dbfc6f99e1b2ca2e005" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Animal Well's egg room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Animal Well's egg room." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f8916d766ab76dbfc6f99e1b2ca2e005" data-recommend-id="image://f8916d766ab76dbfc6f99e1b2ca2e005" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Animal Well's egg room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The overarching goal of <em>Animal Well</em>’s second layer is to <strong>collect all 64 secret eggs that are hidden around the game</strong>. However, you’ll need to complete a few “quests” first, since <strong>you’ll need a total of twelve different usable items</strong> to complete this task. If you’re stuck on layer two, make sure to complete the following objectives:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Return to the egg room in the center of the map after collecting 8, 16, and 32 eggs to find new items essential for exploration.</li><li>Find all nine Matches in the game and place them in the dark rooms where the ominous shadow creatures chase after you.</li><li>Collect the three hidden medals and place them in the circular recesses to unlock all-new areas. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-medals-e-k-s-medal-where-find-what-to-do-1851518877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-medals-e-k-s-medal-where-find-what-to-do-1851518877">Check out our detailed guide about this here</a></span>.</li><li>Free the five cats trapped in cages in the bottom-right corner of the map. (We’ll have a guide on this shortly as well.)</li></ol><p>Following these steps, you should have the tools necessary to collect every egg in the game. <strong>You may need hints to collect some eggs, but this layer is otherwise solvable on your own</strong>. If you get stuck, visit the egg room near the center of the map and reference which shelves are still missing eggs. This will help you determine which eggs you specifically need to hunt down.<br></p><p>After collecting all 64 eggs, you’ll unlock an extra key item in the egg room. Take this item to a secret room in the “final” area in the game, and you’ll trigger a new final boss sequence that resembles how layer one ended. Congratulations!

So, as you may guess from this hint, <strong>the objective of layer three is to find 16 bunnies hiding behind predominantly esoteric puzzles</strong>. Whereas layers one and two were exploration based, layer three will involve decoding ciphers (which typically involve using the Animal Flute) and looking carefully at background details  for clues. You’re bound to have noticed loads of these while playing earlier, but now’s the time to put on your detective hat.</p><p><strong>You <em>will </em>get stuck in layer three of Animal Well without outside help</strong>, for two distinct reasons<strong>. </strong>Firstly, the puzzles here are tricky enough that you’ll want to trade tips and tricks with others to find every hidden bunny. Secondly, one bunny specifically requires assembling a puzzle that consists of 50 distinct pieces, and you’ll only see <em>one</em> of them on your file. In other words, unless you have at least 49 friends playing this game alongside you, you’re going to need to look up solutions here.<br></p><p>Fortunately, if you’re determined to solve layer three all on your own, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://philippgitpush.github.io/bunnymuralhelper/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://philippgitpush.github.io/bunnymuralhelper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can click here to use a tool that will help you solve this 50-person puzzle on your own</a></span>.<br></p><p>After collecting the 16 bunnies, a new puzzle will appear inside the house you found after completing layer one. By solving this, you’ll get a series of directions that you’ll need to follow by flying on the manticore in the ending area of layer two. This will take you to a secret island that houses a neat secret for your troubles. Congratulations! You very probably actually finished the game!<br></p><figure id="" data-id="34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-recommend-id="image://34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-format="jpg" data-width="1368" data-height="767" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A secret room in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A secret room in Animal Well." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-recommend-id="image://34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-format="jpg" data-width="1368" data-height="767" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A secret room in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Your reward for completing layer three</strong>: Unlike the first two layers, the credits won’t roll again.

Instead, <em>Animal Well</em>’s fourth layer consists of carrying out incredibly specific tasks across multiple playthroughs, that the game doesn’t necessarily hint at, to unlock a series of symbols (usually referred to as unicode or wingdings). These include tasks like speedrunning the game, letting a boss hit you several times on Groundhog Day, and circumventing the solution of a layer two puzzle.<br></p><p>By piecing these clues together, you can uncover another series of directions similar to the end of layer three, which unlocks yet another secret. To be clear, <strong>you don’t need to uncover all of these clues yourself</strong>. If you’re just interested in the reward, you can look up the answer online and follow the directions without any consequence. </p><figure id="" data-id="0eedb3e9bbed1f83e675f5d16ec6ecc2" data-recommend-id="image://0eedb3e9bbed1f83e675f5d16ec6ecc2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="I have genuinely no idea, I'm just editing this article.

<p>Just days after announcing a number of games during Summer Game Fest, British game developer Sumo Digital — the studio behind The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, among others — has announced that layoffs are coming to the company.  The studio is set to let go 15% of its workforce, or 160 people, across five different countries.</p>



<p>The news of the layoffs was first revealed by <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1800565013700280422" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon’s Nicole Carpenter</a>. It also comes just days after parent Sumo Group announced a number of new games from the company.</p>



<p>According to the company, the layoffs come due to “recent difficulties” that the studio has “not been immune” to. This has lead to a decision to reduce costs “in a number of ways”.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-dead-by-daylight-dev-makes-more-layoffs">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-dev-layoffs/">Dead by Daylight Dev Makes More Layoffs</a></h6>



<p>Shortly after the layoffs were revealed, Sumo Digital <a href="https://x.com/SumoDigitalLtd/status/1800566419735576756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released the following statement</a>:</p>



<p>“Over the last 21 years Sumo has grown from small beginnings into a family of studios across the UK and the world, which we’re incredibly proud of.</p>



<p>“While we have been able to manage through many of the recent difficulties the games industry has faced, we have not been immune and reshaping operations across the business to better navigate the upcoming challenges expected in the coming months, is a path we must now take to ensure the security of the business going forward.</p>



<p>“The difficult decision to reduce our costs across the business in a number of ways is a direct result of these challenges, and unfortunately will include a reduction in the number of people the business can support. Every alternate route to limit the impact to our people is being considered but sadly this process of transformation will affect up to 15% of our people across the Group in Canada, UK, Poland, Czech Republic and India.</p>



<p>“This is an incredibly challenging process to go through for everyone at Sumo and our focus is now on supporting our people and working with our partners on their games as we move forward to ensure we emerge from this difficult time, ready for the future.”</p>



<p>The latest set of layoffs now puts the total <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known amount to roughly 10,561</a> within the gaming industry. The number surpasses the 10,500 known layoffs from 2023 within the first six months of the year.</p>

McCaffrey is the sixth running back to serve as the cover athlete, following <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-25-anniversary-edition">Adrian Peterson</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-25-anniversary-edition-past-gen">Barry Sanders</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-12">Peyton Hillis</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-2003">Marshall Faulk</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-2001">Eddie George</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Madden NFL 25 Cover Reveal</h3></div></output><p>"To be on the cover of Madden NFL is a career achievement and an honor I share with all of my teammates, coaches and 49er Faithful who have helped make it possible," McCaffrey commented. "I'm pumped to get back on the field this year to give Madden players more reasons to keep scoring touchdowns with me in Madden NFL 25."</p><p>McCaffrey is one of the most recognizable stars in the NFL and one of the best running backs in the league right now. Last season, McCaffrey not only led the league in rushing with 2,023 scrimmage yards, but had the most touches with a total of 339 and the most combined rushing and receiving touchdowns with 21 for the year. In addition, McCaffrey tied a league record of scoring a touchdown in 17 straight games.</p><p>Due to his performance last season, McCaffrey won Offensive Player of the Year and was a finalist for the NFL MVP. In previous years, EA Sports used the cover athlete to represent the new features or changes made to Madden's gameplay. Unfortunately, EA did not reveal the new features and how McCaffrey's inclusion ties into them. </p><p>This is the first proper reveal EA has done for Madden NFL 25 after reliable video game leaker and data miner Billbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-connait-la-date-de-sortie-du-prochain-madden-nfl-25-50251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a report</a> about when this year's game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25s-release-date-leaked">would release</a>.

                <p>Video games should be upfront and honest with the player, but sometimes they have to mislead you a little bit. Case in point: according to a recent <a href="https://x.com/EbengerJohn/status/1799810812347117772" rel="nofollow ">social media post</a> from designer John Ebenger, if you tried to sprint in the Citadel in Mass Effect 1, you weren't actually moving any faster: the camera field of view (FOV) simply changed to give you a sense of speed rather than the real thing.</p><p dir="ltr">Ebenger served as a designer at BioWare on both Dragon Age and Mass Effect, and now currently works as a cinematic director at Firewalk Studios, which is working on the recently-revealed hero shooter Concord. Ebenger says Shepherd's turtle-like gait was due to technical limitations: the game simply couldn't stream in assets fast enough on the older consoles. Given how the original Mass Effect famously used elevators to hide its load times, this makes sense. The more you know.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official 20 Minute Gameplay Reveal</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Teaming up with everyone's favorite dwarven archer, <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Varric_Tethras" rel="nofollow ">Varric</a>, lovable former Inquisition scout <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Lace_Harding" rel="nofollow ">Harding</a>, and Minrathous' resident mage-slash-detective, <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Neve_Gallus" rel="nofollow ">Neve Gallus</a>, Rook hacks-and-slashes his way through the various demons that have begun slipping through the Veil. At a glance, Veilguard's third-person combat looks smooth and satisfying, and gives players the choice to attack in real-time or pull up a combat wheel, pausing time while they decide which power they want to make use of. Players can choose to be a rogue, a mage, or a warrior, and each class has its own skill tree featuring useful perks and combat abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">After fighting off a Pride Demon, Rook and his fellow Veilguards get within sight of Solas, who's slightly distracted by the whole tearing-a-hole-in-reality thing. Varric decides now would be a great time for a chat, directing Rook, Harding, and Neve to hold off the demons while Varric pleads with Solas to rethink his methods. Unfortunately, his attempt at getting the elven god to see reason goes awry, and Solas zaps Varric's crossbow with a blast of magic, shattering it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4317294-choices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317294" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4317294-choices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317294"></a><figcaption>As with every Dragon Age game, The Veilguard forces players to make difficult decisions, though The Veilguard seems to give players some extra context.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4317294-choices.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Realizing things have gone sideways, Rook decides it's time for some hands-on diplomacy and opts to knock over one of several massive elven statues, hoping to create a domino effect that will interrupt the ritual. But first, he has a decision to make: Should he bring Harding with him, or Neve? An option wheel appears on-screen, and Rook decides to take Harding with him (earning some approval from her in the process) while Neve stays back to keep the demon attacks under control. Interestingly, the wheel provides some extra information about the choice, revealing that Neve is more likely to follow the player into serious danger.</p><p dir="ltr">With Harding's help, the statues are toppled, and Solas is nearly crushed by one of them. This seems to interrupt the ritual, but it's not clear if it's actually been stopped, as a massive tear in the Veil appears and two imposing, monstrous figures step through it. Even Solas looks a little concerned, but the trailer ends before more information about these creatures is divulged.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is set to release sometime this fall.

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We have finally seen a decent chunk of gameplay for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. Developer BioWare has published a full 20-minute video detailing some beautiful locations, an encounter with Solas, and the tragic loss of Bianca in what seems like a very early part of the game. </p> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">The video shows the player character following Varric as they move through a city in turmoil. Their plan is to prevent Solas from tearing down the Veil and opening up a hole to the Fade. This would allow demons to pour into the world, though many of them are already present and attacking the party as they collect more characters moving through the city. It’s the heartbreaking encounter with Solas that’s so impactful here, though. Poor Bianca never saw it coming. </p>
 <h2 id="h-dragon-age-the-veilguard-s-gameplay-shows-off-varric-and-solas-explosive-encounter" data-injectable="false"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>‘s gameplay shows off Varric and Solas’ explosive encounter</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Gameplay Reveal" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="false">Bianca is Varric’s beloved crossbow. Ever since his introduction in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>, she’s been a staple weapon for him. Capable of shooting dozens of arrows at once, she could make short work of any enemies. Now, though, as we see in the video above, she’s been ripped apart by Solas in a fit of rage when the two friends shared a moment, and Varric pleased with him not to tear the Veil. </p>

It’s been a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/atomic-heart-puts-its-ray-traced-beauty-on-full-display-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good looking game</a>, to be sure, but ray-traced it wasn’t. Unless you’ve got the latest update, that is.</p> <p data-characters="543" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">Indeed, <em>Atomic Heart</em> has finally received a proper set of ray tracing graphic settings for players to peruse, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/atomic-heart-review-destructoid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost a year and a half after its initial release</a> on PC. The update – patch 1.14.4.0 – is fairly exciting in a few different ways, mind, as it comes with a surprisingly comprehensive array of accessibility features <em>and</em> a set of new Steam achievements for one of the game’s DLCs, but ray-traced graphics are definitely the belle of the bunch. Just note that they’re currently still in public beta, as it were.</p>

This beta version of the option allows you to set ray tracing to Performance, Quality, or Balance mode depending on your hardware and preference, which will elevate the game’s visual fidelity a few notches beyond its already impressive baseline.</p>
 <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">This, of course, comes with a hefty performance malus. Further, you’ll also need a DXR-enabled graphics card with <em>at least</em> 12 GB of VRAM for ray tracing to work properly in <em>Atomic Heart</em>. This is a tad funny in hindsight, of course, as even though <em>Atomic Heart</em> was initially demoed on the now-humble RTX 2000 series of Nvidia graphics cards, it’s clear that the game’s current ray-traced graphics are still going to push even the latest RT-ready GPUs to the max.</p>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">If you’re uninterested in ray tracing for whatever reason, <em>Atomic Heart</em>‘s new suite of accessibility settings might prove more meaningful to you. The new update allows you to tweak all of the following settings however you wish:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true"> <li>Quick-time event auto-completion</li> <li>Colorblind mode (Deuteranopia, Protanopia, Tritanopia)</li> <li>Special contrast mode</li> <li>Black and white mode</li> <li>Environmental object highlights</li> <li>Camera shake settings</li> <li>Puzzle auto-solving</li> <li>Auto-healing</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="109" data-injectable="false">Not bad, right? Patch 1.14.4.0 is now available for all PC players of <em>Atomic Heart </em>on PC, so give it a whirl.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arcanes-second-season-will-be-its-last-says-its-first-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

        <p>Arriving on Netflix this November</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>I've never played League Of Legends and I have no interest in doing so, but Arcane was superb. Set within the world of Riot's MOBA and starring several of its playable characters, Netflix's mini series was better animated and better written than any of its peers.
</p>
<p>A second season is on the way and due to arrive this November. Its teaser trailer also refers to it as "the final chapter".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Probably don't watch this if you didn't see the first season:
</p>

<p>
<a aria-label="Arcane: Season 2 | Official Teaser | Netflix" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AEbfiLaOdJA?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Arcane season two teaser trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEbfiLaOdJA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>That its the final season is good news, right? I loved the first season of Arcane, but good stories have endings. 
</p>
<p>I might need to go re-watch the first season between now and November, because I've forgotten a lot of the details since the first season launched in 2021. Even I can tell its picking up the major plot threads from the original's ending, with several recurring characters - which is why you shouldn't have watched the above trailer if you didn't see season one.
</p>
<p>Arcane is the work of French animation studio Fortiche, who aside from Arcane also worked on K/DA music videos and game trailers for Riot. Riot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-buy-big-part-of-arcane-animation-studio">bought a substantital stake in the company in 2022</a>, which suggests Arcane might not be their last League Of Legends-themed animation project. Or maybe next time it'll be a Valorant series, who knows.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Won’t Actually Take Up Over 300 GB of Storage Promises Activision]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-does-not-take-up-over-300-gb-storage/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-won%E2%80%99t-actually-take-up-over-300-gb-of-storage-promises-activision.898326/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-does-not-take-up-over-300-gb-storage/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Call of Duty franchise has become rather notorious in recent years for gobbling up unreasonable amounts of storage, which is particularly frustrating on current-gen consoles with limited SSD space. So yeah, most people were expecting <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> to be a big game, and yet, many were still shocked when the game’s pre-order pages indicated the game will require a <em>310 GB install</em>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFcallofdutyblackops69.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Say whaaaat? Thankfully, the <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1720119892697821399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty X account</a> has since popped up to reassure players that the Black Ops 6 install won’t be <em>that</em> unreasonable. That 310 GB is for somebody who installs Call of Duty HQ, which is the launcher required for all recent CoD titles, along with CoD Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone, and all DLC for those games. While you can’t get away from installing Call of Duty HQ, obviously you don’t need to install Warzone or any of the other games to play Black Ops 6.</p>
<p><em>“Correction: The estimated file size currently displayed on the Black Ops 6 pre-order pages does not represent the download size or disk footprint for Black Ops 6.</em></p>
<p><em>The sizes as shown include the full installations of Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone and all relevant content packs, including all localized languages combined which is not representative of a typical player install experience.</em></p>
<p><em>Players will be able to download Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 at launch without downloading any other Call of Duty titles or all of the language packs . The actual estimation of the Black Ops 6 file size will be available closer to launch.”</em></p>
<p>As for how big Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will actually be, that remains to be seen, but Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and III “only” require about 150 GB apiece to play if you strip them right down and don’t install Warzone, DLC, other games, ect. Interestingly, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will also be utilizing cloud-based texture streaming, which means the game is always online, but perhaps that might also keep the game’s file size somewhat in check.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on PC (via Steam, Battle.net, and Microsoft Store), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 on October 25. You can <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct-omnimovement-campaign-zombies-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get more details on the game here</a>.</p>

This will also include the chance to recreate their protagonist from <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, who will appear in <em>The Veilguard</em>, though you’ll be controlling Rook, a new protagonist for this game.</p><p>“What’s not lost on us is that it’s been 10 years since existing players have played,” Busche told <em>IGN</em>. “They might not remember [what they did in previous games]...They might need that refresher and we don’t want new players to feel like they’re missing out on those decisions. So in the character creator, I like to call it ‘Last Time on <em>Dragon Age</em>,’ but you can go into your past adventures and it, actually through tarot cards, tells you what the context was and what decision you want to make.”</p><p>Busche explained the decision was made to not import save data this time around because “technology is so different and [BioWare] wanted it to be in the client.” That makes sense given <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>is 10 years old and was played on old hardware. I’d also be surprised if a lot of those decisions tracked by Keep will factor into <em>The Veilguard</em>. So maybe as novel as it was, it’s just simpler to give players a menu to pick the decisions that will play into things rather than importing <em>everything</em>.</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S this fall, and takes a notably more action-oriented approach with combat than the series has ever had.

Now in full production, senior members of the development team spoke about their goals for the remake.</p><p>One of the first challenges was finding the right balance between being faithful to the original game and modernizing it. According to creative director Bio Jade Adam Granger, there was a fine line between keeping "the original recipe" intact and tweaking other parts of the experience.</p>

<p>"We have things that are staying as-is, like the wall run, which is so iconic that we will try to match it as much as we can," Granger said in a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/5bpvgE64gxlTtkBULl98XT" rel="nofollow ">Ubisoft blog post</a>. "The dagger as well. There are core elements of the original recipe that we respect and sanctify: time powers, the tone of the game, and the gravity-defying gameplay. But we modernize stuff like the level design, for example, and really enhance the scale of the world."</p><p>Game director Michael McIntyre added that combat has also been reworked, but signature moves like the overhead vault strike and rolling attacks have been kept so that players still feel like an acrobatic hero.</p><p>Addressing the lengthy development cycle--the project was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-revealed-dur/1100-6482030/">first revealed during the 2020 Ubisoft Forward Showcase</a>--Granger explained that "the landscape of remakes has evolved a lot" in the years since Sands of Time was first announced and that the bar had been raised. Big changes to the characters, camera, and controls have been made, and Ubisoft Montreal had to build prototypes to fine-tune the gameplay further.</p><p>"It takes time and craftsmanship and people, which is why we have reinforcements from other studios to help us here," Granger said.</p><p>While the story will remain the same, McIntyre says players will get to experience more interactions between the Prince and companion, Princess Farah. "Probably the biggest development that we've done is to make Farah more present," McIntyre said. We're able to add more interactions between her and the Prince, so you can get more from their relationship. They will simply spend more time beside each other.</p><p>This year marks the 35th anniversary of the Prince of Persia franchise, and Ubisoft is celebrating with new content for two of its recent releases. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" data-ref-id="5000-590624">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> has more DLC on the way and it will receive its first expansion, Mask of Darkness, in September.

        <p>Nearly 250 employees at risk</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sumo Group has announced it is seeking to cut costs with up to 15%, or nearly 250, of its employees at risk.</p>
<p>The firm says it hasn't been immune to the challenges facing the games industry and needs to reshape its organisation to 'navigate upcoming challenges'.</p>
<p>The company is best known for its work-for-hire and co-development services, and has built games for the likes of PlayStation, Microsoft and Sega. It also has an indie publishing team called Secret Mode. The firm has offices across Europe, India and Canada.</p>
<p>It was acquired by Tencent<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-high-court-approves-tencents-sumo-acquisition"> in a $1.27 million deal in January 2022.</a></p>
<p>The firm said in a statement: "Every day the incredibly talented people across Sumo studios are dedicated to creating great games and bringing ground-breaking experiences to players worldwide. That work and dedication over the past 21 years has helped to put Sumo on the map and build a family of studios that are second to none, and we are incredibly proud of what Sumo has become.</p>
<p>"Whilst Sumo has been able to manage through many of the recent difficulties the games industry has faced, we have not been immune and reshaping operations across the business to better navigate the upcoming challenges expected in the coming months is a path we must now take to ensure the security of the business going forward.</p>
<p>"The difficult decision to reduce our costs across the business in a number of ways is a direct result of these challenges, and unfortunately will include a reduction in the number of people the business can support. Every alternate route to limit the impact to our people is being considered but sadly this process of transformation will affect up to 15% of our people across the Group in Canada, UK, Poland, Czech Republic and India.</p>
<p>"This is an incredibly challenging process to go through for everyone at Sumo and our focus is now on supporting our people and working with our partners on their games as we move forward to ensure we emerge from this difficult time, ready for the future."</p>
<p>Sumo Group has developed games including the BAFTA-winning Sackboy: A Big Adventure and Crackdown 3, and supported the development of games such as Team Sonic Racing, Forza Horizon and Hogwarts Legacy. It also develops its own internal projects, including Snake Pass and the upcoming Still Wakes The Deep.</p>

Our studio is best known for our roguelike deckbuilder </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Train</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In May 2023, we released another roguelike strategy game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062810/Inkbound/">Inkbound</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, into Steam’s Early Access program. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was recently released in 1.0, and we have been reflecting on our first experience with Early Access. This postmortem will outline what we think went right and wrong and will hopefully have some useful takeaways.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After wrapping up </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Train</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, its expansion pack, and various ports, we decided that we wanted to continue making roguelike strategy games but wanted to try to expand into online cooperative multiplayer. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> started as another card game, like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Train</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but we felt we couldn’t make that work well in a cooperative environment after some early prototypes. The pacing was too slow. We pivoted to a hybrid of real-time and turn-based gameplay. In Inkbound, each player has an avatar they control with free movement in a 3D world, but in the strategic battles, the gameplay is turn-based. Players go on roguelike runs in a fantasy world where books create portals into their stories. During a run, players draft powerups to improve their “build” on a mission to defeat the enemy threat who is trying to unravel the world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although the game can be played solo, we also support 2 to 4-player cooperative multiplayer. Critically, to keep the pace up, in multiplayer, all players can take their actions simultaneously, including in combat. There is no defined turn order among players. It’s up to players to coordinate to use their abilities effectively. This combat system is one of our core twists and one of the reasons we wanted to use Early Access: to get additional feedback and iteration time on this new model before reaching 1.0.</span></p><p>Players battling a boss in multiplayer. Images via Shiny Shoe.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of feedback, listening to team and player feedback is a critical component of our development process and we have built a variety of systems to try to make gathering feedback as efficient as possible. Creating a culture of open feedback is a core studio goal. Prior to releasing in Early Access, we tested the game with a few hundred testers to try to both catch as many technical issues as possible, as well as improve balance and game feel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the stage set, let’s jump into the specifics of what went right and wrong in our Early Access program.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What Went Right">What Went Right</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text"><br>Listening and Pivoting</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After releasing in Early Access we received a significant amount of feedback from a variety of channels, some good, some bad, and some requesting major changes. Although it can be painful to listen to negative feedback at times, I believe it’s critical to push through and try to understand the feedback trends. It’s clear to me that some people are better at staying level-headed when reading negative feedback than others. I encourage you to identify those people on your team and have them help summarize the feedback in constructive ways.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We felt we had a solid core game at our Early Access launch but some aspects of how the title was built were not received well by players in a way that blindsided us. More on this later. We absorbed that feedback and made some major pivots during Early Access in terms of game structure and business model. Some of the biggest feature additions included new character classes, new bosses, and a popular feature called “vestige sets” that give synergistic benefits to collecting different items during the course of a run.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Feedback Made Easy">Feedback Made Easy</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Train</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we’ve shipped all of our games with a feedback mechanism built straight into the game. It has gone so well that I encourage every developer to do this. On PC, we map a key to open an in-game feedback form, and in pre-release builds, put a message on the screen at all times encouraging players to push the button if they have something to say. We also ship this feature into production, though we turn off the always-on prompt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This system has proven immensely useful. If a player encounters a bug, they have an immediate way to send a report to the development team right when they are experiencing the issue and it is fresh in their mind. The same is true for balance feedback, quality of life concerns, and any frustration that they might be experiencing. When a player sends feedback, they get a free text entry to type in what is on their mind and under the hood, we capture a screenshot, their log file, their save game, and some other gameplay metadata. This additional data is incredibly useful for investigating bug reports and generally understanding the context of the feedback in cases where the written text may not be 100% clear.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to this in-game mechanism, we also encourage our engaged player community to connect with us on Discord and put in the effort to keep that well-moderated and a positive place to offer constructive feedback. Finally, we monitor a few other sources for feedback, like the Steam forums, our support e-mail, and social media. We want it to be easy to reach us.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Online Infrastructure">Online Infrastructure</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We designed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to encourage multiplayer. When playing the game online, players see each other in a central social hub between runs. There, they can optionally chat and party up before going on their next run. As a studio, this was our first big online game, and we decided to go with centralized hosting to ensure multiplayer would be as frictionless as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We had the benefit of deciding to approach it this way from the outset, which enabled us to make technical decisions to support multiplayer and cloud server hosting along the way. We did a lot of research on engine architecture and server hosting deployment architecture, and we did as much simulated load testing as we could before the game came out to look for issues. Finally, before Early Access release, we ran a Steam Playtest, framing it as a “technical test” where players could try out the game and we could see how well our infrastructure was working.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We were quite nervous about this aspect of the project going into Early Access launch day, but, in the end, it went fairly well. All the effort in research, development, and testing in this area resulted in a quite stable launch from a technology perspective.</span></p><p>Players hanging out in the Atheneum social hub. Images via Shiny Shoe.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What Went Wrong">What Went Wrong</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Business Model Misfire">Business Model Misfire</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched as a premium title with optional cosmetic-only in-game monetization. This is not common in the roguelike genre, but with our planned centralized online/cooperative experience, we wanted to try a business model that could support ongoing updates without having to charge for content in a way that segregates the community (like only certain players having access to an area). We tried to be as simple and generous as possible with the monetization design. There were plenty of cosmetics to earn for free, and the system was completely optional. Players could not buy power, and all gameplay was available without interacting with that system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The decision to incorporate in-game monetization did not go over well with players. We were blindsided by the amount of negative feedback. The complaints were primarily centered around the sense that additional items being sold in an Early Access title is unacceptable. This wasn’t stated by players but I also theorize that between the time we started developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2021 to its Early Access release in 2023 that in-game monetization in premium games has soured industry-wide.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even though we did a lot of pre-release testing, I think we were blindsided because business model decisions are basically impossible to test pre-release on PC compared to elements like gameplay balance. Our pre-release community testing crew got the game and everything in it for free, so they did not have the same emotional response to these features as players who were not involved in the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, during our time in Early Access we fully removed in-game monetization. As expected, this was a popular decision, and I believe the right one for the project. We migrated the cosmetics that were previously available in the game into DLC “supporter packs” that can be optionally purchased on Steam. This is a model that is more widely accepted.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="English-only during Early Access">English-only during Early Access</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We made a strategic decision to launch in Early Access in English only to maximize our ability to iterate and release content updates without lengthy translation pipelines. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has a lot of text and game mechanics, and the goal was to empower game designers to change it as rapidly as they saw fit, improving the game and reducing the time it took to release those changes to our players. In that regard, this decision was a success because it certainly simplified the release process and allowed us to patch gameplay rules and systems rapidly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s impossible to know for sure, but I believe that this was a mistake on the business side. Our top refund reason for the duration of Early Access was “no Chinese language support.” The Early Access release is one of your most important marketing beats, and only supporting English certainly reduced our reach during one of the times of maximum visibility. Eventually, we localized into a variety of languages at 1.0, which had been our plan all along, but I’ll always wonder how many players we failed to reach between Early Access that we were not able to reconnect with at 1.0.</span></p><p>At 1.0 we finally completed the Chinese localization. Images via Shiny Shoe.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Solo vs Co-op—it’s hard to serve both well">Solo vs Co-op—it’s hard to serve both well</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We designed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from the outset to support online co-op as one of its core unique features, but also committed to supporting solo play. We found that after launch, approximately 60% of runs were played solo, and 40% were co-op. We received feedback from engaged players in both camps, suggesting ways to improve either the solo or co-op experience.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these suggestions were sometimes at odds with each other.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our design team found it challenging to support both playstyles optimally, and with the split between runs relatively even, there wasn’t an obvious side to fully commit to. It also caused some friction internally where some folks on the team were advocating for focusing on pushing multiplayer features while others didn’t want to do anything that would potentially cause a purely solo player to be unhappy. For example, adding objectives that require multiplayer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, we stuck to ensuring solo players could experience everything in the game, with multiplayer remaining a fun way to play but not pushed as far as it could have been if we had gone co-op only. In the end, we feel it did work out, but we also wonder if we should have gone solo-only or multiplayer-only.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was our first game to utilize Early Access, and we had some surprises that we did not anticipate. In the end, it was a valuable learning experience and I’m glad that we tried it. As we continue to support </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> post-launch we also have an eye to the future and are debating internally if and how we will use Early Access on future games. Regardless, we will definitely be applying the lessons learned on this project to our future games.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Blogger</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mark Cooke is the Lead Gameplay Programmer at Nihilistic, which he joined in August 2004 after interning at the company 3 years earlier.

Born during these challenging times, emerging studios will be fueled by creative freedom, innovation, and a more sustainable and equitable future. Those studios with a clear vision for the industry will be the standouts. Whether you’re a solo dev or indie studio riding the crest of the next wave, now is the time to clarify that vision.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While promoting your game is crucial, crafting a compelling corporate story is equally important — a story that shows your unique vision for gaming’s future and outlines a proactive PR strategy that builds trust and establishes your studio as the forefront of thought leadership.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Why should we care about your studio?&quot;">"Why should we care about your studio?"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">More than a marketing schtick, your corporate story is the DNA of your studio which encompasses your mission, values, unique vision, and team culture.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-games-to-play-if-you-are-tired-of-warhammer-40000/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-best-games-to-play-if-you-are-tired-of-warhammer-40000<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="274" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Take it from someone who has played an assortment of wargames for nearly four decades: sometimes, a change is as good as a rest. If you have been pouring your heart and soul into <em>Warhammer 40K</em> for a while and just need something a bit different, there are options out there.</p> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true">While Games Workshop certainly has a lot going for it, such as rather nice sculpts, very good lore, and a degree of mindshare that makes getting games extremely easy, that’s no reason to ignore the rest of the offerings on the market from all manner of companies. Now, this list will concern itself with games that are set in science-fiction settings and are army-level. I’m assuming you want to play something like 40K here, not something dramatically different.</p>
 <h2 id="h-great-alternatives-to-warhammer-40k" data-injectable="false">Great alternatives to Warhammer 40K</h2> <h3 data-injectable="false">Grimdark Future by OnePageRules</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via One Page Rules</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="641" data-current-count="941" data-injectable="true">OnePageRules is something of a cheat entry, as they have an alternative for almost everything, but this really is the very best thing to play if you are looking for something new to do with your <em>Warhammer 40K</em> army. A simple set of rules won’t take long to learn, and you’ll be able to use pretty much every model you already own because that is how the system was designed. Over the years, OPR products have slowly been turning into viable standalone products rather than just a “this is almost 40K, but free” alternative. This is great, as they are a talented team that deserves to grow beyond that initial concept. </p>
 <p data-characters="531" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true">Have you always wanted to use a custom Space Skaven army to smash up some silly Chaos Space Marines? You can just use Mantic’s Veer-myn range of minis for a Ratmen Clans army while your CSM become Havoc Brothers. Fans of the magic of 3D printing can buy all sorts of files for the game’s many factions, and those same factions have been designed to cover just about every popular motif across the biggest games in the genre. They also have an extremely high-value Patreon, where you get oodles of free files each month.</p>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">The best thing about <em>Grimdark Future</em> is that the rules really are fun. Army balance is pretty on point, and there is a certain reward for playing in a sandbox with less structure and lore around it, in that you can simply make it all up as you go. For an average game of 40-50 models made up of squads, vehicles, and characters, you are looking at about an hour and a half once you are familiar with the rules.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">BattleTech by Catalyst Game Labs</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Catalyst Labs</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><em>BattleTech’s Alpha Strike</em> made it onto my list of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-tabletop-miniature-skirmish-games-to-play-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best skirmish games to play</a>, but this time around, we are talking about the standard rules. Catalyst Game Labs have done a pretty good job of bringing this beast back to good condition in recent years, although folks outside of America should be warned that distribution can be a little spotty.</p>
 <p data-characters="529" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">The joy of <em>BattleTech</em> is in the details. While the model count might be low, with a classic match being two players and four mechs each, the deep and detailed ruleset means you are still looking at maybe two hours to wrap a game, and that is if you are quite familiar with it. Now, there are plenty of ways to make that shorter or longer, depending on your preference. I’ve seen people play games that took entire weekends to complete, with multiple players, multiple boards, and troop migration from one table to the next.</p>
 <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="204" data-injectable="false">What seems to be the sticking point for many people is the models, which have quite dated designs and might not be your cup of tea. That just means you are wrong, but don’t worry about it too much. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Firefight by Mantic Games</h3> <figure data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mantic Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">I’ve got a few reasons why Mantic is a better company than Games Workshop, and <em>Firefight </em>is one of them. Cheaper overall, better rules (sorry, 10th Edition 40K, you are just not for me), well supported, and similar enough to be inviting while different enough to be challenging. </p> <p data-characters="670" data-current-count="955" data-injectable="true">I feel like Mantic gets unfairly saddled with a “poor man’s GW” title, but <em>Kings of War</em> has been the best rank and flank game on the market for years, and <em>Firefight </em>is a fantastic game on its own merit. Starter sets cost about $140 with everything you need for two forces and all the rules to play. There are also two of them available, in case you don’t like one of the factions in one of the boxes. Most armies have a starter set for about $100, which would maybe get you two squads in other systems. You can even get the rules for free by signing up for their companion app, and those app-based rules get updated whenever new changes are made.</p>
 <h3 id="h-star-wars-legion-by-atomic-mass-games" data-injectable="false">Star Wars: Legion by Atomic Mass Games</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Atomic Mass Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">Don’t tell anyone, but <em>Star Wars: Legion</em> is actually pretty ace. This is the game to go to if you want to play out some of the large battles that you saw on screen as a child in those space opera movies that nobody ever really saw. It has the advantage of getting to use designs that have stood the test of time and are as visually striking today as they were when first released. </p>
 <p data-characters="495" data-current-count="495" data-injectable="true">One of the reasons that I like <em>Legion</em> is that it scales pretty well. You can use smaller forces on a small table or bigger forces on a bigger table, and you won’t get some of the creaking that comes from under the hood of other rule sets. Games Workshop has a novel means of solving this lately with Combat Patrol in <em>40K</em> and Spearhead in <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, but <em>Star Wars: Legion’s</em> designers managed to crack this one pretty well without the need for an additional ruleset being attached.</p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">The game features a neat activation system that replicates some of the randomness of war without leaving one player completely open to getting RNGd into oblivion, and the gameplay manages to walk a fine line between being both strategically and tactically rewarding. I always break it down like this. Strategy is how opposing armies interact, and tactics are how opposing troops interact. If you are missing one of those elements, you have a bad tabletop game.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Beyond the Gates of Antares by Warlord/Skytrex</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warlord Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true"><em>Beyond the Gates of Antares</em> is an interesting fish because it never really got the attention it deserved, and now it might be too late. <em>Gates</em> is all about human and non-human factions punching the hell out of each other to control the titular gates that allow access to all manner of hidden worlds and cosmic wonder.</p>
 <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">Rick Priestly, probably still best known for his work laying the very foundations and building an awful lot of the walls of <em>Warhammer 40K</em> back in the day, is the man behind the rules. You’d be tempted to think he would have just rolled off and designed his next iteration of that ruleset under a different banner, but <em>Gates </em>is a pretty interesting game on its own merit.</p> <p data-characters="561" data-current-count="937" data-injectable="true">The bad news on this one is that the game is currently in an odd place. It is no longer under the banner of former publisher Warlord Games and is instead with sister company Skytrex, which is selling the miniatures. This means it now sits in a strange place where you can get the game, and it is being supported as a passion project by Rick Priestly and former official head of the project Tim Bancroft. It is seeing an interesting surge in support on a community level, and it’s worth exploring if you don’t mind buying into older, at-risk systems.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Warmachine by Steamforged Games/Privateer Press</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="773" data-injectable="true">Folks were wondering where <em>Warmachine </em>was on my list of best skirmish games. Well, here you go. <em>Warmachine </em>is the game that could have, nay, should have, taken the crown from <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, at least as a competitive game. Then publisher Privateer Press somewhat fumbled the bag, sadly, and over the years, the game has faded away. The launch of MKIV didn’t do much to win me back with $200, 3D printed starter sets, and it seems like that is the case for others, too.</p>
 <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><em>Warmachine </em>and related IPs were recently sold to Steamforged Games. Now, Steamforged is certainly not above some criticism around certain areas, but I originally wrote this entry BEFORE this news was announced, and it was a few paragraphs of doom and gloom. I feel much better now, as Steamforged has said nothing will be changing except the stuff I think is bad, such as the lack of availability of the product, lack of a proper two-player starter set, and lack of plastic models in the new sculpts.</p>
 <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="183" data-injectable="false">So, while I still feel a lot of trepidation about Warmachine in general, I do wonder if this might be it. The moment. The glorious ascent to levels of yesteryear? We can live in hope.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Quick Hits</h2> <h3 data-injectable="false">Victory Decision: Future Combat by A.D. Publishing</h3> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true">Flexibility is the name of the game for Victory Decision: Future Combat. This tome builds onto the Victory Condition system, adding specific rules for science fiction units. It covers quite a lot of variety and can work with anything from 6mm to 32mm models. It’s a fun system, but will definitely take some getting used to.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Dropzone Commander</h3> <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">Technically more <em>Epic </em>than <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, this 10mm scale city battles game by TT Combat is well worth a look. Miniature design in this game is just wonderful, with all factions being distinct and a lot of love going into each and every model. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Any old edition of Warhammer 40K</h3> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="false">If, like me, you are just not jiving with 10th Edition, then feel free to break out any old edition of the game. I still play 2nd Edition a lot and will play 5th Edition when people give my arm a little twist. Old rules are, thankfully, not dead rules, we can always crack open those old books and play again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/marvels-spider-man-2-gets-an-amazing-new-lineup-of-suits-including-the-latest-into-the-spider-verse-skin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=marvels-spider-man-2-gets-an-amazing-new-lineup-of-suits-including-the-latest-into-the-spider-verse-skin<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="223" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Just when I think I’ve gotten my fill in the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-spider-man/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Spider-Man</a> </em>universe, Insomniac Games swings me back in with new content. Another suit expansion is on the way, with an upcoming update set for June 18, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">The new update offers eight new suits to try on, and don’t worry; they are entirely free to use. The artist Colm Dillane, also known as KidSuper, designed several skins, blending together his classic artwork into <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-marvels-spider-man-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a></em>. He also collaborated with other special guests for the project, including professional football player Vini Jr., motorsports driver Lando Norris, and singer/actress/model Rina Sawayama.</p>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">Vini Jr. and KidSuper have co-designed the vibrant Ginga Suit (left), depicting a sporty look for Vini Jr.’s successful athletic career. Lando Norris, on the other hand, has taken his racing career as the muse for the Fluro Suit (right), perfectly matching any motorsports driver’s gear through its helmet. </p> <figure data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false">As for Rina Sawayama and KidSuper’s collaboration, players can expect a “badass motorbike” look with the Motorchic Suit. Hit the streets of New York City covered in leather and take down those bad guys in style.</p> <figure data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">Among the suits that Insomniac Games has customized, one that I’m particularly thrilled about is Into the Spider-Verse’s Peter B. Parker fit. This suit, with its unique design and nod to the beloved character, will be excellent for those movie scene recreation shots. Many players have already done this with other skins, specifically with the film-based suits from <em>Spider-Man</em> and <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="148" data-current-count="148" data-injectable="false">Another personal favorite of mine, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-spider-man-miles-morales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miles Morales</a>, will also be getting more suits, including the Animated Suit (left) and Uptown Pride Suit (right).</p> <figure data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">I have always loved the look of <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man’s </em>animated outfits, so it’s fantastic to see even more join the lineup. Insomniac Games also plans to implement more stability fixes with the update. It will address the issues with the parry and traversal swap from the Symbiote to Spider Arms.</p> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false">Both the stability fixes and the suits will arrive on June 18. Make sure to update <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em> with the latest patch to get the new skins for free.</p>

<p data-characters="242" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Wuthering Waves</em>, the free-to-play gacha game by Kuro Games, has only been available for the masses to play for under three weeks. However, since its release on May 17, 2024, the RPG has already hit a huge milestone — 30 million downloads.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">This number does include pre-registrations and doesn’t reflect the number of active players per day. However, it’s a commendable occasion for the studio either way you slice it. It’s no small feat, considering the issues faced by <em>Wuthering Waves</em> since it was released.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">There have been a string of issues plaguing the game, such as event schedule readjustments, translation errors, problems with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-echoes-guide/">Echo system</a>, and balancing issues when recycling certain Echoes. All of these issues have resulted in compensation rewards for all players, including huge amounts of Shell Credits and Astrite to make up for inconveniences faced.<br></p>

 <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="214" data-injectable="false">Despite all of these issues, it’s clear that players are still coming back for more <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, with new players adding to the number of pre-registrations that existed prior to the release of the game.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">It’s easy to see why, with regular updates and hotfixes, plus a seemingly endless stream of events and the addictive nature of gacha gaming, <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is clearly hitting all the right notes with players, even if things haven’t gone entirely smoothly.</p>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">With a new update arriving on June 28 (or June 27, depending on where you’re located), including two new Resonators and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-1-1-release-date-new-resonators-and-map-expansion/">host of other new features</a>, <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is likely to keep attracting players both new and returning.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-sails-far-from-the-series%E2%80%99-origins.898278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare has released the first&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer, and we're a long way from the careful, considered CRPG approach of 2009's&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>.</p>
<p>Last week, BioWare revealed that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-the-veilguard">had become&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em></a>, and that we'd get a first look at gameplay soon. That time has come, and first impressions of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>are...certainly different.</p>
<p>The trailer opens with the player character, here named Rook, and series regular Varric Tethras looking for a mage detective (that's a detective who's a mage, not one who finds mages) named Neve Gallus.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-hack-and-slash.jpg?itok=HQ1OCbZg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-hack-and-slash.jpg?itok=WA2K4rUo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>isn't the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>you might remember.</figcaption></figure><p>Varric and Rook move through a city seemingly watched over by a giant Panopticon-style tower, and it isn't long before demons are running loose throughout the city, apparently summoned by Solas himself, the Dreadwolf of the game's previous title.</p>
<p>Soon, Rook, Varric, and companion Harding get into some combat, and we see that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is pretty much shrugging off the cloak of tactical RPG combat to fully embrace action.</p>
<p>The combat looks very hack-and-slash-inspired; the focus seems to be on stylish moves and cooldowns rather than strategy and planning, which means the trajectory of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Inquisition&nbsp;</em>is arguably at its apex here.</p>
<p><em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>also looks like it's putting quite a heavy emphasis on setpieces and "cool moments"; bringing down a statue and watching as demons rampage through the city streets spring to mind in this trailer.</p>

<p>Although the combat doesn't look much like old-school&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>, we do get to see our protagonist making some dialogue decisions on an&nbsp;<em>Inquisition</em>-style dialogue wheel that assigns responses to certain tones and moods.</p>
<p>We also get to see decisions being made that will apparently impact the plot and how characters feel about us; at one stage, Rook makes a decision of which one character approves and another disapproves.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that this gameplay trailer represents the opening moments of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, which means that it might be placing a heavier emphasis on setpieces than later sequences do in order to set the scene.</p>
<p>The trailer culminates in Varric confronting Solas about his deeds, upon which Solas shatters Varric's iconic crossbow Bianca and two powerful-looking demons appear to flank him.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see just how much of the original&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>'s DNA has actually made it into&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>, but either way, the game is launching on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S this fall. You can check out our hands-off preview of BioWare's latest RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-epic-fantasy-action">right here</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 5.45pm UK:</strong> Arcane may be ending with its second season, but Riot Games is planning more projects with the show's talented animation studio Fortiche, the developer has now said.
</p>
<p>"Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and our partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," co-creator Christian Linke said in a new <a href="https://x.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1800543519725297679">developer update video</a>. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with the second season. 
</p>
<p>"But Arcane is just the first of many stories we want to tell in Runeterra. We've been with Riot through Vi and Jinx's entire journey thus far, from becoming in-game champions to characters featured in different cinematics to main characters in a TV show. Their arcs have grown so far beyond our original dreams, and we want to give the same treatment to more champions. 
</p>
<p>"We're currently working on our next projects across television and film, and we're hopeful that we can share more before the end of the year. We're still in the early stages of that, and these things do take a lot of time, but we want to share updates with you whenever we can."</p>
<divider></divider>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 4.45pm UK:</strong> 
You wait years for a new season of your favourite show, and then find out it's ending. In what looks like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-5-will-be-its-last">classic Netflix fashion</a>, today's action-packed trailer for Arcane season two describes the show's long-awaited second run of episodes as "The Final Chapter". 
</p>
<p>
Which, for possibly the best video game adaptation of all time, and just an incredible TV show in general, is pretty bad news. 
</p>
<p>
Spoilers abound for the show's first season here, as the trailer appears to answer what happened next after the first season's explosive cliffhanger ending.

<p>
Some (but clearly not all) of the series' characters from season one are present, in this, our best look at Arcane season two yet. It looks great! But hell, to find out these episodes are likely the end of Arcane's story already is a massive shame. 
</p>
<p>
Arcane's first nine-episode season debuted on Netflix in 2021. It took six years to make, and was showered by praise from fans of its League of Legends source material and newcomers alike. It was also critically adored, and won that year's Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program.
</p>
<p>
The show's upcoming second season has taken another three years to put together, and it was hoped its story would continue on further. There's still the possibility of another Arcane-style series set elsewhere within its universe, perhaps, but fans should now seemingly prepare themselves for the show's overall series finale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-two-teaser-reveals-a-big-new-character-and-sets-fan-tongues-wagging">when new episodes arrive this November</a>.

The bones of the game bear the shape of this team’s previous release, a board game titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Games-Multi-Colored-AGS-WOTR001-Players/dp/1903385113?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Games-Multi-Colored-AGS-WOTR001-Players/dp/1903385113?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23938020__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23938020__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>War of the Ring</em></a>, depicting the storied struggle at the heart of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It’s an epic experience that features clashing armies <em>and </em>the march to Mt. Doom <em>and</em> all of the most important characters in Tolkien’s novels. <em>War of the Ring</em>’s best aspect is the tactical dice system that controls the flow of play and composes the game loop. This is the main element carried ported over into <em>Dune: War for Arrakis</em>.</p>
<p id="vUsPmS">Each turn both players roll a pool of dice. These custom six-siders have various action icons and the results determine what you will be able to do during the round. Play then consists of going back and forth from Atreides to Harkonnen, each player assigning a die and executing an action. </p>
<p id="e4YUu5">This is a simple system. You spend a die to recruit troops or move them. You can also play special cards from your hand to spring nasty surprises or launch massive attacks. The dice pool acts as a restriction, forcing players into tough spots where you can’t perfectly execute a plan. The tactical challenge is in how you utilize your options to warp the board to your will.</p>

<p id="acyUYN">Victory, likewise, is nuanced. The Atreides have the tougher assignment as they need to focus on a small assortment of goals dealt out from the Prescience deck each turn. These encourage various maneuvers built broadly on the novel’s narrative, such as Paul drinking the Water of Life or Atreides using their Fremen warriors to attack vulnerable harvesters. They focus play on momentary considerations, forcing adaptation and bending to the environment — two central themes running throughout Herbert’s novel. </p>
<p id="0ya1rT">There is also incentive to control the ecological stations scattered about the map. These form hotspots as the Harkonnen player will typically try to defend them. Finally, Atreides will edge closer to success by taking the Harkonnen strongholds, such as the North Pole and Arrakeen. These are always well defended and a significant challenge, but with tools such as the fierce sandworms and the elite Fedaykin troops, such an offensive is possible.</p>
<p id="ID6Isy">The Harkonnen player has it a bit easier. Instead of pursuing dynamic objectives that change each round, they simply need to destroy 10 points of Fremen bases. The value of each sietch is hidden, but this number can be scouted with ornithopters as well as some clever card play. This is the more blunt faction, relying on marshaling legions of troops to root out the indigenous Fremen and annihilate them. It highlights the alternative philosophies of each house and incorporates one of the novel’s many motifs.</p>

<p id="ffBFQL">Both combat and the incorporation of named leaders on the battlefield are reminiscent of <em>War of the Ring</em>. Violence is simple: Each unit adds a die that yields either a hit, shield, or special leader buffs. Shields cancel out hits with the remainder applied as casualties to the army. The special leader buffs are the most intriguing aspect. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23930166/lego-dune-set-buy-order">Baron Harkonnen</a>, for instance, will offer defense while The Beast Rabban supplies extra blows. The special troops — Fedaykin and Sardaukar — add further texture by soaking multiple hits and negating the opponent’s defense results. This, while simple and easy to internalize, proves a surprisingly strong offensive toolset that results in the potential for devastating results. Fights resolve quickly and logically, framing dramatic moments that punctuate play and support the larger narrative arc of the game.</p>
<p id="vb9M65">Besides conflict, the leaders are a significant aspect due to how they enhance player actions. Paul allows you to perform a special action that rallies multiple legions to him. Rabban can execute a potent double move which allows you to strike behind enemy lines and gain separation. Still other leaders influence card acquisition or deploy special units to the board. As the narrative evolves, new leaders come into play. The result is an unique story path each playthrough, with some sessions never even witnessing the Reverend Mother or the great Wild Maker.</p>

<p id="etH8DU">There is a lot of detail here. The asymmetry of the two forces is a large part of the appeal. The Atreides/Fremen forces can ride worms across the desert with impunity, while Harkonnen legions left in the open desert are worn down by storms each round. Collecting spice is integral to the Harkonnen keeping the rest of the empire content and maintaining their economic advantage. There is bluffing and secrecy through hidden units and vicious card play. Despite all of this detail and the large amount of content, the game wraps up in a surprising two hours. It’s shocking how this framework is exceedingly capable of furnishing a full story arc with depth and precision in the alloted time.</p>
<p id="1CrEm0">Many of its accomplishments are a result of the design team iterating on <em>War of the Ring</em>, now in its second edition. Tweaks to leaders represent a significant improvement over that game, as they are now decoupled from the bonus dice they grant in Middle-earth. Here on Arrakis, the action system is more satisfying, as Atreides possess less dice but are able to perform the clever wormsign action on their turn — effectively manipulating the environment — instead of simply passing and waiting for their opponent to spend their extra dice. The time commitment is much shorter, as <em>War of the Ring</em> requires a huge chunk of the day to setup and play. There are other small improvements found in battle, the card system, and general game flow. The outcome is an experience that sits at this splendid intersection of grand strategy wargame with a more personal and intimate composition.</p>
<p id="BhDQfB">Despite these plaudits, it’s important to understand this is primarily a two-player game. It can function as a four-player endeavor with each faction split in half between a pair of players, but this is far less satisfying in practice and undercuts some of the design’s strengths. If a group of four players is in search of something to play, they would be much better off looking elsewhere.</p>

<p id="nYh1Xf">Of more significance is an issue of faction balance. Michele Garbuggio, a developer that worked in support of the design team on this game, has <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3304026/article/44306943#44306943">stated</a> that “by precise design intent, [<em>Dune: War for Arrakis</em>] is not balanced on a 50/50 win ratio…it’s more like a 60/40…in favor of the Harkonnen.” The intentionality behind this reflects the power disparity between the forces and the miraculous rise of the Kwisatz Haderach to lead the scattered Fremen. This does not detract from the overall power of the design. The vast majority of participants will engage this game casually and not in a tournament format, and in this more relaxed environment it’s of little consequence.</p>
<p id="Tzrjtg">Regardless of these minor concerns, <em>Dune: War for Arrakis</em> has burst from the sand with ferocity. This game offers an epic experience flush with drama and moments of grandeur. It successfully condenses and refines many of the concepts of its designer’s previous work, and it produces a special game that stands with its own identity. 2024 is only halfway complete, but it may have already received its best title. </p>

<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-summer-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised by BioWare</a>, Dragon Age: The Veilguard gameplay was shown off on Tuesday, June 11.  </p>



<p>The gameplay showcases some of the game’s story, various cutscenes, movement, combat, the environment, and more. This footage, according to BioWare, comes from the “opening moments of the game”, and doesn’t spoil much of the overall story and experience.</p>



<p>“This bold, heroic adventure is built to deliver on what Dragon Age is best known for: rich storytelling, fantasy worldbuilding, companions and fellowship, and a world where you matter,” BioWare says. </p>



<p>“It’s time to become the leader others believe in. Select from different races and combat classes, customize your appearance, choose your character’s backstory and begin your journey as Rook, Dragon Age’s newest hero. Be who you want to be and play how you want to play as you fight back and lead your team of seven companions, each with their own rich stories.”</p>



<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launches fall 2024 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>
