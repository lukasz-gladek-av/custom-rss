But once the price tag was revealed, sticker shock took over and largely drowned out more nuanced conversations about the new device.</p><h2 id="h115"><a id=""></a>How much better will games look on PS5 Pro?</h2><p>It’s easy to understand why. $700 is a lot to spend on a video game console, and adjusted for inflation is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-to-sell-a-more-powerful-700&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-to-sell-a-more-powerful-700" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third-highest price</a></span> Sony has charged for a new console. And the company’s presentation did it no favors in trying to sell players on the virtues of making a PS5 Pro their next big gaming purchase. Cerny’s presentation showed old games, including the next-gen port of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> which originally came out on the PS4. There was no new game running in 4K at 60fps to wow fans, and the differences with smoothness and background detail were hard to detect over the internet. Weirdly, only one outlet, <em>CNET</em>, seemed to have been invited to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/exclusive-hands-on-i-played-sonys-all-new-ps5-pro/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/exclusive-hands-on-i-played-sonys-all-new-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test the new hardware in-person</a></span>.</p><p>It wasn’t until some experts started looking at direct, lossless renders of the PS5 Pro gameplay footage that the improvements left a larger impression. “Wow, yeah, FF7R looks a LOT better on PS5 Pro,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/dark1x/status/1834165882039271867&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/dark1x/status/1834165882039271867" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> <em>Digital Foundry</em>’s John Linneman a couple of days after the initial reveal. “Night and day difference. I actually put off playing it due to other things happening at the time of release but the Pro will finally push me to enjoy it. Image quality was just too awful on normal PS5.”</p><p>The lowkey comment ignited a firestorm of replies and quote-tweets slamming the PS5 Pro and the critique of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>’s existing graphics on the base PS5. Which was weird, because the way that Square Enix’s sprawling RPG looked gorgeous when static but choppy in motion was widely covered at launch. If anything, it’s an ideal test case for the PS5 Pro upgrade: a third party game struggling to hold things together within the current limitations of the launch hardware.</p><h2 id="h116"><a id=""></a>A comparable PC is more expensive than people think</h2><p>  <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> is also the type of game that will be coming to PC in the future, where on higher-end machines it will likely look even better than on PS5 Pro. But how much will those gaming rigs cost relative to what Sony’s offering? We don’t have the full official specs for the PS5 Pro yet, but builds on sites like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pcpartpicker.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pcpartpicker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCPartPicker</a></span> run the gamut from a little more expensive to a <em>lot </em>more expensive. </p><p>For example, a barebones PC build by <em>IGN</em> trying to match the SSD storage and GPU power arrived at an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/you-can-build-a-pc-equivalent-to-the-ps5-pro-heres-how&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-can-build-a-pc-equivalent-to-the-ps5-pro-heres-how" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated cost of around $930</a></span>. Not bad for a machine that has access to Steam sales, Epic Games Store freebies, and doesn’t require you to pay a monthly subscription for online multiplayer. But other more conservative estimates put the price much higher. A custom build by<em> Techradar</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/gaming/pc-gaming/how-to-build-a-ps5-pro-pc-equivalent-gaming-rig&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/pc-gaming/how-to-build-a-ps5-pro-pc-equivalent-gaming-rig" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated the cost at closer to $1,200</a></span>, and that’s not even including a DualSense controller to get the most out of first-party Sony games once they’re ported to PC. Even that number might be low-baling it, though. </p><p>“Probably a fair bit more,” <em>Digital Foundry</em>’s Richard Leadbetter told <em>IGN</em> in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/videos/digital-foundry-on-the-ps5-pro-gta-6-others-unlikely-to-hit-60fps&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/digital-foundry-on-the-ps5-pro-gta-6-others-unlikely-to-hit-60fps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent interview</a></span> when asked how much a comparable PC would cost. “If you consider the holistic view of all the different components, the enhanced ray tracing—no AMD GPU has that at the moment—the machine learning block—no AMD GPU has that—it’s almost like essentially an Nvidia-style feature set but made by AMD and the closest equivalent GPU you’ll be locking at would be the RTX 4070. The 4060 is quite close to base PlayStation 5, factoring out machine learning and ray tracing, so you’re looking at a 4070.” </p><p>The cheapest versions of those GPUs often run over $500, with costs “ramping up” from there after including the 2TB SSD, motherboard, case, and other required PC parts.  Leadbetter stressed that the PS5 Pro price is still “crazy,” but that the math is a little more complicated, in addition to the product being largely pitched at existing PlayStation users who are unlikely to want to jump to PC and leave their existing game libraries behind. He also noted that the hardware jump from the PS5 to the PS5 Pro is smaller this time around than when Sony showcased the move from PS4 to PS4 Pro, which he largely blamed on an industry-wide struggle to bring down the costs of higher-performing tech. </p><h2 id="h117"><a id=""></a>What’s the PS5 Pro hate really about?</h2><p>Not everyone believes that Sony is putting its best foot forward with the PS5 Pro price. An<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FglPnj1eu2o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FglPnj1eu2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> opinion video</a></span> on the reveal by LinusTechTips blamed it in part on a lack of competition in the high-end console space. With PS5 reportedly outselling the Xbox Series X/S two-to-one, and a Switch 2 still not ready for primetime, the YouTube channel argues that there’s less pressure on Sony to cut its profit margins on the PS5 Pro and try to bring it in at a more appealing price point. </p><p>There’s some analysis to back up this argument. “With no comparable mid-gen upgrade from Microsoft, and Nintendo’s upcoming console expected to be less powerful than the base PS5, Sony is positioning the PS5 Pro as a premium offering for console gamers seeking superior graphics performance at a somewhat accessible price compared to high-end PCs,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/zhugeex.com/post/3l3zxyxuinu2p&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/zhugeex.com/post/3l3zxyxuinu2p" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> Daniel Ahmad, director of research and insights at Niko Partners, in a recent thread on the topic. </p><p>With the console aimed squarely at existing PS5 owners locked into a living room gaming setup, the Pro offers Sony the chance to sell the most powerful console on the market at an audience of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ballmatthew/status/1833531529747960244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ballmatthew/status/1833531529747960244" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price insensitive</a></span>” users willing to spend extra. “Manufacturing costs, including component prices such as for SSDs, continued to remain high post pandemic and have squeezed hardware margins,” Ahmad wrote. “The lack of overall console install base expansion from prior gens has also led to platform holders maximizing spend per user and expanding beyond console.”</p><p>Even if the Pro makes business sense for Sony, it doesn’t do anything to assuage the growing frustration with the PlayStation platform this console generation. While the PS4 era was typified by lower-cost debut hardware and the coming-online of a first-party studio system aimed at churning out one mega blockbuster after another, the PS5 era is synonymous with higher prices and a feeling of less innovation and experimentation.<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150"><em>Astro Bot</em> is a shiny exception</a></span> in a sea of first-party sequels that felt impressive but bloated compared to the novelty of their PS4-era predecessors. </p><p>Where are the brand-new Sony franchises? Where are the PS5 blockbusters pushing the envelope not just on graphics but in terms of storytelling, mechanics, and design? Instead of a big 2024 PlayStation showcase blowing them away, fans got <em>Concord</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-ps5-toxic-haters-heroes-shutdown-1851646309?_gl=1*i21kms*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjIzNDQzMi4xMzAuMS4xNzI2MjUzNTI0LjU4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-ps5-toxic-haters-heroes-shutdown-1851646309?_gl=1*i21kms*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjIzNDQzMi4xMzAuMS4xNzI2MjUzNTI0LjU4LjAuMA..">a live-service also-ran so out of sync</a></span> with the player base that Sony unceremoniously unreleased it inside of a month. In some ways Sony is a victim of its own success, and the lofty expectations that now accompany it. And so far the only thing that feels extraordinary about the PS5 Pro is its price. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Metro developer 4A Games is not leaving the Embracer Group for Saber Interactive after all. When Saber <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-splits-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> its split with Embracer six months ago, it also secured the rights to acquire the Ukrainian studio. However, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier confirmed today that the move won't actually happen.</p>
<p><em>Saber CEO Matt Karch told me in a statement this morning that "it was always our intention to exercise on 4A” but “we thought it would be better for all parties” for the studio to instead remain with Embracer.</em></p>
<p>The news didn't exactly sit well with fans, especially after Embracer closed down several studios and laid off many employees throughout the whole group. Perhaps they'll feel better when 4A Games finally unveils its next project. The publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-new-metro-game-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> a new Metro installment as early as August 2019, but we still haven't learned anything concrete other than a generic '202X' release window.</p>
<p>This year, series fans are <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sold-10-million-units-in-5-years-next-mainline-installment-coming-in-202x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting</a> a Virtual Reality game called Metro Awakening, but it's being developed by Vertigo Games (the maker of Arizona Sunshine) instead. According to the little info we have, it will be a prequel with a supernatural vibe:</p>
<p><em>The year is 2028. The survivors of nuclear Armageddon cling to existence in the buried subways of the Moscow Metro – civilization’s last refuge and tomb, where ghosts and spirits haunt the living in this man-made purgatory.</em></p>
<p><em>You are Serdar, a doctor braving the darkness, crippling radiation and deadly threats of the Metro in the search for your wife and the medication she so desperately needs. As your courage and sanity are pushed to the limit, you must learn to walk the line between life and death, the spirit and the material world, and awaken the being you will become…</em></p>
<p>The unveiling of the next mainline Metro title (which the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sdk-released-next-metro-influenced-by-russian-invasion-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said </a>will be influenced by their experience with the Russian war) could happen as soon as the upcoming The Game Awards event. It would be about time, certainly.</p>

                <p>There's nothing quite like Doom, especially after recent releases saw the series reinvent itself as a fast-paced arcade-shooter that wasn't afraid to paint the town red with demonic blood. A new entry in the series was recently revealed, and this time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> will see players create a medieval massacre when they take on the armies of the damned.</p><p>A dark fantasy with an over-the-top arsenal and a metal soundtrack, rumors of a Doom prequel began to appear in 2023 after court documents were leaked, with the game having the working title of Doom: Year Zero. Now that it's out in the wild, here's a closer look at everything we know about Doom: The Dark Ages so far.</p><h2>When will Doom: The Dark Ages be released?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366691-doomdarkages_0000_doomthedarkages_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366691" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366691-doomdarkages_0000_doomthedarkages_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366691"></a><figcaption>All hell is about to break loose on Argent D'Nur.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366691-doomdarkages_0000_doomthedarkages_01.jpg"></figure><p>As revealed during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5460/" data-ref-id="2900-5460">2024 Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages will be released in 2025.</p><h2>Doom: The Dark Ages platforms</h2><p>Doom: The Dark Ages will have a multi-platform release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. Microsoft owns the franchise but will continue to release new entries in the series on rival systems like PS5. It's a first-party game for Microsoft, so it should also be available via Game Pass.</p><h2>Will Doom: The Dark Ages be PS5 Pro enhanced?</h2><p>The number of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/" data-ref-id="2900-5758">games with a PS5 Pro Enhanced label</a> are still small for now, and Doom: The Dark Ages isn't currently on that list. Games developed by Id Software are typically some of the best-in-class when it comes to visuals, and the next Doom could certainly benefit from the extra horsepower of that system if it does get optimized for the high-end Sony console.</p><h2>Doom: The Dark Ages story, setting, and characters</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366690-doomdarkages_0001_doomthedarkages_announce_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366690" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366690-doomdarkages_0001_doomthedarkages_announce_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366690"></a><figcaption>The Doom Slayer is back, and rocking some furry fashion.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366690-doomdarkages_0001_doomthedarkages_announce_05.jpg"></figure><p>Doom: The Dark Ages bridges the gap between the original games from the '90s and the ones released in the 2010s, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom/" data-ref-id="5000-285543">Doom (2016)</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-eternal/" data-ref-id="5000-483372">Doom Eternal</a>. According to the lore entries of the previous games, Doom Guy wound up on the world of Argent D'Nur, home of Night Sentinels, and he was forced to fight in the gladiator pits after he was enslaved. After proving his worth in combat, the Doom Slayer joined the Night Sentinels, just in time for Hell's invasion of Argent D'Nur.</p><p>This is where The Dark Ages has the potential to tell one of the more exciting chapters in the Doom saga, as according to the lore, Doom Guy was empowered by Maykr technology in a last-ditch effort to stop the armies of Hell. After the Night Sentinels discovered that they had ultimately been betrayed by the Maykrs, who sided with Hell so that they could use the conflict to generate Argent Energy, the warriors and Doom Guy embarked on a suicide mission into Hell to throw a spanner in the plans of the Maykrs.</p><p>What we do know is that only Doom Guy survived, spending an eternity in Hell and becoming the Doom Slayer of legend.</p><h2>Doom: The Dark Ages gameplay</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3KftOn8YdE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g3KftOn8YdE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Like the other Doom games, the primary combat of The Dark Ages is pure run-and-gun action at its core. The game has a distinct push-forward sense of energy influenced by the original Doom games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-was-inspired-by-the-original-doom/1100-6524144/" data-ref-id="1100-6524144">according to The Dark Ages' directors Hugo Martin and Marty Stratton</a>.</p><p>"At the beginning of project, everybody kind of goes back and plays the original Doom," said Stratton. "There were so many things in that original game that just have have fueled us... It's always that evolution, but there's just so much of the DNA even with the way that we develop and our our team size. When we were talking about like what is Doom [in development], it was very much like borrowing from those ideas of the original Doom and Doom 2. As the brand has evolved and the ideas through the lore and all the different gameplay mechanics have evolved... it's amazing when you play the game you're just like 'this is unbelievable.'"</p><p>The directors also explained how the slower-moving projectiles in this game harken back to the first two Doom titles.</p><p>"I think in the original Doom, in the opening hours, we all remember imps or soldiers firing slow moving projectiles... and they hit hard," explained Martin. "And if you get hit by one of those, you're in a lot of trouble... That's where the movement comes in. Instead of constructing a multi-tiered arena... if we ground it, slow down the projectiles, make them hit way harder, and create patterns in the space, then that's the jungle gym you're going to move through."</p><p>What we haven't seen yet is how the health and ammo economy of The Dark Ages will function. 2016's Doom forced players to essentially use specific tools and moves to harvest what they needed from their enemies, and Doom Eternal built on that idea with a system of action, chainsaws, flamethrowers, and swords. It was a killer combo of rhythm and speed, and it'll be interesting to see how Doom's emphasis on rip and tearing through enemies will evolve in The Dark Ages.</p><h2>Doom: The Dark Ages weapons</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366689-doomdarkages_0002_doomthedarkages_announce_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366689" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366689-doomdarkages_0002_doomthedarkages_announce_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366689"></a><figcaption>The Doom Slayer has a fun new arsenal of weapons to play with.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366689-doomdarkages_0002_doomthedarkages_announce_04.jpg"></figure><p>Some of the best arsenals in video games can be found in the Doom games, and The Dark Ages looks set to continue that tradition of outrageous firepower. So far, we've seen the Doom Slayer's signature super-shotgun, a plasma-firing assault rifle, a rifle that fires railroad stakes, and a weapon that grinds up skulls and turns them into deadly pieces of high-velocity shrapnel. Officially, this is called the Skullcrusher, but unofficially, we're calling this our head-cannon.</p><h2>Doom: The Dark Ages shield</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366687-doomdarkages_0005_doomthedarkages_announce_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366687" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366687-doomdarkages_0005_doomthedarkages_announce_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366687"></a><figcaption>Even the toughest demons will be forced to yield to the shield.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366687-doomdarkages_0005_doomthedarkages_announce_01.jpg"></figure><p>Interestingly, The Dark Ages will also see the Doom Slayer wield a shield in combat, proving that the best defense is a metal-bladed shield-saw that can be thrown through demons as if you were a bloodthirsty version of Captain America. Not only can you block attacks and push through enemy fire with the shield, but you'll even be able to parry enemies when you nail the timing of it. In the brief snippet of gameplay we've seen so far, the Doom Slayer hurls the shield like a demonic frisbee through cannon fodder enemies, ricochets off a wall to do even more damage, and catches it in one fluid motion, readying it for use against the legions of Hell.</p><p>While you'll have to wait until 2025 to feel what it's like in action, one enterprising modder has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/that-cool-ass-doom-the-dark-ages-shield-has-been-modded-into-og-doom/1100-6524198/" data-ref-id="1100-6524198">inserted it into the original Doom game</a>.</p><h2>Can you ride a dragon in Doom: The Dark Ages?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366688-doomdarkages_0004_doomthedarkages_announce_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366688" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366688-doomdarkages_0004_doomthedarkages_announce_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366688"></a><figcaption>The bar has officially been raised for dragons in video games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366688-doomdarkages_0004_doomthedarkages_announce_02.jpg"></figure><p>Hell yeah, you can! While there aren't too many details on it yet, we do know that the Doom Slayer will mount a jet-fueled, cybernetic war dragon in the game.</p><h2>Can you pilot a Pacific Rim-style mech against Godzilla-sized demons?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366686-doomdarkages_0003_doomthedarkages_announce_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366686" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366686-doomdarkages_0003_doomthedarkages_announce_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366686"></a><figcaption>Godzilla, beware.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4366686-doomdarkages_0003_doomthedarkages_announce_03.jpg"></figure><p>You bet your chainsaw-shield that you can rip and tear on a titanic scale, thanks to the Atlan mech.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on Doom: The Dark Ages in the days, weeks, and months to come!</p>

			<p>Just a couple of weeks ago, Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a partnership with Annapurna to co-finance (with an even split) the development of Control 2, as well as to develop movies and TV shows based on the Control and Alan Wake IPs.</p>
<p>When it was discovered that Annapurna Interactive's entire team had resigned, fans were understandably worried about the fate of the aforementioned partnership. However, Remedy Communications Director Thomas Puha <a href="https://x.com/RiotRMD/status/1834409934202589679" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> that the deal was actually with Annapurna Pictures and is, therefore, unaffected.</p>
<p><em>Many of you are reaching out about the news around Annapurna (sorry to see what is going on to all involved ) Interactive. Thank you for your care! Remedy's deal for Control 2, including Alan Wake and Control AV rights, is with Annapurna Pictures, and we are self-publishing Control 2.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Remedy is currently working on the second Alan Wake 2 DLC, titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-dlc-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lake House</a>. Here's the premise of this DLC slated to launch at some point next month:</p>
<p><em>The Lake House is a mysterious facility situated on the shores of Cauldron Lake set up by an independent government organization to conduct secret research… until something goes wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>Explore the Lake House and embark on an adventure as the realities of the Pacific Northwest and the Dark Place collide again.</em></p>
<p>Beyond Control 2, which is in the 'production readiness' stage, Remedy is also cooking the Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remakes (for Rockstar) and Project Condor, a multiplayer spin-off based on the Control IP. On the other hand, in May, the Finnish game developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-cancels-co-op-multiplayer-game-project-kestrel-formerly-vanguard-will-focus-on-alan-wake-and-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> the live service game Project Kestrel. Formerly known as Project Vanguard, it was conceived as a free-to-play game to be published in partnership with Tencent. It was later rebooted as a premium game, but even this new incarnation didn't last.</p>
<p>By the way, other Annapurna Interactive projects like Wanderstop and Mixtape are also reportedly unaffected by the division's demise.</p>

In the meantime, Sony has managed to dominate with a relatively lean first-party lineup, all the while porting and releasing some of its biggest hits on PC.</p><p>Now, many of those PC hits are on sale, and with very little to be excited about this fall season, you may as well dip your toe into the best games Sony has to offer while they’re cheap. Here’s what to pick up on PlayStation’s PC sale.</p></div></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332">I’ve written exhaustively about <em>Helldivers 2</em></a></span>, the cooperative third-person shooter from Arrowhead Studios that took the world by storm when it launched earlier this year. I don’t think Sony expected it to be its biggest game of the year, but often the best things in life can’t be predicted. Since its meteoric rise, the game (as well as the studio behind it) have been in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071">hot water</a></span> with the fanbase over <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-framerate-1851622269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-framerate-1851622269">countless balancing </a></span>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-dark-fluid-mission-fix-arrowhead-1851512049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-dark-fluid-mission-fix-arrowhead-1851512049">quality-of-life issues</a></span>, but that hasn’t ever stopped <em>Helldivers 2 </em>from being a good time when enjoyed in the right company. At the end of the day, it’s still fun as hell to drop into increasingly ravenous hordes of enemies, be they killer bugs or robots, and wage a constantly escalating and satirized war against them. It’s still fun to dive just out of the way of a barrage of missiles and land a well-placed shot from an autocannon into the weak spot of an enemy just in the nick of time. <em>Helldivers 2 </em>regularly churns out incredible stories of survival and endurance (or just baffling good luck) in the face of all odds, and that’s what the game’s all about. <strong>You can dive into hell with some good friends and kill some bad bugs by picking up </strong><em><strong>Helldivers 2 </strong></em><strong>for just $32 on Steam and Humble.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Throughout the PS3’s lifetime, Naughty Dog put itself on the map by releasing the first three <em>Uncharted </em>games to widespread acclaim and popularity. These action-adventure games made a household name of protagonist Nathan Drake, who became the generation’s golden boy and made the franchise Sony’s prized possession. Though the studio would eventually move on to <em>The Last of Us </em>(more on that in a bit) Naughty Dog did come back in 2016 to properly finish Nate’s story with <em>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End </em>and its 2017 spinoff, <em>The Lost Legacy</em>. I happen to like these last two installments quite a lot, with the former putting a neat bow on Nate’s story that leaves the door propped open for other protagonists and tales, which allows <em>The Lost Legacy </em>to deliver on by letting us play as his longtime ally Chloe Frazer in an adventure that rivals the mainline games’ best stuff. These are also the two games that come bundled together in the <em>Legacy of Thieves Collection</em>, which uprezzed either title for the PS5 and brought them to the PC in the first place. <strong>Now, you can tackle some of the series’ best setpieces and heartfelt moments by snagging </strong><em><strong>Uncharted Legacy of Thieves Collection </strong></em><strong>for $25 on Steam, Humble, or GOG.</strong></p></div><div><p>I’ve got a soft spot for Insomniac’s <em>Spider-Man </em>games. I can’t help it. He’s been my favorite hero since I was a kid and my whole life has been dominated by him. I grew up with the Sam Raimi flicks, watched the Sony-produced <em>Amazing Spider-Man </em>movies as a teenager, and by the time Tom Holland took over the role in the MCU, I was a young adult who’d spent a lifetime admiring the friendly neighborhood superhero. I love that he’s just a kid from New York—whether it’s Peter in Queens or Miles in Harlem—and that he lives like the rest of us and has to pay rent by slinging pizza and taking crappy jobs around town. Dropping me into his shoes is always going to go over pretty well, and the <em>Spider-Man </em>games are respectable blockbusters with a lot of heart and some of the breeziest storytelling and gameplay in the AAA space.<br></p><p>It is so <em>easy</em> to enjoy the fantasy of swinging around the city as either Peter or Miles and it never fails to produce a grin or a boost to my mood to zip around and do things Spider-Man would do. Both are also easy heroes to root for, and Insomniac’s version of Peter might be the most personable and down-to-earth take on the guy ever. Watching him websling across the city while engaging in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/spider-man-s-text-message-scene-is-perfect-1829449521&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-s-text-message-scene-is-perfect-1829449521">tense text conversation</a></span> with MJ is still one of the high points of the entire generation of games and shows that Insomniac really understood what this character was about and why we love him so much.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-s-spider-man-miles-morales-the-kotaku-review-1845581003&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-s-spider-man-miles-morales-the-kotaku-review-1845581003"><em>Miles Morales</em></a></span>, a sort of sequel to the first game, establishes Peter’s successor and centers a hero who is much closer to my heart. We may be from opposite sides of the same city, but our heritage takes us back to a pretty similar place, and I love that boricua king with all that I can muster. He’s the blueprint for the heroes I never grew up with: ones who kind of look and sound like me. I would protect him and his bodega cat with my life.<strong> Do yourself a favor and pick up </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/spiderman-remastered-review-pc-insomniac-ray-tracing-1849391687&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/spiderman-remastered-review-pc-insomniac-ray-tracing-1849391687"><em><strong>Spider-Man Remastered</strong></em></a></span>&nbsp;<strong>and <em>Miles Morales </em>on Steam or Humble for $36 and $30, respectively.</strong></p></div><div><p>We don’t say it enough but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/returnal-the-kotaku-review-1846786237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/returnal-the-kotaku-review-1846786237"><em>Returnal</em></a></span><em> </em>is probably one of the best games of this generation. Housemarque knocked it out of the park in this grueling roguelike that spins hell out of a procedurally generated alien planet. Selene, the game’s protagonist, is a rarity in games—a middle-aged woman—and <em>Returnal </em>follows her after she crash lands on a curious planet and tries to blast her way home. Everything from the movement and gunplay to the trickle of abilities and upgrades is finely tuned in <em>Returnal</em>, but it’s really the presentation that takes the cake. Helios feels alien. Its structures and biomes resemble our own, but there’s a menacing aura about them. The planet feels like it’s withholding something crucial from Selene, and no matter how hard she tries, she can’t seem to crack it. It taunts her, and by extension, you, and throws you for literal loops as you die and crash land again and again in search of a way to break free and go home. <strong>Get caught in </strong><em><strong>Returnal</strong></em><strong>’s loop by picking it up for $36 on Steam or Humble.</strong></p></div><div><p>I never really <em>loved </em>the <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank </em>games in the past. I’ve played a few, namely <em>Size Matters </em>on PSP, but the wider series never clicked with me. That was until I parked myself on my friend’s couch while on vacation and blasted through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-the-kotaku-review-1847047303&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-the-kotaku-review-1847047303"><em>Rift Apart</em></a></span> in record time. What an absolutely vibrant, beautiful, and joyous game it is, the kind of game that PlayStation’s been lacking lately, and one that shows the company finally seems to understand it should be making these games alongside heavyweight “prestige” titles like <em>God of War </em>and <em>Horizon</em>. <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart </em>is much the same as any game in the series, but it wields the (at the time) new PS5’s technology to render a world that <em>feels </em>like it’s teeming with playfulness. A gun opens portals that make use of the console’s powerful SSD to transport randomized elements and characters into the fray. You seamlessly jump between perspectives and characters in manners that are not only buttery smooth, but awe-inspiring. It’s not just impressive to look at, it’s a pleasure to behold and I’m sure that’s especially true of its PC port. <strong>Aside from </strong><em><strong>Astro Bot</strong></em><strong>, I’d say </strong><em><strong>Rift Apart </strong></em><strong>is one of a handful of PS5 titles everyone should have, and you can now grab it on Steam or Humble for $36.</strong><br></p></div><div><p><em>God of War: Ragnarok </em>is landing on PC <em>very</em> soon, which means now’s a pretty appropriate time to check out the game that kicked off Kratos’ Nordic rampage. Back in 2018, <em>God of War</em> shook things up thanks to its tonal differences from the games that came before it, a drastic shift in gameplay, and a new pantheon of gods to face off against. It retains the series’ longstanding emphasis on scale, but distilled it into setpieces with a sharper focus than that of its predecessors. It also kickstarted the rehabilitation of Kratos, one of gaming’s foremost toxic assholes—where you come down on the success of that is entirely up to you. I aint here to yuck anyone’s yums. <strong>I am here to tell you that </strong><em><strong>God of War </strong></em><strong>is $20 on Steam, Humble, and GOG, so do with that what you will, boy.</strong></p></div><div><p><em>The Last of Us Part I </em>is, annoyingly, the third version of this game, despite the title. Originally released as the swan song of the PS3, <em>The Last of Us </em>was eventually remastered for PS4 before being completely remade for no apparent reason a few years back. <em>Part I </em>made it to PC last year where it was absolutely busted, but the game is in significantly better shape now. Though I still wonder why it was made at all, there’s no denying the lasting impact of <em>The Last of Us</em>, which has since spawned a controversial sequel and a hit show for HBO. It’s one of <em>the </em>games of the 2010s, for better or worse, and you probably owe it to yourself to check it out while it’s on the cheap. You’re not going to find a <em>technically </em>better version of the first game than this, even if it is a bummer that it’s missing the original’s incredible multiplayer mode. <strong>Prepare to cry before grabbing </strong><em><strong>The Last of Us Part I </strong></em><strong>on Steam or Humble for $36.</strong></p></div><div><p>If you’ve just finished up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span><em> </em>and are looking for other adorable platformers on the PS5, there’s not many of them! Hopefully that’ll change in the near future, but in the meantime, you’ve got <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sackboy-a-big-adventure-the-kotaku-review-1845700699&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sackboy-a-big-adventure-the-kotaku-review-1845700699"><em>Sackboy: A Big Adventure</em></a></span>. Both games are similarly charming, and <em>Sackboy: A Big Adventure </em>even manages to successfully separate itself from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150">brand-heavy identity</a></span> that began encroaching on the <em>LittleBigPlanet </em>titles, which feels all-consuming in <em>Astro Bot</em>. In this 3D platformer, you play as the titular character in a familiar world of arts and crafts that constantly challenges you with new and inventive tasks. You can play the game cooperatively with up to three other players, which retains the chaos of <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>’s multiplayer but fits it into a different mold of game this time around. It’s a blast, even if it errs on the side of being a simpler game for kids more often than not. <strong>You and three of your favorite people can jump and punch your way through </strong><em><strong>Sackboy: A Big Adventure </strong></em><strong>for $30 on Steam or Humble.</strong></p></div><div><p>Over the years, PlayStation has put out some pretty notable games, but most of them have been fairly linear. <em>Horizon </em>was its biggest open-world series, and probably still is, but for my money, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-steam-reviews-1851605129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-steam-reviews-1851605129"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a></span><em> </em>is probably the better one. Cribbing from the style of the works of the acclaimed filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>is a samurai action game set in a Ubisoft-style open world. Funny how PlayStation beat Ubisoft and <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>to that punch…</p><p><em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>is, in a word, cinematic. It’s minimalistic, often guiding players by the visualization of wind blowing through fields and trees. Its combat is a mixture of stealth gameplay and more direct clashes, but all of it has a sheen and elegance to it that PlayStation prides itself on. It’s restrained and even quiet in a way that open-world games, which are prone to bloat, rarely are and it’s much appreciated. It actually stands apart in its field, and on top of that, it’s got a cooperative multiplayer mode that is apparently a hoot and a half?<strong> You can get PlayStation’s best open-world game by grabbing </strong><em><strong>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut</strong></em><strong> for $48 on Steam and Humble.</strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>Astro Bot could very well be the best PlayStation exclusive for this console generation--and an opportunity for Sony to refocus.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>PlayStation is not what it used to be; some of that, of course, is for good reason. You'd be hard-pressed to argue that Cloud Strife looked better when he was a pile of polygons, or that stealth-game controls peaked with 1998's Metal Gear Solid. Technology has evolved, bringing us not necessarily <em>better </em>games but games offering visuals and overall experiences that were previously unfathomable. And just as technology has changed, so have the companies implementing it--companies like Sony.</p><p dir="ltr">Originally a home for RPGs and platforming mascots, PlayStation has spent the past few decades intensely focused on cinematic single-player games, with narratives that eschew early-aughts whimsy in favor of morally conflicted anti-heroes. Despite the incongruity between those two styles, both were hugely successful for the company. But now, PlayStation is changing its focus yet again, only this time into an arena so competitive that there's no guarantee even this titan of video games will see any measure of success: live-service games. So far, the company's path to success has been bumpy, but it quietly might have just taken a big step in the right direction towards achieving its goal.</p><p dir="ltr">Back in 2022, Sony decided to be up front about its vision for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-projects-launching-12-live-service-games-by-2025/1100-6503924/">the future of PlayStation</a>, revealing to investors that PlayStation Studios has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-planning-to-invest-heavily-into-live-service-games-with-bungie-buyout/1100-6500131/">"an aggressive road map with live services"</a> and was aiming to launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-sales-surpass-17-million-10-live-service-games-coming-by-2026/1100-6500204/">"more than 10 live-service games by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026."</a> Sony executive deputy president and interim CEO Hiroku Totoki stated that this was part of the company's overall plan to "expand into the live-game services area," which was yielding success for studios like Epic, MiHoYo, and Bungie, the latter of which was already in the process of being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-acquired-by-sony-for-3-6-billion/1100-6500122/">acquired by Sony</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366697-3947584-2022_twq_the_last_chance_compressed11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366697" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366697-3947584-2022_twq_the_last_chance_compressed11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366697"></a><figcaption>A Destiny 2 character confronts enemies.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366697-3947584-2022_twq_the_last_chance_compressed11.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Yet things haven't been going quite as planned at the company. For starters, it's been reported that a number of employees were upset by former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/">mandated pivot towards live-service games</a>--a fact that is not all that surprising considering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/poll-shows-majority-of-game-devs-worry-about-live-service-sustainability/1100-6522748/">developers' concerns regarding live-service stability</a>. According to former PlayStation developer David Jaffe, the creator of Twisted Metal and co-creator of God of War, this was part of the reason that long-time PlayStation developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/">Connie Booth was reportedly fired</a>. Jaffe claimed that multiple sources told him that Booth "was somehow blamed" for the initiative. Though the truth behind Booth's departure is not entirely clear, the outcome was the end of her 30-year career at Sony, during which she played a key role in producing Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Jak &amp; Daxter, Ratchet &amp; Clank, Sly, Marvel's Spider-Man, Resistance, Uncharted, Infamous, and The Last of Us.</p><p dir="ltr">A month later, Totoki informed investors that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/">only half of the promised live-service titles would be ready by Spring 2026</a>. This was followed by the news that two of its live-service titles--a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/">The Last of Us multiplayer game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unannounced-twisted-metal-live-service-game-canceled-report/1100-6521393/">an unannounced Twisted Metal project</a>--we're being scrapped entirely. Though the reason the Twisted Metal title was scrapped is not clear, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog was quick to release a statement following the news, writing:</p><p dir="ltr">"To release and support The Last of Us Online we'd have to put all our studio resources behind supporting post-launch content for years to come, severely impacting development on future single-player games. So, we had two paths in front of us: Become a solely live-service-games studio or continue to focus on single-player narrative games that have defined Naughty Dog's heritage."</p><p dir="ltr">In February 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cutting-900-jobs-in-video-game-industrys-latest-round-of-big-cuts/1100-6521383/">Sony announced it was laying off 900 employees</a> in a move that would eliminate its VR-focused London studio and affect production at Firesprite, Insomniac Games, Naughty Dog, and Guerrilla. Layoffs continued later that summer, when the Sony-owned studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-plans-to-optimize-overall-studio-structure-at-bungie-following-destiny-layoffs/1100-6525636/">Bungie laid off 17% of its workforce</a>, and then migrated 12% of its remaining staff to other departments at PlayStation. Despite this news, however, Totoki reaffirmed that Sony would continue to go all-in on live-service titles.</p><p dir="ltr">In that same briefing, Sony stated it had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-major-sony-franchise-game-releases-are-coming-until-april-2025-at-earliest/1100-6521071/">unable to meet its goal</a> of selling 25 million PS5s during the current financial year--causing it to revise its projection to 21 million sales and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-loses-10-billion-in-market-value-due-to-ps5-sales-forecast-cut/1100-6521224/">lose $10 billion in market value</a>--and that the PS5 was now in the "latter stage" of its life cycle. Fortunately, one of Sony's promised live-service titles, Concord, was almost ready to launch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366699-feb498bc7a874470e7ff763b7935460b21442b0c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366699" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366699-feb498bc7a874470e7ff763b7935460b21442b0c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366699"></a><figcaption>A space ship console in Concord.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366699-feb498bc7a874470e7ff763b7935460b21442b0c.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Yet when Concord finally launched in August 2024, it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-big-new-ps5-and-pc-game-concord-got-off-to-a-slow-start/1100-6526101/">met with little fanfare</a>. Upon release, the game peaked at a dismal 697 concurrent users on Steam. And while PlayStation 5 player numbers are not publicly available, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/100138/concord-is-511-on-steams-top-sellers-list-but-42-the-playstation-store/index.html" rel="nofollow ">Tweaktown</a> discovered that Concord ranked at No. 50 on the PlayStation Store's <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/d0446d4b-dc9a-4f1e-86ec-651f099c9b29/2" rel="nofollow ">PS5 best-sellers chart</a>. Two weeks after launch, Sony announced it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/">removing the game from sale and shutting down its servers</a>. The game may return in the future, but this was not the new foothold in the live-service space that Sony was surely hoping for.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite all of this, Sony recently revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/">PS5 is getting an upgraded model</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/">PS5 Pro</a>. However, the upcoming console's $700 price tag--and that's without the $80 disc drive you can<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-buy-a-disc-drive-for-ps5-pro/1100-6526391/"> purchase separately</a>, mind you-- the lack of dramatic technical differences between the PS5 and PS5 Pro, and Sony's overall lack of PS5 exclusive titles, means this announcement was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-internet-reacts-to-ps5-pros-700-price-tag/1100-6526397/">largely met with scorn</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">However, I think Sony has an opportunity to course correct.</p><p dir="ltr">On September 6, PlayStation released Astro Bot, a charming platformer with a ton of heart and absolutely glowing reviews. On the surface, the game is a celebration of PlayStation and its history, as throughout it, you unlock bots that are made to look like some of the consoles' greatest characters--both from exclusive titles and third-party games notably associated with the company--all while piloting a PS5 controller. Yet to dismiss the game as pure Sony nostalgia, or reduce it as an ode to the unfortunate IP collectathon currently happening in the games industry, discredits what makes it truly special.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/">As GameSpot's Mark Delaney put so eloquently</a>, Astro Bot is "a platformer whose incredible ambition is matched by its brilliant execution." It feels fantastic to play, offers bountiful exciting mechanics that--while different--never feel disparate, and creates gorgeous worlds that feel natural to explore yet constantly surprise and delight. It's a game that rivals the likes of Super Mario Odyssey and beyond that, it's <em>fun</em>. Pure, wondrous fun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366706-ps2slim%2814%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4366706" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366706-ps2slim%2814%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4366706"></a><figcaption>Astro Bot glides through the air alongside flamingos.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366706-ps2slim%2814%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In recent years, Sony has proven it can tell a great story. Their exclusive titles are known for their complex characters, emotional narratives, and well-conceived worlds. But in the midst of all that, it feels like Sony forgot about the joy of simple fun. It forgot about all the different kinds of players that exist, and what they long to see. And it forgot about all the series that, while heralded in Astro Bot, have effectively disappeared.</p><p dir="ltr">Though folks online love to call me a Sony Pony anytime I throw any sort of criticism at Xbox--here's hoping this piece clears that up a bit!--the only time I truly felt like a Sony fangirl was when I was a child. I remember the transition from the Nintendo 64 to the PlayStation--it absolutely blew my mind. I remember the variety of games my family obtained over the course of a few years: Tomb Raider, Spider-Man, Time Crisis, Spyro the Dragon, Crash Bandicoot, Silent Hill, Tekken, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, and a small mountain of Final Fantasy games, my family's favorite. When the Xbox launched in 2001, I saw zero reason I would ever need it. I already had my portal to every world I could ever want to visit.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, I'd eventually find a lot of value in Xbox and return to Nintendo, and these days, I don't feel a closeness to PlayStation anymore. I'm sure this is partially due to my age and how the years inevitably come with a loss of childlike whimsy, but I know there are other factors, too. I'm not jaded, I still love games, and I could <em>easily</em> list dozens that have come out even in the last few years that I think are phenomenal. But to me, PlayStation just doesn't quite feel <em>special </em>anymore. But Astro Bot does. And it also reminds me of how it used to feel.</p><p dir="ltr">Astro Bot feels like a chance to reignite the brand's charm and perhaps even alter what live-service means for PlayStation, if that's the path it intends to walk down. Whereas it seems like Sony is sticking to a very particular type of live-service game--one that is oversaturated and that it can't seem to quite find an audience for, as Concord's lack of success would indicate--the company has already revealed a plan to add more characters and levels to Astro Bot, and it could easily add more. It'd certainly make sense; it's a game that feels simple to expand upon and has a foundation sturdy enough to cradle that expansion. Why continue to toil over creating a fun live-service title that sticks when you have a game that is proven to be fun and whose structure lends itself to being expanded?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366705-ps2slim%2814%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4366705" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366705-ps2slim%2814%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4366705"></a><figcaption>A bot is dressed as God of War's Kratos.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4366705-ps2slim%2814%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Sure, this doesn't fit the bill when it comes to satisfying PlayStation's desire to create a Forever Game--one that incentivizes players to log in daily, participate in seasonal content, and, to put it plainly, fork over cash on things like battle passes, skins, and loot boxes. But why is this well-established (and increasingly criticized) model the only way forward? Players have begun to see the vast majority of them for what they are: a somewhat predatory way to continuously rake in money. Games, and the amount of money companies are willing to spend making them, are growing monstrous in size yet it feels as if developers are forced to work in the confines of a narrow, short-sighted scope. It's easy to see where this leads, and it's not a place I want to see the industry go.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet at my most cynical and business-minded, Astro Bot still feels like a revenue booster, as it is a fantastic marketing opportunity for the company. Much like how Super Smash Bros. is said to have <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/98904/how-super-smash-bros-melee-introduced-fire-emblem-to-western-audiences" rel="nofollow ">contributed to Fire Emblem's success in the West</a>, Sony now has a great avenue to introduce new characters, showcase indies, reignite interest in previous titles, and gauge what audiences are responding to or demand more of. When I played through Astro Bot, there were certain characters I didn't know and was compelled to learn more about, as well as others that I had simply forgotten about but was delighted to see again. It made me want to buy and install games I hadn't thought about in years. And it goes beyond the generation who grew up with these characters; my two-year-old son was <em>fascinated</em> by Spyro, which led to me redownloading the Reignited Trilogy and spending an hour introducing him to the feisty little dragon. This is the power that game currently wields, and it's not a small one.</p><p dir="ltr">But beyond that, Astro Bot also proves that Sony can still do different types of games exceptionally well. It proves that Sony is still innovative, and its games still fun. Before Astro Bot, I couldn't tell you the last time a PlayStation platformer <em>truly </em>gave a Nintendo platformer a run for its money, but here we are. I wish Sony knew it doesn't necessarily need to pursue live-service. In fact, I'd argue it shouldn't. There are other paths to success--paths that invest in studios' unique visions, foster creativity, and delight players.</p><p>I can't claim to know if the live-service bubble has truly burst or if the market is grossly oversaturated to the point where no room remains, but I do know that myself and <em>many</em> others are certainly fatigued by it all. The money-grabbing is as transparent as the stagnation, and something needs to change. Here's hoping that Sony can sense that too.</p>

While actual details on the event are still few ahead of its debut on September 17, the trailer reveals WoW-themed skins for the aforementioned heroes as well for Zenyatta (cosplaying as Thrall) and Torbjorn (as Magni Bronzebeard).</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 x World of Warcraft | Collaboration Trailer</p>

<p dir="ltr">As part of the event, Blizzard says players will be able to choose to represent WoW's two main factions, the Horde or the Alliance.</p><p dir="ltr">"Join the celebration as Overwatch 2 and World of Warcraft unite the realms for a legendary crossover event," the trailer's description reads. "Choose to represent the Horde or the Alliance as the mighty heroes of Overwatch honor the iconic characters from the world of Azeroth."</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting this isn't the first time WoW-themed skins have been available in Overwatch, nor the first time Blizzard's shooter has crossed over with another Blizzard property. Skins turning Doomfist into Orc warchief Blackhand, an Illidan Stormrage skin for Genji, and two skins for Symetra (one turning her into a Blood Elf, another transforming her into Night Elf leader Tyrande Whisperwind), have previously been available. There is already an existing Magni Bronzebeard skin for Torbjorn as well, though the new skin seen in the trailer shows him in his diamond "Speaker of Azeroth" form.</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch's last <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-7-is-getting-a-hellish-crossover-with-diablo-4/1100-6518115/" data-ref-id="1100-6518115">Blizzard crossover was themed around Diablo 4</a>, and introduced a new PvE game mode where players collected power-ups to face off against enemies like Azmodan Wrecking Ball, Butcher Roadhog, and Lilith Moira.</p><p dir="ltr">As for how WoW itself is celebrating its 20th birthday, Blizzard announced it will be releasing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-bringing-back-its-most-iconic-armor-sets-for-massive-20th-anniversary-update/1100-6526277/" data-ref-id="1100-6526277">massive 20th-anniversary update</a> for the game later this year, filled with activities and rewards that harken back to the MMO's early days. Overwatch 2, meanwhile, recently introduced its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-12-introduces-juno-lets-players-become-egyptian-gods/1100-6525795/" data-ref-id="1100-6525795">newest support hero, Juno</a>.</p>

Bungie didn’t offer an explanation to <em>The Verge</em>; Hasbro didn’t immediately reply.</p><p>But yesterday, Tofu told <em>The Verge</em> that Bungie had already been “polite and encouraging” in private messages, saying she was hopeful the situation could be resolved soon, since Bungie has dealt with similar issues in the past.</p><p>Indeed, this isn’t the first or even the second time that Bungie or a contractor has plagiarized <em>Destiny </em>fan art, but it has compensated and credited some previous fan artists after it was called out.</p><div><p>The plagiarism wasn’t the only controversy around the new Nerf blaster. To order <a href="https://bungiestore.com/bungie-rewards-nerf-ace-of-spades-blaster">the $50 replica of Cayde’s Ace of Spades handcannon</a>, players first have to unlock the Legend status in the game, which reportedly takes <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-responds-destiny-2-10th-anniversary-title/">an incredible amount of grinding</a>, something that Bungie has pledged<a href="https://x.com/destiny2team/status/1833652758446215528?s=46"> to somewhat fix</a>. </p></div><p>“If you’re an existing player, you likely have a lot of the prerequisites to start earning the title but new players would require an almost comical time investment,” my colleague Nick Statt tells me.</p><p>That’s a shame, because I’d have loved to own this blaster. It looks like one of the best licensed blasters Hasbro has yet made, a six-shot revolver with two removable cylinders and battery-powered motors for blasting. Years ago when Nerf did a licensed <em>Overwatch </em>revolver, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DxGhuKbgbV4w">it didn’t actually revolve</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/v-rising">V Rising</a>, you're a fledgling vampire on a mission to become absolute bossferatu of a Gothic open world. You get a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo</a>-ish combat system, the ability to shapeshift into a spider, and a whole castle to prance around in, crooning at the moon. I like this premise almost as much as I dislike the fact that V Rising is also a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game, in which you must fell trees and master a crafting system like a common turnip farmer.
</p>
<p>
What do we hope for when our interest in a game is almost perfectly balanced by our disinterest? We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.

<p>Here are some things that intrigue and beguile me about V Rising, based on how it's been described to me. Firstly, you actually have to worry about sunlight, a traditional vampire weakness that gets tidied under the carpet in a lot of Hollywood adaptations - looking at you, Gary Oldman. You'll need to drink blood regularly and it confers different benefits depending on your victim, which encourages you to develop a palate, rather than pouncing and draining without distinction. You can summon things like death knights, and teleport your castle around like in the Castlevania show (once it's levelled up, at least).</p>
<p>Still, it's hard to look past the survival game taint, which seems totally contrary to the vampire premise. "To become a more powerful bloodsucker, you have to craft leather pants and copper swords and raise your gear score a la Destiny," Edders wrote in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/v-rising-10-review">V Rising 1.0 review</a>. "To gain power is to build things, until the thing you want to build requires you to build something else. And to build that something else, you need something else."</p>
<p>This is not how Dracula did it, Edders! Vampires are supposed to be monstrously decayed aristocrats! If Dracula wanted some new leather trousers, he'd champ on the tanner's neck and turn him into a ghoul minion. Please, Edders: tell me this is possible in the game.</p>
<p>If the non-free version hooks your interest, V Rising is currently 30 percent off with 20 percent off its cosmetic DLC (including a Castlevania-themed DLC pack) until 24th September. Find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/">Steam</a>. I guess I'll give it a shot myself, but I ain't crafting no pants.

<p>When Nightingale first launched into Early Access on Steam, it did so as a relatively buggy mess. It was challenging to play online, or even solo, due to the number of frame drops and disconnections, considering the game required an internet connection. But developer Inflexion Games didn’t throw in the towel. They’re working diligently to improve the survival crafting experience tenfold. The most significant step in its journey is the Nightingale Realms Rebuilt content update for patch 0.5!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-biggest-additions-in-nightingale-realms-rebuilt">The Biggest Additions in Nightingale Realms Rebuilt</h2>



<p>They’re calling this the “most ambitious update” for the game to date, completely revamping the overall experience from start to finish to ensure new and returning players can dive into the new story content and reworked gameplay mechanics. You can check out the gameplay overview trailer for Nightingale Realms Rebuilt below, and a little further down, we have an overview of our very own with what you can expect from the massive update!</p>

<li>New spells and magic that enhance your abilities and give you additional play styles to mess about with.</li>



<li>Additional charms to enhance equipment.</li>



<li>Resource management and consumption mechanic overhaul.</li>



<li>Additional estate building mechanics to allow for more creativity and freedom, including an increased build limit for all players.</li>



<li>A progression tree that unlocks recipes as you gain more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-farm-essence-dust-in-nightingale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Essence</a>, rewarding in-game challenges and accomplishments, along with new bonuses when crafting items and equipment.</li>



<li>A glamour station allows you to transmog equipment to put fashion before function.</li>
</ul>

If it's freebies you're after, the Epic Games Store has another bunch for you to add to your calendar, with acclaimed photography puzzler Toem and zombie rogue-like The Last Stand: Aftermath both now confirmed to be getting the freebie treatment next week.
</p>
<p>
Starting with Toem, it's a game of chill beats and quirky characters that sees players setting off on an expedition across a gloriously presented black-and-white world. Along the way, there are gentle problems to solve, all requiring creative use of your camera.
</p>
<p>Christian Donlan called Toem a "cheerful modern classic" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toem-review-a-photography-puzzler-and-a-journey-filled-with-lovely-moments">his Essential review</a>, championing its "playful challenges and a warm sense of place".

<p>
As for next week's second free Epic Store game, that'll be The Last Stand: Aftermath, a "single-player standalone action adventure rogue-lite" - and the fifth title in developer Con Artist Games' zombie-apocalypse-themed The Last Stand series.
</p>
<p>
Playing as an infected survivor who'll inevitably succumb to the zombie virus (at which point a new survivor takes over), players are tasked with exploring the ruins of civilisation, gathering materials and crafting valuable items to aid their progress as they go.

<p>
Toem: A Photography Adventure and The Last Stand: Aftermath will both be free to download and permanently add to your Epic Games Store library starting next Thursday, 19th September, after which a fresh batch of freebies will take their place.
</p>
<p>And if you've missed Epic's current free games - <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/rugrats-adventures-in-gameland-737402">Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/super-crazy-rhythm-castle-e3b464">Super Crazy Rhythm Castle</a> - there's still time to pick them up before it's all change.

            <p>
Released last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mosa-lina">Mosa Lina</a> is a chaotic 2D platform puzzler full of bombs and frogs and spikeballs and tentacles, all subject to real-time physics. It's an "aggressively random" response to what the developers call the "lock-and-key" philosophy of certain immersive sims. It's also just been Major Updated, with new two player cooperative local and online multiplayer, various quality-of-life tweaks, new recording functionality, and a suite of gameplay changes or fixes to make Larian's eyes water. If you've been holding out for a sim in which "frogs can jump off of other frogs" and "delete that's deleted by delete triggers the delete's deletion as it gets deleted", well, I encourage you to get involved.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2477090/view/4607834045442857504?l=english">the full changelog</a>. I will do my best to summarise it, using the bits of my brain that haven't been fritzed by that sentence about deleting. As regards the multiplayer, it's available across all existing modes and supports custom levels. There are also two new co-op exclusive modifiers that stack on top of existing ones.
</p>
<p>
As for the technical or quality of life stuff, the developers explain that "the web browser that was previously running the game is now gone" and that "underlying systems have been rebuilt to run fully natively". One consequence is that "the entire game's size is now less than 90mb (you only need like 60 floppy disks to store it)". Excellent work, developers: I approve of anything that can be measured in floppy discs, even hypothetically.</p>
<p>They've introduced some keyboard remapping options and the game now runs at a fixed 120 ticks per second, meaning that it is "now consistent and behaves the same way for everyone, regardless of the PC configuration and performance".
</p>
<p>
They've also replaced the old video recording system, which "severely impacted performance" and often caused the game to crash when left running for a while. The new version of the game uses Steam Recording instead, and lets you capture gifs to boot.
</p>
<p>
And then there's the list of gameplay changes. I worry if I post the full thing it'll cause your eyes to yeet themselves onto your keyboard and make a break for the nearest airvent, so here are my highlights:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- fruits don't get heavier if you jump when you collect them 
</p>
<p>
- non-super kinds of impossible places are still allowed
</p>
<p>
- moon will now try its best to spawn in more interesting places
</p>
<p>
- tentacle no longer gets holes
</p>
<p>
- butterfly no longer makes the ticking sound once it is destroyed
</p>
<p>
- super secret frog mode
</p>
<p>
- gungun no longer gets stuck in midair if picked up mid-backflip
</p>
<p>
- clamp no longer randomly decides to clamp multiple objects
</p>
<p>
- you can delete delete with delete
</p></blockquote>
<p>
...Yes. The unspecified changelog author notes that while the game's level editor hasn't received any significant changes, the multitude of adjustments to tools and objects might make it feel that way. They caution that "some levels that were relying on specific object interactions (around 2% i think) have been broken at least partially" and that "there are a bunch of bandaids applied to make less things break, but some stuff just can't be fixed by me".
</p>
<p>
We didn't review Mosa Lina. I think we probably should have. It's like a bunch of very dehydrated Transformice developers set out to make a Deus Ex game. Perhaps we'll circle back and do a write-up at Xmas.

Here’s some footage of the mod in action:</p><p>La Barbera decided to add Walz to the game after reading an article about his Dreamcast online. “I thought it’d be a funny homage, like Bill Clinton in the arcade game <em>NBA Jam</em>,” La Barbera told MPR News. </p><p>The game dev learned how to mod Dreamcast games and then reportedly spent a week putting the mod together. He also added snow-covered trees and Minnesota landmarks to the game’s map. Clips of Walz speaking were also included in the mod, letting the VP nom say a few words (as <em>Crazy Taxi </em>drivers typically do) while driving around like a maniac. </p><p>“I chose a more Minnesota-casual flannel outfit for Tim because it was easier to create than a suit,” La Barbera explained. “Basically, I had to work with the original character model, and that model had the over/undershirt look.”<br></p><p>To actually play this mod you’ll need to have a Dreamcast emulator set up and do some tinkering to the<em> Crazy Taxi </em>files<em>.</em> It’s not easy to setup, La Barbera admits, so the modder uploaded some more footage of the Walz mod in action on YouTube so we can all enjoy him picking up fares and dropping people off. Also, yeah, 2024's been a weird election year, huh? </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The trailer teases Knull as a terrifying figure feared by all the symbiotes, which he created. While Knull’s comic book history is tied together closely with Venom, we actually have to begin his story by talking about Thor. The very first mention of Knull came in 2013 when Jaason Aaron depicted a black-armor-clad god wielding a sword in issue six of his run on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Thor:_God_of_Thunder_Vol_1_6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Thor:_God_of_Thunder_Vol_1_6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Thor: God of Thunder</em></a></span>. Gorr, the antagonist of Aaron’s <em>Thor </em>run, witnessed the god in a duel and eventually took possession of the sword the god wielded, named All-Black, which then bonded to him. </p><figure id="" data-id="c9edc7912ab519e7dea2840169bbd0c6" data-recommend-id="image://c9edc7912ab519e7dea2840169bbd0c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black-armor clad god fights a gold-amor clad god" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A black-armor clad god fights a gold-amor clad god" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c9edc7912ab519e7dea2840169bbd0c6" data-recommend-id="image://c9edc7912ab519e7dea2840169bbd0c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black-armor clad god fights a gold-amor clad god" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It wasn’t until five years later that the name Knull would even be created. During their seminal run on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Venom_Vol_4_3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Venom_Vol_4_3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Venom</em></a></span><em> </em>in 2018, writer Donny Cates and artist Ryan Stegman picked up that unnamed god from Aaron’s run and turned him into the Knull comic fans would come to know. Knull would serve as the basis for a new take on the symbiote lore of the comics, fleshing it out in ways that had never been done. That lore begins long before the creation of the Marvel Universe, as Knull is said to be the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Doncates/status/1134969329169162241&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Doncates/status/1134969329169162241" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oldest thing</a></span> to ever exist.

This was a complete affront to Knull’s way of life, so he did what any reasonable ancient being would do and declared war on the Celestials. He did this with the aid of a powerful blade called All-Black the Necrosword, the blade that Gorr wields in Aaron’s <em>Thor</em>. The blade was forged from the void itself and is used by Knull to sever the head of a Celestial.<br></p><p>While a major threat, Knull could not destroy all the Celestials as he had planned. Banished back into the void, Knull took his sword and his severed Celestial head with him. Within that head he created a forge where he birthed the rest of the symbiote race. You might know that symbiotes such as Venom and Carnage are weak to flames and loud noises. Well, that is given an explanation here by Cates and Stegman. Fire and noise remind symbiotes of their painful creation in the forge of that severed celestial head. So Spider-Man is basically using the symbiotes’ childhood trauma against them to win battles.</p><p>After the creation of the Symbiotes, Knull wages a war across the universe. One of his symbiotes includes a large dragon-like creature named Grendel that fought Thor during the Viking ages on Earth which, the comics explain, would eventually become the basis for the monster in the <em>Beowulf</em> legend, because why not. Anyway, eventually the symbiotes rebel against Knull and imprison him in the void once more. </p><p>Knull does free himself from his prison and wage war on Eddie Brock, Venom, and all of Earth in the climactic <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_in_Black&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_in_Black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>King in Black</em></a></span> event from Cates and Stegman that ran from 2020 to 2021. That premise of Knull coming to Earth to combat Venom sounds a lot like the plot of <em>The Last Dance</em>, so there could be some similarities between the two stories. Either way, Knull’s appearance on film is sure to be just one part of the stunning finale to Tom Hardy’s <em>Venom series</em>, and now you’ll know who the hell he actually is when he appears.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
