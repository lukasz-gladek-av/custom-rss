            <title><![CDATA[Ex-Bungie Dev On Marathon‘s Summer Of Hate: ‘You Can’t Take The Thing I Care About The Most Away’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-director-budget-development-2000661252</link>
            <guid>1410769</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The buzz around <em>Marathon</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-shooter-best-vibrant-colorful-bungie-trailer-1850481359">was strong coming out of its initial 2023 PlayStation Showcase reveal</a>. It was a familiar multiplayer formula inside a wrapper that looked unlike anything else out there. But things started going downhill after fans went hands on with an alpha test build in May 2025. Coupled with an art plagiarism incident and annual mass layoffs at Bungie, the vibes had turned rancid. Fans were skeptical and haters were gleefully calling <em>Marathon</em> the next <em>Concord</em>. What does that do to the headspace of someone working on the game internally?</p> <p>“That kind of stuff hits everyone differently,” <em>Marathon</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-2000654665">former franchise art director, Joseph Cross</a>, said in a new interview with <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/exit-interview-joseph-cross-marathon">Mikhail Klimentov’s ReaderGrev newsletter</a>. “We had both spells, where there was a lot of positivity and then there was lot of negativity. Personally, I’m able to compartmentalize a lot of that. And a big part of the reason I’m able to do that is just because, getting back to my own identity as an artist, the art is really the most important thing to me here.”</p>

 <p>Cross, who’s worked outside games on film projects like 2021’s <em>Dune</em>, said he ultimately can’t control how players feel about the game design or how <em>Marathon</em> plays. “It’s difficult for me to take any of that stuff personally because I believe in the art, because I believe in what we’ve done,” he said. “I think we did something really cool, and I think it will pan out. I can’t control the way the game plays. I’m not a designer. I’m not the game director. I can only control what I can control, and what I could control, I feel really good about.”</p> <p>He continued:</p> <blockquote><p>And you can’t take that away from me, as much as the haters try online or wherever, and whether someone doesn’t happen to like the art direction personally, whether they don’t agree with some political thing Bungie did, or whatever the animosity du jour is, you can’t take the thing I care about the most away. There’s a part of me definitely that feels bummed, but sort of in the same way you feel bummed like you got unlucky. It’s like when you drop the toast and it goes face down. It’s like: Damn, I wish it would have gone face up when I dropped the toast. It feels like losing a lottery ticket or being in the wrong place at the wrong time. And that stuff never feels personal, you know?</p></blockquote> <p>As a manager, Cross added that it can be hard to know how everyone else on the team is processing the noise, especially when people are working remote through Zoom and Slack. “In my position, it’s not enough to just process it internally,” he said. “You have to advocate for and be there for the team and for the project and that’s a whole other can of soup.”</p>

 <p>Something that did weigh on the veteran Bungie artist is what a big risk and investment <em>Marathon</em> is if it ends up not paying off. The people comparing it to <em>Concord</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">which took many years to develop and cost over $200 million</a> to make, are not entirely wrong in that regard. Cross pointed to that risk taking as one of the project’s vritues, but worries it could be party of a dying breed of AAA project that studios like Bungie made their bread and butter.</p>

 <p><i>“Marathon</i> is such a massive project,” he said. “The studio took such a risk on this. You know, often times we felt like we were sort of getting away with something. And I think about that in the big picture, the idea of studios funding unproven, unknown projects for six or eight years, for hundreds of millions of dollars, sort of on spec. How much longer are things like this going to exist? I’ve been part of a couple of them now.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forget Mac Mini, Amazon Clears Out Ryzen 7 Mini Gaming PC at Record Low (Windows 11 Pro, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD)]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-mac-mini-amazon-clears-out-ryzen-7-mini-gaming-pc-at-record-low-windows-11-pro-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-2000661033</link>
            <guid>1410766</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC upgrades don’t always require shelling out big bucks, if you know where to look. Those looking for a compact, space-saving, but powerful (and cost-effective) solution should consider the Acemagic mini gaming PC at Amazon, which offers the best of both – or well, all – worlds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6787/">This PC retails for $599, but shoppers can grab it for less today.</a> Amazon Prime members can snag it for $408, after a nice 32% drop, while non-Prime shoppers can pick it up for $469 ($61 more than Prime members), which still knocks 22% off the list price. All shoppers will enjoy free delivery with their purchase, so there are no extra costs to worry about.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Compact, But Powerful</h2>
<p>This mini PC is truly compact. It easily fits in the palm of your hand and can squeeze into tighter, cluttered workspaces with ease. If you prefer a cleaner, more minimal setup, you can even mount it behind your monitor, or under the desk to keep it out of sight.</p>
<p>Performance is seriously impressive. The mini PC comes equipped with an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor that clocks up to 4.5GHz. When compared with its predecessors like the AMD Ryzen 7 5825U, this PC delivers around 35% faster CPU and 38% better GPU performance. It’s made to handle 1080p gaming, light editing, regular work, and even multitasking without slowing down. The PC is perfectly capable of supporting your work needs in the day, and entertainment sessions with games like APEX, CSGO, PUBG, COD, DOTA2, RUST, GTA5, and more at night.</p>



<p>There’s a massive DDR4 32GB RAM (dual channel), which keeps things snappy as you push through busy days. It keeps the system running smoothly, even when you’re working on a heavier, resource-intensive project that demands power. Storage is taken care of by the built-in 1TB M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0 SSD. It’s spacious enough to house all your important files, work documents, research papers, high-resolution photos, videos, and more comfortably. What’s even better is that both the memory and the storage are expandable up to 64GB and 2TB, respectively. That means if your needs grow in the future (which is inevitable), the system can grow to support them. You won’t need to worry about major overhauls anytime soon.</p>
<p>Port selection is decent. A triple monitor setup is supported with HDMI 2.0 (4K@60Hz), DP, and dual USB 3.2 Gen2 ports, letting you juggle a bunch of tasks at the same time. Think taking work meetings on one screen, while working on your project on the primary one, and having reference material opened on the third. Or playing a game on your main screen, while also catching up with friends on the other. You won’t have to worry about the system overheating, either. That’s thanks to the dual-vent cooling system, which maintains optimal 15-28W TDP performance without throttling.</p>
<p>The PC plays nicely with a variety of operating systems, but comes with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, meaning it’s ready to be used right out of the box. It’s also certified for AutoCAD/Adobe suites, which makes it great for work professionals, creatives, gamers, and students alike.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6787/">The PC is now down to $408 for Prime members, and $469 for non-Prime users.</a> The discounts offer a great way of upgrading your system without paying the full price.</p>

                <p>World of Warcraft lead producer Raymond Bartos has left Blizzard to join Riot, where he will work on the League of Legends developer's upcoming MMO.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7417390270268329984/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bartos said</a>, "I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to join such an inspiring group of people, and I can't wait to get started." Serving as a senior game producer, Bartos said his job will be to "help deliver an MMO experience players truly enjoy."</p><p>Additionally, Bartos said he's excited to join another former WoW developer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/orlando-salvatore-03772915/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Orlando Salvatore</a>, at Riot. "Given our track record on World of Warcraft, I have a feeling we'll be moving fast on day one," Bartos said.</p><p>He joins Riot following the developer's announcement in 2024 that it was resetting its MMO project, saying it will go back to the drawing board and stay silent for "years to come" as it reshaped the project. The MMO was originally announced as a League of Legends game set in the world of Runeterra. The game had been in the works since at least 2020 prior to its "reset" in 2024.</p><p>As announced previously, ex-Bioware and EA developer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fcondominas/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fabrice Condominas</a> is serving as the game's new executive producer.</p><p>Riot had always expected its MMO project to take time to materialize. The game's former executive producer, WoW veteran Greg Street, said there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-guarantee-league-of-legends-mmo-will-ship-producer-says-but-development-is-going-super-well/1100-6502412/" data-ref-id="1100-6502412">"no guarantee" the game would ever be released</a>, as the team wouldn't ship a game it thought would "disappoint players." Street left Riot in March 2023 after nine years with the company to start his own studio, Fantastic Pixel Castle, which is now making a AAA MMORPG under the codename Ghost, funded by NetEase.</p><p>Riot has also been in the news lately regarding the game Hytale. The company canceled the game in 2025, but its original developer bought the rights from Riot and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hytale-is-off-to-quite-the-strong-start-with-impressive-twitch-viewership-numbers/1100-6537390/" data-ref-id="1100-6537390">released the game just recently to big success.</a></p><p>And in other MMO news, Amazon Games just announced that its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-big-mmo-that-started-strong-is-shutting-down/1100-6537436/" data-ref-id="1100-6537436">MMO New World will shut down in January 2027.</a></p>

                <p>For the first time in series history, the Halo franchise will be<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696"> playable on PlayStation this year</a> with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/" data-ref-id="1100-6535992">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>. Executive producer Damon Conn said in an interview that Microsoft's goal is to "bring players back together."</p><p>"There are people who have never been exposed to Halo. Maybe they've always been on <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/" rel="nofollow ">Sony</a> products, switched consoles at a certain point, or just missed it at the time. We want to bring players back together," Conn explained to GamesRadar.</p><p>Creative director Max Szlagor added that, "Halo is best played when we have a large, healthy community."</p><p>Releasing Halo: Campaign Evolved on PS5 is a "way to grow, expand, and reconnect the Halo community," Szlagor said.</p><p>"We want to honor the Halo legacy on PlayStation, and we're paving the way to expand our Halo universe--that's how we see it," Conn added. "And it's not a small thing. We don't and we won't take it lightly. We definitely feel the weight of it."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSjbIM0iegY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hSjbIM0iegY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Releasing Halo on PS5 is also a way for Microsoft to make a lot of money potentially. After all, Microsoft has already earned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-xbox-game-just-passed-300-million-in-revenue-on-ps5-report-says/1100-6537323/" data-ref-id="1100-6537323">hundreds of millions of dollars bringing its games to PS5.</a> So far, Forza Horizon 5 has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-by-far-xboxs-most-successful-port-on-ps5-report/1100-6537371/" data-ref-id="1100-6537371">Microsoft's most commercially successful PS5 port.</a></p><p>Halo: Campaign Evolved is a remake of the 2001 original, but without multiplayer. It's slated for release some time this year on PS5, as well as Xbox and PC, featuring brand-new prequel missions, split-screen co-op, new weapons, visual and audio updates, and more.</p><p>There are other new Halo games in development, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-games-will-be-on-playstation-going-forward-says-microsoft/1100-6535712/" data-ref-id="1100-6535712">these titles will come to PlayStation as well.</a> This shift isn't surprising given Xbox president Sarah Bond has said the concept of exclusive games "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exclusive-games-are-antiquated-xbox-president-says/1100-6535625/" data-ref-id="1100-6535625">is antiquated for most people</a>."</p><p>In other Xbox news, the next Xbox Developer Direct is coming up on January 22, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-returns-january-22-with-fable-and-forza-horizon-6/1100-6537273/" data-ref-id="1100-6537273">promising news and updates on the new Fable game and Forza Horizon 6, among others. </a></p>

The game is getting a brand new content drop next week in the form of the Regal Update, and it'll bring new characters, new balls, and more.</p><p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2062430/view/99775316462930481" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a>, the <em>Ball x Pit </em>Regal Update launches on January 26th, and its main addition to the game comes in the form of two new treasure seekers: the Carouser and the Falconer.</p><p>The Carouser's thrown balls will orbit around him when they return, while the Falconer will be flanked by two falcons who will aid her in throwing balls towards her enemies. They should add a fun new tactical dimension to <em>Ball x Pit</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Ball x Pit </em>is getting two new characters and more next week.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Developer Kenny Sun is also promising eight new balls as part of the Regal Update, as well as new passive abilities and "some new features many [players] have been crying out for since launch".</p><p>He's also teasing a "nice surprise" that he and his fellow <em>Ball x Pit </em>devs "don't want to spoil just yet". I suppose we'll find out what that surprise is when the update arrives next week.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Ball x Pit</em>, it's a roguelite that takes inspiration from the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7938a993-0699-46f6-b76d-06acb4234348" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a><em> </em>for its gameplay, as well as arcade classics like <em>Breakout</em> (and, arguably, <em>Space Invaders</em>).</p><p>Each level sees you hurling balls at columns of enemies, and since this is effectively a bullet heaven game, you can apply all kinds of absurd modifiers to your balls (ahem), including flame, poison, and bleed effects, plus more.</p>
<p>The game has done very well for itself since launching in mid-October, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ball-x-pit-sales-300k" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c66e79de-ad49-448b-a480-58a8aeff462c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">racking up 300,000 sales within its first week</a>. That number is likely to be higher by now, too.</p><p>You can check out <em>Ball x Pit </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062430/BALL_x_PIT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/ball-x-pit/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ball-x-pit/9MWXF3SRD7QN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/BALL-x-PIT-2931076.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/BALL-x-PIT-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2949433.html" rel="nofollow">Switch 2</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ball-x-pit-review-bubble-bobble-toil-and-trouble" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bc62caf3-6a98-45be-907e-22ef807517ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">read my review here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>The winter abates, the days begin to lengthen, the snowdrops creep forth from their burrows, and the raiders of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</a> carry on raiding Arcs. Developers Embark have also done another round of interviews, in which they discuss plans for ARC Raiders updates in 2026, and in particular, address the question of whether to implement a player-trading menu and/or some kind of auction house feature. Right now, you can only officially barter with NPC merchants. 
</p>
<p>Briefly, the developers are concerned that such features would sabotage how players themselves organically assign value and significance to particular items. They worry it would encourage us to see everything as currency – an argument that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-hardest-part-of-making-arc-raiders-was-creating-a-meaningful-item-meta-so-that-your-loot-doesnt-just-feel-like-cash">echoes thoughts to RPS</a> from the launch period last year. They’re keen to maintain the enchantment of encountering another wanderer in the waste, and trading items by dropping them on the floor. They sort of don’t want it to feel too much like an “extraction” game, in effect. Ideally, all of that stuff needs to happen in the world itself.
</p>
<p>"We're not building an auction house or anything like that,” design lead Virgil Watkins told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-had-an-auction-house-style-trade-system-at-one-point-but-embark-removed-it-because-it-ruined-loot-it-turned-the-game-into-just-being-about-coins/">Gamesradar</a> in an interview. “Currently, I think it's more leaning into the aspect of social facilitation in that sense of our design.”
</p>
<p>As an example of this “social facilitation”, the devs are looking at letting you actually hold out an object to another player, rather than chucking it at their feet (and daring them to let their guard down a fraction while they push the button to pick it up).
</p><p>Watkins had more to say on the subject to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/2026-plans-embark-interview">PCGamesN</a>, describing player-trading as a “very tricky aspect” of games like ARC. "You can see it in other games that have like a more traditional auction house, especially once [in-game] currency becomes involved, I think we [would] diminish one of the central aspects of our game, which is caring about the items you find and what [their] use cases are,” he said, “rather than it being: 'I'm going to go into the world to maximize profit, take all that money out, and then just buy the things I need.'
</p>
<p>"I think any avenue we go down in terms of player trading has to keep that in mind," Watkins went on. "It can't undercut what one of the primary loops of the game is, which is caring about exploring the world, finding the things you need to find, and then caring about getting those things out, rather than, you know, hoarding 3,000 Lance's Mixtapes to sell so you can then buy all your guns on the trading market."
</p>
<p>Watkins does feel that Embark can do a lot more with the current NPC trading system, which obviously allows the developers to maintain direct control over the game’s economy. And if auction houses are off the menu, it’s very possible Embark will expand the off-map side of the game by turning the secret human citadel of Speranza into an actual walkable hub area. 
</p>
<p>"For me, personally, I love the vibe and aesthetic of a walkable hub, but I would want to preserve the menuing so that you can do it quickly and efficiently, rather than [having to] run to Celeste and then run to my [raider's room], and then 'Oops, I forgot this thing at Shani’,” Watkins told PCGamesN. “But there's also, of course, an immersion factor to that. So yeah, it's something we have discussed, and we'll continue to discuss, and I think there's definitely a good appetite on the team for it as well. It's more about when the right moment to open that door is."</p><p>All this aside, Embark are looking at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raider-devs-want-future-expeditions-to-be-less-about-fat-stacks-and-fomo">creating more varied ARC Raiders expeditions in future</a>. I quite like the idea of a proper trading animation, though I do worry about the possibility of an accompanying sucker punch mechanic. Sike! Perhaps if they foster enough bonhomie at the level of the animations, players could host their own impromptu auctions out in the wilderness.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-development-runner-art-2000661234</link>
            <guid>1410718</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Marathon</em> is a <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-runner-shells-trailer-abilities-bungie-2000660170">hero extraction shooter</a>, but it wasn’t always that way. Former franchise art director Joseph Cross detailed his time working on the game in a new interview, including a big change to a core aspect of the game midway through development. He also spoke about <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-2000654665">leaving Bungie</a> after spending so much time working <em>Destiny</em> and the company’s upcoming multiplayer game.</p> <p>“The game design itself [had] a pretty profound evolution midway through, and that changed the visual psychology a fair amount,” the veteran artist <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/exit-interview-joseph-cross-marathon">told Mikhail Klimentov’s newsletter <em>ReaderGrev</em> in a new interview</a>. As Cross describes it, <em>Marathon</em>‘s player characters were originally just generic throwaway mercenaries that players would customize to fit their own fantasy. It was only later on that the development team made the shift to actual characters with prescribed backstories, abilities, and unique visual identities.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marathon Art Style (a short thread). First of all thanks to everyone for all the kind words and enthusiasm for the art style/direction in our announce trailer, it's been amazing to see. This was the result of many talented artists working together, with the support of an amazing <a href="https://t.co/ePPi41KA6c">pic.twitter.com/ePPi41KA6c</a></p> <p>— Joseph Cross (@josephacross) <a href="https://twitter.com/josephacross/status/1663415929043296257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“You’re going from designing one vehicle in a fleet of a thousand to now you’re designing the Millennium Falcon,” he said. “The psychology changes. I think that gets back to your original question, which is like, art relating to gameplay and at what point do those collide? And that certainly was a big one. In the case of this production it was a fairly significant event, and had to happen incredibly quickly, too.”</p> <p>The hero aspect has become an important part of the marketing around <em>Marathon</em>‘s in-world fiction and a differentiator between it and genre rivals like<em> Arc Raiders</em> and <em>Escape from Tarkov</em>. But it also gives the game one foot in the realm of a genre that some players seem incredibly burnt out on. Elsewhere in the interview, Cross said the game is banking a lot on its striking art style, which borrows inspiration from things as wide-ranging as Nike sneaker culture and Ikea furniture assembly, to help set it apart.</p>

 <p>He said:</p> <blockquote><p>There’s also something about the design of the game, where at a certain point I really did believe that art had potentially more of a responsibility for creating interest than it would if we were working on a different kind of game. The game design, nobody’s reinventing the wheel here. We’re putting compelling spins on established mechanics. The narrative is also not reinventing the wheel. It’s an abandoned space colony where something mysterious happened. We’ve seen this a lot. It’s about how you spin it, and at some point, for better or for worse, I told myself that this is an opportunity for art to sort of step up and provide a level of newness to this world.</p></blockquote> <h2>Leaving Bungie on the eve of <em>Marathon</em>‘s release</h2> <p>So why did Cross, who spent over a decade working on art for the studio beginning with the original<em> Destiny</em>, decide to recently leave before <em>Marathon</em> ships? He said he’s an artist first and foremost, and is increasingly conscious of the limited number of new projects he’ll actually get to work on in his lifetime. “I’m not a founder of Bungie,” he told Klimentov. “This is not my company. And I’m conscious of the number of projects I get to work on in my life. I’m not getting any younger. I’ve spent what will ultimately be 15 years, essentially, on two projects for Bungie: <i>Destiny</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Marathon</i>, with film work in between.”</p>

 <p>Cross decided on his departure just a couple of weeks before <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975"><em>Marathon</em>‘s new March 5 release date</a> was decided. “The natural cadence of the kind of work that happens post-launch in a live service game, I also understood what that was looking like,” he added. “It’s also true that at the level of seniority that I had, there are challenges there that don’t necessarily exist as an artist, and getting to this phase of a project like this at that level had its own challenges that contributed also.”</p>

              <p>Whether you’re a content creator who relies on great sound or just someone who needs to record audio or interviews, an excellent and affordable mic can be hard to find. DJI is here to save the content creation world again with another affordable product you won’t want to miss out on. You can snatch up the DJI Mic 3 for a discounted price right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6786/">The DJI Mic 3 (2 TX + 1 RX + Charging Case) is up for grabs at Amazon for sale, where you can pick it up for $259</a>. That’s a savings of $70 and 21% less than the normal $329 price tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6786/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A mic that’s great for casual creators and established professionals</h2>
<p>The DJI Mic 3 Bundle (2 Transmitters + Receiver + Charging Case) combines two wireless transmitters, a small wireless receiver and a charging case into a single lightweight portable recording package. DJI describes the system as ultra-light with adaptive gain control for maintaining a consistent volume level regardless of the type of speaker,. It also uses dual-band anti-interference technology to help prevent interference from nearby wireless devices.</p>
<p>DJi states that the combined battery life will provide up to 28 hours of continuous use when taking into account the charging case, allowing you to shoot for extended periods of time before having to charge the case again.</p>
<p>Two clip-on transmitters and a wireless receiver that mount to a camera hot shoe, can be used to create a complete 2 person wireless microphone system. All of these components fit inside the provided charging case that allows all of the components to remain organized and charged during non-use intervals.</p>



<p>The receiver can connect to as many as four wireless microphones and synchronize audio to as many as eight receivers, with four-channel output available for larger production needs. Therefore, you can begin with the two wireless microphones provided, and then purchase additional units to expand your recording capabilities.</p>
<p>Each of the two wireless microphones is capable of internally recording two separate files of 32 bit floating point data, providing a wider dynamic range than typical 24-bit systems, and therefore more opportunities for adjusting levels in post-production.</p>
<p>Additional details regarding power and connectivity include a charging case that not only powers the transmitters and the receiver but also stores all of the provided accessories. In terms of total operation time, DJI rates the system at 28 hours or more, depending on how often you are using each component before needing to recharge the case.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6786/">If you’re ready to upgrade your mic situation or just want to add another to your arsenal, you can’t go wrong with this setup. Act quickly and get yours before it disappears from stock again.</a></p>

            <guid>1410679</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The WD Black 1TB C50 Xbox Storage Expansion Card provides 1 full terabyte of additional storage for the Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S, with the same speeds as the internal SSD. The C50 expansion card is a compact NVMe solid-state drive that fits into the dedicated expansion card slot at the rear of the console. It is compatible with Xbox Velocity Architecture, so the majority of your games will launch quickly and remain available via Quick Resume. The small black housing of the C50 is designed to match the console’s rear and provide a clean, clutter-free appearance when inserted into the expansion slot and secured by clicking into place.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6785/">You can find the WD Black 1TB C50 Xbox Storage Expansion Card currently for sale at Amazon.com for $150, down from the original price of $200, a savings of $50 and 25%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6785/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A reliable expansion card for your Xbox console</h2>
<p>Because it has been certified by Microsoft for use with their latest generation of consoles and utilizes the expansion port of the console, the C50 allows you to store and run your most recent generation games directly from the card at the same speeds they would be accessed from the internal SSD. Quick Resume also functions as expected, so you can continue to switch between paused and resumed games, even when the storage limits of the internal SSD have been reached. Unlike external USB-based storage devices that only let you archive your Xbox Series X/S titles, the WD Black C50 enables you to install your titles directly to the card and play them just like they were on the internal SSD.</p>
<p>Installing the WD Black C50 is easy and requires no complicated steps. Power down the console, then slide the card into the identified expansion port at the back of the console. Securely insert the card by pressing firmly into place until you hear it click securely into the port. Once the console is powered back on, it will automatically recognize the card and present the new storage capacity to the user for selection and installation of their desired titles.</p>



<p>The WD Black C50 is compact and industrial-looking, and is designed to fit seamlessly into the console’s design rather than appear as an external device attached via a USB port. Additionally, the size and lightweight nature of the WD Black C50 make it unobtrusive regardless of whether the console is positioned vertically or horizontally in a home entertainment system. Included with the WD Black C50 are the card itself, a protective cover for the card, and a short, easy-to-follow guide that outlines basic installation procedures.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6785/">At a discounted price of $150, versus the original MSRP of $200,</a> the WD Black C50 provides plug-in storage capacity that operates at console-level speeds, allowing users to retain additional titles on their Xbox Series X/S consoles without degrading performance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/if-you-like-baldurs-gate-3-this-is-gonna-be-great-larian-boss-swen-vincke-reveals-what-to-expect-from-divinity-in-first-interview-since-the-game-awards-announcement">Last month’s announcement of Divinity</a> has sparked a significant increase in sales of Baldur’s Gate 3 and Divinity: Original Sin 2, developer Larian has said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Divinity, announced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">The Game Awards</a> in December with a much-discussed trailer, is the next role-playing game from Larian following the enormous success of its 2023 Dungeons &amp; Dragons-themed role-playing game. And it’s Baldur’s Gate 3 that has shown remarkable staying power, particularly on Steam where it is still seeing peak concurrent player numbers above 100,000 despite being two-and-a-half years old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2017's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-original-sin-ii">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, meanwhile, has also seen an uptick in players following the Divinity announcement, with peak concurrents in the tens of thousands rather than thousands in the weeks since. (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-divinity-larian-studios-baldurs-gate-3">If you're wondering what Divinity is, check out IGN's handy explainer</a>.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Larian boss Swen Vincke, it’s not just that people who already own Baldur’s Gate 3 or Divinity: Original Sin 2 are returning to the game. People are buying both games in significant numbers and jumping in for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Sales for both BG3 and D:OS2 have been incredible since the announcement of Divinity,” <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2013481225030094906" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vincke said</a>. “D:OS2 really surprised us by having its best month since release in 2017. Wish I’d removed the squirrel in time :)”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Typically, multiplayer live service games are expected to retain a large playerbase over the course of years, with revenue generated by the sale of in-game items such as battle passes, cosmetics, and DLC add-ons. Indeed, Steam’s top 10 most-played games are packed with live service games such as Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, and PUBG.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are some single-player games that buck this trend. Bethesda’s single-player RPGs such as Skyrim and Fallout are usually there or thereabouts in terms of Steam popularity. CD Projekt’s The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 remain hugely popular even now, years after launch. And Baldur’s Gate 3 is perhaps top of the single-player tree, with renewed interest in all things Larian following the Divinity reveal fueling it further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Divinity, Larian recently held a reddit AMA to answer questions from fans. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-learned-about-divinity-from-larians-reddit-ama">Here’s everything we learned about Divinity from it</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>Larian Studios' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">new Divinity game</a> has been the talk of town since it was revealed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards 2025</a>. Even the comments on potential gen-AI use, ensuing backlash, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">course-correction</a> haven't sunk the excitement around the next RPG from the developers behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. In fact, the 2023 CRPG and the studio's previous game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-original-sin-2-review">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, have seen a surge in popularity.</p>
<p>Though <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1086940/charts/#max">BG3's hold for the past couple of years</a> has been quite solid, users took to social media on 20th January to point out it was faring well even in the face of new releases and online giants like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-robot-bosses-set-to-become-even-scarier-pve-escalate-embark">Arc Raiders</a>. Larian boss Swen Vincke, who's also leading development on the new Divinity, quickly added a quick comment on their previous two games' very enduring appeal:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Sales for both BG3 and D:OS 2 have been incredible since the announcement of  Divinity. </p><p>D:OS 2 really surprised us by having its best month since release in 2017.  Wish I’d removed the squirrel in time :) <a href="https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r">https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r</a></p></div>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2013481225030094906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>It must be noted Vincke talked about sales for both games, which aren't fully represented by the actual concurrent players activity we're seeing. Moreover, we only have access to data on Steam's numbers, but with Larian's catalogue seeing recent sales across all the available platforms and <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/divinity-original-sin-2-official-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-series-xs-ps5-launch-trailer">Original Sin 2 getting a native Switch 2 port and current-gen upgrades</a>, it's not hard to believe many folks are finally jumping on the massive RPGs now.</p>
<p>The developer also stated the previous Divinity game has had its best month since its launch in 2017, which might be true if you look at the full picture (again, we'll have to believe Larian here), but doesn't fit <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/435150/charts/#max">SteamDB's all-time chart</a>, which you can also find below.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>SteamDB</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The game's highest post-launch peak is found on March 2020, right as the Covid pandemic started, when it got to 30,882 concurrent players. This month, it reached its best numbers (27,409) since then though.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1086940/charts/#max">As for Baldur's Gate 3</a>, its best post-launch moments happened in January 2024 (297,492) and April 2025 (169, 267). Right now, it's sitting at (127,254) on Steam. Again, the total could be much higher across all platforms.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>SteamDB</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>As a side note, Larian has also stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-will-certainly-consider-a-divinity-switch-2-release">the studio will consider a Nintendo Switch 2 port of Divinity</a> as well as look into supporting Steam Deck again after BG3's success on Valve's handheld PC.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/razer-kishi-ultra-gaming-controller-is-almost-50-off-mobile-gaming-can-feel-way-better-for-much-less-2000661027</link>
            <guid>1410649</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Little cousins love to ask the question, “What games you got on your phone?” Not too long ago, the answer to that question would be a humble response. <em>Flappybird</em>, some <em>Tetris</em> ripoff, maybe <em>Words With Friends</em>. Or even that one app that makes it look like you’re drinking a beer, though that technically isn’t even a game.</p>
<p>But now? The answer to that same question in 2026? EVERYTHING. The App Store is full of real games now. <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and<em> Roblox</em>—of course—all can be downloaded and played right from your phone. And with cloud gaming available with services like Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PS Remote Play, that list of games you can play grows exponentially. Though, many of these games are far better when experienced with a controller than with a touchscreen. So come bring your phone’s interface up onto the level of the games it can now play.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6784/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Razer Kishi ultra gaming controller is exactly what your need, bringing you the ergonomics of an actual gamepad for when your gaming on your phone. Right now, Amazon happens to have the controller add-on for a massive discount. Normally set at $150, the price has been cut to nearly half. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6784/">A limited time Amazon deal has the controller discounted by a staggering 47%, meaning you end up only having to pay $80 to completely elevate your mobile gaming.</a></p>

<h2>Pro Grade Console Controls on Mobile</h2>
<p>All you do is just slot your phone or tablet in between the two sides of the controller and presto. You have yourself a gaming handheld, evoking the design of the Nintendo Switch or a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The controller connects to your mobile device over USB-C. So if you’re still holding onto that old iPhone 15 or even earlier model, you best upgrade before purchasing this because it is not compatible with the discontinued Lightning port. Android users need not worry. And since it’s plug in, no need to worry about any latency.</p>



<p>The construction of the Razer Kishi is solid. The controller is equipped with a Mecha-tactile eight-way d-pad and action buttons, Hall Effect triggers, programmable buttons, and ultra durable TPSiV analog sticks. It even supports haptic vibrations.</p>
<p>The controller isn’t limited to mobile gaming. You can even plug it in over USB-C to a PC to use it like any other PC gaming controller. It’s a little funky looking without a phone or tablet stuck in the middle, and you might prefer a different controller for PC gaming. However, if you’re traveling and trying to pack light, you can use just the one controller for both mobile gaming and gaming on your laptop which is pretty rad.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-playstation-5/</link>
            <guid>1410646</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Forza Horizon 6 is racing onto the scene this year, but following the release of its predecessor on PlayStation 5, questions regarding platforms are already starting to appear.</p>



<p>If you’re a PlayStation 5 gamer and you’re looking for details on whether Forza Horizon 6 will be available on PS5, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-playstation-5">Will Forza Horizon 6 be on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Forza Horizon 6 will be playable on PlayStation 5, Playground Games have confirmed, though it won’t be launched immediately on the console.</strong></p>



<p>After the success of releasing Forza Horizon 5 on PS5, the decision to release the sequel on the PlayStation platform has been confirmed in advance of launch, and the wait will be shorter than the many years it took for Forza Horizon 5 to make the move onto the platform.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 will, however, initially launch exclusively on Microsoft platforms on Xbox Series X|S and PC, before making a move to PlayStation at a later date.</p>



<p>Just like its predecessor, this will include all content and crossplay, allowing players across all platforms to play together when exploring, racing, or causing chaos.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-playstation-5">When Will Forza Horizon 6 be on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<p><strong>No precise launch window has been announced for Forza Horizon 6 on PlayStation 5, with confirmation stating only that the arrival will be “post-launch”.</strong></p>



<p>In the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-6-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forza Horizon 6 reveal</a>, it was stated that, due to “the excitement for this franchise on other platforms,” Playground Games and Turn 10 Studios are “working together to bring Forza Horizon 6 to PlayStation 5 post-launch.”</p>



<p>While the history of Forza Horizon doesn’t provide too much of an insight, given Xbox’s approach to cross-platform launches is relatively new, other titles may provide a hint of how long PlayStation gamers will have to wait.</p>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was released in December 2024 on Xbox Series X|S and PC, with a PlayStation 5 version launching four months later in April 2025. Using that timeframe, expect there to be at least a few months before a PS5 launch of Forza Horizon 6.</p>

<p>Forza Horizon 6 is one of the biggest games releasing from Microsoft-owned developers this year, and the series will be heading to a new location.</p>



<p>After an extended stint in Mexico with the last edition of the game, Insider Gaming has all the details on where Forza Horizon 6 will take place.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-will-forza-horizon-6-take-place">Where Will Forza Horizon 6 Take Place?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A new setting. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 6 will bring the franchise to Japan, a setting that has been heavily requested by players since the first game in the series.</strong></p>



<p>The setting of Forza Horizon 6 was <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-6-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced by Playground Games</a> at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2025, where it was stated that players “will get to discover a scenic and breathtaking Japan,” while the reveal trailer showed several locations, including Tokyo, Mt. Fuji, and roads lined with cherry blossom trees.</p>



<p>In the reveal FAQ, PlayGround Games added that “Japan has been one of the most iconic and requested locations by the community,” and that bringing the Horizon Festival to the region “has been one of our largest ambitions yet.” </p>



<p>Advancements in technology and design will provide players with a world that they “hope you will fall in love with,” and they can’t wait for players to “discover the beautiful landscapes and rich heritage of Japan” when Forza Horizon 6 releases.</p>



<p>Japan follows on from Colorado, France, Italy, Australia, the UK, and Mexico as the locations in the Forza Horizon series.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-of-japan-will-forza-horizon-6-feature">How Much of Japan Will Forza Horizon 6 Feature?</h2>



<p><strong>The full map size for Forza Horizon 6 in Japan has not been showcased, though it has been announced the setting will be a “region” of Japan, and not a single city or location.</strong></p>



<p>Forza Horizon games usually take an area of a location and reduce its size to be smaller, allowing for a variety of biomes to be featured, which results in the likes of Forza Horizon 5 having barren desert landscapes and lush jungles. On top of this, the seasonal changes significantly tweak the look of the environment.</p>



<p>Tokyo is sure to feature, along with Mt. Fuji, and more details of the map, and how the size compares to previous games in the franchise, will be revealed closer to launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new concept leak offers players a glimpse of the Fable reboot’s locations, items, story elements, and more ahead of its official reveal at the Xbox Developer Direct. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Playground Games had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> the release of the Fable reboot to 2026 last year to give the title more time. We were finally going to receive an extended look at the title at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-games-confirmed-for-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct</a> this week. However, a leak has now revealed some major details ahead of the event. </p>







<h2 id="h-fable-leak-suggests-return-to-bloodstone-a-fable-2-location">Fable Leak Suggests Return to Bloodstone, a Fable 2 Location</h2>



<p>A report by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1ST</a> reveals concept art for the Fable reboot, shared in an artist’s portfolio who previously contributed to the game. One of the most important finds in these images is the return of Bloodstone, a port town from Fable 2, known for housing criminals. The castle’s entry was situated between a range of mountains, which is how you might access Bloodstone in the Fable reboot. </p>



<p>Different areas surrounding this location were highlighted, including the Market District, Pub Island, and Arena. Some routes lead to characters like Artisan and Jacobs. The location features signs indicating it operates as a functioning town, such as one showing a man selling his fresh catch of fish and another reading “The Phoenix Feather.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Fable concept art leak revealed another location: a swamp village named Hamlet in the files. Two versions of this location were showcased in the artwork; one depicting its original appearance and the other illustrating the effects of a flood on the village, which could serve as a story element.</p>



<p>Moreover, there are images of the main character travelling through sewers and facing off against a werewolf. The werewolf’s den is filled with hanging corpses along with skulls and bones spread across the area. Lastly, there’s also an image of different versions of chests that players can acquire in the game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Readers should note that there is no information regarding when this concept art was created, so details may change by the time the final version of the game is released. We might receive confirmation about some of these details during the Xbox Developer Direct next week.</p>







<p>In other news, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alleged-screenshot-reveals-forza-horizon-6-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged screenshot</a> has revealed the release date for Forza Horizon 6.

            <p>A bunch of alleged concept art for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-everything-we-know">Fable</a> reboot has reportedly been unearthed via a developer's portfolio, ahead of the RPG's appearance at this week's Xbox showcase. As of writing, there's no indication as to what stage of developement the apparent game art could be from. However, if it's genuine, it does seem to point towards a location from Fable 2 making a return in the reboot.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The alleged art's been shared by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations">MP1ST</a>, who claim to have pulled it from the portfolio of an unnamed developer who worked on the game at some juncture between right now and the beginning of time.</p>
<p>Taking a look through the gallery of 29 images, a few of which aren't in colour, a good number appear to reference or depict Bloodstone. Fable 2 frolickers will remember a coastal town of that name being a pirate haven you visit on your quest to recruit Reaver, a tophatted rogue whose help you need to do big spoilery things. Well, if one of these images appearing to show the layout of its market district is to be believed, Bloodstone may now be home to a "pub island".</p>
<p>One of the images which appears to show Fable's protagonist looking out over a rocky vista also includes a sign with Bloodstone's name scrawled on it. Though, said sign appears to indicate you can get to Bloodstone both by heading in a certain direction or its complete opposite direction, which has raised my eyebrow slightly. Beyond these, MP1ST claim some of the images show a swampy village filenames suggest to be called The Hamlet, with multiple interprations of its nature-encusted homesteads appearing to show them before and after being abandoned.</p><p>There's also a sequence of sewer exploration, some more of the sort of whimsical fantasy architecture you might expect from Fable, and no less than two shots prominently featuring sheep. All in all, I'd say none of it looks hugely out of line with the pre-alpha gameplay Playground showed off when they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-has-been-delayed-until-2026-because-the-studio-needs-more-time-says-xbox">announced the game's delay to 2026</a> last year - not that this counts for anything in terms of proving the art's real.</p>
<p>For now, all we can do is wait for that Developer Direct Fable's set to rock up at on Thursday, January 22nd. There, Xbox have promised, will be Fable things you don't have to gulp down with a tablespoon of salt. Well, unless you really can't stand <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEQRwpMYPaw">Richard Ayoade</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valentine’s Day is less than a month away, and it’s the perfect excuse to tell your partner how much they mean to you. A thoughtful gift can, of course, sweeten that expression, and if you’re after something beyond flowers or chocolates – something that lets you both spend quality time together – the LEGO Art Love collectible building set deserves your attention.</p>
<p>You can create your own small version of Robert Indiana’s famous LOVE sculpture with this one, that too without paying the full price right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/">It’s currently available at Amazon for just $64, down from $80, after the retailer slashed the price by 20%.</a> But as you’d expect, the offer is selling out fast. Hurry to pick one up, before it’s too late!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fun Weekend Activity</h2>
<p>This set comes with 791 pieces in total, and is based on the famous real-life sculpture with a similar design and colors (red, blue, and green). Less than 800 pieces means it won’t really be one of those massive building projects that take weeks to complete. It can be a fun weekend activity with your loved one, where you guys bond over the experience. You can take turns following the steps, or each focus on one letter, as the set comes with two building instructions. Prepare some hot chocolate, pull out a list of thoughtful questions, and get started with the thing. Before you know it, you won’t even realize how long it’s been since you last picked up your phone.</p>



<p>You can even gift it to a friend to appreciate their presence in your life, or a parent who enjoys creative activities. Once built, the model measures over 10 inches (25 cm) high, 10 inches (25 cm) wide, and 2.5 inches (6 cm) deep. It can be a great display piece anywhere you like; place it on a shelf in the living room, the dining area, or even your office to add some personality to it. The model is sure to turn some heads!</p>
<p>Getting started is straightforward. The included instruction books take you through each step of the process one-by-one. The booklets are quite easy to follow, but you can also download the LEGO Builder app for 3D instructions. The app offers zoom and rotate features that make it easy to view each block from every side.</p>
<p>The LEGO Art range features more such brick-built artworks that let you create iconic pieces and pop-culture figures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/">We’re spotting quite a few sets at a discounted rate, which makes now a great time to grab the ones you’ve been eyeing for a long time.</a> As for the current discount, we’re expecting it to wrap soon. It’s best to act quickly to score the drop.</p>

            <p>
Following last week's announcement that long-running MMO The Elder Scrolls Online would be moving away from traditional major expansions to focus on smaller seasonal updates, developer ZeniMax Online has insisted the big shake-up is in no way related to last year's sweeping layoffs at parent company Microsoft, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-employees-discuss-chaos-of-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-in-new-report">heavily impacted</a> the studio.
</p>
<p>
Last July, in a year that saw Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella boast "record performance" and a revenue increase to $281.7bn, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">announced mass layoffs</a> affecting over 9000 employees across the company, marking its third round of significant job cuts since 2023. The move - which impacted numerous Xbox studios including Rare, Turn 10, The Initiative, and Raven Software - was accompanied by multiple project cancellations.

<p>
ZeniMax Online Studios' in-development sci-fi MMO Project Blackbird was one of the games impacted, and its cancellation coincided with nearly 200 job cuts at the studio. But following last week's announcement that <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/69137">The Elder Scrolls Online would be shifting to smaller seasonal releases</a>, executive producer Susan Kath has insisted the two events are unrelated.
</p>
<p>
"Seasons is not in any way a response to [the layoffs]," Kath <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-smaller-expansions-are-not-in-any-way-a-result-of-last-years-layoffs">recently told RockPaperShotgun</a>. "We kicked off the Season work at least 12 to 14 months ago. We started making the changes in the team to move in this direction, knowing that this was our intent."
</p><p>
Kath describes 2025 as a "hard year for the studio", but acknowledges Blackbird's cancellation could be seen as a positive for ESO. "Ultimately, we had a lot of people doing double duty on those projects, splitting their time between projects," she continued. "[They] are now devoted 100 percent to Elder Scrolls Online. So, in fact, in some capacities, we actually increased the number of folks available as we came out of that because they weren't managing two products anymore. They were only devoted to one title."
</p>
<p>
ZeniMax first publicly discussed the idea of smaller updates for The Elder Scrolls Online shortly after the layoffs. In September, studio game director Rich Lambert <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-elder-scrolls-online-heads-on-the-aftermath-of-microsofts-cuts-and-the-future-of-the-long-running-mmo">told GamesIndustry.biz</a> the MMO was in "a bit of a transition year", and that the team was now looking to get "smaller, more bite-sized things out quicker". The aim, he said, was to launch these smaller updates roughly every six to nine months, compared to the 12-15 month release schedule for traditional expansions. And last week, ZeniMax formalised its plans, announcing a move to smaller, quarterly - and free - seasons, starting 2nd April, which will also see many earlier paid expansions rolled into the base game. This change coincides with the introduction of a seasonal (but not time-limited) battle pass, featuring a free tier and two paid extensions.

<p>
In a press briefing attended by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">RPS</a> ahead of the announcement, Elder Scrolls Online game director Nick Giaomini insisted the shift would give the team the "flexibility to make our game more exciting and invest in addressing long standing pain points, add features and improvements players have been asking for, and update and iterate on the core game, rather than always just chasing something brand new."
</p><p>
"To say that [the layoffs] didn't impact us wouldn't be right," Giacomini added. "We're putting on a strong face. We're human. It absolutely impacted us. But, you know, the team rallied. We're excited about the future. We're excited that we're making all these big changes."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon</a> is celebrating its 30th anniversary on 27th February, and we're collectively dying to see what might be revealed about the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-teraleak-reveals-unannounced-games-seemingly-laying-out-franchises-major-releases-through-2030">long-rumoured next mainline game</a> and other projects. Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a> aims to shake things up with a new take on town life sims in early March. In its beginnings, however, the series took a long time to figure out.</p>
<p>This is what The Pokémon Company president and CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara said during a brief appearance at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HNNugGXKQ0">New York Game Awards</a> through a special video (hat tip to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/pokemons-game-boy-development-process-took-a-great-deal-of-trial-and-error">Nintendo Life</a>). The franchise as a whole <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-to-receive-prestigious-award-at-the-15th-annual-new-york-game-awards">received the Andrew Yoon Legend Award</a>, which celebrates a "sustained body of work demonstrating exceptional artistic achievement and innovation."</p>
<p>Ishihara took this opportunity to reflect on the series' humble origins. The games were made with "limited resources" back then, and he underlined Red and Green took "a great deal of trial and error" to get right and to the finish line. He even revealed the entire process ended up lasting six years, which is shocking to learn about when you consider dev cycles back in the day were substantially shorter than nowadays. What now feels normal rarely happened back then.</p>
<p>We know it all paid off in the end, and much like us, Ishihara believes it was all about having a strong base-level idea the team was confident about: "Still, we all felt confident in the main gameplay elements that would become the foundation of the Pokémon video game series: catch, raise, trade, and battle." These elements were designed with nostalgic themes and warm feelings in mind, as it was all tied to "fundamental experiences" many players had as children who connected with nature.</p><p>That said, he was "uncertain at first" about its appeal outside Japan as many formative childhood experiences aren't shared. Needless to say, there was nothing to be scared of. After that initial hit, Pokémon's core themes of friendship and our (often very complicated) relationship with the world shaped the franchise's identity.</p>
<p>No comments on the next main game from Ishihara beyond continuing to use those tenets as a "major driving force," but that could change soon.</p>
