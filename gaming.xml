			<p>Destiny 2: Renegades <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-destiny-2-renegades-expansion-ahead-of-launch-next-week/">is out now,</a> and as part of that launch, Bungie has debuted a new cinematic trailer for players to check out, but what players are also likely checking out is the game's concurrent player count on Steam. Now, it needs to be said that concurrent player counts on Steam are not everything; they are not the full picture for any multiplatform game, they are not an indication of sales, and they are not the best measuring stick for the health of multiplatform multiplayer games.</p>



<p>All that said, Steam is, almost undoubtedly, the largest digital storefront and platform for PC players, and the concurrent player counts for multiplayer games on Steam are not exactly a data point that should be easily cast aside.</p>



<p>So, how are Destiny 2's concurrent player numbers now that Renegades is live for all players? Better than they have been since August 2025, and slowly growing to be even better.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>At the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1085660/charts/#6m">per SteamDB</a>, there are 66,207 players currently playing Destiny 2 on Steam. That's miles better than the <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/">all-time lows recorded in October</a>, and the recent lows of a little more than 1k players recorded just days before the launch. But it is still not better than the launch day for Edge of Fate, Destiny 2's last major expansion release.</p>



<p>When Edge of Fate released, Destiny 2 peaked at 108,535 players on launch day. Of course, the day isn't done yet, and Renegades could prove to beat Edge of Fate's record, though falling short would be the latest sign pointing towards how Destiny 2 has fallen off in the eyes of players. And even if Renegades is able to beat the concurrent player count for Edge of Fate, that doesn't make the expansion an all-out success, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-selling-worse-than-expected-sony-records-impairment-loss/">since even Edge of Fate was a commercial miss for Bungie</a>.</p>



<p>Bungie is fully aware of the fact that players don't hold Destiny 2 in the same regard as they used to. <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-went-beyond-usual-boundaries-for-destiny-2-renegades/">According to a recent interview</a>, it hopes that Renegades will be the start of a better future for the game, while acknowledging where it stumbled following <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-gets-launch-trailer-ahead-of-next-weeks-debut/">the release of The Final Shape</a>. Still, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-in-extremely-early-development-according-to-bungie-leakers/">rumors persist that Bungie is working on Destiny 3</a>, which would potentially give the studio the blank slate it needs to try to get players back into the decade-spanning shooter.</p>



<p>But since Destiny 3, if it happens, won't arrive for a while, in the meantime, we'll see how Bungie does when it tries to brute force a commercial success <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-star-wars-expansion-renegades-bungie/">with the backing of Star Wars</a> for its latest major expansion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Nearly ten years ago, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-ps4k-ace-will-be-hdr-support-more-than-any-resolution-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote an opinion piece about HDR gaming being the most groundbreaking feature of the upcoming PlayStation 4 console refresh</a>, then known as 'PS4K' and later released on November 10, 2016, as the PlayStation 4 Pro. Initial information suggested that it would deliver HDR support, unlike the base PS4 model; however, Sony later <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps4-400-update-tomorrow-bringing-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolled it out for regular PlayStation 4 consoles</a> as well.</p>



<p>These specifics aside, the article's core foundation was the belief that HDR gaming was poised to be the next big thing in computer graphics, even more so than 4K (Ultra HD) resolution. There was plenty of evidence to support that being true. Microsoft and AMD had already proclaimed that initial user surveys suggested HDR would be revolutionary and even more impactful than higher resolution. Additionally, unlike rendering a game at a higher resolution, HDR would not negatively impact performance.</p>



<p>Those first few years were indeed highly promising. Leading game developers like <a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-ps4-pro-realize-full-potential-image-hdr-enormous-benefit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Naughty Dog</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-3-dev-see-hdr-cant-unsee-game-connected-weve-ever-made/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Playground Games</a> publicly stated that HDR support would be 'an enormous benefit' and something that 'could not be unseen'. At CES 2017, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/g-sync-hdr-monitors-available-q2-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its G-SYNC HDR monitors, allowing gamers to enjoy both G-SYNC and HDR support in their games. In July 2018, console manufacturers like Microsoft and Sony, display manufacturers like ASUSTek, HP, LG, Panasonic, Samsung, Toshiba, and Vizio, and game developers like Activision, CAPCOM, EA, Epic Games, Electronic Arts, SIE, Square Enix, Ubisoft, Vicarious Visions, and WB Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr-gaming-interest-group-formed-optimize/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded the HDR Gaming Interest Group</a>, or HGiG, to optimize content for viewers.</p>



<p>Everything appeared ready for the HDR revolution, and yet, fast-forwarding to the sad state of the present day forces us to analyze what went wrong. At the end of 2025, now that practically every display you can buy supports HDR in some capacity, some high-profile games still ship without supporting the feature. This year, that was the case with Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, Hades 2, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, ARC Raiders, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (which later received an HDR patch).</p>



<p>It is a literal slap in the face to all those consumers who bought cutting-edge HDR displays capable of achieving peaks of over 2K nits, or candela per square metre, the unit of luminance, whereas Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) displays is stuck at 100 nits. That's not to mention the vastly inferior Rec. 709/sRGB color formats compared to Rec. 2020, which is capable of displaying a much wider color gamut.</p>



<p>Despite this massive technical difference, the overall perception is that nowadays, most developers don't care at all for it. Even those games that technically support the feature often deliver subpar implementations that only serve to tarnish HDR's reputation. One recent example is Silent Hill f, where HDR apparently lacks the color grading the developers had prepared for SDR (which was the internal development reference), resulting in a wildly different look.</p>



<p>I have been in contact with fellow graphics programmer Filippo Tarpini, an industry veteran who has worked at FireSprite and Remedy. At the latter studio, he worked on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-mod-developed-by-remedy-programmer-adds-native-hdr-full-ultrawide-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Control HDR mod</a> (on his own time, and his work was later implemented <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-arch-2025-update-ultra-ray-tracing-dlss-3-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with an official patch</a>), as well as on Alan Wake II's HDR implementation. He also created the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-luma-native-hdr-mod-released-by-all-star-modding-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luma HDR mod for Starfield</a> and other games, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/prey-remastered-luma-mod-adds-hdr-gtao-dlss-and-improves-a-boatload-of-other-things/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prey</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-breaks-players-peak-gets-luma-hdr-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Recently, he founded Gamma Studios, a (currently) one-man company to help game studios 'improve their post-processing pipelines, implement HDR output, and do modern color grading'.</p>



<p>While he cannot discuss some of the game projects he has worked on lately, he is also collaborating (on a voluntary basis, without compensation) with NVIDIA to integrate HDR into the RTX Remix game remastering platform. Given that Tarpini is one of the foremost experts on the topic, I asked him to chat openly about what's wrong with HDR gaming and what needs to be done to make it shine as bright (literally and figuratively) as it can.</p>

<p><strong>Hello, Filippo. Tell us a bit about yourself.</strong></p>



<p>After years in game development, my focus shifted towards a widely overlooked part of games: tonemapping and grading. Besides having a passion for good looking games, there's literally a whole in this industry where the knowledge for the final parts of "rendering" is scarce and full of misinformation. So I'm trying to come to the rescue of HDR gaming, given that it really deserves to be given more attention.</p>



<p><strong>What is the state of HDR gaming at the end of 2025, in your opinion? Is there a gaming platform that fares slightly better, or are they all at the same level?</strong></p>



<p>I'm sorry to start on a negative note… Let’s just say that out of 25 of the biggest and best games of 2025, half of them don't support HDR and with just a few exceptions, the other half have major defects, like crushed or raised blacks, distorted color hues, clipped or limited highlights, lack of proper calibration settings, bad UI, etc.</p>



<p>In almost all cases, it's clear the game was made on and for SDR, with HDR being an afterthought that only occasionally represents the artistic direction, as it’s easy to tell when SDR was the visual reference, based on its visual consistency. Regarding platforms, there’s usually no difference; almost all games have the same exact HDR implementation. </p>



<p>I personally prefer Sony’s approach over the Microsoft one, but there’s no clear winner. Windows is fine too when it comes to displaying HDR content. The Switch 2’s HDR implementation <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hdr-calibration-settings-are-slammed-even-further-by-expert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn’t seem to be up to standard</a>; however, I haven’t analyzed it myself, so I can’t really judge it.</p>



<p><strong>Why do game developers neglect HDR even when most displays and monitors nowadays ship with HDR capabilities? Is it that troublesome to implement?</strong></p>



<p>I’m not too sure about the state of HDR in monitors as of 2025, as there have been a fair amount of “fake” HDR ones that kinda ruined its reputation in the past; however, most non-entry-level TVs now ship with good to decent HDR! I’ve been trying to get hold of this data, but nobody seems to be tracking it. It’s at least clear that OLED is becoming the new golden standard for mid to high-end displays.</p>



<p>I believe that somehow gamers aren’t aware of the value HDR adds to the gaming experience. Marketing pushes you to care about having the hottest GPU, but nobody is advertising HDR, given there's no single producer behind it. GPU manufacturing companies often approach game studios with proposals to implement Ray Tracing or features exclusive to their GPUs, but none of that happens for HDR. For the reasons above, developers are under the impression that HDR is a niche technology and isn’t worth the effort. As of late 2025, that stance is very outdated! </p>



<p>That said, if you know what you are doing, no, adding HDR is not hard, but it depends on how flexible your game engine is. I’ve seen engines that were very friendly towards adding HDR, and some that weren’t. In Unreal and Unity, which power most current games, enabling HDR is as easy as toggling a checkbox; however, both have major faults in their implementations. Ultimately, it comes down to whether a studio has anybody passionate about post-processing and encoding (‘gamma’); that doesn’t seem to be very common, though development time constraints also play a role.</p>



<p><strong>As a professional game developer, what was your experience when trying to push for more attention in this specific area?</strong></p>



<p>It varies a lot. On average, I would say the care for it is still very low, while the misconceptions are high. A big obstacle with implementing HDR in games is that… they work even without it! All games are essentially starved of budget and development time, so if anything isn’t essential, it doesn’t get added until as late as possible. It’s unclear how much HDR influences sales, but certainly not by a huge margin, so most devs leave it to the last minute, sometimes even adding it post-launch.</p>



<p>Now, why HDR isn’t considered “essential” is a different story. I’ve certainly been confused by the care studios' focus on Ray Tracing and other graphical features that arguably have less impact and are harder to implement, while completely ignoring HDR. When I talk to fellow devs, I feel there’s often a bad feeling towards HDR, as if they were scared of adopting this new technology, away from something they are used to. They often have the misconception that SDR was perfectly standardized while HDR is a hot mess.</p>



<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. SDR, as we know it, was never standardized in either brightness or transfer function, so each TV/Monitor will look very different. Ironically, most common problems with HDR implementations stem from issues with SDR that were carried over due to misinterpretations of its standards. There’s a big disconnect between color standards on paper and what display manufacturers have actually been following for years. These issues went unnoticed for 20 years due to devs being unable to analyze the results from outside of the SDR ecosystem.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/hdr_off_on-HD-2-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>'We recently opened our Reddit with the intent of helping both gamers and developers find information on this "obscure" technology.

That’s what Gamma Studios is all about: I aid developers in implementing or improving HDR in their games, or anything else that has to do with post-processing.</em>'</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Is there one triple-A game (that you didn't work on) that does HDR really well by default?</strong></p>



<p>I quite enjoyed the HDR in Dead Space and Red Dead Redemption II. When examining them technically, with a 2025 eye, they both have defects here and there, but they still manage to achieve a good result, partially due to the strong artistry behind them. I believe that with a bit more work, they could have gone down in history for their impressive HDR and even improved the reputation of the technology.</p>



<p>I think some of Sony's AAA games and Call of Duty games also have good HDR, though I haven't played any recently. What I can say, at least, is that these games will look as intended in HDR, because the teams behind them test and carefully balance it.</p>



<p><strong>Now that you run a company to aid developers with HDR, do you think the HDR Den and <a href="https://github.com/Filoppi/Luma-Framework" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luma</a> helped in getting others to know your work?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. The HDR Den is still expanding a lot. We recently opened our Reddit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HDR_Den/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r/HDR_Den</a>), with the intent of helping both gamers and developers find information on this "obscure" technology. We got quite a few game developers in the Discord, and there are often interesting technical discussions. We've all been sharing information, and that basically means we can learn much faster than any actual AAA studio could, given we have 5-10 dedicated modders researching this topic night and day, testing things left and right, and sharing the conclusions from their research. </p>



<p>You can't really find this information elsewhere unless you spend months on it yourself. It needs to grow on you organically over time; hence, unless companies have a passionate employee dedicated to post-processing (color grading, tonemapping, etc.) full-time, there’s very little chance they will pull it off successfully. So much can go wrong, and so easily! And that’s what Gamma Studios is all about: I aid developers in implementing or improving HDR in their games, or anything else that has to do with post-processing.</p>



<p>I was indeed contacted by some developers for my work at Remedy and on Luma; however, much of it is also due to me sharing my work on social networks, Reddit, etc. Because of its popularity, my most requested product is my Unreal Engine HDR improvement package. A few games also used the “Luma” open license code and shipped with it! Even Luma is stronger than ever. Recently, a few amazing devs joined the project and pulled off new amazing mods, like a unified mod that turns the TAA implementation of all UE4 games into DLSS/FSR. We recently designed a new way of patching game shaders directly in memory, opening the door for more advanced modding than was ever possible before.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AutoHDR-Windows-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>'When it comes to computers, it's pretty much a disaster: we have half of the monitors with “fake” HDR panels, looking worse than SDR; we have Windows showing SDR content in HDR in a “broken” way (all colors are off); we have Windows upgrading SDR content to HDR (AutoHDR) using an improper formula; we have the two major game engines not doing HDR properly out of the box'.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>What else can be done to increase awareness of the potential benefits of well-crafted HDR in gaming?</strong></p>



<p>Besides Dolby or Samsung pushing their exclusive HDR technologies (<a href="https://wccftech.com/dolby-vision-gaming-is-now-available-on-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dolby Vision</a>/<a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr10-gaming-debuts-with-the-first-descendant-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR10+</a>), or me posting pro-HDR content left and right, there’s not much happening at the moment.</p>



<p>Let’s start from the current situation. Smartphones have fantastic HDR, iPhone videos and photos are now in HDR, and many of the shorts uploaded on Instagram and YouTube are also in HDR. But when it comes to computers, it’s pretty much a disaster:</p>



<ul>
<li>We have half of the monitors with “fake” HDR panels, looking worse than SDR.</li>



<li>We have Windows showing SDR content in HDR in a “broken” way (all colors are off).</li>



<li>We have Windows upgrading SDR content to HDR (<a href="https://wccftech.com/auto-hdr-preview-available-today-on-pc-adds-hdr-support-to-1000-games-that-lacked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AutoHDR</a>) using an improper formula.</li>



<li>We have the two major game engines not doing HDR properly out of the box.</li>



<li>We have YouTube taking a week to publish a video that was uploaded in HDR.</li>



<li>We need mods like RenoDX or Luma to fix the HDR in most games.</li>
</ul>



<p>Similarly, movies are not doing much better either; in fact, they might even be doing worse. HDR in movies is often literally SDR in an HDR container, or barely 10% brighter than SDR. All of the above damage the reputation and awareness of HDR. So what could be done?</p>



<p>Sony and Microsoft could push developers to use proper encoding and calibration techniques, making these practices part of their quality assurance for games released on their platforms. Stop spreading sRGB, given it’s an abandoned standard. TV manufacturers should more often contact developers for collaborations. A consortium needs to be started to define how games should implement HDR and standardize a set of features.</p>



<p>For example, if the brightness calibration were standardized at the OS level, games wouldn’t need to implement individual calibration menus. Game reviewers could start discussing the HDR implementation and criticizing it when it falls short or is not satisfactory. Spreading the word to the next person on how amazing HDR is.</p>



<p>I strongly believe that in 5 years, people will struggle to play SDR games, as they will look so bad (flat) in comparison to the new ones. There’s no going back! Essentially, every game that comes out with broken HDR will be stuck playing in an inferior way in the future, which makes me quite sad.</p>



<p><strong>The HGiG format was established to promote and standardize HDR gaming. However, calibration settings in games are often very different, and it can be confusing for users to navigate this stuff. Should HGIG (or some other subject) do more in this regard?</strong></p>



<p>HGiG is a passive standard: it’s simply making the TV reproduce an image as it came from the source (e.g., PC/PS5), without altering its average or peak brightness, etc. The alternative to HGiG is dynamic tonemapping, which I think has mostly been surpassed by now.</p>



<p>So, calibrating HDR gaming would actually be an extremely simple thing. I think that most devs are scared of that and often overthink it, causing more confusion than anything. All you need is a game scene and UI brightness sliders. The peak brightness of the display can (and should) be retrieved from the OS. The Alan Wake 2 calibration menu does exactly that, and so do my mods.</p>



<p>We have some games that expose 5 or 6 sliders to users (exposure, HDR average brightness, HDR shadow, HDR highlights, contrast, saturation), allowing users to completely change the look of the game, without a clear indication of how the game is meant to look. I believe these “extended” calibration menus are a consequence of devs being under the misconception that HDR is not properly standardized and that all HDR displays are so different that they need to give users a way to produce a good-looking image.</p>



<p>However, that is not the case! On average, HDR displays are more accurate to the source image than SDR ever was. These menus also often present SDR images in the background that do not represent how the game would actually react to each setting. Ultimately, all this does is cause extra confusion among gamers, scaring them off this new tech, while also making them more likely to mess up the settings and play the game in a way that doesn’t look like the developers intended.</p>



<p>We’ve seen all kinds of questionable behaviors in calibration menus, but the funniest is definitely one (unnamed) game that defaults to 900 nits as paper white! That is blinding and ~4.5 times brighter than the suggested default brightness.</p>



<p>For cases where the user has a display with what essentially is “fake” HDR, we should simply give up on them and use SDR instead. For marketing purposes, these displays take advantage of the loose certification requirements HDR has: many LCDs that don’t have local dimming present a very raised black floor (low contrast) with a low peak brightness (below 400 nits) in HDR mode. The solution for these isn’t to tweak HDR calibration settings until they look good, as often nothing can redeem them; SDR will likely offer a more balanced image.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dolby-Vision-HDR10-Gaming-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>'Dolby and Samsung have clearly put a lot of effort into improving the situation, and there are real benefits there.

The upcoming HDR10+ Advanced and Dolby Vision 2 could move the needle further.'</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You mentioned Dolby Vision and HDR10+ earlier in our chat. Do they make any sense in games? Could they be helpful at all for HDR gaming?</strong></p>



<p>I would love for these technologies to play a bigger role in games; right now, though, they still feel more like marketing features than truly transformative tools.</p>



<p>That said, I don’t think the work behind them is wasted. Both Dolby and Samsung have clearly put a lot of effort into improving the situation, and there are real benefits there. However, despite these streamlining efforts, I believe they both ended up with something that is more complicated for devs to implement, with modest returns and limited compatibility.</p>



<p>Since the industry is only just getting comfortable with HDR10, it’s natural that it will take a few more years before we see broader adoption of more advanced formats. The upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/samsung-announces-hdr10-advanced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR10+ Advanced</a> and Dolby Vision 2 could move the needle further, so I’m genuinely curious to see where things go.</p>



<p><strong>Recently, you also criticized developers for making color grading mistakes. How does that happen nowadays? Aren't there tools to help with such processes?</strong></p>



<p>In short, it’s a pity that the artistic intent of the game is so often compromised in HDR. Behind every studio, there are many artists who work hard to craft an image with a specific mood to it. These artists, for the vast majority of the time, work in SDR and do grading and lighting in it. Games’ HDR implementations are still almost always an afterthought done by the tech/engine teams and aren’t artist-driven, so they drift away from the artistic intent that was tightly controlled in SDR.</p>



<p>In these cases, artists themselves won’t be happy with it, and that usually goes one of two ways:</p>



<ul>
<li>They block the game from shipping with HDR (it often happens with Unreal Engine games when they can’t get the look right).</li>



<li>They swallow their pride in favour of marketing and accept the HDR looking different from what they envisioned.</li>
</ul>



<p>Unreal Engine has massively lowered the technical skill floor for developing games. Entire UE AAA games are made with few engine coders and often none on graphics. So, these “color grading” mistakes come down to the devs either not knowing how to do it technically or simply not caring about it.</p>



<p>As mentioned before, finding information on this stuff is nightmarish (don’t even try AI!). Almost all of the art/graphics/images tools out there are stuck in SDR, and entire work pipelines revolve around them. Beyond the HDR Den, there are no public/standardized methods to upgrade SDR pipelines to HDR, so devs try to invent local ways of adapting them, but as mentioned above, color correction is an extremely delicate thing, and one slight change in a math formula can make or break the look of a game, so the results often leave something to be desired.</p>



<p><strong>Is there anything developers could do in terms of graphics rendering that could show off HDR gaming more than it already does? With lighting, for instance?</strong></p>



<p>Yes! Most game engines are doing fine regarding PBR and brightness dynamic range in the scene. However, with one exception (Gran Turismo?), all games are stuck in the Rec. 709/sRGB color space, only occasionally generating colors beyond it during post-processing. We need to move to wider color spaces like Rec. 2020 for albedo (color) textures and light colors as soon as possible. Only then will we have mind-blowing HDR in games. TVs are improving every year, and we are approaching 2500 nits with 90% BT.2020 coverage.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time. For the sake of HDR gaming, let's hope enough of your colleagues in game development are reading.</strong></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-antireal-art-plagiarism-extraction-2000649685</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this year, Bungie found itself in the center of <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">an unexpectedplagiarism scandal</a>. The studio’s upcoming extraction shooter, <i>Marathon</i>, was found to have included work lifted from online artist Antireal without her knowledge or consent. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/taucetigg.bsky.social/post/3lpcw5x7qlc26">Bungie fessed up and apologized</a>, claiming it was an accident.</p>   <p>Now, five months after the controversy, the artist, <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1995907613004018047?s=20">Antireal, has posted on X stating</a> that the “<i>Marathon</i> art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Marathon art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction.</p> <p>— N² (@4nt1r34l) <a href="https://twitter.com/4nt1r34l/status/1995907613004018047?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This comes after a few months of silence from both parties. Bungie placed blame on a former employee and stated it would conduct a review of all of its assets to make sure it wouldn’t happen again.</p>

 <p>Antireal hasn’t shared the details of what was involved in the resolution, but as her post indicates, she appears to be happy with how it all shaked out.</p> <p><i>Marathon</i>’s early previews, meanwhile, haven’t been entirely positive. The hero-based extraction shooter has failed to impress fans of the studio and the genre broadly speaking. Still, the gorgeous aesthetic at work in the game’s art was one of the shooter’s highlights. That was all thrown into chaos after the plagiarism revelations.</p> <p>The developer recently conducted some private tests for the shooter, but a release date is still nowhere to be found following the game’s delay earlier this year. Sony has claimed Marathon will launch before April 2026.</p>

              <p><span>The Department of Homeland Security has been using memes and shitposts to promote its Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, including imagery and music from series like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-ice-trump-microsoft-developers-criticism-2000639666"><i><span>Halo</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>to create disgusting viral videos promoting the capture and deportation of people of color. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><span>said it wasn’t involved</span></a><span> in the September video’s creation, but neither company disavowed the use of its IP to promote state-sanctioned violence. Whoever runs Xbox and The Pokémon Company’s social media accounts and public relations could learn a little bit from pop star </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-sabrina-carpenter-icon-skin-leak-festival-1851772197"><span>Sabrina Carpenter</span></a><span>, who did more to shame the Trump Administration’s “inhumane agenda” with a single post than either of those huge franchises.</span></p> <p><span>On Monday, December 1, the White House posted a video of ICE agents arresting people set to Carpenter’s sexy single “Juno.” The song has a line in which the singer asks her partner if he’s “ever tried ‘this one,’” referencing a sexual position. When Carpenter performed this song on the Short n’ Sweet Tour, she would imitate a position on stage that became a viral tour moment, as she rarely did the same position twice. Unfortunately, virality means that the worst people you know become aware of something and co-opt it to make shitty videos in which the “positions” in question are various ways ICE agents pin people down and arrest them.</span></p>

 <p><span>Carpenter, to her credit, has responded to the video and has, in no uncertain terms, told the Trump Administration to keep her songs out of their fuckin’ mouth.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">this video is evil and disgusting.

The statement, issued to <a href="https://zeteo.com/p/trump-white-house-sabrina-carpenter"><em>Zeteo</em></a>, mixes in references to Carpenter’s music (he a fan) and says it’s only deporting “illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles.” This ignores the fact that non-criminal ICE arrests <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-detainee-data-fastest-growing-without-criminal-records-trump/">have skyrocketed under the Trump Administration</a>.</p>

 <p>“Here’s a Short n’ Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: We won’t apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in the statement. “Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?”</p> <p><span>Carpenter doesn’t make any mention of legal action, though her fans are urging the singer to file a copyright strike against The White House.

              <p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>‘s European concert is selling out in record time. <em>Megabonk</em> is back in the running for The Game Awards. Also RIP to the fish that did what many players couldn’t. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Rockstar Games cofounder Dan Houser likened AI hype to “<a href="https://youtu.be/d4RTTcvFxJU?si=3rw5DLWLXvhGrG7D">Mad Cow disease</a>.” Every game store should add that as a disclaimer: this game was made using generative AI tools. It might slop-ify your brain as a result. Play at your own peril.</p> <h2>The goldfish beat Malenia but couldn’t overcome a systemic bacterial infection</h2> <p>Tortellini, the viral goldfish that <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-malenia-boss-goldfish-twitch-stream-1850610071">played<em> Elden Ring</em></a> and other games using a motion censor in its fish tank, has died at the age of three (via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/viral-goldfish-that-beat-elden-rings-hardest-bosses-dies-aged-3-3289242/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>). The pet’s owner, YouTuber Pointcrow, said the goldfish had spent weeks battling an infection, and things took a turn for the worse over Thanksgiving week.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unfortunately, my goldfish Tortellini has passed away.</p> <p>He's been unwell for the past couple weeks fighting a systemic bacterial infection, and took a turn for the worse last night.

He was a big spender, notably buying an Oil Cooler Inlet Pipe for a Nissan Altima and TWO designer bags,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/PointCrow/status/1994132270530335040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1994132270530335040%7Ctwgr%5Ed298b2c1cbf436e9124962999c8b297578559dc1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fgaming%2Fviral-goldfish-that-beat-elden-rings-hardest-bosses-dies-aged-3-3289242%2F">wrote</a> in a tribute posted last week. “He was there to make us all laugh and bewilder us on how a small fish could do so much. He’s lived a god damn good life. I miss him so much. I’m sure he’s swimming in the great tank in the sky right now as happy as he can be.”</p>

 <h2>Someone finally escaped from <em>Escape from Tarkov</em></h2> <p>A streamer who goes by Tigz has spent years playing the extraction shooter in Early Access, but was finally able to complete its last mission now that the game recently went 1.0 (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a>). Unlocking the ending required a harrowing playthrough of the new map Terminal, but Tigz reportedly only got the second-worst ending out of four. While he’s the first player to officially “<a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1995598764103663793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1995598764103663793%7Ctwgr%5Ebebcf1413e76f5906a67c6d4b11fc0f6b352f720%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fsomeone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov%2F">beat</a>” the game, someone else out there still has the chance to be the first to unlock<em> Tarkov</em>‘s best ending.</p>

 <h2><em>Megabonk</em> still has a shot at winning The Game Awards</h2> <p>While the game’s creator took the <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-dev-officially-withdraws-it-from-the-game-awards-2000645270">unprecedented step</a> of removing <em>Megabonk</em>‘s nomination for best debut indie game since he said he’d shipped other things in the past, it’s back in the player’s choice category. It’ll have to pass successive rounds of voting to make it into the finals. “I withdrew my other nomination due to <em>Megabonk</em> not fitting the category, but with this new nomination, we’re more back than ever. go vote pls,” Vedinad <a href="https://twitter.com/MegabonkGame/status/1995560069413655012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1995560069413655012%7Ctwgr%5Eacb23534c17e27b9e548b9286fa2df33607769d8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Fmegabonk-game-awards-fan-vote-players-choice-category-ballot-vedinad%2F">wrote on X</a> this week.</p>

Only a few locations, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, and Strasbourg, still have tickets available. Fans said seats for the concert in the biggest cities like London evaporated immediately. I guess players are into video game concerts after all, <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-concert-cancelled-dates-delay-us-tour-2000632085">but only ones with great music</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Ball X Pit</em> is getting a bunch of free DLC</h2> <p>2025’s hit indie dopamine machine will be giving fans more balls and more pits in early 2026. Publisher Devolver Digital revealed the game has now sold over 1 million copies and has a post-release roadmap. An update titled Regal arrives in January, one called Shadow arrives in April, and one called Natrulaist arrives in July. They’ll all be free and add new balls, evolutions, buildings, characters, “AND MORE.” I guess the arcade roguelike is going to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ball-x-pit-vampire-survivors-balatro-roguelike-2000642155">steal a good portion of my game time</a> next year as well.</p> <h2>The architect of the PS5 is in love with <em>Pikmi</em>n</h2> <p>Mark Cerny revealed the Nintendo exclusive was one of his favorite games in a recent interview on Simon Parkin’s <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console">My Perfect Console</a> (via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/im-a-sucker-when-it-comes-to-story-ps45-architect-recalls-transformative-experience-with-a-gamecube-classic"><em>NintendoLife</em></a>). “I had this thing where I tended to play smaller, lighter games for about 10 years, so I don’t know, <em>Portal</em> or<em> Plants vs Zombies</em> or<em> Flower</em> or <em>Katamari Damacy</em>,” the <em>Marble Madness</em> creator said. “<em>Pikmin</em> I just pick out of that list because I thought it was such an emotionally involving story.

		<p>Paradox Tinto has remained busy after the release of Europa Universalis V last month, pushing out a clutch of patches and with a testing regime for upcoming changes. The tail end of November was all about the 1.0.8 beta patches, and now those improvements have gone live for the main development path, bringing hundreds of bug fixes, and some nice new tweaks and features.</p>
<p>On a high level, the patch brings eight new advances for the Aztec formable country, six new advances for the Two Sicilies formables, one more Tenochtitlan advance, and two more Sicilian and Neapolitan advances that can also be unlocked.</p>

                <p>A handful of new Mega-Evolved Pokemon are making their debut in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>'s upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-dlc-is-coming-really-soon-brings-new-mega-evolutions-and-donuts/1100-6535993/" data-ref-id="1100-6535993">Mega Dimension DLC</a>, and ahead of the expansion's launch, The Pokemon Company has revealed another new one: a second Mega Evolution for Lucario.</p><p>Mega Lucario Z marks the game's first Z Mega Evolution--a new kind of Mega-Evolved form that has a shorter cooldown period, but depletes Mega Energy much more quickly. According to the official <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/mega-lucario-z-debuts-in-pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pokemon website</a>, "Pokemon that undergo Z Mega Evolution require less time to fire off moves after receiving the orders from their Trainer, but they also burn through their Mega Power very quickly, making them less suited for long battles."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UkrLROjkA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V_UkrLROjkA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Like the original Mega Lucario, Mega Lucario Z is a steel and fighting type. Where this form differs, however, is in its defense and speed stats. As the official Pokemon website explains, "While Mega Lucario concentrates its aura into a destructive force, Mega Lucario Z uses it to surround its entire body, cloaking itself to increase its defense, flexibility, and agility."</p><p>It's unclear how many other Pokemon will be able to undergo Z Mega Evolution, but we've already gotten a look at several new Mega-Evolved forms coming in the Mega Dimension DLC. In addition to Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y, the DLC will introduce Mega Evolutions for Baxcalibur, Chimecho, and the mythical Pokemon Zeraora.</p><p>Pokemon Legends: Z-A's Mega Dimension DLC launches on December 10 and costs $30. The expansion takes players to an alternate dimension known as Hyperspace Lumiose, where they'll encounter Pokemon not normally available in the base game, including wild Pokemon that are over level 100.</p><p>In the meantime, Pokemon Legends: Z-A's third Ranked Battle season is underway until December 17. Players who hit Rank S before the season ends will receive a Mega Stone for Chestnaught. A new Mystery Gift is also now available. All players can claim a free Mewtwonite X and Mewtwonite Y, which will unlock a new side quest that leads to an encounter with the legendary Pokemon Mewtwo.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>A new report has shed more light on the CEO succession plans at Disney, with a story from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-bob-iger-next-ceo-f571257c?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcAnvO9HkSwOq6dtHvI9PgJs3zhb49bj_LauaFJs14tv8lhB61GX4WPPBJja20%3D&amp;gaa_ts=692f2221&amp;gaa_sig=5rTkrqo_jsKcEoMTYLBST2cadphurZq06o0aS9vWQa9F-lFkDGUUH5KOtfmQmf5ojqy4aIYuQjsxv9Dmruz0-g%3D%3D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Wall Street Journal</a> saying leading candidate Josh D'Amaro wants to focus more on gaming. The same report also suggested that Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson is not going to get the job.</p><p>It was previously reported that Disney's board considered external candidates to take over for Bob Iger, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-reportedly-in-the-mix-to-be-the-next-disney-boss/1100-6527707/" data-ref-id="1100-6527707">including Wilson</a>. But the new report said Disney is likely to choose an internal candidate. Wilson, for his part, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">staying on with EA amidst the company's $55 billion sale. </a></p><p>The new Disney CEO could be D'Amaro, who is currently the current head of Disney Experiences--a sprawling unit that covers theme parks, consumer products, cruise ships, and video games. The WSJ report said D'Amaro--who is "widely considered" to be named the next CEO--wants to give video games "a bigger role at the company." The report said D'Amaro is also looking to integrate "gaming technology" into Disney's creative processes. No further details were divulged, however.</p><p>Disney already uses Epic's Unreal technology for filmmaking, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-how-star-wars-the-mandalorian-used-fortnite-en/1100-6473958/" data-ref-id="1100-6473958">The Mandalorian employing the Fortnite tech</a> to project scenes onto LED screens surrounding the physical set.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUnxzVOs3rk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gUnxzVOs3rk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>D'Amaro is already making moves at Disney in regards to gaming. He spearheaded Disney's $1.5 billion investment into Epic Games for a future Fortnite collaboration and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-its-fortnite-deal-is-so-important-we-have-to-adapt/1100-6526831/" data-ref-id="1100-6526831">previously discussed why gaming is so important to Disney.</a></p><p>D'Amaro said Walt Disney himself was an "adventurer" and a "risk-taker," going on to say what Disney is now trying to achieve through Fortnite is an extension of that spirit.</p><p>"We should never rest on past success. We should always look for the next big idea, the next big challenge," he said. "If we'd always relied on what worked in the past, the Walt Disney Company might not exist today. As consumer preferences continue to shift, we have to adapt, or we are going to be left behind."</p><p>Characters and content from Disney's Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and Avatar brands, among others, will be represented in Fortnite. Disney and Epic have yet to officially unveil any specific projects in Fortnite tied to Disney, but many are hoping to see some kind of "virtual Disney World."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2bRcSIUsE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Yf2bRcSIUsE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For more, be sure read GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-fortnite-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6534455/" data-ref-id="1100-6534455">everything we know about the Disney x Fortnite project.</a></p><p>Disney was at one time a bigger player in the world of video games, as the company had its own dedicated internal gaming division with Disney Interactive Studios. Disney also operated the once-popular Disney Infinity "toys-to-life" brand, but it also shuttered. Today, Disney's efforts in gaming mainly involve licensing its brands to other companies. In 2019, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/bob-iger-disney-isnt-particularly-good-at-publishing-games-1183088/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Iger spoke candidly about Disney's struggles</a> making and publishing games internally, admitting, "We haven't been particularly good..."</p><p>Disney does, however, do some internal game production and development within the Disney Experiences team. Right now, the company has <a href="https://www.disneycareers.com/en/category/gaming-and-interactive-jobs/391/8221696/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">four open positions for video games</a>, including multiple producer roles and a pair of engineering jobs.</p><p>As for Iger, he has said he plans to leave Disney at the end of 2026, and many are speculating his replacement could be named early next year. As many may recall, Iger retired at the end of 2021, but came back in November 2022 after his replacement, Bob Chapek, was dismissed amid multiple controversies.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> on PC just got a whole lot smaller, with developer Arrowhead Studios announcing a new, "slim" version of the game that reduces the game's install size by 131GB.</p><p dir="ltr">Fans on PC have long complained about the PC version's huge install size (and other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-prioritizing-patches-every-two-weeks-to-reduce-critical-bug-count/1100-6535835/" data-ref-id="1100-6535835">technichal issues</a>), which since the game's launch in 2024 has ballooned to 154GB. That's much larger than the close-to-22GB size of the console versions.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQPp9ZCgrP8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QQPp9ZCgrP8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Arrowhead stated in a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/553850/announcements/detail/491583942944621372" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> its long-term goal has always been to reduce the PC install size, but that now, with help from Nixxes Software, that goal has become a reality "much sooner than expected." Helldivers 2 on PC now only takes up 23GB--an 85% size reduction.</p><p dir="ltr">Users on PC who play Helldivers 2 on an HDD may experience slightly increased load times of a few seconds with this change, according to Arrowhead. The studio previously said it believed removing duplicate data on PC (which contributed to the game's huge install size) could potentially greatly increase load times for HDD players. Arrowhead said it now has data to prove that's not the case, as the majority of Helldivers 2's load times are due to level generation rather than asset loading.</p><p dir="ltr">There is, however, one catch to Helldivers 2's new, much smaller size. Players who want to free up space on their drive will need to opt in to a new "beta" version of Helldivers 2 on Steam, after which the game will update and its file size will be reduced. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to enable it.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Find Helldivers 2 in your Steam library and right click</li><li dir="ltr">Select Properties from the drop down menu</li><li dir="ltr">Select the Betas tab</li><li dir="ltr">In the Beta Participation drop down list, select "prod_slim"</li><li dir="ltr">Close the dialog box and Helldivers 2 will update to the new version</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Arrowhead stated that once players using the beta version confirm there are no issues present, the slim version will become the default. For a limited time after that, players will be able to opt in to the legacy version if need be. However, given that there are only "very minor differences in loading times" between each version, Arrowhead will not continue to support the legacy version long term, as it would add "extra burden" to the development team.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside the file-size reduction on PC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-python-commandos-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-7282/" data-ref-id="2900-7282">Helldivers 2's new Python Commando Warbond is also live</a>, adding a flame-spewing drone, minigun, chainsword, and more for Super Earth's defenders to add to their arsenal. The Warbond was delayed in order for Arrowhead to better start addressing various bugs and technical concerns players have had with Helldivers 2, including the game's file size.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Helldivers news, Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-movie-lands-fast-furious-director/1100-6536624/" data-ref-id="1100-6536624">Helldivers film just found a director in Justin Lin</a>, known for his work on the Fast and Furious film franchise.</p>

The studio recently underwent layoffs and put a second in-the-works project on hold until Mina the Hollower releases.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's make-or-break for sure," Velasco said. "If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden. If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great.

At the time of the delay, the studio said it "wasn't a major delay" and was to done in order to "apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine." The studio said it didn't want to announce a new release date until the game was submitted to platform holders.</p><p dir="ltr">It was only in 2024 that the entire studio shifted to work on Mina the Hollower, a top-down Zelda-like with Game Boy-era visuals, with the studio having previously been split into two teams. One team worked on Mina while the other worked on an unannounced 3D Shovel Knight sequel, according to Bloomberg.</p><p dir="ltr">Yacht Club released its debut Shovel Knight, a throwback platformer starring a knight that wielded a shovel, to great success in 2014. The character struck a chord with players, and Shovel Knight even received an official Amiibo from Nintendo and was included in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as an assist trophy.</p><p dir="ltr">The studio spent the years after Shovel Knight's release crafting various expansions and spin-offs. Yacht Club's most recent release was 2022's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shovel-knight-dig/" data-ref-id="5000-501664">Shovel Knight Dig</a>, developed in collaboration with Nitrome.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Too Real, News Tower]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/news-tower-impressions/</link>
            <guid>1370728</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I’ve finally been playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1649950/News_Tower/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>News Tower</u></em></a>, a management game where you’re put in charge of every facet of a 1930s newspaper. Like, <em>every</em> facet, from which reporters cover which stories to making sure the bathroom is clean. It’s the kind of video game stuff I tend to love, but all of it taking the form of running a news outlet hits a little too close to home.</p><p>One of the last freelance pieces I wrote before starting as managing editor of Kotaku in 2016 was a review of <a href="https://unwinnable.com/2016/02/04/doing-your-job-in-the-westport-independent/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Westport Independent</u></em></a>, an indie newspaper management game that was mostly focused on the editorial end of things. I remember finding both the game and writing the review emotional, making me think about what my editing career had been up to that point and what it would look like in my new role. And while being managing editor involved, well, both <a href="https://kotaku.com/goodbye-and-tktk-1847173953?ref=aftermath.site"><u>managing and editing</u></a>, there were still big chunks of the business that were firmly other people’s problems.</p><p>Not so now, and not so in <em>News Tower</em>. In the game, you inherit a struggling paper and, most crucially, the building it’s housed in. The newsgathering is pretty simple: your telegraph operators find news across the city and globe, and then you send a reporter to cover it based on their strength in its subject area, such as sports, crime, politics, or economy. When a reporter is done they hand their story off to be typeset and assembled, and at the end of the week, you arrange your stories onto the pages of a newspaper and print it off to be sold. All of this takes in-game time; you have to juggle how long stories take to report to make sure you have enough to fill your pages, and I’ve spent a lot of the game’s Sunday evenings muttering “come on, come on” as the assembly person’s progress bar slowly filled and the clock ticked down.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zEya-_8sxsI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="News Tower - 1.0 Launch Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>But you play as the publisher, not the editor-in-chief. Beyond the work of the paper itself, there are all kinds of other things to oversee. You lay out your newsroom, buying and placing everything from reporters’ desks to lamps to trash cans. The printing press takes up a ton of space, and it’s also hot and noisy, which saw me sequestering it to its own floor and then desperately arranging acoustic panels and tiny fans around it. You need paper, someplace to store the paper, and someone to carry the paper where it needs to go. Your employees get hungry and thirsty, so you need a water cooler and food for them. They need to use the bathroom, so you need air vents to keep the bathroom from stinking and an employee to keep it clean. Things break, so you need a repairperson to fix them.&nbsp;</p><p>Employees will get uncomfortable if their physical needs aren’t met, slowing them down. I’m early in my first run with the game, and my person in charge of stocking supplies is unhappy with everything: it’s too dark at his desk, the printer is too loud and hot when he has to put paper in it, the bathroom is too stinky when he has to go in it. I’ve literally carried out his duties for him, using my mouse to drag boxes of paper from outside the news office up to the shelves as he meandered up and down the stairs, all while bemoaning our lack of paper.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d like to give him another lamp or more fans or some help, but I currently have barely enough money to keep us in business. I’ve refused to take out a loan, even though I’ve been making extra money by doing deals for the mafia instead. I’ve sold off odds and ends to scrape together handfuls of dollars for something I need more urgently, swiping up reporters’ potted plants and clustering their desks around a single light bulb, swearing I’ll fix things later if we can just sell enough papers this week. This money stress has made me unkind to my virtual employees; I swung from making my reporters a lovely little newsroom to snapping “You wouldn’t complain about the lighting if you were out <em>reporting</em>” within a handful of in-game time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Sparrow Night</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>News Tower</em> is paced such that none of this is too stressful mechanically. Since the reporting largely happens on its own once you set it ticking, you have plenty of time for this day-to-day management, and you can move and re-do your layout easily. The game gives you plenty of clues to what’s wrong, if you have the means to fix it. But emotionally, I’m finding it <em>a lot</em>. It feels like there’s so much to handle, and so much of it relies on money I don’t have, and I <em>still </em>want to make everyone happy and not fire anyone. On top of all <em>that,</em> I still really want to make a good, honest paper that highlights the most important news, even as I promise the mafia I’ll do the opposite. There’s so much to do and so few resources to do all of it perfectly, but I’m still so certain I can, even as this commitment just digs me deeper into an early-game hole.</p><p>I’ve never really had the experience of a management game not feeling fun because it’s too similar to my real life. A game like <a href="https://aftermath.site/frostpunk-2-impressions/"><em><u>Frostpunk</u></em></a> is a harsh setting I’ll never find myself in; <a href="https://aftermath.site/stardew-valley-concernedape-haunted-chocolatier-interview/"><em><u>Stardew Valley</u></em></a> is a lovely escape that sands all the rough edges off actual farming. I usually love little chores in games like this, but all the little chores in <em>News Tower</em> are just pinging all my brain cells attuned to my real life chores. I recently got access to the game’s financial reports, and I’ll be honest I can barely look at them without thinking about my own real-life financial reports and all the responsibilities they entail.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m drawn to the game because it’s about journalism, but maybe I’m not in a place to play a journalism management game right now. This might be praise for <em>News Tower</em>: It definitely feels like running a news outlet, or at least running a news outlet if you’re me, someone with an over-developed sense of responsibility and a self-imposed mandate to do everything perfectly that I should probably work out in therapy instead of in a video game. There’s definitely a lesson in here about priorities and time management that I badly need to learn. At least my real life news outlet is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aftermath.site/post/3m6iaw6hrcc2m?ref=aftermath.site"><u>doing a lot better</u></a> than my virtual one, and at least the only bathroom I have to deal with there is my own. (Which is also currently dirty, oh no.)&nbsp; </p>

<figure data-uuid="51f69cd3c3a3b"><a title="Mina the Hollower" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51f69cd3c3a3b/mina-the-hollower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>We have been keeping an eye on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> for some years now. This is the GBC-looking Zelda-like from Yacht Club Games, the studio behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shovel_knight_treasure_trove">Shovel Knight</a>, that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/shovel-knight-devs-new-game-mina-the-hollower-smashes-kickstarter-goal">launched on Kickstarter</a> back in 2022, and only recently missed out on its initial release date thanks to a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/retro-zelda-inspired-adventure-mina-the-hollower-has-been-delayed-for-switch-2-and-switch">last-minute delay</a>. It feels like it has been a long time coming, a fact that Yacht Club is reportedly painfully aware of.</p>
<p>In a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), studio founder Sean Velasco described Mina as "make-or-break" for the future of Yacht Club Games. In the time since Shovel Knight, the studio has downsized, faced a global pandemic and divided its teams into two — later reforged into one — and delays don't come cheap, either. “If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden," Velasco told Bloomberg, "If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great. If we sold, like, 100,000, that’s not so good”.</p><div><figure data-videoid="W9fsZhwHLmM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytW9fsZhwHLmM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5efcbejsliqr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>According to the report, the game's inception came back in 2019 by designer Alec Faulkner. Yacht Club initially split its staff into two teams — one focusing on Mina, and the other on a 3D Shovel Knight follow-up — though the former project quickly grew in ambition, with Faulkner reportedly struggling to operate as the game's director.</p>
<p>Seeing that the system wasn't working, the studio laid off some staff to cut expenses and re-combined the teams to focus purely on the Mina project, with Velasco stepping into the director role. According to artist Sandy Gordon, had the team stuck together right from the jump, "we would’ve finished it two to three years ago".</p>
<p>"If Mina flops, we'll still be around," Velasco told Bloomberg, though he's quick to clarify that they would "need more money". The studio is already taking steps to cut back on this front, moving fully remote at the end of the year and shifting its attention to only working on one project at a time.</p>
<p>From the little of Mina that we have seen so far, we remain cautiously optimistic that the full game will deliver the goods. There's a free demo now available on the eShop (sporting 120fps on Switch 2, no less), and it plays every bit as much like a 2D Zelda game as you would hope. A delay is never a welcome sight, but our fingers are crossed that we don't have to wait too long to see things hit their full potential.</p>

			<p>Squeezing itself in <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-clair-obscur-hades-2-the-game-awards-players-voice-awards-nominees/">just before The Game Awards</a>, 11 bit Studios has announced that it will host its first-ever digital showcase next week on December 8, 2025, at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET. It'll be livestreamed on the studio's YouTube channel and in partnership with IGN on its YouTube channel, featuring new looks at Frostpunk 2 DLC, new content coming to The Alters, and more.</p>



<p>The publisher and developer will include information on games it worked on in both capacities, with its published titles like Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault and Death Howl making an appearance, along with games it developed, like the aforementioned The Alters and Frostpunk 2. A press release for the event also includes that "<em>there may be a surprise or two in there, of course</em>."  </p>



<p>Hot off the release of Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, which currently sits at a 'Very Positive' rating on Steam and just ahead of releasing Death Howl, 2025 has been a strong year for 11 bit Studios. The team has wins in both its publishing and development branches, with Moonlighter 2 representing the publishing win and The Alters representing its development win.</p>



<p>And that's even with The Alters getting caught up in one of the year's many scandals around developers using generative AI and not disclosing it. 11 bit Studios was caught using the technology for localization and a couple of small art assets, which did sour the game for some players, but that hasn't stopped it from being one of the highest-rated games in 2025, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=2">with an 85 on Metacritic and the 46th best 2025 release</a> as sorted by Metacritic score (technically, it's listed at 48th, but that's with Metacritic including re-releases of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom at the top).</p>



<p>This showcase is the chance for the studio to end 2025 off with a bang, since the showcase will not only do its best to get players amped for what it has coming down the pipeline, but it also coincides with the release of Frostpunk 2's first major DLC, Fractured Utopias.</p>



<p>We'll see if 11 bit Studios is able to stick the landing this coming Monday, December 8, 2025, at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Is The ‘Easiest’ Way To Kill A Leaper In Arc Raiders]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-leaper-kill-spaceport-trials-into-the-fray-2000649665</link>
            <guid>1370695</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are many reasons to kill a Leaper, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a>’ terrifying robotic spider-like menace that can cross vast distances in seconds. The quest “Into the Fray” specifically asks you to take one out. Weekly trials frequently require you to damage or destroy a Leaper. They’re also a source of some solid loot. Their <a href="https://ardb.tools/items/leaper-pulse-unit">Pulse Units</a> do respectable damage as a throwable and they’re needed for stage four of the current Expedition Project. Here’s the best way to take them out.</p>   <p>While I’d wager Leapers, though intimidating, are the weakest of the larger Arc forces, their ability to traverse large distances quickly makes them a tough target. They can also crush you to death without much effort. Luckily, they’re large, they can’t squeeze into tight spaces, and they don’t fire any projectiles. So if you can find a safe spot with a clear sightline, and you’ve got the right weapons, their ass is grass.</p>

 <p>After spending nearly 200 hours in this game, I’ve found what I consider to be the best place for taking down a Leaper quickly, whether you’re running solo or in a crew. To get there you’re gonna head to Spaceport, specifically the center of the map near the Central Elevator. There’s a bunker northeast of the Elevator, sandwiched in between it and the South Trench Tower. That’s our spot.</p>

 <p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trade-fruit-loot-scrappy-lemons-mushrooms-2000649233">Extraction Shooter Player Puts Down Guns And Starts Selling Fruit Instead</a></p> <p>The only downside to this spot is that it’s in a wide open area, so you’re unlikely to be the only one who’ll join the fight and you’ll have to keep an eye out for hostile players. To be honest, this is also true of just about any place in the game. But this specific location has a few critical advantages when it comes to PvP and quick extraction, so let’s dive in.</p>

 <h2>Spaceport: The ultimate Leaper killing grounds</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000649669" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649669"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649669">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This bunker is an excellent location to dig in for a Leaper assault as both of its doors are pre-blocked (if you get there and there’s no option to breach the door, it means other players have broken in already). The Leaper won’t be able to climb into the bunker and, as I mentioned before, they don’t shoot projectiles, so if you stay away from the windows when it charges up its singularity area-of-effect attack, you’re basically untouchable while you pour the heat on our robotic spider pal.</p>

 <p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-field-depot-crate-off-radar-down-to-earth-2000642525">This Is The ‘Easiest’ Field Depot In&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em></a></p> <p>Speaking of that Leaper, they usually spawn in the surrounding area. You’ll typically see it walking around near the Elevator, or close to the Launch Towers and Departure Building south of the Elevator.</p>

 <p>Sometimes, a Leaper will also spawn on the opposite, eastern side of the Launch Towers. In theory, you can lure one over to the aforementioned bunker, but it’s a hike and you open yourself to a lot of risk by doing so. If there’s no Leaper in the area near the bunker, I advise making yourself busy with something else and loading back into a new instance of the map where, hopefully, our prey will be waiting.</p>

 <h2>Step one: Arming up and fortifying the bunker</h2> <p><b><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-guns-blue-green-purple-gold-best-2000644142">Any gun with Heavy Ammo</a> will deliver sufficient damage to the Leaper.</b> A maxed-out <a href="https://ardb.tools/weapons/ferro-i">Ferro</a> will do well, as will an <a href="https://ardb.tools/weapons/anvil-i">Anvil</a>. If you’re bringing either of those weapons, be sure to have a healthy amount of ammo. The Leaper will go down faster than you think, but it will take a lot of shots.</p> <p>Hullcrackers are okay, but I’d save those for bigger threats. Thrown explosives are also handy to have, though having said that, we’re going to be shooting the Leaper through a two-foot window in the bunker and there’s a good chance that in the chaos of your assault, you may screw up the throw and end up bouncing the grenade back into the bunker and, well, that’s a less-than-ideal situation.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-inventory-full-stash-loadout-crafting-cheat-sheet-2000643629">The Hoarder’s Guide To Managing Your <em>Arc Raiders</em> Inventory</a></p> <p>If you’re at all a fan of <i>Rainbow Six: Siege</i>, you’re going to <i>love </i>this next part. Any combination of the following items will help make your mission more successful:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://ardb.tools/items/barricade-kit">Barricade Kit</a></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://ardb.tools/items/door-blocker">Door Blocker</a></li> <li aria-level="1">Any trap or mine (Blaze Grenade Traps, Jolt Mines, or even Trigger ‘Nades will work well)</li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://ardb.tools/items/lure-grenade">Lure Grenade</a> (good for sending the Leaper or other Arc away from you if things get messy)</li> </ul> <p>While the Leaper can’t get into the bunker, other players can and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvp-betrayal-bounty-rat-camp-2000649163">there’s no guarantee that they’ll be friendly</a>. So we have to do what we can to make it hard for other players to get inside while you’re taking on the Leaper.</p> <p>Good thing the bunker is pre-blocked! Other players can break those blocks, but they make a lot of sound while doing so, which can buy you time to shift your focus to the invading threat.</p> <p>But you’ll need to smash one of the blocks yourself to get in. I recommend picking the west-facing door to break open. <b>Once you’re inside, immediately block that door again with a Door Blocker </b><b><i>or</i></b><b> place Barricade Kits right up to both doors</b>. (You can get the Barricade Kit close enough to the door frame that you can’t walk past it on the western door. This is harder to do on the eastern door, hence the reason I advise leaving that door untouched when you break in).</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649667" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649667"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649667">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>At this point, with doors blocked or barricaded, you’ll have bought yourself some valuable time from invading players looking to take advantage of you. Also, since there’ll be a Leaper jumping around the bunker as you attack it, enemy players open themselves up to serious risk if they try to break through the door blocks or take down the barricades.</p> <p>Still, there’s a chance an enemy player can get in to ruin your day. It can be hard to hear an enemy player breaching a door or taking down a barricade while the Leaper is making a racket while bouncing around.</p> <p>That’s where the traps come in handy. Go nuts here with whatever you have: Place Jolt Mines in front of the door or behind barricades. Rig the door with Blaze Grenade Traps. You could even place some <a href="https://ardb.tools/items/laser-trap-lure">Lure Traps</a> which in theory would go off, sending the Leaper to the doorway and calling over any nearby drones, positioning the invading player in between you and Arc threats.</p>

 <p>You can also place some Explosive Mines at the doors too, but I’d be wary of the shrapnel inside the bunker hitting you. There’s risk of that with the Jolt Mine too, but those just temporarily stun and don’t do any damage.</p> <h2>Step two: Luring the Leaper and commencing the attack</h2> <p>Once you’ve fortified the bunker, you should be able to spot a Leaper from inside. There’s usually one patrolling south of the bunker. If there’s no Leaper in the area, you may have to just reload into a new instance. It’s a common area for our spider pal, so you’ll see one eventually. Just fire a shot at it to get its attention and let it race over to try and attack you.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000649668" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649668"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649668">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Since it can’t get into the bunker, it won’t be much of a threat to you. Its charged-up area-of-effect attack <i>can</i> do damage if you’re close enough to the window, so if you see it charging up, just back away from the window.</p> <p><b>Prioritize your fire on its eye.</b> Just keep pouring the damage in. It’ll go faster if you’re with friends, but this is a perfectly soloable activity provided you brought enough ammo. Also, <a href="https://youtu.be/qLlNpSXlgAM">it sure would be nice if you had some grenades</a> or <a href="https://ardb.tools/items/wolfpack">Wolfpacks</a> (just be careful throwing them).</p>

 <p>The Leaper isn’t a total fool, however. After taking enough damage without returning any, it will start to walk away from the bunker. If you keep shooting it, however, you’ll retrigger its aggravated state and it will continue to try and jump on top of the bunker and squeeze into the windows. But try as it might, it can’t.</p> <p>Keep shooting and it will eventually go down.</p> <h2>Step three: Loot (if you need it) and GTFO</h2> <p>You’re going to make <i>a ton</i> of racket with this assault. Any nearby players who are looking to take advantage of you might wait until you’re looting the wreckage to jump you. So, once the Leaper’s dead, head out, grab what you need and then race over to the nearby Elevator to extract.</p>

 <p>Unless you’re doing a Night Raid (where Elevators are your only way out), I advise using a <a href="https://ardb.tools/items/raider-hatch-key">Raider Hatch Key</a> to get out somewhere else so you don’t have to mess around with any rats camping the Elevator.</p> <h2>Closing thoughts and considerations</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000649670" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649670"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649670">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Just about any place similar to this bunker will be a good spot for taking out a Leaper. That said, this particular bunker on Spaceport is advantageous given its proximity to an Elevator for quick extraction, the fact that the doors come pre-blocked, and its right near a common Leaper spawn point.</p>

 <p>There is a pre-blocked bunker south of the Central Elevator that also may work, but it’s a bit too close to the Departures and Arrivals Building where hostile players may be waiting to snipe or jump you.</p> <p><b>Also, if you’re taking out a Leaper for a weekly trial, be sure to run this tactic during a Night Raid or an Electromagnetic Storm since it will double the trial points.</b> The storms are riskier if you want to loot the remains as you open yourself up to a lightning strike, however.</p> <p>There are many other places across <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ current maps to take out Leapers, but this bunker in Spaceport is by far the most reliable spot to just load in and kill one while covering your ass from any rats looking to ruin your day.</p> <p>Happy hunting!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-undertaker-trailer-forsaken-hollows/</link>
            <guid>1370662</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is getting a new DLC expansion in just two days from the time of this writing, with the release of<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows-release-date/"> The Forsaken Hollows DLC</a> arriving on December 4, 2025. The DLC was announced last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-in-the-works-fromsoftware-kadokawa/">just as players were complaining about a lack of content</a> in Nightreign.</p>



<p>The Undertaker is one of two new characters added in the DLC, with today's trailer showcasing an impressive flying move where the Undertaker charges into enemies through the air, with a direct hit stunning even the more terrifying bosses.</p>



<p>When the DLC was announced last month, the Undertaker was described as a character featuring "<em>impressive strength and faith</em>," which this trailer definitely leans into with her swinging a heavy weapon around. In a press release, FromSoftware adds that she "<em>lets her faith be the hammer that purges the darkness festering in Limveld</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN The Forsaken Hollows | Undertaker Character Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z8qzE__2TTc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Forsaken Hollows also adds a second new playable character, the Scholar, and two new bosses for players to fight with these new characters. It also adds The Great Hollow, a hole that opened in Limveld and isn't exactly a whole new map, but it seems to at least be a new area of Limveld for players to explore.</p>



<p>Overall, it'll be interesting to see how players respond to the Forsaken Hollows. If you didn't purchase the deluxe edition of Elden Ring Nightreign, then you'll have to pick up this DLC separately as a paid expansion for $15 USD. It's not the biggest ask, but after months of players complaining that Nightreign lacked post-launch support, arriving late to the party with two new characters, two new bosses, and a new sub-area might not be what players had in mind when thinking about what they would expect from paid DLC.</p>



<p>Of course, those who absolutely devour new content within the first few days of its release aren't the example to use for how the community feels about the new DLC overall; you can practically write the Steam reviews now for the players that have tens of hours in Nightreign already, who will complete all the new content within two days of its launch, complaining that there wasn't more to do.</p>



<p>That said, it's not unfair to say that if Nightreign wants to maintain the commercial success it achieved in 2025, FromSoftware will likely need to do more for it than it currently is.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> developers Embark have shed a bit of light on how their looter-shooter changed after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-from-the-finals-devs-is-no-longer-free-to-play-and-coming-2025">shifting away from the free-to-play business model</a> back in 2024. Apparently, it made Arc "drastically easier" to design, in the sense that the Swedish studio felt less pressure to turn players into whales.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
That's my admittedly rather blunt reading of the latest Arc Raiders <a href="https://youtu.be/ST_fD5NL_pg">behind-the-scenes development video</a>, as passed on by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embark-says-moving-from-free-to-play-made-designing-arc-raiders-drastically-easier">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. Embark's previous multiplayer FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a> was free-to-play, and Arc Raiders was due to follow in its footsteps, but as design director Virgil Watkins explains in the video, this made it harder to "respect the player's time" when plotting out Arc's extraction shooting.
</p>
<p>
"In free-to-play, you need to, in some ways, make things a little stickier than they would be otherwise, take a little more time, a little more grind just so players are more incentivised to stay in and stick into those loops and keep playing your game, and ideally are incentivised and inspired to spend money on that game," he says.
</p>
<p>
"For this type of title, it made it kind of hard to respect the player's time in some of these areas around crafting or sessions and things like that. We were almost like 'slow down a little bit'. It felt a little bad so as soon as that decision came down, it made us able to make things take the amount of time that felt appropriate in a lot of ways."
</p><p>
Watkins offers some examples of how Embark changed Arc Raiders after deciding to charge for it upfront. "Crafting no longer has timers on it that you need to wait out or the amounts of things we are asking you to collect are a little more rational," he comments. "Effort and outcome match each other a little more precisely." 
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the video, Embark CEO and founder Patrick Söderlund makes the obvious point that Arc would have landed more players upfront as an F2P game. "A free-to-play game would attract a lot of players and we can maybe get tens of millions of players for a while," he says. "But as we started building what would become the rebirth of Arc Raiders, the team started to ask me questions - was free-to-play the right model for us?"
</p>
<p>
If Arc is now an old-timey "premium" release, it's still not worlds away from many F2P games in its reliance on grinding resources out of the maps. It also has microtransactions - cue <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-celebrates-the-launch-of-a-new-region-in-the-north-line-update-with-microtransactions-price-cuts">a recent player controversy</a> about pricing - which are ubiquitous among videogames today, but are more prevalent in F2P releases for obvious reasons. 
</p>
<p>
"It's helped a lot, but on the other side, launching it with a price point, we still need ways to monetise that doesn't feel predatory," Watkins concedes of the switch to upfront payments in the video. "That's also been an interesting challenge."
</p><p>
At the time of writing, Embark are gearing up for the first Arc Raiders expedition. This basically lets you reset much of your progression - including your inventory, blueprints, player level, skill points, quest progress - by sending your Raider off to join a caravan of pioneers, once you've offered up sufficient resources for the trip.</p>
<p>Expeditions operate according to an eight-week schedule, with the first one due to "leave" on 21st December. In return for packing your current character off to the frontier, you'll get increased XP gain, Scrappy materials, bonus skill points, more and cheaper weapon repairs, and more stash space. It's a novel way of characterising the routine live service practice of bumping players back to square one, both for "prestige" and so that we have an incentive to climb the ladder once again.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-install-size-large-smaller-pc-update-150gb-arrowhead-2000649639</link>
            <guid>1370647</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> on PC is a solid version of Sony’s 2024 online co-op shooter. However, one significant flaw of the PC port was its massive installation size, which took up around 150GB of space and was approximately three times larger than the game on console. Arrowhead promised this would be cut down. And a new update does just that.</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371">Arrowhead Games posted a lengthy and detailed post</a> about the studio’s efforts to make the PC port of <em>Helldivers 2</em> less bloated. According to the team behind the sci-fi shooter, <em>Helldivers 2’s</em> total installation size on PC has been reduced from approximately 154 GB to around 23GB. That’s over 130GB slashed, which is <em>wild</em>. Arrowhead thanked support studio Nixxes, which apparently helped get the install size down to such a small amount.</p>

 <p>So why was <em>Helldivers 2</em> on PC so big compared to the console ports?<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286?l=english"> Well, as explained in this post from Arrowhead back in October</a>, <em>Helldivers 2</em> on PC supports both solid-state drives and older mechanical hard drives. In an effort to keep load times down and make<em> Helldivers 2</em> more optimized, Arrowhead included redundant and repeated files so that older drives that still spin tiny platters and seek out data wouldn’t be bogged down as much. This was a common technique back when games shipped on optical discs and when consoles didn’t use much faster solid-state drives. <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573">That’s also why the Xbox and PS5 ports of <em>Helldivers 2</em></a> were smaller in size: Those devices all have SSDs and don’t need redundant, repeated data to optimize loading.</p>

 <p>The majority of what was removed from<em> Helldivers 2</em> in the most recent update on PC were these redundant files. That might make you worry about players on PC still using older drives, but Arrowhead says load times for players on older systems will only be increased by a few seconds, a worthy tradeoff to get the file size below 25 GB.</p> <p>For now, this update is optional on PC as Arrowhead continues testing it to make sure nothing was overlooked. But eventually, sometime next year, this reduction in installation size will be mandatory as the studio doesn’t want to support two different versions of the game on PC.</p>

            <guid>1370641</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Face front, True Believers! With Tribute Games’ side-scrolling beat 'em up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> launching onto every system under the sun, we thought it would be the perfect time to look back on the history of Marvel video games and select the most standout entries featuring our favorite Marvel superheroes. This list features games based on any Marvel license, from solo vigilantes to teams of Earth’s mightiest heroes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some ground rules: we’ve picked just one game per subseries, so don’t expect to see all three Insomniac Spider-Man games on here, for example. All entries are primarily based on a Marvel IP, so we’re not including things like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 just because Spidey makes an appearance, or Fortnite for having a lot of Marvel collaborations. The game can’t be 100% unplayable (RIP Gazillion’s Marvel Heroes), and overall quality, historical relevance, and how successful it is at fulfilling the superhero fantasy of feeling like you’re within the Marvel Universe are all taken into account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that covered, let’s dive into IGN’s Top 10 Marvel Video Games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. X-Men: The Arcade Game</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/x-men-arcade-1764164630742.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami was the king of arcade hits throughout the 1990s, delivering many instant classics like The Simpsons, TMNT: Turtles in Time, and Dance Dance Revolution. Also included in that lineup is its take on X-Men, which continues to be one of the most endlessly replayable arcade games in Konami’s catalogue. Based on the Pryde of the X-Men animated pilot – a precursor to X-Men: The Animated Series – X-Men Arcade features six playable mutants traveling across the globe in an effort to thwart the schemes of Magneto, the villainous Master of Magnet (his words, not ours). </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/x-men-the-arcade-game">X-Men Arcade</a> doesn’t even take a full hour to complete, but its classic beat ‘em up design is polished to a mirror shine, so much so it’s impossible not to enjoy it with a group of friends. The goofy translations (“Welcome to die!”) only add to the game’s charm, and punching your way through armies of Sentinels, Reavers, and Magneto’s lieutenants is still as entertaining now as it was back in 1992. The last time it was re-released outside of specialty arcade cabinets was on the Xbox 360 and PS3, so we’re going to need a fresh port of it, stat.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Captain America: Super Soldier</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/captain-america-super-soldier-1764164776198.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Marvel Cinematic Universe changed the game for quite a few classic Marvel heroes, most notably those associated with the Avengers. Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America were hardly nobodies before the MCU, but their popularity skyrocketed thanks to the success of Marvel Studios’ first wave of films. Said films also received a few game tie-ins courtesy of Sega, but the only one that’s worth looking back on is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/captain-america-super-soldier">Captain America: Super Soldier</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starring the First Avenger on a WWII mission not shown in the film, the game features semi-open level design that unfolds across the campaign, and a rhythmic melee combat system – both of which are clearly inspired by Batman: Arkham Asylum. There are many foes to face, including several important villains from the comics, such as Baron Strucker, Madame Hydra, and Iron Cross. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Video games based on movies don’t typically play out well, but the key reason Captain America: Super Soldier fares better than its forgettable MCU tie-in peers is because it’s the only one that truly goes to lengths to make you feel like the hero it’s based on. Throwing Cap’s shield, deflecting enemy projectiles, and cracking Hydra skulls with a plethora of unique special move animations feels fantastic, and really sells the fantasy of playing as a super soldier.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Lego Marvel Super Heroes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/lego-marvel-super-heroes-1764164812047.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best examples of Lego’s long, long video game history also happens to be a Marvel game: Lego Marvel Super Heroes, released in 2013 by veteran brick game developer Traveller’s Tales. Featuring over 100 playable characters from the comics universe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-marvel-super-heroes">Lego Marvel Super Heroes</a> unquestionably has the best roster of any Lego Marvel game, since it doesn’t excise Fantastic Four and X-Men characters like its successors, Lego Marvel’s Avengers and Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2. That’s not to say there isn’t fun to be had in those games, but the first Lego Marvel adventure was one of the last games to feel like it was based on the classic era of Marvel comics, before everything became strangled by MCU synergy during the mid-2010s. Running around a Lego version of New York with your favorite Marvel heroes while working to thwart the schemes of Doctor Doom and eventually defeating a giant Lego Galactus is still some of the most fun you can have in a game flaunting the Lego brand.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/umvc3-1764164825231.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After developing multiple Marvel fighting games in the early ‘90s, such as X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes, Capcom crossed over one of their own brands with the Marvel Universe in X-Men vs. Street Fighter. The rest, as they say, is history, and the Marvel vs. Capcom series has remained one of the company’s most beloved franchises ever since. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Choosing between MVC2 and MVC3 was hard; the former is arguably more historically important and has a larger character roster, but the latter has secured this spot thanks to its gorgeous 3D graphics, improved musical score, and absolutely chaotic gameplay, which has been driving fighting fans bonkers since the game’s original release. The incredible animation work makes each match a visual feast to behold, and the game brought in many new important roster choices such as Phoenix, Dormammu, and MODOK. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ultimate-marvel-vs-capcom-3">Ultimate release</a> added even more iconic Marvel heroes, like Doctor Strange, Hawkeye, and Rocket Raccoon, thus making it the definitive version of one of the best fighting games ever made.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Marvel Rivals</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/marvel-rivals-1764164996969.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to launch a new live service game in today’s market; just ask Warner Bros. about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice Leagueign c</a> or Sony about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a>. But NetEase Games managed to pull it off with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, the most literal interpretation of the “hero shooter” genre. From slicing through enemies with Magik’s soulsword, to diving on opponents as Venom, or swallowing whole teams as the adorable Jeff the Land Shark, Rivals fulfills the fantasy of playing as Marvel’s most iconic heroes. These characters shoot (or otherwise maim/support) each other across a variety of maps that also pull from Marvel’s rich comic history, using the multiverse to deliver a wide variety of locations such as Asgard, Krakoa, K’un-Lun, and the Tokyo of 2099. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The base formula of moreish 6v6 matches and excellent art direction have been supplemented by a tsunami of fresh content over the game’s first year, including a dozen new playable heroes and numerous new maps and modes. It’s difficult to evaluate games like Rivals since they’re constantly evolving and adding new stuff, but as it stands, it’s exactly the sort of game that’s easy to get lost in while playing with friends or climbing ranks in Competitive. For your daily dose of Marvel gaming, it doesn’t get much better than this.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Spider-Man 2 (2004)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/spider-man-2-1764165012272.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to movie tie-in games, few have been as well-received as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-2-2004">Spider-Man 2</a>. Released alongside the Sam Raimi film of the same name, it eschewed traditional self-contained levels for an open world approach – something deeply ambitious back in 2004 – and allowed you to freely swing around New York City to your heart’s content. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not technically the first superhero game to use the open world format (would you believe that honor goes to the 1997 Batman &amp; Robin game?) Spider-Man 2 did popularize the idea with the gaming masses. The web swinging mechanics were revolutionary for their time, as you needed to actually attach your webs to environmental geometry instead of just firing them up for them to latch on to the skybox like in previous games. Developer Treyarch also expanded the movie’s story with characters from the comics, including fan-favorites like Black Cat, Mysterio, and Rhino on top of the requisite encounters with Doc Ock. It all adds up to an entry that changed how superhero games would be made for years to come. Plus, what other game lets you deliver pizza as a side activity?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/marvel-ultimate-alliance-1764165026343.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for a game that truly transports you into the Marvel Universe, then one of the best examples has to be Raven Software’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-ultimate-alliance">Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</a>. Built off a foundation developed for the studio’s earlier X-Men Legends games, Ultimate Alliance is a cooperative action RPG where you guide a team of four Marvel heroes in their fight through an epic adventure that’s essentially a company-wide crossover event come to life. Doctor Doom has assembled the Masters of Evil, and the Avengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men, and other unaffiliated heroes like Spider-Man have to team up to take them down. Such a strong roster means you’re free to recruit your own super team made up from your favorite heroes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason Ultimate Alliance is still so beloved by Marvel fans is because it makes full use of the Marvel mythology, featuring characters and locations from virtually every corner of the Marvel Universe instead of just one. And unlike Lego Marvel Super Heroes, which has the abstraction of everything being made of Lego bricks, Ultimate Alliance feels like the world and characters of Marvel comics have been ripped right off the page and transplanted onto your TV screen without any compromises. It might not be the newest or prettiest game on this list, but the vibe and experience hasn’t been replicated by anything before or since, even its own sequels.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Marvel’s Midnight Suns</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/midnight-suns-1764165041030.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You might not expect Firaxis, the developer behind Civilization and XCOM, to create one of the best Marvel games, but that’s exactly what we got with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/midnight-suns">Midnight Suns</a>. A tactical RPG with turn-based combat, deck-building, and life-sim mechanics, Midnight Suns is a bizarre mix of elements that somehow coheres into something rather special. You take on the role of The Hunter, an original character who fights alongside established Marvel heroes like Blade, Ghost Rider, Iron Man, and numerous others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hunter and their allies fight in battles that emphasize strategy and team synergy, and then hang out between missions to develop interpersonal relationships. Featuring a lengthy single-player campaign, an engrossing narrative with strong character writing, and plenty of ways to customize the build of your Hunter and their allies, Midnight Suns is an underappreciated gem that’s sure to charm if you’re willing to go along with its quirks. But next time, Marvel, don’t call them “friendship” levels. Let us date our favorite Marvel heroes. You can’t tease me with a Scarlet Witch romance and not deliver.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/guardians-of-the-galaxy-1764165057266.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After the disappointment of Marvel’s Avengers, who knew that Square Enix would publish one of Marvel’s best ever games shortly afterwards? That would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/guardians-of-the-galaxy">Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</a> from developer Eidos-Montreal, a single-player action-adventure game starring the space-faring super team. Taking on the role of Star-Lord, you can give orders to Gamora, Rocket, Groot and Drax during combat, comboing teammate abilities for maximum effect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the combat isn’t the star of the show here; it’s the story, which is a beautiful, character-driven tale that gets surprisingly emotional on multiple occasions. With fantastic performances from the main cast, a sharp script that merges elements of the Guardians’ comic personas with the MCU’s revisionist takes on the characters, and an incredible musical score from Richard Jacques, this game is arguably a more satisfying blockbuster experience than any of the Guardians movies. If you haven’t played it, you’re missing out on one of the best superhero stories released in any medium in years.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Marvel’s Spider-Man</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/spider-man-1764165074017.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of great superhero stories, Insomniac Games of Ratchet &amp; Clank and Resistance fame delivered one of the very best in its first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/spider-man">Spider-Man</a> game. Creating an original version of Spidey’s mythology, Insomniac used a fresh version of a familiar world as part of a larger effort to refine the many gameplay advancements that had been made in Spider-Man games since Treyarch’s ground-breaking web-swinging, and balanced all that with top shelf production values to deliver the most satisfying Spider-Man game ever released. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some may argue in favor of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, but the sequel’s novel focus on switching between playing as Peter Parker and Miles Morales, as well as minor gameplay improvements, are offset by a much weaker script that doesn’t emotionally resonate in the same way the first one did. And so Marvel’s Spider-Man is the best overall Spider-Man game, featuring a lively world brimming with side activities, smart reworks of many of Peter’s supporting cast, and plenty of action from start to finish. We’ll see if Insomniac will finally top its best effort with the upcoming Wolverine game and the inevitable Spider-Man 3, but for now, this is the best it gets if you want to play as everyone’s favorite Web-Slinger. And as Marvel’s flagship character, it just feels right that his best game is also the greatest Marvel game ever made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there we have it, the 10 best video games to have come out of the House of Ideas.
