<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/motordoom">Motördoom</a> boasts one of those genre mash-ups that it can be difficult to understand, on paper, what's going on. It's a "freestyle-sports roguelite horde shooter that combines high octane, visceral combat with fluid movement and trick mechanics," its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/motordoom-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqTU8fWvPp7Dq5U_BZMlbV3GIMzEFtFiA_kA3ELJP5YUD__DqMb">eShop listing</a> reads, which feels like a lot of words for what can basically be boiled down to, <em>kill demons while pulling off sick BMX skills</em>.</p>
<p>This one arrives on the Switch eShop on <strong>7th November</strong> for <strong>$16.99</strong> (the EU page is not live at the time of writing), and it looks really rather gnarly. The above trailer tells you everything you need to know. It's a roguelike where you have to kill as many of the horde demons as possible while pulling off combos on your chainsaw-driven pit bike. Has anything made you want to shout "<em>dude!!</em>" more?</p>
<p>Developer Hobo Cat Games has added a dash of deckbuilder gameplay (because <em>of course</em>) in the shape of cards that boost your abilities, and there are unlockable characters and bikes to give you something to work towards between runs. And putting the 'k' in rogueli<em>k</em>e, an overall meta-progression system will have you gaining bike add-ons for better builds as you go.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the key features and a handful of screenshots from the eShop listing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>◆Career Mode (Inspired by classic extreme sports games)<br>
◆Single Run Mode (Highscore Mode)<br>
◆Endless Run Mode (Highscore Mode without Time or Level limit)<br>
◆Free Ride Mode<br>
◆Difficulty settings for all skill levels<br>
◆5 Arenas<br>
◆7 Characters<br>
◆5 Bosses<br>
◆35 different Demonic Offering Cards<br>
◆Unlockable Bike Add-Ons<br>
◆Unlockable Bike and Rider Skins</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The old school polygonal art style might not be to everyone's tastes, but after launching on Steam last year, you just know that such a gnarly mash-up will be up someone's street.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Borderlands 4</i> arrived last month on September 12–and some people are <i>still</i> waiting for shader compilation! That’s a preview of what you can expect in this edition of “As Told By Steam Reviews,” because, ya’ll, either this game really, truly runs that poorly or the mimetic nature of the internet is working overdrive here.</p>

 <p>You’ll quickly spot a trend when it comes to perusing <i>BL4</i>’s user reviews on Steam: Folks are generally struggling to enjoy this game&nbsp; not because of the story or the gunplay– the reviews mostly speak favorably of those elements. No, that pale orange “Mixed” review status on the game’s Steam page is the result of countless reviews trashing how this game runs, with particular ire directed toward Unreal Engine 5, and for Gearbox’s talkative CEO who also <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-patch-console-crash-pitchford-2000626826">spent some time doubling as tech support</a> after this game’s bumpy release.</p>

 <p>It’s hard to find a negative review that doesn’t just meditate on the misery of eternal shader compilation and signature UE5 stuttering. But those who ain’t too hot on what <i>BL4</i> is selling seem to find the open world a little shallow. On top of that, there are some who seem to just prefer <i>BL2</i>’s writing over the narrative and dialogue here.</p> <p>Positive reviews, however, reflect that <i>Borderlands</i>’ gun-handling has come a long way since the awkwardness it exhibited of the earlier entries. It feels like a more refined shooter experience than ever, and, to some at least, it seems the writing is much better.</p> <p>So let’s get onto <i>Borderlands 4</i>, as told by Steam reviews!</p> <h2>‘Who are you and what have you done to the borderlands writing team?!’</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634026" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634026"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634026">© Screenshot: Valve / SkeleBen / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‘You straight up can’t play this game if you’re broke.’</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634029" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634029"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634029">© Screenshot: Valve / OnionMuncher / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000634030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634030"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634030">© Screenshot: Valve / Mister Macaroni / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‘The structure of the balance, postgame and gear has actual thought behind it for once.’</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634031" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634031"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634031">© Screenshot: Valve / LazyData / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000634032" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634032"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634032">© Screenshot: Valve / Tchii / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‘Borderlands 4 feels like that first sip of an energy drink at 2 AM when you know you’re gaming all night.’</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634034"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634034">© Screenshot: Valve / Shinigami/ Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‘Most importantly the writing has taken a step in the right direction.’</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634036"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634036">© Screenshot: Valve / Xzanos / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‘Randy needs to get off twitter.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/magic-the-gathering-tmnt-set-leaps-out-of-the-sewers-in-march.1322056/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has revealed the latest in its&nbsp;<em>Universes Beyond&nbsp;</em>series of&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>crossovers, and I hope you're ready to get tubular, because the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are on their way to a tabletop near you.</p>

<p>Launching on March 6th, the new&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;</em>set will feature new sets of boosters, as well as a brand new Commander deck featuring none other than the Turtles' leader himself, Leonardo.</p>

<p>Per a press release, while Leonardo will serve as the Commander deck's face commander, you'll also be able to take advantage of a new mechanic that allows you to combine the strength of two Commanders with the Partner ability.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles.jpg?itok=gK42susb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles.jpg?itok=YzfXN5-D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to slam that Turtle Power down on the table.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned press release, Wizards promises that the new&nbsp;<em>Turtles&nbsp;</em>set for&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>will be perfect for any&nbsp;<em>TMNT&nbsp;</em>fan, whether you're a diehard fan of the original Kevin Eastman artwork or a newer convert thanks to the likes of&nbsp;<em>Mutant Mayhem</em>.</p>

<p>Eastman himself has returned to illustrate the new set's four headliner cards, which all feature "original borderless artwork" by the&nbsp;<em>TMNT&nbsp;</em>creator, as well as a "shiny stamp" of his signature.</p>

<p>Additionally, existing&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>cards will be tricked out with&nbsp;<em>TMNT</em>-themed artwork in the new set's Collector Boosters. Wizards has revealed a new&nbsp;<em>Turtles</em>-themed version of Doubling Season, but there are 20 source material cards with new artwork in total.</p>

<p>Not only that, but lands in the new set will be decked out with new full-art pizza variants as part of new Pizza Bundles, although Wizards promises that "the toppings are sure to be contentious". I think that's probably an understatement, given what we've seen so far.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-tmnt-set-special-cards.jpg?itok=M3wVGIr8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-tmnt-set-special-cards.jpg?itok=u3ZPcBv0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are some pretty special-looking new cards in the&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;</em>set.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;</em>is just the latest property to get the&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>crossover treatment. It joins the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-magic-gathering-crossover-brings-classic-art-and-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy</a>&nbsp;</em>(which <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-final-fantasy-made-200m-in-one-day" rel="nofollow">proved a hugely successful crossover</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-magic-gathering-sonic-hedgehog-secret-lair-is-gonna-go-fast" rel="nofollow"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em></a>, and Marvel's very own Merc with a Mouth <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deadpool-secret-lair-brings-merc-with-mouth-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow">Deadpool</a>, among many others.</p>

<p>The news also comes just a few months after the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>movie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-screenwriters-have-been-summoned" rel="nofollow">screenwriters were announced</a>&nbsp;in the form of&nbsp;<em>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol&nbsp;</em>writer Noah Gardner and&nbsp;<em>Calls&nbsp;</em>scribe Aidan Fitzgerald.</p>

<p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;</em>set launches on March 6th, with pre-release events happening between February 27th and March 5th. A full decklist for the Turtle Power! Commander deck will be revealed "closer to the set's release", according to Wizards.</p>

            <p>Drive faster, she screams as a cacophony of meepy noises, it's coming! I know, headstand lady, I know, comes my response from behind the wheel. We'd be safe if I hadn't botched one of the switchbacks and gently skidded into a low wall. I'd best put my foot down if I want to escape the demo of mysterious delivery driver Truckful without finding out what happens when a little truck is swallowed by a bigger truck.</p>

<p>This is the sort of mystery promised by Truckful's trundling down otherwise picturesque forest lanes and tracks. Another mystery is how you, the player, ended up permanently stuck in the cab of a plucky little pickup. The game tries to play that one one off as a joke. To be fair, the pretty brief and linear demo is keen to get on with the quick slice of a day and night's trucking it offers to delve too deep into any mysteries just yet.</p>
<p>Assuming the rest of the game follows suit, your time when the sun's up in Truckful is spent making deliveries to various locations. I had to pick up a lady called Rotti whose van had broken down. I pulled up behind it and loaded both her and her cargo into my pickup's bed. There's some nice physics stacking to packing seven objects into just four slots, and amid the precarious balancing I discover that I can flip items upside down. I have to pack Rotti in the back too, so decide to plonk her on her bonce. She doesn't seem to mind. </p><p>Truckful's side-on camera and narrow, windy roads aren't too challenging when your only obstacle's the occasional herd of sheep blocking the road, but they are tricky enough to punish carelessness. My racing instincts kicked in at one point while descending a hill, and the resulting bunch of flowers sent flying from the truck bed instantly failed the mission and sent me back to the previous roadside checkpoint.</p>
<p>Delivering the goods to an old lady's garage was repaid by her restoring the truck's lights and horn, allowing myself and Rotti to venture out into the night. Rotti now elected to sit the right way up and in the passenger seat, which I found slightly disappointing. Just as the darkness was making the game's chill woodland vibes really sing, a great noise erupted behind us. A haunting horn, somewhere between an air raid siren that needs to blow its nose and a cargo ship's mournful cry. The ghost truck. Despite the need to haul ass making the flowing turns even tougher to thread through, I was on track to easily outrun the beast until the mistake. The fact I survived and was able to re-open a gap pretty rapidly on the way out of the woods maybe suggests the revenant rig will need to up its game to be a threat.</p>
<p>This was only a short taste of Truckful though, so there's every chance it does. I've come out of it still in two minds as to whether the game'll have much to offer in terms of in-depth mysterious substance beyond the initial spectral semi intrigue, but what I've played certainly wasn't lacking in charm or chill driving atmos.</p>
<p>Truckful's set to release in 2026, and you can find this new demo on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3090810/Truckful/">Steam page</a>.</p>

              <p>AI’s all-encompassing usefulness is now well beyond debate. A stellar AI tool is great. An AI tool on sale for 82% off is even better. An AI tool on sale for 82% off that you can also stack with a special checkout code that drops another $10 from the price and gives you a lifetime subscription for just $30? That’s downright unbeatable, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4692/">that’s what’s waiting for you right how at StackSocial — a lifetime license to 1min.AI is all yours for $30.</a></p>
<p>1min.AI also spares you from doing the deep dive to find out which of the ever-growing number of AI models is the best one to use, because 1min.AI is not an AI model — it’s a smorgasbord of several AI models all in one interface. So if you’re already signed up for several model subscriptions, now’s your chance to streamline them, reduce your bills, and not miss out on any of the latest AI advances.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4692/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Newbies Welcome</h2>
<p>Even if you’re just now dipping your toe into the AI pond (which is more like an ocean by now), and the idea of suddenly having several different models at your fingertips is intimidating, there’s no need for concern. 1min.AI is amazingly accessible even for newbies. The intuitive user interface is easy to learn once you start feeding it text and/or images and asking it to generate your desired output.</p>
<p>If you’re working with visuals, you can even backtrack if you don’t like what 1min.AI has done with your creative suggestions. It has a Generative Remove tool to take out unwanted elements, giving you ultimate control over your own creative vision. And that vision can take its form virtually any way you like when you deploy the AI models of 1min.AI: image generation, keyword research, content creation — it’s basically limitless.</p>



<h2>One Payment, All the Power</h2>
<p>The one-time purchase of a lifetime subscription to 1min.AI gives you access to AI models including GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama 3, MistralAI, Command, and more. In time you’ll find which one suits your needs best, and the odds are different needs will be handled best by different models.</p>
<p>The lifetime subscription to 1min.AI’s Pro plan is all-inclusive, with all future updates covered — no recurring costs or monthly fees buried in the small print. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4692/">It normally sells for $234, but StackSocial’s 82% off deal brings the price down to $40, and when you add the code <strong>SAVE10</strong> at checkout, the price gets knocked down to just $30</a>. It doesn’t require any artificial intelligence to see what a great deal this is.</p>

              <p>How will Radiance Cores make make web-slinging even better in <em>Spider-Man 3</em>? How much of<em> Battlefield 7</em> will be AI-generated once Saudi Arabia takes over? And why is licensed DLC fueling a <em>Sonic</em> kart-racing renaissance? Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. The Eagles spiked another one last night. Now begins the annual Philly football crashout before things start to recover after Thanksgiving.</p>   <p>The architect behind Sony’s upcoming gaming hardware sat down with AMD’s senior VP of computing, Jack Huynh, to discuss how the two companies’ joint partnership in advancing GPU tech will make Joel’s beard in <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> look even more awe-inducing on next-gen hardware. They talked about Neural Arrays, Radiance Cores, and Universal Compression. No, these aren’t <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1976272374543630842?s=19"><em>Destiny 2</em> patch notes</a>, they’re a roadmap to what will seemingly make gaming on PS6 marginally better than current-gen tech.</p>

 <p>In layman’s terms, it’s all supposed to mean more efficiency that lets developers draw better performance and visual fidelity out of the existing GPU. It will seemingly scale with AI tech to give you more bang for your buck across the spectrum, whether you’re playing on a high-end living room console or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">rumored PlayStation handheld</a> that’s coming. Cerny didn’t call out the PS6 by name but did suggest it will be here in the next “few years.”</p>

 <p>“Overall, it’s of course still very early days for these technologies, they only exist in simulation right now,” he said. “But the results are quite promising and I’m really excited about bringing them to a future console in a few years’ time.” Microsoft is also working with AMD on its next-gen hardware, which it <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-console-leak-rumor-costco-sams-club-2000632026">promises it hasn’t canceled</a>.</p>

 <h2>Players are having too much fun with the new <em>Minecraft</em> pack in <em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em></h2>   <p>The <em>Minecraft</em> pack arrived in-game this week and costs $6 for the addition of Steve, Alex, Creeper, the<em> Minecraft</em> vehicle and World course, and other cosmetics. Sonic fans are already calling it “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1o1s4wa/the_minecraft_track_is_peak/">peak</a>.” Sonic can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1o1s1eo/lol_most_sonic_characters_barely_stick_out_the/">barely see out over the top</a> of the <em>Minecraft</em> cart vehicle. In no other game can you have a Creeper race Shadow while riding in a Hatsune Miku box.</p>

 <h2>EA exec calls generative AI “very seducing”</h2> <p>Speaking of everyone’s favorite $1 trillion Ponzi scheme, EA’s general manager of DICE and Criterion Games, Rebecka Coutaz, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno">told the <em>BBC</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-exec-insists-players-wont-see-anything-made-by-very-seducing-generative-ai-in-battlefield-6"><em>IGN</em></a>) that there is no generative AI in the finished version of <em>Battlefield 6</em>, though the technology is used early in the development process “to allow more time and more space to be creative.” CEO Andrew Wilson previously told investors that AI was going to be at the heart of everything the company does moving forward, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">some developers within the company</a> have told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> there’s new pressure from above to experiment with AI tools wherever possible.</p>

 <p><em>The Financial Times</em> reported that EA’s new Saudi and private equity owners are banking on an AI transformation to help it pay off $20 billion in debt. &nbsp;“If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative,” Coutaz told the<em> BBC</em>.</p> <h2><em>Fortnite</em>‘s new Ghostface mythic weapon is wrecking people</h2>   <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blueskynoise.com/post/3m2rxomnvss2u">The Last Call Knife</a> changes your costume to the <em>Scream</em> icon and offers voice lines and a speed bonus.

<p>Battlefield 6 has launched, and its all-time player peak on Steam keeps rising by the second, with the number sitting at over 700k at the time of writing, surpassing Call of Duty’s record. </p>



<p>The anticipation for Battlefield 6’s launch has been at an all-time high since the open-beta weekends, where players flocked in huge numbers. However, the beta has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-betas-smaller-maps-were-intentional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smaller maps</a> and fewer features to try out. The full version of BF6 has been released right now, and players are pouring in by the thousands. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-all-time-steam-peak-surpasses-700k-within-the-first-hour">Battlefield 6 All-Time Steam Peak Surpasses 700k Within the First Hour</h2>



<p>As spotted on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, Battlefield 6’s all-time Steam peak concurrent number sits at 704,005 at the time of writing, and the number keeps going higher every time you refresh the page. That’s not all, Battlefield 6’s launch numbers on Steam have also beaten Call of Duty’s all-time peak, which stands at 491,670. </p>



<p>The game has additionally beaten its all-time peak from the open beta weekends, which sat at 521,000. Moreover, it is just Friday; a whole weekend remains, so the number could go even higher as the days go on. </p>



<p>For those who haven’t checked out the title, Battlefield 6 brings back iconic all-out warfare, where players can wage war with infantry and vehicle combat, including fighter jets, tanks, and more. The game features tactical destruction, where players destroy their surroundings to gain a tactical advantage over their opponents. The title also introduces the new Kinesthetic Combat System, a global-scale campaign, several multiplayer modes, the massive sandbox mode, Portal, and an upcoming battle royale mode. </p>



<p>In other news, the developers of Battlefield 6 have confirmed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wont-use-anything-made-by-generative-ai-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not use generative AI</a>. Also, players are already making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-community-is-already-making-star-wars-ships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars ships</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty maps</a> in the game’s Portal mode.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/backyard-sports-leads-discuss-completing-the-retro-collection-the-animated-special-wrapping-production-and-more.1322035/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">During its panel at New York Comic Con, Playground Productions not only looked back on the return and relaunch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/backyard-sports-revival-officially-announced-by-playground-productions">the beloved Backyard Sports video games,</a> but it also announced it will be completing its Backyard Sports retro collection with Backyard Basketball '01 and Backyard Hockey '02 in mid-November, that there are high scores and events coming to Backyard Baseball '97, and it shared a few new details for the series' upcoming animated special. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To learn more, IGN had the chance to speak to Playground Productions CEO Linday Barnett and Chief Product Officer Chris Waters about the past and future of this fan-favorite franchise, and we began by chatting about what makes these games so special.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We think it works because the games have always been character-first, comedy-forward, and accessible," Waters said. "These games weren't, 'Hey, let's make the most incredibly realistic simulation,' they were, 'let's recreate the experience of what it felt like to go out and pick up a bat and a ball, grab whatever friends you had around whether they're athletic or not, and go out and play baseball and see what madness ensues.' That madness transcends time and transcends technology." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Backyard Sports' Retro Library Will Be Complete in Mid-November, New Features Headed to Backyard Baseball '97</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you are new to the franchise or returning to it, you'll be happy to know that the Backyard Sports retro library will be complete when Backyard Basketball '01 and Backyard Hockey '02 are released on Steam in mid-November. Oh, and did we mention both will be free to download and keep?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These games, alongside Baseball '97, Baseball '01, Football '99, Soccer '98, will also be part of the Backyard Sports Retro Bundle, which will be available for $26 - a 40% savings from buying all the games individually. Players will even be able to 'Complete the Set' and only pay for the games you don't have yet at the cheaper price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, the Backyard Soccer '98 and Backyard Basketball '01 mobile versions will be free on iOS and Android when that Steam retro bundle goes live later next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of mobile, Backyard Baseball '97 is getting a new gamification feature in collaboration with Lucra. Fans can now compete against each other in week-long and month-long events like Home Run Competitions or Most Strikeouts. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/123-1760093189150.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Global high scores will be tracked in real-time, and the new feature will be free for fans and even includes a chance to win tickets to the 2025 World Series, a Pablo Sanchez trading card, and more. This feature will begin on iOS to start, and players will need to opt-iin and provide some personal information. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What we want to do is allow that community to grow and for players to be able to engage with each other," Waters said of the new gamification features. "And again, without the source code, we can't make these games, but by adding a tournament layer onto them, we're sort of creating a backdoor co-op mode."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fun fact, Playground Productions did not get the source code for most of these games when they acquired the rights, so the team had to hack the old CD-ROMs and rebuilt the games themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We thought those games were just dead," Barrnett told us. "And it was an incredible feat that Mega Kat Studios was able to do, which is reverse engineer and hack the CD-ROMs to make them playable. The thing that we didn't know in all of this, however, was that we'd be able to make the games even better and we were able to remove certain bugs that existed in the original games and add leaderboards and add competitions and just make them playable on systems that didn't even exist back then, like Nintendo Switch."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Future of Backyard Sports Includes an Animated Special That Just Finished Production</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We then shifted our talk to the future. While the team wasn't ready to reveal anything about future games, they did confirm that Backyard Sports officially wrapped production on their new animated special that builds upon the brand's beloved IP and characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This special is being produced by Lighthouse Studios, which is known for its work on Bob's Burgers and Rick &amp; Morty, and it will feature an "all-star cast" that will be announced in early November. As for when you can see it, the special will be released at Dave &amp; Buster's in early 2026 and direct to consumer shortly after. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What makes Backyard Sports special is the characters," Waters said. "For us, the opportunity to take your favorite characters and bring them to life in a new way was a no-brainer as we've already said this is a multi-platform franchise we want to go beyond games. We all loved how beautiful the animation was in the games and how much love and care they put in, and it made you love and understand the characters and made you want to pick a certain character. So, we are really, really humbled to be able to extend that into more animation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This special was our way of establishing a tone, establishing a look, and really putting our flag down to say, Backyard is a multi-platform franchise. You're going to be able to experience it in lots of different ways. I can't wait until we can say more, but I can promise you that I've got a 20-year history in animation and we have pulled out all the stops to make something that captures the tone and magic and comedy of this world."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/20240818-055213000-ios-1724085212284-1760093211100.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">First look at the Backyard Sports revival from 2024, featuring Pablo Sanchez and Stephanie Morgan</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With Backyard Sports, the team wants these games and multimedia projects to showcase just how fun sports can be and for this new generation to enjoy all of this alongside those that grew up with them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Streamers have picked these games up and people aren't watching them because they're amazing video game players," Waters said. "They're watching them because they're bringing these kids to life through their own lens. It reminds you of what it was like to play baseball the first time you picked up a glove and a bat and a ball and you were just playing for fun. I think that's been the big thing for why this really is a timeless and classic franchise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It is celebrating all of the different characters in your backyard and all their strengths and maybe even some of the weaknesses," Barnett added. "You laugh and you get through everything together. You play together and you might win, you might lose, but you always had fun doing it. And unfortunately, a lot of sports, not just sports video games, but also just sports in general aren't really like that anymore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

"These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce's years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Examples of issues faced due to management failures include "radical changes" to working practices with little explanation, "confusion and distress for all staff" as redundancies began — including various errors in the dismissal process, and four months of mandatory overtime ahead of MindsEye's launch for which staff say they still have not been fully compensated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These and many other issues," the letter continues, "have caused pain and stress for your employees. Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MindsEye Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an email to IGN, the IWGB provided further quotes from former staff members backing up the letter's claims. One ex-MindsEye developer said that Build A Rocket Boy's "public statements of care have not matched the reality of working conditions" at the company. Another detailed seeing "mental and even physical illnesses, beyond the usual burnout" among fellow staff due to the months of overtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Studio leadership have chosen not to take responsibility for the game's failure and instead blamed saboteurs, as if individual employees or online influencers could have caused this," one former employee stated, referencing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments">the bizarre comments made by Gerhard ahead of release</a> that blamed unnamed hostile forces for the game's poor reception — a position that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye">MindsEye publisher IO Interactive later distanced itself from</a>.

Build a Rocket Boy has since said it wants to continue working on the game and give it something of a relaunch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-delays-hitman-crossover-update-says-updates-may-be-less-frequent-going-forward">though more recently cautioned that this would take longer than planned</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's letter concludes with demands for a public apology and proper compensation, for remaining staff still at risk of redundancy to take payment in leave of notice, a commitment to use an external partner in future layoffs to prevent unfair treatment, and for a "concerted, meaningful and documented effort to improve conditions and processes within the company."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The treatment that workers at Build A Rocket Boy have been facing in the past 12 months has been shocking," IWGB Game Workers chairperson Spring McparlinJones said in a statement passed to IGN. "They have been routinely belittled, cheated, and manipulated by the company they dedicated years of their lives to. Despite this, they were able to keep trust in each other and work together to fight for fair treatment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: IWGB </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p dir="ltr">At the end of 2022, an unknown number of online leagues in Madden 23 were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-23s-disastrous-franchise-problems-continue-with-saves-permanently-lost/1100-6510276/">deleted overnight</a> due to what EA called a "data-storage issue that resulted in Franchise files being corrupted." Some players who were affected eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-restores-a-limited-number-of-madden-cloud-franchises-others-lost-for-good/1100-6510742/">got their leagues back</a>, while others never did. The total number of affected players or leagues was never revealed, but it wasn't an especially rare event, as the game's subreddit, EA Forums, and various Discord servers were flooded with players decrying their leagues' disappearances. Now, in Madden 26, something similar seems to be happening.</p><p dir="ltr">It hasn't occurred in one fell swoop, and a different--possibly more hopeful--error message is greeting affected players, but it's unclear why it's happening or if affected leagues can be salvaged.</p><p dir="ltr">The error message some players are getting reads, "Error: The requested league is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later. We apologize for any inconvenience. You have been returned to the Franchise launcher."</p><p dir="ltr">Normally, this is the message players may see if they try to access their league while a patch is being rolled out. But in this case, some players have been stuck staring at this message for weeks. One player in my league said his other league has been inaccessible for a month and a half. Yesterday, our 32-player league was hit with the same bug. We're now tentatively structuring our Plan B in case we need it.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no shortage of forum threads in which players are worried about their leagues having become permanently unavailable, like <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/re-franchise-mode-league-unavailable-error/12680427" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/franchise-mode-league-unavailable-error/12702061" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, and <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/online-franchise-is-temporarily-unavailable/12646488" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. In fact, <a href="https://forums.ea.com/category/madden-nfl-26-en/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en" rel="nofollow">browsing by Franchise-related posts turns up many similar threads</a>. Naturally, the same is happening on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1o29f5l/madden_franchise_error/" rel="nofollow">Reddit</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4583234-qo-8cxdw.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4583234" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4583234-qo-8cxdw.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4583234"></a><figcaption>Madden leagues are locking players out without apparent rhyme or reason.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4583234-qo-8cxdw.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's hard to say if the issue is happening more recently, but it's definitely affecting different leagues at different times, rather than hitting a number of leagues all at once like in 2022. Some players have reported that their leagues came back to life after a few days, while others have given up after weeks of waiting. On the EA Forums, a <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/online-league-error/12635493/replies/12725728" rel="nofollow">community manager provided an update yesterday</a>, saying, "Apologies for the late reply on this one. We have notified the team that this has been happening with the leagues, and they are currently investigating this. Once we have more info on these or need any further information, we will update this thread."</p><p dir="ltr">This latest Franchise lockout doesn't seem to be occurring for the same reasons as when it happened in late 2022, but for affected players, the result is the same: A great deal of investment, sometimes hundreds of hours, is getting wiped out in the blink of an eye.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has contacted EA for comment on this issue and will update this story if the publisher responds.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has just launched and already players are facing huge queues as servers reach maximum capacity.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, lead producer <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1974844687484641683">David Sirland stated on social media</a> the team was planning for launch day queues, adding the "open beta helped gauge the interest as well".</p>
<p>Indeed, the beta - which ran in August - had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-almost-250000-people-waiting-in-an-open-beta-queue">almost 250,000 players waiting in queues ahead of its launch</a>. It would seem, so far, launch day queues for the full game are just as busy.</p>

In reality, it’s primarily a speaker that can connect to sources over Bluetooth, a USB cable, or an analog audio cable, <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Speakers-in-the-design-of-a-gaming-PC-Edifier-New-Cyber-displays-CPU-load-via-2-8-inch-display.1134125.0.html">as spotted by <em>Notebookcheck</em></a>. The <a href="https://www.edifier.com/cn/product/product-866.html">Huazai New Cyber speaker</a> is currently available in China 1,499 yuan, or around $210 in aurora white and phantom black color options. It’s unclear if the company plans a wider global release.</p><p>The Cyber speaker pairs a 4-inch subwoofer on the with three passive radiators to further boost lower frequencies and two 52mm mid-high range drivers. Those are all hidden on the lower half of the speaker behind a fabric screen, while the upper portion features electronics like amplifiers, a power supply, braided speaker cables, and a signal processor that are arranged and mounted to look like components you’ll find inside a gaming PC such as a graphics card and memory slots.</p><p>There are five circular RGB lighting elements with animated effects that make them appear to spin, mimicking the appearance of cooling fans, while a 2.8-inch screen can be used as a decorative element displaying images, screensavers, or custom messages. But it has some practical uses, too, such as showing performance metrics like CPU, RAM, and GPU usage while the speaker is connected to an actual computer with a USB cable, or song lyrics while streaming music from a smartphone.</p><p>The Cyber speaker’s footprint is comparable to bookshelf speakers which are often used as part of desktop PC setups. But to expand its usefulness while it’s gobbling up a sizable chunk of your desktop real estate, Edifier includes an additional USB-A and USB-C port you can use to charge other devices.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/798148/edifier-huazai-new-cyber-speaker-bluetooth-gaming-pc]]></content:encoded>

              <p><span>Last week, a Portland protestor named Seth Todd showed up at the ICE protests in the Oregon city dressed up in an inflatable frog costume. Footage of armed soldiers backing up as the protester confidently walked toward them went viral on social media, along with a video of an agent spraying pepper spray into the costume’s air filter. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/trump-autism-tylenol-press-conference-reaction-jokes-2000627950"><span>President Donald Trump</span></a><span> has been trying to </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/us/portland-oregon-trump-history"><span>paint a grim picture of the protests</span></a><span>, saying the city has become “war-ravaged,” but seeing a protestor dressed in a frog costume tells another story. Now, the frog costume has inspired dozens of other Portland citizens to dress up as animals as they continue to fight against ICE and America’s continued descent into fascism.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><i><span>The Oregonian</span></i><span>, a local outlet in Portland, interviewed several protesters last night, October 9, who came to the ICE facility dressed up as frogs in an act of solidarity.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 has officially launched worldwide. Even though it has a shiny new campaign, everyone wants to play online multiplayer. Unfortunately, the EA servers are biting back, so let’s check why you can’t play Battlefield 6 right now, and what’s happening with the server queues.</p>



<p>It was claimed by a Battlefield 6 dev that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">servers ‘Should be’ ready for launch day</a>. This was not the case as players were left queuing for the brand-new game. Messages don’t always spread very quickly or widely. Meaning, many of you Battlefield 6 owners have been left in the dark over the game’s servers and long queues.</p>



<p>This quick explainer should help you if you’re one of the many having trouble with BF 6 servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-can-t-i-get-into-battlefield-6-servers-right-now-are-they-down">Why Can’t I Get Into Battlefield 6 Servers Right Now? Are They Down?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a war, in more ways than one. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 launch day queues are excessive because so many people are trying to play the game at once. The player base is so big that it’s overloading the EA servers, meaning players have to wait for other players to quit the game before being able to play.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re being met with a “Game Servers Full” screen when trying to play <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, this is because the game’s maximum occupancy has been reached. The servers physically can’t handle any more players. It’s not because they’re down, they’re just full.</p>



<p>Again, EA was confident the servers would be ready, but it hasn’t worked out like that.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-the-battlefield-6-server-queue">How Long is The Battlefield 6 Server Queue?</h2>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 launch day queue is several hundred thousand players deep at times, meaning you could potentially be waiting a long time to play Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>Consider these queues like a random ballot: Some people got in right away, and some of you could potentially have to wait 10 minutes, all the way up to an hour or more, if you’re unlucky. The server queues will likely never be this bad again, and it’s up to EA to add more servers and allow more people into the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-battlefield-6-right-now">How To Play Battlefield 6 Right Now</h2>



<p><strong>The only way to play Battlefield 6 online multiplayer right now is to wait in the queue until it’s your turn to get in.</strong></p>



<p>We absolutely understand this isn’t the answer you want—<em>believe us</em>. But it’s the simple reality of the situation. Battlefield 6 is one of the hottest game launches of 2025. The beta broke record numbers, and this launch was always going to be fierce.</p>



<p>Battlefield Studios did issue a warning ahead of launch, but it hasn’t spread as quickly as the company probably would’ve liked.</p>

                <p>Once Battlefield 6 players start digging into user-created Portal content, they'll find that someone already made a familiar map from Battlefield's biggest competitor.</p><p>As Portal tools were already available a day before the release of Battlefield 6 itself, creator DANNYonPC took it upon himself to recreate Call of Duty's Shipment map using the Portal editor. In a YouTube video, the creator specified that this version of Shipment is based on the iteration seen in the 2019 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare reboot, which added some extra routes on higher ground.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZvmYdnQ_d0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FZvmYdnQ_d0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>First appearing in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Shipment has brought its simple layout and unique brand of chaos to several titles, only rivaled by Nuketown in number of reappearances.</p><p>Shipment is a sensible first project to make in a map editor, given the map's tight quarters. Its small space almost always leads to frantic and explosive encounters where it's hard to last even a full minute before being gunned down or blown up. Arguably, Shipment is the antithesis of Battlefield's gameplay, which is more focused on large-scale encounters in a wide area.</p><p>With this creator revealing the map before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-times-seemingly-revealed-and-there-is-no-early-access/1100-6535079/" data-ref-id="1100-6535079">Battlefield 6 went live</a>, there was no actual gameplay footage in this Battlefield-ized Shipment, but people were already joking about it on social media, with user <a href="https://x.com/BrokenMachine/status/1976427319356203379" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BrokenMachine</a> on X remarking: "We got Shipment in Battlefield 6 before GTA 6."</p><p>And that isn't all that happened to the game pre-launch--according to a report, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-generated-100-million-on-steam-from-pre-sales-report/1100-6535361/" data-ref-id="1100-6535361">Battlefield 6 already made $100 million</a> in revenue from pre-sales alone.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Workers laid off from <em>MindsEye</em> developer Build A Rocket Boy <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have sent an open letter</a> and launched legal action against the company. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain’s Game Workers group, representing 93 current and former workers who signed the open letter, announced Friday that they're filing "legal action" against Build A Rocket Boy for the "mishandling of the redundancy process."</p><p>Shortly after the launch of <em>MindsEye</em> in June, Build A Rocket Boy announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had begun a redundancy process at the company</a>, a notice period required by law in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-heartbroken-amid-troubled-launch-as-players-report-success-with-refunds-and-sponsored-streams-are-canceled-last-minute" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>MindsEye</em>'s launch went poorly</a>, and the studio began work on fixing the issues with patches. The studio, founded in 2018 and based in Scotland, was founded by Leslie Benzies, the former Rockstar North president who was heavily involved in the Grand Theft Auto games. <em>MindsEye </em>is the first project from the studio, and part of a larger project called <em>Everywhere</em>, which is intended to be both a massively multiplayer online game and a game platform.</p><p>More than 250 workers were ultimately laid off, according to the IWGB. The union wrote in a press release that these layoffs <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/everywhere/build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were preceded by an "initial round of layoffs"</a> <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/build-a-rocket-boy-lands-110-million-in-funding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following $110 million in funding</a> announced in January 2024. IWGB writes in its press release that the legal actions involve “failure to carry out fair consultation ahead of redundancies as well as multiple cases of unfair dismissal.” Aftermath has reached out for more information.&nbsp;</p><p>Workers write in the open letter that Build A Rocket Boy was plagued with a "lack of transparency and communication," "unbearable levels of overtime" in which every employee was allegedly asked to work an extra eight hours per week, "disastrous handling of redundancies," and "many other issues." The workers write that Benzies and Build A Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard "repeatedly refused to listen to [their] workforce’s years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade."</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to Build A Rocket Boy for comment.</p><p>“The callousness shown by management towards staff at Build A Rocket Boy is truly awful," former Build A Rocket Boy data analyst Ben Newbon wrote in a statement sent to Aftermath via email. "Even before the disastrous launch of <em>MindsEye</em>, staff had suffered months of crunch, resulting in some horrific mental and even physical illnesses, beyond the typical widespread burnout. Studio leadership have chosen not to take responsibility for the game's failure and instead blamed <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/mindseye-boss-reportedly-blames-its-failure-on-saboteurs-and-says-a-re-launch-is-in-the-works-even-as-the-entire-development-studio-is-at-risk-of-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saboteurs</a>, as if individual employees or online influencers could have caused this. The arrogance of leadership to believe they can act with impunity throughout development and the following redundancies has pushed myself and many former and continuing employees to take a stand.”</p><p>IWGB is asking Build A Rocket Boy leadership for “a public apology for this mistreatment of employees and proper compensation for laid-off employees;”&nbsp; for remaining employees on redundancy notices to work through that period or receive payment for the period instead; "a concerted, meaningful, and documented effort to improve conditions and processes within the company, including the acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union;" and a "commitment to use official external partners to action any future redundancies and prevent unfair treatment."</p><p>"In my experience, Build A Rocket Boy has shown little regard for the wellbeing of its staff," former Build A Rocket Boy audio software engineer Isaac Hudd said in a statement. "Many fantastic, hard-working developers have felt used and discarded, while public statements of care have not matched the reality of working conditions. A pattern of poor decisions from senior management has led to a disappointing launch and ongoing challenges for both players and employees. Having supported many of my colleagues through the recent redundancy process, I have seen how damaging these practices can be. I will continue to speak out until this industry treats its people with the respect they deserve."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-review"><h3>100 Meters Is A Soulful Gem About The Poetry Of Running</h3></a><p>Studio Rock’N Roll Mountain’s rotoscope take on Uoto’s track manga unearths raw truths and soulful cadence with every thunderous footfall</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chess-dungeon-crawler-yeah"><h3>Chess Dungeon Crawler, Yeah</h3></a><p>Below the Crown combines roguelike hallmarks with chess</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange"><h3>Baby Steps’ Manbreaker Did Not Break Me</h3></a><p>Baby Steps' Manbreaker is an optional, brutal challenge that is as much a test of your humility as it is your skill.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/mindseye-igwb-game-workers-open-letter-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’m looking forward to a weekend filled with a bunch of squad-based shooter action, with the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/">Battlefield 6</a>. There’s always a bit of a disconnect between playing shooters for review, where I’m turning on streamer modes to hide user names and being a lone wolf most of the time, and then playing after release where I can join a party and voice chat.</p>
<p>But that’s not all I’ll be playing, because I’ve still got reviews of the daft walking simulator Baby Steps and the UGC dungeon crawler King of Meat to finally wrap up.</p>

<p>It’s been a big jumble of games for <strong>Gamoc</strong> this week, who’s returned to Atomfall: The Red Strain DLC, and had Dreams of Another and Rise of Industry on the go for upcoming reviews. Add some spooky fun times with Phasmophobia, wand waving in Beat Saber and some VR shooty stuff in Synapse, and he’s had a busy gaming week!</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong>, meanwhile, reviewed the decidedly average <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/06/blood-of-mehran-review/">Blood of Mehran</a>, and swiftly went back to Ghost of Yotei to mop up the last few things he needed to grab the platinum trophy! After all that modern gaming, he needed something a bit older, with Dark Void and Spec Ops: The Line – “Dark Void is very average but had some fun ideas though the aerial combat induced some motion sickness. Spec Ops The Line holds up well with the messaging relevant as ever.”</p>


<p>Always finding new beat ’em ups to batter around, <strong>Ade</strong> played the “rogue ’em up” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/absolum-review/">Absolum</a>. It’s not perfect, but “It’s a really fun game, well worth a look, even with a few too many issues holding it back from greatness.” To make up for those weaknesses, he also played more Hades 2. And when not playing Absolum with Ade, <strong>Laura</strong> has been ” Hoovering slimes, and solving ghost crimes” in Slime Rancher 2 and Banishers.</p>
<p>With Battlefield 6 on his horizon, <strong>Jim</strong> booted up Battlefield 1 and immediately got his butt kicked. So he played Ghost of Yotei, and has thoroughly enjoyed his time with it – “I dig the freefrom structure which was interestingly a complaint I had about Assassin’s Creed Shadows.”</p>

<p>It was a bunch more Digimon Story Time Stranger for <strong>Jason</strong>, who says it’s up there as his Game of the Year. “Something I didn’t mention in the review is how good the grind is once you hit just before the end game, as you can just hop around in the story grinding and doing side quests.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Steve</strong> this week, who’s been enjoying By Sweet Carole’s Gothic Disney vibes, and revisiting Yooka-Replaylee which, aside from the poor title, promises a lot of improvements over the original version. And then, of course, there’s been a ton of Steam Next Fest demos ahead of next week, and a bunch of indie horror games for this time of year!</p>
<p>Now then, what have you been playing?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Build a Rocket Boy's debut title, MindsEye, is likely to finish 2025 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=15">as the worst-rated game this year</a> and one of the year's biggest flops. Prior to release, there was plenty of hype around it due to former Grand Theft Auto producer and Build a Rocket Boy founder, Leslie Benzies, leading the charge at the studio alongside Mark Gerhard. But even before the game was out, signs began to appear online that things weren't going well at Build a Rocket Boy.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">Negative early previews, combined with a launch trailer that failed to impress</a>, and a lack of information on the game so close to its release, gave players waiting to grab MindsEye misgivings about the game, to say the least. Then, <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">two chief executives at Build a Rocket Boy left the studio</a> just two weeks before MindsEye's launch, which came shortly after <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">physical copies of the game got out into the wild early</a>, and players had begun posting clips of the severe technical issues the game had and its lacking gameplay.</p>



<p>A statement from Build a Rocket Boy claiming a day one patch would solve these issues fell on deaf ears, especially since when that day one patch came, it didn't do what Build a Rocket Boy promised, and the game was still riddled with issues. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">studio released a statement committing to fixing it</a>, saying they were "<em>heartbroken</em>" over the state of the game's launch, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">PlayStation had begun giving players who purchased the game refunds if they wanted one</a>.</p>



<p>Leslie Benzies <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-ceo-blames-saboteurs-mindseye-struggles/">pointed at internal and external saboteurs for the poor state of the game</a> (which he had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">already done when MindsEye was getting negative previews</a>), but <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">after mass layoffs were confirmed at the studio</a> and reports that the game's flop could push IO Interactive, the game's publisher and the first game published by the Hitman devs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-disastrous-launch-io-ionteractive-publishing/">to abandon its publishing arm</a>, former and current Build a Rocket Boy developers have laid the blame for the studio's struggles where it arguably should fall: with its leaders.</p>



<p>The buck has to stop somewhere, usually with the people who have the letters 'CEO' in front of their name, and according to <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/barb-open-letter/">93 former and current Build a Rocket Boy developers in an open letter</a>, that's exactly who is to blame.</p>



<p>"<em>Employees and ex-employees at Build a Rocket Boy (BARB), together with the Game Workers Branch of the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB), are writing to address the longstanding disrespect and mistreatment of your staff</em>," the letter, which is titled 'Open Letter to the Executive Leadership at Build a Rocket Boy', begins.</p>



<p>"<em>For years, you have expected them to adapt to your every whim, with those in disagreement being shut down or cast aside. We estimate a UK-majority of the 250-300 workers across the company have now lost their livelihoods. These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce's years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade.</em>"</p>



<p>The letter goes on to directly call out three key faults in leadership, including "<em>lack of transparency and communication,</em>" "<em>unbearable levels of overtime</em>," and "<em>disastrous handling of redundancies</em>," before continuing that these are just some of the more public faults.</p>



<p>"<em>Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into. BARB needs to change. CEOs need to take a backseat and allow the skilled people who remain at the company to forge the path ahead</em>."</p>



<p>The developers also name four demands they have of leadership:</p>



<ol>
<li>A public apology for this mistreatment of employees and proper compensation for laid-off employees</li>



<li>The option for remaining employees on redundancy notice to either work their notice period or take Payment in Lieu of Notice (PILON)</li>



<li>A concerted, meaningful, and documented effort to improve conditions and processes within the company, including the acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union</li>



<li>A commitment to use official external partners to action any future redundancies and prevent unfair treatment</li>
</ol>



<p>The developers close off the letter by saying, "<em>Mark Gerhard and Leslie Benzies, you often refer to your employees as 'family.' But we ask you to consider; is this really how you treat your own?</em>"</p>



<p>Way before any of this happened, when Build a Rocket Boy was in its earliest days, Leslie Benzies and the studio's leadership <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-series-former-producers-build-a-rocket-boy-completes-110-million-series-d-fundraising/">secured $110 million in funding for the studio and its debut projects</a>. With Benzies name attached to the studio, and the promise of a new Grand Theft Auto-sized game, there was a lot of excitement around what Build a Rocket Boy could become.</p>



<p>Now, it seems like the only thing it'll become is another failed studio, unless something drastically changes. </p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/797879/fractal-design-scape-pc-gaming-headset</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fractal%E2%80%99s-first-gaming-headset-is-as-refreshingly-elegant-as-its-pc-cases.1321951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Not many gaming headsets have a Scandinavian minimalist aesthetic, which is why Fractal’s $199.99 Scape caught my eye. Like many of <a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/">Fractal’s PC cases</a>, this headset looks more sophisticated than you might expect from gaming gear, with clean lines and simplistic color schemes that might blend in better with your furniture and desk setup.</p><p>I’ve spent the last few weeks using the Scape at work and while playing games, and it’s among the best that I’ve ever tested in this price range. The fit and finish are impressive for a first-gen device from a company with no lineage in audio hardware. Its sleek design comes in gray or black, with minimal LEDs that add a subtle glow around the bottom edge of the ear cups (these are the first LEDs in a headset I haven’t wanted to immediately switch off). It has a chunkier version of Apple’s Digital Crown on the back of its left ear cup. The knob controls volume and can be clicked to pause and resume content (double- or triple-clicking skips and reverses songs, respectively).</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6Nzk3ODg4"><p><span>$<!-- -->200</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great sound</li><li>Sleek charging cradle</li><li>Web-based settings customization</li><li>Has a built-in mic for when boom mic is detached</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>No ANC </li><li>Lie-flat ear cups would have been nice</li><li>Can’t do 2.4GHz and Bluetooth concurrently</li></ul></div></div></div><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>The knob is great for small volume adjustments, and to play, pause, or skip tunes.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>This headset features a button on its right ear cup that lets you toggle between three premade audio equalizer settings. It’s great to have these controls on the hardware, not just buried within a companion app. And configuring the Scape feels as elegant as using it. Everything —including customizing those EQ presets — is handled by a web tool called Adjust Pro. It also lets you tweak the mic’s sidetone, adjust the headset’s LED lighting (you can opt for one of 10 tasteful themes, including “campfire,” and “northern lights,” set it to a custom color and pattern, or turn it off), and install firmware updates when needed. You can even download a portable version of the Adjust Pro app that works without installation or an internet connection. It’s all very thoughtfully designed.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>In Adjust Pro, you can select from different lighting themes for the LEDs or turn them off.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>I like that Fractal gives you two mic options. You can use the flexible flip-to-mute boom mic for superior voice quality, or detach it to enable the Scape’s built-in microphone. Not many headsets allow for this level of flexibility, but we’re seeing it on occasion with models built to pass as over-ear headphones in public; SteelSeries’ new $600 Arctis Nova Elite wireless headset is the most recent example. The recording quality from the Scape’s boom is serviceable (the built-in mic is less good, but works in a pinch). Pressing and holding the mute button toggles microphone noise cancellation. I have an oscillating fan going in my office, and the setting mostly tuned it out. You can adjust the amount of sidetone in the web app — the higher the value, the more you’ll be able to hear your own voice (and maybe your breathing, too) through the headset, along with more background noise.</p><p>Fractal advertises over 40 hours of battery life with the RGB lights off, or around 24 hours with them on. Even with them on, the headset had no issue surviving a few full days of work, as well as a weekend full of gaming, before needing a charge. However, battery life wasn’t a concern during most of my testing because the included magnetic charging dock removes almost all of the friction usually involved in charging a headset. (You can also plug the headset in via the included USB-C cable and keep using it as it charges.) The dock also serves as a stand to keep it off your desk, and as an extender for its 2.4GHz audio transmitter.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Scape automatically shuts off once placed on the dock, turning back on upon removal.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>The dock or just its transmitter can be used with other devices; I’ve been plugging it into my Switch 2 dock after work. Or you can toggle the switch on the Scape’s left ear cup to switch on Bluetooth (it can’t pipe in audio from both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth sources simultaneously). It supports multipoint over Bluetooth, letting it connect to two devices, but it can’t play audio from both devices simultaneously.</p><p>The Scape’s connectivity isn’t nearly as versatile as some recent headsets, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776006/astro-a20x-headset-switch-ps5-xbox-price-features">$179.99 Astro A20 X</a>, which connects via 2.4GHz to a box that lets you swap between two wired sources with a button, and also has Bluetooth (it can’t mix Bluetooth and its Lightspeed wireless, though). <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/788141/steelseries-arctis-nova-elite-review">SteelSeries’ new $599.99 Nova Elite</a> sets a high bar, lettings you hear up to four wireless audio sources mixed together: three inputs plugged into its base station’s USB-C and aux ports, and one over Bluetooth, including three wireless sources, plus audio coming through its base station’s wired aux port (the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23132836/steelseries-nova-pro-wireless-review-gaming-bluetooth-anc">2021 Nova Pro Wireless</a> can do three wireless sources simultaneously). I’d love to see Fractal expand the number of devices you can listen to at once in the next version of its headset.</p><p>Fractal’s headset delivers better sound quality than I was expecting for its price. Songs and games come through with warmth and a high level of detail. It’s surprisingly competitive to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/757680/sony-inzone-pc-gaming-headset-keyboard-mouse-hands-on">Sony’s $349.99 InZone H9 II</a>, and it handily beats the Astro A20 X . The big difference is that the H9 II has active noise cancellation, while the Scape doesn’t. It’d be great to have ANC here, but I wouldn’t pay the extra $200 just to get ANC, especially since it’d mean giving up the Scape’s sleek design, clever charging dock, and easy customization.</p><p>The Scape stands out as a great-looking, great-sounding headset that’s nearly effortless to customize. While it lacks some features compared to its pricier competition (concurrent multi-source audio, ear cups that lie flat, and ANC would all be nice), Fractal’s first headset leaves little else to be desired at this price.</p><p><em>Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/797879/fractal-design-scape-pc-gaming-headset]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Following the inauspicious launch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> and subsequent layoffs at developers Build A Rocket Boy, 93 current and former staff at the studio have signed an open letter demanding an apology, while accusing Build A Rocket Boy's senior leadership of having "consistently mishandled the redundancy process" and mandating "unbearable levels of overtime" around the game's launch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/barb-open-letter/">The letter</a> calls out Build A Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard and MindsEye director Leslie Benzies by name, and was organised by the <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/">Independent Workers of Great Britain</a> union, who announced that the workers will also file legal claims against the studio. The current and former staff accuse the studio's leadership of "longstanding disrespect and mistreatment" and allege that an estimated 250 to 300 workers have been let go as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-director-reportedly-says-the-studio-will-relaunch-the-game-as-around-300-staff-are-at-risk-of-being-laid-off">layoffs at Build a Rocket Boy</a> so far. "These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce’s years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade," the letter reads.</p>
<p>It goes on to make specific accusations about a number of issues, including an alleged mishandling of layoffs. "We believe you have consistently mishandled the redundancy process, causing confusion and distress for all staff," the letter reads. "Employees have received misinformation, been handed dismissal notices with the wrong notice periods, and been put in the wrong teams so that their performances were scored by the wrong people. These and other errors have potentially resulted in the wrongful dismissal of dozens of staff members."</p> <div>

<p>Build a Rocket Boy's execs are also accused of having enforced eight hours of mandatory overtime per week for every employee in the four months running up to Mindseye's launch, with staff then allegedly struggling to take back time off in lieu they were granted due to requests for them to keep grinding away at "high-priority" work which continued once the game had launched. A lack of transparency and communication on the part of studio leadership is also cited in the latter.</p><p>"Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into," the current and former staff wrote. They call for Build a Rocket Boy to give a public apology, give staff on redundancy notice the option to either work their notice period or take a payment in lieu of notice, commit to using "official external partners" for any future redundancies. "A concerted, meaningful, and documented effort to improve conditions and processes within the company, including the acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union," rounds out that list.</p>
