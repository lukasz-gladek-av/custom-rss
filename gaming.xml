And even though all of its many currencies and systems can make for a confusing impression, it didn’t take long for players to figure out metas. And now we can share that information with you! From the three available booster packs from the launch period of the new expansion, we’ve put together a ranking of the top eleven cards.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-guide-how-to-get-cards-1851689908&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-guide-how-to-get-cards-1851689908"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> Can Be Deeply Confusing At First, So Here Are The Basics</a></span></p><p>This list will be based specifically on cards from the initial expansion. We won’t be including any limited-time promo cards, although we will give a special shout-out to the Lapras ex card. If you’re interested in what to look out for from <em>Genetic Apex</em>, these are the best cards you can pull.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-recommend-id="image://ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Alakazam card, showing the Pokémon focusing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Alakazam card, showing the Pokémon focusing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-recommend-id="image://ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Alakazam card, showing the Pokémon focusing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Under the right circumstances, Alakazam will hit like a truck. His Psychic attack does 60 base damage plus an additional 30 damage for each energy attached to your opponent’s active Pokémon. Considering that most ex Pokémon require three or four energy to use a strong attack, Alakazam can easily dish out 150 or 180 damage.</p><p>The biggest detriment is that he will require quite a bit of work. You’ll need to evolve an Abra and then evolve a Kadabra before you can get this guy on the field. It’s a great idea to set up Alakazam on your bench while using other Pokémon in the active spot. On the other hand, it’s a bad start if you have to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195">go first</a></span> and put an Abra in the active spot.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-recommend-id="image://34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gengar smiles deviously in the Gengar ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gengar smiles deviously in the Gengar ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-recommend-id="image://34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gengar smiles deviously in the Gengar ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the more unique utility Pokémon to use is Gengar ex. The 170 HP and 100 damage attack certainly help it stand out, but its best contribution will be the Shadowy Spellbind ability. It’s only active when Gengar ex is in the active spot, but it stops your opponent from using Supporter cards. This is a great way to stop an enemy from powering up their Pokémon or from messing with yours.</p><p>Just like Alakazam, an issue here is that Gengar ex is a stage two Pokémon. You will need to evolve two times to bring it out. There is also an inherent risk as an ex card, since it could cost you two points if it’s knocked out. Charizard ex or even Gyarados can spell trouble against this troublemaker ghost.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-recommend-id="image://866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Pidgeot card shows the bird grabbing hold of a Magikarp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Pidgeot card shows the bird grabbing hold of a Magikarp." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-recommend-id="image://866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Pidgeot card shows the bird grabbing hold of a Magikarp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Next is another fantastic utility Pokémon. Pidgeot can use its Drive Off ability once per turn to switch out your opponent’s active Pokémon to the bench. It’s like a Sabrina card you can use every turn! Best of all, it can do all this from the bench.</p><p>You might notice the pattern, but Pidgeot can take a while to come out since you’ll need to evolve a Pidgey and Pidgeotto. The only other concern is that its Wing Attack dealing 70 damage is kind of just okay. Thankfully, that is balanced out by a lax two-energy requirement.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-recommend-id="image://3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Misty Supporter card shows the eponymous Water trainer confidently posing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Misty Supporter card shows the eponymous Water trainer confidently posing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-recommend-id="image://3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Misty Supporter card shows the eponymous Water trainer confidently posing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>That brings us to the first Supporter card on the list, and naturally, it’s Misty. This must-have for Water-type decks relies entirely on luck. You select one Water Pokémon and then keep flipping coins until you flip tails. The Pokémon will gain one energy for each time the coin flips heads.</p><p>A match’s momentum can easily switch when this card is used. Being able to fully load up a strong Water Pokémon that didn’t have any energy before is a huge game-changer. Conversely, immediately flipping tails will make this the biggest waste of a Supporter card. The sheer impact it can have cements it a spot on this list.</p><p>It also has an unproven, but certainly real bug where every time I use it I’ll only flip one head, but my opponents will get at least three when they use it. They really need to fix that.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-recommend-id="image://0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large blue bird flies out of the borders of the Articuno ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large blue bird flies out of the borders of the Articuno ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-recommend-id="image://0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large blue bird flies out of the borders of the Articuno ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Speaking of strong Water-types, you can’t mention the best without including Articuno ex. A basic ex Pokémon has plenty of potential and this Legendary easily proves that. Its Blizzard attack deals 80 damage but also has the benefit of inflicting 10 damage to your opponent’s benched Pokémon. </p><p>Aside from the risk of your opponent gaining two points if it’s knocked out, the only other problem is that it takes three energy to use Blizzard. Articuno ex can make up for that with a 40-damage Ice Wing attack that only requires two energy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-recommend-id="image://19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The yellow electric mouse jumps out of the Pikachu ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The yellow electric mouse jumps out of the Pikachu ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-recommend-id="image://19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The yellow electric mouse jumps out of the Pikachu ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The face of the brand earns a spot here as well. Pikachu ex has access to the powerful Circle Circuit attack, which does 30 damage for every Lightning-type Pokémon on your bench. A full bench can output 90 damage as long as they’re all the correct type.</p><p>There isn’t much too much to complain about here. Circle Circuit can deal a lot of damage for just two energy. What prevents this from landing higher is that it’s entirely dependent on your bench, and 120 HP isn’t great for an ex card that can’t promise consistent damage.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-recommend-id="image://86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Professor Oak waves in the Professor’s Research card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Professor Oak waves in the Professor’s Research card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-recommend-id="image://86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Professor Oak waves in the Professor’s Research card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Professor’s Research might be on the most basic cards, but it’s invaluable no matter the deck. Playing it allows you to draw two cards to add to your hand. These 20-card decks aren’t big by any means, but there are still times when you’re not drawing what you need. This has a great chance of giving you the right card(s) or at least milling out the deck to get them sooner.</p><p>I can’t imagine putting together any deck without including this in there. Whether you play it at the beginning of a match to give yourself an advantage or use it in the climactic final turns, the card is great. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-recommend-id="image://6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charizard ex card shows the Pokémon posing with their wings outstretched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Charizard ex card shows the Pokémon posing with their wings outstretched." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-recommend-id="image://6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charizard ex card shows the Pokémon posing with their wings outstretched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Everyone’s favorite dragon-but-not-a-dragon-type creates a big presence when played on the field. Charizard ex has a tanky 180 HP and both a three-energy Slash attack and a four-energy Crimson Storm. The former deals a modest 60 damage while the latter inflicts a painful 200 that can beat anything.</p><p>This Fire-type isn’t without its setbacks. Crimson Storm’s four energy requirement is a lot to build up to and it additionally discards two Fire energy to use it. The giant pool of HP and massive damage make this a card still worth playing.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-recommend-id="image://bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sabrina poses with her arm outstretched in her Supporter card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sabrina poses with her arm outstretched in her Supporter card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-recommend-id="image://bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sabrina poses with her arm outstretched in her Supporter card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sabrina is undoubtedly the best Supporter card. Playing this will switch out your Opponent’s active Pokémon with one of their choosing from their bench. This is a great way to force them to bench a tough ex card or to bring out a weak Pokémon you know you can beat in one turn.</p><p>Some might argue that Pidgeot can be a more consistent way to use such an effect, but Sabrina requires no setup in return. Unless your opponent has a stacked bench, using this is a great way to disrupt their strategy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="38c78ff80799a62cf47dfe5d5519858b" data-recommend-id="image://38c78ff80799a62cf47dfe5d5519858b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The legendary Pokémon leans out in the Mewtwo ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The legendary Pokémon leans out in the Mewtwo ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="38c78ff80799a62cf47dfe5d5519858b" data-recommend-id="image://38c78ff80799a62cf47dfe5d5519858b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The legendary Pokémon leans out in the Mewtwo ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Mewtwo is most people’s favorite legendary from the Kanto region, and for good reason. It looks cool and has an awesome movie that can make anyone cry and leave them with deep pondering thoughts. Mewtwo ex is just as beloved here thanks to it being a basic card that can inflict 150 damage with its Psydrive attack. For just two energy, it can also inflict 50 damage using a Psychic Sphere attack.</p><p>Similar to Charizard ex, Mewtwo ex’s strongest attack has the detrimental effect of discarding two Psychic energy to use. That can make Psydrive a less consistent attack to pull off. Still, the 150 damage is great for a Basic Pokémon. As you’ve probably seen, pairing him with a Gardevoir can do wonders thanks to its ability to attach one Psychic energy to the Active Spot card each turn.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-recommend-id="image://6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large ten-pointed star Pokémon spins in the Starmie ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large ten-pointed star Pokémon spins in the Starmie ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-recommend-id="image://6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large ten-pointed star Pokémon spins in the Starmie ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sitting at the top of this list isn’t a Legendary or something that requires a ton of energy. Starmie ex is a low-risk card that can deal big damage fast, making it a great inclusion for a Water-based deck. Its Hydro Splash attack only needs two energy to deal 90 damage. Another fantastic benefit it has is a zero retreat cost, meaning you can easily swap it out if you’re worried it might get knocked out soon.</p><p>The only barrier with Starmie ex is that you need to evolve a Staryu for it. That isn’t that big of an issue in the grand scheme of things. Hydro Splash is sure to knock out if not take a big chunk from most Pokémon you pit it against. At the same time, 130 HP will help it survive against most attacks thrown at it. Every Water-based deck will be elevated by including or basing itself around a Starmie ex card.</p><hr><p>There is no telling how the metas might change, but for now, these are the best cards by far.

This time around, work-for-hire spriggan Van Arkride is tasked with investigating murders  at the hands of a mysterious red monster in the City of Edith. Despite its familiarity, the setup nevertheless sets the stage for some notable change-ups in combat, returning character cameos, and a narrative time-loop mechanic.</p><p>Let’s take them in order, starting with combat. Players will still largely be working with the same structure and toolset they’re accustomed to, but <em>Daybreak II</em>’s real-time, action-oriented field combat has more options this time around, with party members able to wield Quick Arts outside of  conventional turn-based combat. Once things do switch into turn-based encounters, a new Recast timer prohibits players from spamming S-Crafts back-to-back, a strategy that dominated in the first game.</p><p>  <em>Daybreak II </em>also features a larger cast. There are more playable characters and lots of cameos. The former assassin duo from <em>Trails Into Reverie</em>, Swin and Nadia, will play big roles in the game. Others, like the martial artist Zin Vathek who appeared as far back in the series as <em>Trails in the Sky, </em>will also make appearances, fighting alongside your party for a time when the story deems it appropriate. The callbacks will be a boon for longtime <em>Trails</em> fans but will also potentially make <em>Daybreak II</em> harder to parse than the first game, which in many ways served as the most ideal jumping-on point for newcomers the series has had in years. </p><p>Perhaps most unique to <em>Daybreak II</em> is a time-loop system in which a magic artifact revives the team when they die and lets them pursue an alternate course of action to progress their journey instead. It sounds like this mechanic, which includes a menu screen showing branching story paths, will be purely a narrative device rather than one that impacts gameplay. You’ll still be pursuing every avenue in a somewhat linear fashion, and while time technically resets, your earned XP and treasure chest rewards remain intact between loops. </p><p>But much of the bread and butter of a <em>Trails </em>game is everything you’re doing in-between new dungeons and major story beats. <em>Daybreak II</em>’s European-inspired urban backdrop includes food carts you can buy stuff from and consume to get temporary party buffs, as well as to increase your gourmet rank to unlock new and better foodie benefits. Fishing, cards, cyberhacking, and other minigames <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/trails-through-daybreak-ii-brings-improved-combat-more-perspectives-and-fishing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/trails-through-daybreak-ii-brings-improved-combat-more-perspectives-and-fishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have also been confirmed</a></span>. And outside of main quests and character side stories, there’s  an optional endless dungeon to grind to your heart’s content. </p><p>Even if <em>Daybreak II </em>seems like mid-arc filler, NIS America rep Alan Costa said its events will be important for later games, including a direct sequel that’s already out in Japan called <em>The Legend of Heroes: Kai no Kiseki</em>. NIS also localizes Nihon Falcom’s other big RPG franchise, <em>Ys</em>, the tenth entry of which just arrived in the West back in September. Costa <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/nis-america-says-trails-and-ys-rpg-fans-wont-have-to-wait-so-long-for-future-english-releases-we-want-to-bring-that-timeline-down/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/nis-america-says-trails-and-ys-rpg-fans-wont-have-to-wait-so-long-for-future-english-releases-we-want-to-bring-that-timeline-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has said</a></span> NIS America is trying to cut down on the time it takes to bring the games overseas without cutting corners or hurting the quality of the translations.</p><p>That doesn’t necessarily mean using AI, however. While Nihon Falcom President Kondo Toshihiro <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20241009051/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20241009051/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appeared bullish</a></span> on the prospects of using improving AI translation capabilities to speed up development and close the gap in global release times for <em>Trails</em> and <em>Ys</em> games, NIS America, which localizes the games for English, isn’t using any AI translation in its pipeline at the moment. </p><p>“We don’t use AI for any forward-facing translations inside of our games,” Costa told <em>Kotaku</em> during the recent preview event. “Anything that Falcom decides to do on their end, obviously we have no insight or oversight or say into that. I don’t believe they used any AI  in the creation of their script for this game, but we didn’t in our use in localizing the title. So all of this is warts and all—hopefully we don’t have too many—this is all done by people.”</p><p>Though <em>Trails Through Daybreak III</em> doesn’t yet have a release date in the U.S., the second game isn’t the only <em>Trials</em> release next year. A remake of the first game in the series, <em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 1st</em>, is also due out in 2025 on Switch. In addition to updating the 2006 game, it will also finally provide a clear starting point for new players on modern platforms. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whoever comes next will have a tough act to follow, as Shadow’s tease at the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 </em>was a huge moment for the live-action movies that had fans popping off in the theater. Who do we think is most likely to be burdened with this heavy responsibility? Will it be the next villain, or could it be a new ally for Sonic and his friends? I rounded up characters I think have an actual shot—even a very small one— at showing up at some point in <em>Sonic 3</em>, and am ranking them based on how likely I think they are to be the featured reveal in the big post-credits stinger.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-recommend-id="image://42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-format="jpg" data-width="757" data-height="657" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Big waving." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Big waving." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-recommend-id="image://42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-format="jpg" data-width="757" data-height="657" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Big waving." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Look, it would be a good bit. Big the Cat, the lovable oaf who debuted in <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, is beloved by fans despite mostly being a joke character in recent years. While he’s not often a playable fixture in the series, Big has been surprisingly present in several big games, to the point where I feel like he will probably show up somewhere down the line if the <em>Sonic </em>live-action universe continues to draw in ticket sales. I can already envision a scene in which Big is running around, chasing his slippery sidekick Froggy through the wreckage of whatever destruction Shadow creates in <em>Sonic 3</em>. Will it actually happen? No chance. That’s why Big is kicking off this list as the least likely hero to show up in <em>Sonic 3</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-recommend-id="image://988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="528" data-height="516" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Renders of Espio, Charmy, and Vector." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Renders of Espio, Charmy, and Vector." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-recommend-id="image://988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="528" data-height="516" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Renders of Espio, Charmy, and Vector." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Did you know the detective agency trio of Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, and Charmy Bee already exists in the live-action <em>Sonic </em>universe?

Even so, since we know these three sleuths are in this continuity, it seems likely they’ll make an appearance somewhere down the line. However, with so many big names in the <em>Sonic </em>franchise still unaccounted for, I have a hard time seeing them setting up the next film.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="50d4d34966ad6b2408eb7e5f6a9ded86" data-recommend-id="image://50d4d34966ad6b2408eb7e5f6a9ded86" data-format="jpg" data-width="2615" data-height="1470" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Chaos" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Chaos" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50d4d34966ad6b2408eb7e5f6a9ded86" data-recommend-id="image://50d4d34966ad6b2408eb7e5f6a9ded86" data-format="jpg" data-width="2615" data-height="1470" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Chaos" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I think there’s a strong possibility that Chaos, the water-like mutant antagonist of the original <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, is the villain in a future <em>Sonic </em>movie. Whether that’s <em>Sonic 4</em> or another movie down the line, Chaos is the kind of world-ending threat that these movies seem to be leading toward as they escalate and raise the stakes each time. However, I do think these movies need a marketable face to tease what’s next, and that’s why Tails and Shadow’s appearances at the end of the first two movies made sense. They were both well-known characters that you could see facilitating merchandise like figures and plushies. Chaos is exciting to long-time <em>Sonic </em>fans and I would love to see him flood a city and Sonic make some joke about how the team is “gonna need a bigger boat,” but as a post-credits stinger? There are probably more likely candidates.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d4f91fab398c13cb3735182f722011fe" data-recommend-id="image://d4f91fab398c13cb3735182f722011fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1195" data-height="669" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Omega" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Omega" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4f91fab398c13cb3735182f722011fe" data-recommend-id="image://d4f91fab398c13cb3735182f722011fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1195" data-height="669" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Omega" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Okay, hear me out. E-123 Omega is a popular character as the third member of Shadow’s Team Dark, but he certainly wouldn’t make for a big, crowd-pleasing post-credits scene on his own.

If you’ve played <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, you know how that story ends for Shadow: he falls to Earth from space, is presumed dead, and then is found by Eggman for his own experiments. If Shadow meets a similar fate at the end of <em>Sonic 3</em>, a robot is going to probably have to find him, right? Who better than his future teammate?</p><p>Come on, Paramount. Give me this.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ef50c42c029dc51679a5cbb7ab41e3dd" data-recommend-id="image://ef50c42c029dc51679a5cbb7ab41e3dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="602" data-height="338" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Silver" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Silver" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef50c42c029dc51679a5cbb7ab41e3dd" data-recommend-id="image://ef50c42c029dc51679a5cbb7ab41e3dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="602" data-height="338" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Silver" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> Now we’re moving away from wishful thinking and into “actually possible” territory. Silver the Hedgehog, the time-traveling telekinetic hero from the future, seems like a shoo-in for a future <em>Sonic</em> live-action movie. If he does show up, I can’t imagine him not being accompanied by Blaze the Cat, his companion from the future in his debut in <em>Sonic ‘06 </em>(though we’ll ignore the way Sega retconned her origins and decided she’s from another dimension, because we don’t need to make <em>Sonic</em> a multiverse story this early into the cinematic universe). </p><figure id="" data-id="f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-recommend-id="image://f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-format="jpg" data-width="548" data-height="306" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Blaze" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Blaze" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-recommend-id="image://f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-format="jpg" data-width="548" data-height="306" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Blaze" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I expect this pair to show up in the near future because some of the groundwork has already been laid. One of the more baffling parts of the <em>Knuckles </em>series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/knuckles-paramount-sonic-06-iblis-flames-of-disaster-1851427520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-paramount-sonic-06-iblis-flames-of-disaster-1851427520">featured a reference to Iblis</a></span>, a major villain in <em>Sonic ‘06</em> and a central figure in the two’s story. The show made some embellishments to Iblis’ nature, so the next movie probably won’t be a 1:1 recreation of <em>Sonic ‘06</em>, but with both Iblis and Shadow joining the live-action universe this year, Paramount has a lot of the pieces in place to make the next movie a retelling of one of the more controversial games in <em>Sonic</em>’s portfolio. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-recommend-id="image://5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-format="jpg" data-width="842" data-height="473" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Rouge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Rouge." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-recommend-id="image://5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-format="jpg" data-width="842" data-height="473" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Rouge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I can’t believe we haven’t seen Rouge the Bat in the live-action <em>Sonic </em>universe yet. Unless Paramount is deliberately hiding her in all the trailers and promotional materials, it doesn’t seem like she’ll be making an appearance in <em>Sonic 3 </em>proper despite it being a loose adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, which featured the debut of the treasure-hunting spy. I was hopeful she would show up in the <em>Knuckles </em>show since she’s considered the titular Echidna’s rival, but again, that show barely had time for one CG character, much less two. So here we are, with no sign of the leader of Team Dark even after a show and a movie that would have been easy entry points. </p><p>If Rouge isn’t secretly in <em>Sonic 3</em>, I could see her debut in the live-action universe being much like the beginning of Team Dark’s story in <em>Sonic Heroes</em>. She could happen upon Shadow in stasis while looking for treasure in Eggman’s base, then one thing leads to another and the team is formed. Typing that out, I realize it seems like a stronger basis for the opening of the reported Shadow spin-off, but I do think Rouge joining the cinematic universe is a matter of when, not if. In recent games and shows like <em>Sonic Dream Team </em>and <em>Sonic Prime</em>, Rouge has been treated as a friend of Sonic, rather than being more closely tied to Shadow as she has been in most other appearances, so there’s a chance the <em>Sonic </em>movies go that route. That would be incredibly disappointing to me as a Team Dark stan, though, especially after Sega brought the band back together this year in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560"><em>Shadow Generations</em></a></span>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-recommend-id="image://48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-format="jpg" data-width="713" data-height="398" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Amy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Amy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-recommend-id="image://48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-format="jpg" data-width="713" data-height="398" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Amy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Unlike Tails and Shadow, I don’t see Amy Rose as the kind of character who can kickstart the narrative of a sequel on her own. She’d probably need to be paired with some other character or force in a post-credit scene, but the <em>Sonic </em>movies desperately need her after being a boy’s club for three movies. Amy is often treated as secondary to the main trio of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, but she’s ultimately a core part of the heroes’ dynamic and it’s about time she showed up. Paramount has omitted her for so long that I’m not sure how she’ll fit into this storyline, but someone over there needs to figure it out, and sooner rather than later. </p><figure id="" data-id="51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-recommend-id="image://51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-format="jpg" data-width="964" data-height="544" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Cream" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Cream" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-recommend-id="image://51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-format="jpg" data-width="964" data-height="544" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Cream" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If they wanted to get real bold, I could see Cream the Rabbit showing up alongside Amy, making the whole cast of anthropomorphic characters more well-rounded.

It wouldn’t be my ideal choice, but I can also see Paramount trying to package Amy, Cream, and Rouge as a girl-centric group in a call-back to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mizuhano/status/989669646730067968&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mizuhano/status/989669646730067968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scrapped <em>Sonic Heroes</em> team</a></span> that would have featured the three of them working together.

I do worry that setting up Metal Sonic as the next movie’s big bad could feel a little samey after Sonic facing an “evil” mirror image of himself in Shadow throughout <em>Sonic 3</em>, but it’s certainly an easier concept to explain in a family film than something like Iblis or Chaos. I hope Paramount swings for the fences and introduces something different in the next movie, but given that there’s already reason to believe Doctor Robotnik might be piecing Metal Sonic together, I fully expect the robot to make his debut in <em>Sonic 3</em>, whether that’s as an eleventh-hour villain or in a post-credits scene. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/people-are-upgrading-the-m4-mac-mini-whether-apple-likes-it-or-not.1036137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/m4-mac-mini-upgrade-memory-storage-nand-flash<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the smartest moves Apple ever pulled, up there with the iPhone itself, was investing in Apple silicon. Starting with 2020’s M1 onward, Apple’s SoC’s (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">System on Chip</a>) have been the best designed out there. The MacBook Air absolutely screams and has a battery that doesn’t quit. The latest M4 Mac mini redesign is a staggering performance jump and thus a fantastic deal.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>It is, indeed, a very small computer as YouTuber Marques Brownlee was quick to point out in his walkthrough of the M4 Mac mini. Credit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mkbhd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marques Brownlee</a></figcaption></figure><p>Or rather, it would be, if not for one perennial issue – the storage in the majority of Apple’s products is not user upgradable and (mostly) soldered directly on the board, although the M4 Mac mini differs slightly. You’re stuck with whatever internal hard drive space you start off with. The pricing is also borderline criminal. But that has not and will not stop people from upgrading the SSDs on MacBook Airs and Mac minis by painfully desoldering the NAND chips and installing new ones themselves, as YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dosdude1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DosDude1</a> has shown.</p><p><strong>It’s iPhones All The Way Down</strong></p><p>Apple, as a general rule, has rarely been open with its hardware or software. On some level, doing things this way makes sense. When your biggest success is unquestionably the iPhone, you eventually just have to design everything that way.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="M1 Mac Mini Soldered SSD Upgrade" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X7C_hdJsY4Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The first major upgrade video by dosdude1</figcaption></figure></div><p>“Historically, ALL Apple SoCs since the original iPhone (which is from a time before Apple even designed their own SoCs) have been designed in this way,” Collin Mistr, who goes by dosdude1, told me when I asked about how Apple designs their products, “where the RAM is soldered to the package via a ‘POP’ (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_on_a_package" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">package-on-package</a>) design, and using their own implementation for storage with a raw connection from the SoC to the NAND.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="UPGRADING an M1 Mac mini SSD from 256gb to 2TB!!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/apEKAY11NQs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>dosdude1's first Mac upgrade got a bump in part because his video was in collaboration with YouTuber Luke Miani.</figcaption></figure></div><p>In Apple’s computers, the flash memory controller is integrated into the SoC, as opposed to a standard NVMe drive you’d buy from a MicroCenter where the controller is on the drive itself. “Such a design choice (soldered storage) is considered normal for mobile devices, though not as much so for computers,” Collin told me. “So to me it is simply implemented this way because, well, that’s literally just how it’s always been done with this system design.”</p><p>If you have ever soldered or desoldered anything, watching Collin’s upgrade videos can be nerve wracking, deeply comforting or somehow both. Like some of the best YouTubers, he exists mainly as a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/so-your-kid-wants-to-be-a-twitch-streamer-three-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soothing voice and a pair of hands</a>. Though he works on all sorts of devices such as older Mac hardware, the Steam Deck and the Lenovo Go, his videos blew up a year ago with one where he upgraded the storage on an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7C_hdJsY4Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M1 Mac mini</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Ahhhhhhhh. Credit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=shared&amp;v=Xrg7nPG6_UU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dosdude1</a></figcaption></figure><p>Collin’s upgrade videos have a surgical quality to them. He first removes the existing NAND from the board using a hot air gun to loosen the solder. Any underfill there is potentially scraped away using a specialty tool. After heating and gentle prying, the chip pops up. He then goes through the process of manually removing and cleaning the board. Fresh solder is reapplied to the PCB using flux, a common chemical that improves the flow of solder. In the case of his M1 MacBook Air video specifically, only one of potentially two NANDs is populated while the other is barren. To upgrade this he applies fresh solder to the pads, takes tiny 0201 resistors from a donor PCB and individually populates them over on the other board. I have done this with much larger resistors fairly recently and can tell you that it is a huge pain in the ass that sucks to do.</p><figure><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=shared&amp;v=Xrg7nPG6_UU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><figcaption>Solder paste and a stencil in the exact shape of the NAND is used to "reball" it. Credit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=shared&amp;v=Xrg7nPG6_UU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dosdude1</a></figcaption></figure><p>From there, Collin moves on to the “reballing” of the fresh, high capacity, totally blank NAND flash. Each NAND is connected via a series of tiny soldered connections in a grid pattern. Solder paste (as opposed to solder wire) is applied to the back of the chip using a stencil attached with kapton tape, and then hot air and slight pressure are applied to melt the balls evenly. Another round of flux and hot air is applied to the NAND modules to make sure the balls are uniform. From there, more flux is applied to the PCB, the freshly balled chips are aligned to that grid as accurately as possible, and hot air is applied to melt the solder exactly where it should be. The freshly upgraded Mac is then put into <a href="https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/DFU_Mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DFU mode</a> and connected to a host PC which will (hopefully) reinstall MacOS. See? Easy.</p><p>Collin says he got his start the way many tinkerers do: getting inexpensive hardware with faulty boards from eBay to learn various diagnostic techniques and build up his toolset. By tinkering, he got good at reverse engineering Mac repair hacks and modifications.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think the earliest mod I attempted was upgrading PowerPC Mac CPUs, doing things like upgrading PowerPC G3-based systems to G4 CPUs,” he says. In addition to his popular Mac upgrade videos, he’s also upgraded the soldered RAM modules of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmobr6YEhWE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Deck</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHkgwhG_eEU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lenovo Legion Go</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>One of the best Macs ever</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="UPGRADING a Brand NEW M4 Mac mini" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJPXLE9uPr8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Collin's latest video: upgrading the M4 Mac mini. </figcaption></figure></div><p>This brings us back to the M4 Mac mini. It quickly caught the attention of journalists and YouTubers alike for two ultimately meaningless and novel choices: shrinking down the device to be in line with every other mini PC that comes out of China and putting the power button on the bottom in a way that is both annoying and very much Apple. But the really important thing is that it’s a fantastic computer. Ars Technica called it “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/review-m4-and-m4-pro-mac-minis-are-probably-apples-best-mac-minis-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple’s best Mac mini’s ever.”</a>&nbsp; This is to say nothing of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1gltzey/quick_look_at_apples_m4_pro_and_m4_max_compute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M4 Pro and M4 Max, </a>which are wiping the floor with the competition in benchmarks. It is one of the most power-efficient computers ever made, and at idle it consumes 3-4 watts of power, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/m4-mac-minis-efficiency-incredible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roughly about the same as a Raspberry Pi</a>, according to homelab expert <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Geerling</a>. The Mac mini has gone from being the unassuming workhorse in Apple’s lineup to possibly one of the best computers it makes.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mac mini M4 vs M4 Pro - Unboxing, Comparison, Benchmarks &amp; Review!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_hNqgSEsQo?start=561&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A breakdown of the M4 Mac mini and M4 Pro. </figcaption></figure></div><p>The base model M4 Mac mini comes with 16 GB of RAM for $599, but the base model SSD remains borderline unusable 256 GB. That is not a functional amount of storage in 2024. Want to upgrade to 512 GB or 1 TB? Unless you plan on living off of external drives, those are $200 and $400 dollar price hikes respectively. In an age where you can pick up a 1 TB M.2 drive for $60 ($100 if you want it to go real fast) those prices are borderline criminal.&nbsp;</p><p>The M4 Mac mini differs from the previous Mac mini in that the NAND flash is physically removable without desoldering. Like the Mac Studio before it, the NAND flash is stored on a proprietary module that is removable. This does not, however, mean you can just throw any SSD in. In order to upgrade the chip you still need to go through the same painful steps as before.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mac Studio Storage Upgrade - Made EASY with Custom Parts" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDFCurB3-0Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Collin working on a Mac Studio, which has a dedicated PCB for the NAND flash like the M4 Mac mini. </figcaption></figure></div><p>“The only difference is Apple physically moved the NANDs onto a removable module instead of soldering them directly to the board,” Collin told me. When performing upgrades “it must be treated as though it is soldered storage.”&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this, the new Mac mini design has much more potential for upgradability. In his previous video about the similar Mac Studio, Collin used a custom, reverse engineered PCB made by his friend Giles at <a href="https://www.polysoft.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polysoft Services</a> (that module is still in the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/polysoftservices/studio-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kickstarter phase</a> as of me writing this) “It is now feasible to sell those with NANDs installed to users, allowing them to perform their own upgrades.”</p><p><strong>The Future Is User-Serviceable</strong></p><p>One of the richest companies in the world probably isn’t soliciting feedback on how to run a business, although I am going to provide it anyway. With Apple Silicon, the MacBook Air and mini became so good that even I had to begrudgingly admit their utility, and the M4 Mac mini’s NAND being semi-removable is a step in the right direction. But this storage racket has to stop. What’s more, with various <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/94127/apples-parts-pairing-rollback-doesnt-go-far-enough" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Right to Repair laws passing</a>, Apple is finally caving <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/97100/apple-finally-promises-to-enable-third-party-parts-mostly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a little bit on the issue of parts pairing</a> for iPhones and iPads, although its implementation has been <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/100266/the-end-of-parts-pairing-almost" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buggy at best</a>.&nbsp; “[Parts pairing] is completely unnecessary, has no benefit, and serves only to prevent users from easily swapping parts,” Collin told me.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of what Apple offers in the future, willingly or via legislation, the door has already been opened. You can’t expect people not to tinker and repair their technology and to show others how to do it, like Collin has. The future is user-serviceable whether Apple likes it or not.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As one of the first tasks of your adventure, you’ll need to make your way over to Patty’s Party Planning Place to recruit three companions. Whether you choose to take along the premade characters or create your own allies, you’ll see that each character can assume one of eight classes. With no frame of reference for how each class performs, how on earth are you supposed to choose?</p><p>Fortunately, you should know that your choices here aren’t necessarily permanent. <strong><em>Dragon Quest III</em> will eventually let you change each of your companions’ classes later on in your adventure, so your goal here is to pick the classes that will help you early on the most</strong>. In some cases, this may mean taking classes that start strong out the gate. In other cases, you may want to prioritize classes that learn valuable utility skills that the character’s second class can inherit down the line. Either way, you have some flexibility with your picks here.</p><p>To help you decide which classes will serve you best in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>, we’ve assembled a tier list that ranks their early game benefits from best to worst. Note that <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> does feature new mechanics and class changes that change how jobs perform relative to previous versions of the game, so longtime fans can’t necessarily rely on their preexisting knowledge of the game. Also, <strong>please note that this is strictly a tier list of which classes to start with, not each class’s overall performance throughout the game</strong>. Some picks function much better when used as mid-game class changes, and one of the best classes in the game isn’t even available at the start!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb5611116313570c9f74bd03440271eb" data-recommend-id="image://bb5611116313570c9f74bd03440271eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

It can inflict decent physical damage, especially since it can equip strong whips that damage entire groups of enemies. Additionally, Monster Tamer learns healing abilities in the form of <strong>Emergency Groom</strong> and <strong>Soothing Song</strong>, which offer single-target and party-wide healing respectively. Not only is this the only source of party-wide healing in the early game of <em>Dragon Quest III</em>, these also work in instances where magic is blocked since they are classified as Abilities. Monster Wrangler doesn’t scale as a healer into the later game, but it fills a powerful niche early on.</p><p>That said, <strong>it’s the new collectible monsters that elevates Monster Wrangler from good to great.</strong> As you explore the world, you’ll find friendly monsters that you can typically recruit by either using the correct item or skill to get them to talk to you. Not only do Monster Wranglers let you automatically catch monsters without fulfilling these prerequisites, collecting a large roster will grant Monster Wranglers new skills as well. This critically includes <strong>Monster Pile-On</strong>, a powerful attack that scales with the total number of monsters you’ve collected. As long as you explore and use the Monster Wrangler’s <strong>Animal Instinct</strong> Ability to track down recruitable monsters, you can easily learn this skill by the time you can change class.</p><p>If you plan to speedrun the game and don’t want to track down monsters, then Monster Wrangler admittedly won’t impress as much. Otherwise, this class covers so many early-game niches and learns such strong Abilities that it will find use in any party you stick it in.</p><h3 id="h74847"><a id=""></a><strong>Mage</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="efa6256e3359251a0234039102710656" data-recommend-id="image://efa6256e3359251a0234039102710656" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

A menu displays the Mage character class, which is seen wearing a green robe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Mages have always been good in <em>Dragon Quest III</em> thanks to their access to powerful magic attacks. However, <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> gives all magic users an inadvertent buff, since all level-ups will fully restore that character’s HP and MP. This means Mages can use their most powerful magic with only the slightest restraint in dungeons, since they’ll usually receive full restoration before their MP runs dry. In other words, Mage is easily a top DPS pick and one of the best damage dealers to start out with in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em></p><p>Even without this boon, Mage would still be a good starting class. It excels at damaging groups of enemies, which you’ll be dealing with way more than single targets. It’s also a great candidate to turn into the mighty Sage class thanks to its naturally high Wisdom and MP stats (see the Gadabout description later on). Mages aren’t quite as useful if you change them to any class that isn’t a magic user, but overall this is an obvious class to pick.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="45ee390148f929f56bf7ab1878ffb3df" data-recommend-id="image://45ee390148f929f56bf7ab1878ffb3df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

A menu displays the Priest character class, which is seen wearing yellow boots and gloves and a blue cloak and hat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While not essential, these classes are top picks to round out your party.</p><h3 id="h74848"><a id=""></a><strong>Priest</strong></h3><p>Funny enough, you don’t <em>need</em> a dedicated healer when you start out in <em>Dragon Quest III</em>. You can technically cover your healing bases by using your main character and either healing items or the Monster Tamer until you eventually get a Sage in your party. Regardless, if you’re wondering who your third party member should be, I’d suggest “have a little Priest.”</p><p>Starting with a Priest has two huge perks. First, a dedicated healer frees up the rest of your party from healing duty, including your incredibly powerful protagonist. Second, a Priest learns so many helpful support skills in the early game that it’ll make virtually any class it later changes to better. Even a Fighter can function like a <em>Final Fantasy</em>-style Paladin when it can remove a slew of status resistances and provide some backup healing when the chips are down.</p><p>Oh, and Priests can learn some basic attack magic in the form of <strong>Woosh</strong> and <strong>Swoosh</strong>, which it can easily use thanks to the aforementioned full heals on leveling up.</p><p>Do keep in mind that if you insist on using both a Mage and a Priest, you may struggle in instances where magic is sealed or you need to use physical attacks. Still, if you’d like to prioritize survival, definitely pick a Priest starting out.</p><h3 id="h74849"><a id=""></a><strong>Martial Artist</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="a381683b5db76a7044ee989a5dc60c3e" data-recommend-id="image://a381683b5db76a7044ee989a5dc60c3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

A menu displays the Martial Artist character class, which is seen wearing a green Gi." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Martial Artist’s weaknesses are actually strengths when it comes to the early game of <em>Dragon Quest III</em>. On one hand, they’re extremely picky with equipment, and they’re literally better off fighting bare-handed in the early game until you can find claws for them to use. On the other hand, this means you don’t need to invest a lot of gold into dressing them and you can focus on the rest of your party without grinding. Additionally, the Martial Artist only learns situationally useful skills in the early game. But despite that, skills like <strong>Flying Knee</strong> and <strong>Hawkeye Claw</strong> will come quite in handy, especially in the dungeons you’ll need to clear before you can unlock class changing.</p><p>There’s honestly not a lot to say about the Martial Artist, as its main function is to just <em>punch</em> nine times out of ten. Still, if you want a dedicated physical attacker on your team, the Martial Artist is a good starting point.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9e79133572fc009f3d33177e5b57ed51" data-recommend-id="image://9e79133572fc009f3d33177e5b57ed51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

It can equip a richer variety of weapons and armor compared to the Martial Artist, but that can put more of a strain on your gold reserves unless you want to forgo loading out your other party members. Its early game skills also aren’t especially impressive, as it takes quite a few levels for it to learn strong physical attacks. The Warrior does technically fulfill a tank role for your party, but frankly the Hero already does an admiral job of filling this void throughout the early game.</p><p>Should you eventually switch one of your classes into a Warrior later on? Sure, it’s a good class! Additionally, if you’re the type of player who always likes to level grind until you get all the best equipment before heading into a dungeon, then the Warrior will likely come out ahead of the Martial Artist. Otherwise, you may want to consider one of the higher-tier options above before picking a Warrior.</p><p>DQ3-Class-Thief.jpg]</p><p>Caption: A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

A menu displays the Thief character class, which is seen wearing long white shorts and a yellow shirt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I want to make one point abundantly clear: <strong>Thief is one of the most important classes in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em></strong>. Its skills <strong>Nose for Treasure</strong> and <strong>Scoop</strong> are <em>invaluable</em> for finding hidden treasure, including the collectible Mini Medals scattered all throughout the game. <em>Several</em> hidden items have literally no visual clue for where they are unless you’re standing on top of them, so the Thief’s skills are essential for completionists. Additionally, <strong>Padfoot</strong> lowers the rate of random battles, which makes several dungeons in the game much more palatable.</p><p>So why not pick a Thief right off the bat? Long story short, it takes them a few levels to get these essential skills, and they are much stronger in battle if you let them inherit skills from another class. If you don’t mind using a weaker class in the early game of <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> and just want those key skills right away, then you should definitely start with a Thief. But for the smoothest play experience, just make Thief one of your first class changes instead.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a4f310c69b8158f253d5544de5ec5891" data-recommend-id="image://a4f310c69b8158f253d5544de5ec5891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

It <em>is</em> usable, as it can inflict respectable damage and equip some strong weapons. The Merchant also can find extra gold after battles, which can be helpful early on while money is relatively scarce. You can even use the “Show” command with a Merchant in the party, which gives you a full and fun description of every item in the game. It’s a really neat touch!</p><p>The Merchant’s problem is that it offers almost no long-term benefits to your party. Sure, the Show command can let you know if an item is cursed, but that’s usually specified in an item’s description already. The skill <strong>Service Call</strong> technically lets you use Inns on-demand, but it doesn’t work in the dungeons where you’d need it the most. It does learn the powerful attack <strong>Call to Arms</strong>, but this is a later-game move and is functionally identical to the Monster Tamer’s <strong>Monster Pile-On</strong>, which is overall cheaper to use.</p><p>Merchants aren’t bad, and they are fun to use.

Don’t bother with this until later.</p><h3 id="h74853"><a id=""></a><strong>Gadabout</strong></h3><p>Please don’t start with this literal clown emoji of a class. It’s bad enough that Gadabouts learn nothing useful in the early game and contribute less damage than the classes listed above. What’s worse is that Gadabouts will literally waste turns disobeying your commands to instead pull pranks on the battlefield, all of which can stun or weaken your party members. Yes, you read that right: You will encounter instances in which having a Gadabout in your party is actually worse than not having a third party member at all.</p><p>Why does such an awful class exist in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> to begin with? Well, if you can pull off leveling a Gadabout high enough, it can learn some useful (albeit often niche) abilities that no other classes can. Additionally, the Gadabout is the only class that can change into the Sage class without consuming the rare Words of Wisdom item. In either case, <strong>the goal with the Gadabout is to have it in your party for the least amount of time possible</strong>. Since EXP scales up sharply as you progress in your adventure, you won’t have to endure using a Gadabout for nearly as long if you save this for a class change later on.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Thunderful has announced its second restructuring in less than a year’s time. This time, it could see up to 100 people lose their jobs within the company.</p>



<p>The announcement came on Thursday via the <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-11-14-thunderful-group-implements-strategic-restructuring-program-doubling-down-on-third-party-game-publishing-and-scaling-back-internal-development-resulting-in-write-downs-of-220-240-msek" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s website</a>.</p>



<p>“This newly announced program follows the cost-saving measures introduced earlier this year, as well as the divestment of the Group’s distribution business to manage previously incurred net debt,” Thunderful said. “Whilst significant reductions in cost levels were achieved this year, revenue targets have not been met and the Group is still struggling with negative cash flow.”</p>



<p>This restructuring will see the company move focus to external publishing with third-party games. Thunderful says it will “reduce the Group´s fixed costs and allow for greater flexibility, enabling faster, diverse game releases by leveraging external talent and resources in a balanced manner, while still retaining some internal development capacity.”</p>



<p>“It is regrettable to announce a second restructuring of Thunderful in less than a year, but we unfortunately see no other alternatives in order to ensure the Group’s long-term sustainability and resilience,” Thunderful CEO Martin Walfisz said.</p>



<p>As part of the moves, somewhere between 80-100 people in and outside of Sweden will lose their jobs. Those in management and administration will also be impacted by the layoffs.</p>



<p>Thunderful expects to have one-time costs of $22.8M – $27.4M as part of separation costs after negotiating with unions. In total, however, they anticipate the job  cuts to improve the overall cash flow by $73M – $82.2M.</p>



<p>In 2024, there have been nearly 14,000 known jobs lost due to layoffs across more than 160 companies.</p>



<p>What do you think of the restructuring and layoffs at Thunderful? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>Trading has been part of the Pokémon fabric and DNA since day one. It’s no surprise Trading is a huge topic of discussion in Pocket, and I’ve gathered the latest news and announcements to tell you everything we know about Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Trading mechanic.</p>



<p>Once you’ve opened many Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-open-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">packs</a> and reeled off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-exploit-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Picks</a>, your collection should look very full; but you’re also bound to have tons of duplicates. Getting extras of the same card is crucial when it comes to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-flair-in-pokemon-pocket-tcg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flair</a> in Pokémon TCG Pocket, but it can become an annoyance too. There are so many Pokémon I love when I first pull but become irritated by when I see them for the 10th time—or twice in one pack!</p>



<p>You can swap duplicates in real life—one area where the physical edition of the Pokémon TCG differs from the virtual format. We know Trading is in Pokémon TCG Pocket, but questions are being asked about it daily, and I’ll answer them now.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-trade-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Can you Trade in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let me Trade, please! Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You cannot Trade in Pokémon TCG Pocket at present</strong> as the feature is currently locked behind a notice saying “<strong>Coming soon.</strong>” I think this part of the equation is quite self-explanatory. You can’t Trade, but The Pokémon Company has addressed the future of the mechanic.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket">When is Trading Coming to Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>As announced by the <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP_JP/status/1856864629009363249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket X social media page</a>, “<strong>January 2025</strong>” is the official start period for Trading.</p>



<p>The post has been <a href="https://x.com/PokemonDealsTCG/status/1856820750529040857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">translated</a>, and says, “We are aiming to add a feature that allows certain cards to be Traded started in January 2025. We are gradually planning to expand the selection of cards that are able to be Traded.”</p>



<p>So, <strong>not all cards can be Traded on day one</strong>. Using my best judgment, I’d say all cards ranging between <strong>one and three diamonds</strong> are going to be eligible to Trade. It does mean EX cards and other mega-rare pulls—such as Full Arts—need to wait a bit longer. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, like many players, I find myself in the situation where I have completed most of the main Genetic Apex set, and I’m mainly missing the odd EX card, as well as Full Arts. The Pokémon Company likely doesn’t want so many people having every card already, and it encourages players to spend more money and open more packs in a bid to pull the rarest cards.</p>



<p>Also, don’t be surprised if <strong>Gold Crown cards are never made Tradeable in Pokémon TCG Pocket.</strong> We’ll update this as we learn more about the card criteria for Trading.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-trade-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How to Trade in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>The actual Trading process hasn’t been outlined yet, but we wager a similar system to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon GO</a> is likely to be employed: Direct, one-to-one Trading between connected players, and you need to have a certain amount of currency to do so.</p>



<p>Pokémon GO requires Stardust to Trade—with certain cards made untradable altogether—and I expect you probably need a certain amount of Shinedust to Trade in Pokémon Pocket. The amount likely depends on the rarity of the creature, and Trading may be limited to a certain amount per day. This is all conjecture for now, but I can’t imagine the system will drastically deviate from this theory.</p>

<p>When Obsidian announced Avowed’s delay <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-confirmed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">out of November 2024</a> to February 2025, the reason given was that it gave the game time to breath on its own against what would’ve been fierce competition. While some fans didn’t believe that to be the case, Xbox head Phil Spencer once again claimed that the decision wasn’t because of the game’s quality.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-phil-spencer-blizzard-avowed-south-of-midnight">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a> (subscription needed), Spencer said that the company had so many games releasing that it just made sense to move Avowed. </p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>“We can afford it when we have the Diablo expansion, then Black Ops, then Indy [and the Great Circle],” he said. “We didn’t move it because Obsidian needed the time. They’ll use the time.”</p>



<p>With the game now set to launch on February 18, Avowed will still face competition from games outside of the Microsoft umbrella such as Civilization 7, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Monster Hunter Wilds, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and more. Despite those other game’s releasing, it seems as though Avowed won’t see another delay based on Spencer’s comments.</p>



<p>Spencer added that discussions with Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty and the Game Pass team helped them spread out the releases of their games to where they see a fit.</p>



<p>When it launches, Avowed will be available exclusively on Xbox Series X|S and PC. The game will also be a day one release on Game Pass.</p>

Zombies won't receive a new map until Season 1 Reloaded, but the new update does add the ability to purchase Gobblegums.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 returns the Gobblegum system from the Zombies mode in Black Ops 3, and it includes special gumballs that offer a range of temporary or one-time use abilities to help in the fight against zombie hordes. Some Gobblegums can help players upgrade their weapon rarity, give them free perks, revive teammates, or even teleport them away from danger.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4399719-gobblegumsinstore.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399719" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4399719-gobblegumsinstore.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399719"></a><figcaption>Season 1 Gobblegum packs</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4399719-gobblegumsinstore.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Season 1 update to Black Ops 6 brings plenty of new cosmetic bundles to the in-game shop, and this includes Gobblegum packs for Zombies players. As of right now, the shop contains a small assortment of packs ranging from 200 CoD Points ($2) for a pack of three gums to a large pack of 12 high-end Gobblegums for 1,100 CoD Points ($10).</p><p dir="ltr">However, it's definitely worth noting that the Gobblegums are an optional loadout item, and Black Ops 6 makes it easier than past years to earn free Gobblegums. Players earn the gums randomly while playing Zombies, and there are even double-XP events that can sometimes increase the Gobblegum earn rate.</p><p dir="ltr">Gobblegums are featured in the Season 1 battle pass, and they'll likely be available as rewards in future events as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The Season 1 battle pass <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-battle-pass-includes-dlc-weapons-sev-operator-and-new-blackcell/2900-5944/">features over 100 items to unlock</a>, including two new weapons, Sev as a playable operator, and plenty of cosmetic weapon blueprints.

            <p>
The Rogue Prince of Persia will receive an enormous new update, Second Act, next week on 21st November, that looks like it'll function as something of a full relaunch. 
</p>
<p>
This roguelite take on Ubisoft's historical action series from some of the developers behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> arrived in early access back in May this year to a warm reception.
</p>
<p>
Now, developer Evil Empire is adding the game's biggest update yet, which will revamp the game's visuals and double the game's size. You can take a look at the changes in the new Second Act trailer below:
</p>

<figcaption>The Rogue Prince of Persia: Second Act trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAeRM7fJ2S0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Writing on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2717880/view/4508758658863071521">Steam</a>, Evil Empire describe the update as a "glow-up" for the game, with additional detail and tweaked colour palettes. Most notably, the Prince is no longer purple
</p>
<p>
"This change was made as the purple tone just didn't fit with the new direction," Evil Empire wrote. "We find that the art direction is now a much better fit with the game's genre, setting/story and the Prince of Persia series as a whole." Which is fair, as the Prince is not purple anywhere else.
</p>
<p>
Other content added in the Second Act update includes more biomes, bosses, a fresh story act and additional quality of life improvements such as multiple save slots.
</p>
<p>
"I think it works because the game has a charismatic star," Chris Donlan wrote of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-definitely-still-room-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia upon its early access launch</a>. "Not charismatic in what he says, perhaps, but in what he does and how he moves. I just love to watch him run."

<p>MADFINGER Games has just revealed an exclusive new trailer showcasing the long-awaited Night Ops update for Gray Zone Warfare. This monumental and major overhaul introduces a day-night cycle to the open-world tactical shooter, forever altering the course of combat and further proving that in Gray Zone Warfare, <strong>every move matters</strong>.</p>



<p>In the snapshot trailer, we get a glimpse at how the world of Lamang changes under a veil of darkness. From new equipment to combat the shadows to quests that can only be completed at night, Gray Zone Warfare players are preparing to eat well when the Night Ops update is released on November 27.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-continuous-improvement">Continuous Improvement</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare was released in April 2024 to a very positive reception, despite there being some teething issues.</p>



<p>MADFINGER has been a stalwart force in tackling these issues, working hard to deliver a game that continuously improves and innovates, with community-led feedback sitting at the heart of everything the team does.</p>



<p>The Night Ops update has been on the cards for a couple of months, and following the release of a new teaser trailer, it has been revealed when that update will hit the ecosystem.</p>



<p>If you’re a Gray Zone Warfare fan eager to jump into some night-based activity, you won’t need to wait long. The Night Ops update will be released in Gray Zone Warfare on  November 27, which is also when MADFINGER will publish a full, feature-length trailer showcasing the impending changes.</p>



<p>I played Gray Zone Warfare as soon as hit early access this year and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-preview/">was blown away</a> by the depth of the game and the ambition of MADFINGER. I was then welcomed by the team at Gamescom to learn about these changes and to talk at length <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Marek Rabas</a>, the CEO of MADFINGER, about the future of extraction shooters.</p>



<p>If you’ve been enjoying Gray Zone Warfare, believe me when I say you’re not ready for Night Ops – it’s going to bring about a paradigm shift that’ll forever change how you play the game, but it’s <strong>all good things</strong>.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Night Ops? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>A month after version 1.0 was released on PC and console, Undisputed has received its first post-launch update for all players. The update addresses a few key concerns from the community while developer Steel City Interactive continues to work on it’s planned December update. </p>



<p>Some of the key fixes in Update 1.1.3 include adjustments to Deontay Wilder’s stats for more fair online play, removeable of the critical stumble reaction, updated blocking, and more. You can check out the full patch notes from the update for yourself.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-undisputed-update-details">Undisputed Update Details</h2>



<ul>
<li>Changes to the block colliders to ensure that block functions as expected and the number of power punches that break through the block is greatly reduced.</li>



<li>Deontay Wilder’s stats have been reduced, and we’ve removed a trait. His power hooks should now be less impactful.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Increased max stamina cost of hooks and straights.</li>



<li>Increased the cost of power punches to both short-term and max stamina.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Introduced a threshold on the number of power punches that can be thrown within a single fight before the stamina cost per power punch is increased further.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Increased the stamina cost of pushing, which should reduce the amount of people spamming the push mechanic.</li>



<li>Temporarily removed the critical stumble reaction from the game as it was too punishing.</li>



<li>Reduced the effectiveness and chainability of hooks by further slowing them down when a fighter is gassed.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that would prevent players from moving if they entered flat-footed movement while fighting on the inside.</li>



<li>On Xbox and PC Steam: Ranked quitters should now receive a loss on their record, and the remaining player should receive a win. The fix for PlayStation is taking longer than we’d like and will hopefully be part of the December update.&nbsp;</li>

None of the unused franchises were cut either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what's more, Astro Bot similarly featured franchises such as Stellar Blade in its credits before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-confirms-astro-bot-post-launch-speedrun-levels-and-special-bots-release-schedule">its protagonist Eve was added as a bot in the speedrunning DLC</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Astro Bot still includes licensing credits for Rayman, Worms, Assassin's Creed, Beyond Good &amp; Evil, Croc, and Tomba, the last of which was added today. Nothing official has been said about if these games will be featured eventually, or if more DLC is planned. The PS5 exclusive seems to have performed well both commercially and critically though, so Sony may want to push more DLC down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-exclusive-astro-bot-sells-15-million-in-2-months">Astro Bot sold 1.5 million units in its first two months</a> on sale and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">earned a 9/10 in IGN's review</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-blockbuster-games-bubble-has-burst.1036011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blockbuster-games-bubble-has-burst<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The video game industry is currently in the thralls of a paradox. For players, it could be argued we’re in one of the greatest times for gaming – there’s incredible breadth of choice across consoles, handhelds and PCs made ever-more accessible through gaming subscription services like Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus. But from an industry perspective, things could not be more dire. More and more studios seem to be closing, original IPs are being scrapped mid-development, and vast legions of game developers, programmers, artists, and animators have been cut loose. To put it simply: the AAA video game bubble has finally burst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the past two years, <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 23,000 jobs in the video game industry were lost</a>, with a staggering 6,000 in January 2024 alone. Over 30 video game development studios have ceased operations including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Arkane Austin</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saints-row-developer-volition-shut-down-by-embracer-group">Volition</a>, and most recently, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">Firewalk Studios</a>. What’s worse, this trend only shows signs of continuing rather than diminishing. How did we get here? Some analysts have concluded these closures and redundancies are a necessary remedy to companies having overextended themselves in response to inflated demand in the market during the COVID-19 pandemic. While that’s undeniably a factor, I believe the truth lies in other long-gestating issues within the AAA project bubble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just five years ago, AAA projects’ average budget ranged $50 - $150 million. Today, <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/465096/article/cma-discovers-video-game-budgets-are-ballooning-to-as-much-as-1-billion/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the minimum average is $200 million</a>. Call of Duty’s new benchmark is $300 million, with Activision admitting in the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/644939aa529eda000c3b0525/Microsoft_Activision_Final_Report_.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Competition &amp; Market Authority’s report</a> on AAA development that it now takes the efforts of one-and-a-half studios just to complete the annual Call of Duty title. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s far from just Call of Duty facing ballooning costs. In the same CMA report, an anonymous publisher admits that development costs for one of its franchises reached $660 million. With $550 million of marketing costs on top, that is a $1.2 billion game. To put that into perspective, Minecraft – the world’s best-selling video game of all time – has of last year only achieved $3 billion. It took 12 years to reach that figure, having launched in 2011.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The realities of these budgets mean entire publishing houses are massively overstretched and are now desperately facing the consequences: if their developers’ huge projects don’t make money immediately, they must die. Sega’s sci-fi shooter ‘super game’ Hyenas was in development at Creative Assembly for seven years, and – just as it was publicly playable for the first time via alpha testing – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-cancels-creative-assemblys-hyenas">it was cancelled</a>. The reason? Sega preemptively concluded Hyenas couldn’t make its money back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard’s survival project Odyssey had a similar trajectory. Odyssey would’ve been the studio’s first new IP in eight years and, given the market’s love for games like Minecraft and Rust, such a gaming titan should’ve undoubtedly made waves with this project. When Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, the project was swiftly killed with little reason publicly given beyond inconveniences in switching engines to increase player count on the servers. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The current AAA publishing cull reflects a deep-rooted fear to engage with anything new and original.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These examples of the current AAA publishing cull reflect a deep-rooted fear to engage with anything new and original, with publishers perhaps more risk-averse than ever to stray out of their established IP safety bars. But even <em>well-known</em> IP that could be worth millions in sales and revenue is being left to rot. Despite owning Infamous, Jak &amp; Daxter, Killzone, Resistance and Sly Cooper to name a few entries in PlayStations’s sprawling dormant library, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki recently claimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-doesnt-have-enough-original-franchises-built-from-the-ground-up-executive-says">the company lacks enough original IP to consolidate itself as a true gaming powerhouse</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Totoki may mean is that Sony’s older catalogue of library IP does not fit the mould of what every publisher has been mindlessly chasing for the better part of the decade – the next big live-service money printer. It’s difficult to imagine much fanfare for a Sly Cooper reboot where Bentley and Murray are purchase-to-play, grand heists are season pass bonuses and worlds are delivered half-baked instead of fully formed. It’s undeniable that on some level, the video game market <em>has</em> changed forever because of the live-service model. New video games don’t just have to compete with new rivals but somehow find space in an increasingly crowded market dominated by decade-old titles like Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto: Online –  games which will continue to hold higher player counts than many of the top-sold games of the last few years. But live-service titles require investment of not only money, but time to find their audience – neither of which was afforded to Firewalk Studios’ Concord.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/15/concordthumb-1723742937181.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The crew of Concord's Northstar will never fly again. Image credit: Sony / Firewalk Studios.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The recent fate of Concord’s Firewalk Studios serves as a microcosm for the increasingly bleak outlook for the next few years in video game development. Concord was Firewalk’s first game, its baby in many ways. An eight-year development bolstered by a Sony acquisition (with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concords-initial-development-deal-was-200-million-but-it-wound-up-costing-sony-much-more-report">reported cash injection of $200 million plus</a>), PlayStation reportedly believed it had the next Star Wars-esque franchise on its hands. But the game struggled significantly across both its beta testing period and launch, and was soon completely shut down by Sony, with Firewalk closed for business shortly after. Concord’s downfall happened faster than any other failed game of the live-service era. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a decade earlier, though, a similar disaster was plaguing Blizzard’s Diablo 3 – the crippling ‘Error 37’ message made the game unplayable and fans worldwide decried the absolute failure to launch. Soon after, the game’s real-money auction house left players with a foul taste in their mouth and Diablo 3’s reputation was roasting in the fires. But rather than abandoning it, Blizzard not only repaired the game and removed the Auction House, but fundamentally upgraded and evolved it to Diablo 3 2.0 with its Reaper of Souls expansion, finally cementing its comeback as a brilliant game. It’s a similar story we’ve seen with CD Projekt Red’s hard-fought battle to win Cyberpunk 2077 fans back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the alleged $200 million + budget had been lowered, the project direction refocused as a spark for a new universe rather than a Big Bang, it doesn’t seem hard to believe that Concord may have found its audience with some Blizzard or CDPR-like shepherding from Sony. Many projects akin to Concord could be the medium-size successes they deserve to be, if not for the financial corners these publishers have found themselves backed into.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If everything is ‘bigger and bolder’, who possibly has the time to play more than one or two games each year?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not that such financial corners are anything publishers should always attempt to navigate. Gamers are beginning to wane interest in these monolithic projects. You need only look at a top rated games of 2024 list – whereas 2023 award lists were littered with AAA titles from 500-strong studios, 2024’s show a revitalised hunger for a smaller, more independent spirit. Arcade machine throwback UFO 50, the Metroidvania-esque Animal Well, poker roguelite Balatro, and text-based pixel-art adventure The Crimson Diamond are just some of the games you’ll see appearing again and again on these lists. Despite their numerous differences, they share a commonality – a smaller, more refined experience that recalls earlier eras of gaming where marriages of mechanics and storytelling were key through technological craftiness, rather than literal country-sized game worlds. The nostalgia they create for older video game generations are central to the heart of their creation: they just want you to pick them up and have a good time now and again. The slow but increasingly clear pivot of video game audiences to a potential indie game renaissance is a clear message to publishers that if <em>everything</em> is ‘bigger and bolder’, who possibly has the time to play more than one or two games each year?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to undercut the difficulty in getting those independent titles made. UFO 50’s Mossmouth LLC team consisted of six developers working over many years, while both Animal Well and The Crimson Diamond share similar stories of being crafted by solo developers - Billy Basso and Julia Minamata, respectively – over several years. Even a smash-hit like Lethal Company started life as one-man-band developer Zeekerss learning to develop games on Roblox before expanding his knowledge. All of these developers put <em>everything</em> they had over several years of their lives into creating these games – not in pursuit of money, but because of a <em>passion</em>. That’s why they don’t need humongous worlds or 300+ side-quests to tick off – these games all feel like lean enjoyment machines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It feels like the top-end of the video game industry is currently faced with two paths to choose from. The first is the status quo; it can continue to engorge on bigger budgets with impossibly-open-yet-incredibly-empty worlds filled with 80+ hours of content that has about 10 hours of meaning to its players, or hopelessly pursue the live-service train which left the station over 5 years ago, with late passengers wondering why the money isn’t rolling anymore. These billion-dollar gambles <em>could</em> pay off, but it’s becoming less and less likely. Or, they could opt for the second path and take a page out of Julia Minamata, Billy Basso and Zeekerss’ books – a wider breadth of projects, smaller in scope and scale with a refined focus on gameplay mechanics, and perhaps a return to older styles of video games long-dormant. Projects where developers aren’t afraid to take weirder choices and unexpected left-turns lest they crash their $400 million ship into a ‘mixed-to-decent’ initial reception. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe studios can remember that we used to play video games because they were fun – not because of their bigger-than-last-year maps carpeted by denser, higher-resolution grass that you walk across to finish another piece of side content that pushes you one digit closer to 100% completion.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It shows the entire squad of four players (rather than the top three performing players on the winning team in Black Ops 6), and lets players select from the emotes now shared across both games.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1857080766221455464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, IGN reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-players-rotate-between-wanting-to-skip-the-winners-circle-and-liking-it-because-it-gives-them-time-to-check-their-phone-between-matches">how Black Ops 6 players were rotating between wanting to skip the Winner's Circle and liking it because it gives them time to check their phone between matches</a>.

As Fares pointed out, there haven't been any announcements, call for nominations, or application process rolled out for a Future Class of 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So is the Future Class program wrapped up? No, but it does not seem there will be any honorees at this year's ceremony. In a statement to Game Developer, Future Class organizer Emily Bouchac explained that the organization is "currently focused on providing value to [its] existing class in and around TGA this year," adding that the organization will "evaluate next steps for the program after this year's show."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bouchac did not explicitly confirm or deny if there would be a 2024 Future Class cohort.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Game Awards </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-game-awards-future-class-highlights-50-people-shaping-the-future-of-the-game-industry">began recognizing</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the Future Class of game developers and advocates who represent "a diverse group of builders, thinkers and dreamers whose voices elevate and diversify the artform of gaming and whose passion makes the industry stronger" starting in 2020.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-game-awards-future-class-highlights-50-people-shaping-the-future-of-the-game-industry" target="_self">The Game Awards' Future Class highlights 50 people shaping the future of the game industry</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Inductees have been recognized annually in an onstage ceremony, with some spotlighted in video segments sponsored by companies like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/dT2t3gJcBiI?si=7-7hryrsJC0Excur">Old Spice</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Outside of the ceremony, they were also promised resources and networking opportunities with each other and prominent developers in the game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But with no Future Class of 2024 in sight, its participants are left wondering where the celebration has gone—and what does it mean for the kinds of developers it promised to help?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Is The Game Awards actually helping its Future Class alumni?">Is The Game Awards actually helping its Future Class alumni?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When Fares first pointed out the absence of news about the Future Class, some speculated that the silence had something to do with last year's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/future-class-members-call-game-awards-silence-a-collective-disappointment-">protest</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Future Class alumni and members about The Game Awards' decision to not make any statement about Israel's invasion of Gaza after the October 7 attack by Hamas. Future Class alumni had called on the Awards to plea for a ceasefire. Keighley and his cohosts did not acknowledge the conflict during the broadcast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That doesn't seem to be the case. The lack of a 2024 Future Class may have to do with another lesser-known protest about the program that hasn't risen to the public eye: one pleading with the organization to do more for Future Class inductees and alumni.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a meeting with Geoff Keighley and Bouchac in December 2023, members reportedly gave a presentation on how they've felt underserved by an initiative meant to celebrate the "bright future" of the video game industry. The presentation discussed inadequate accommodations at the awards ceremony and a lack of opportunities for alumni after the spotlights faded away.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources familiar with the online meeting (who requested anonymity to speak freely to protect their careers) said Keighley and Bouchac were receptive to feedback, and seemed interested in improving the program.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A copy of the presentation reviewed by Game Developer spelled out the specific complaints raised by inductees, and proposed a number of possible solutions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A large segment of the presentation addressed what seemed to be a negative experience for Future Class inductees and alumni attending the award ceremony in Los Angeles. Attendee ADA requests at last year's event allegedly weren't "honored," meaning some members with disabilities struggled to see the show. Alumni were apparently seated in segments of the Microsoft Theater where the view was blocked by camera rigs and equipment (those affected were reimbursed by The Game Awards for their tickets), and the only official networking event was a surprisingly informal "meetup" before the ceremony where Game Awards representatives only briefly attended, reportedly departing after photos were taken. The presentation alleges that Keighley did not make a personal appearance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Members raised the fact that though the Future Class segment is sponsored by advertisers, there is no funding for them to travel to the event, leaving some honorees to watch at home. They also expressed disappointment over the lack of diversity among presenters onstage, such as the accessibility award not being revealed by a disabled presenter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Complaints were also raised about the lack of compensation for Future Class alumni who labor for the organization by mentoring new members, but weren't offered tickets to the awards themselves as part of their work. They're only offered a discount for purchasing their own tickets which according to ticketing site AXS, run anywhere from $50 to $500.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Presenters speaking to Keighley and Bouchac apparently expressed concern over the quality of support and resources offered to Future Class inductees after the the Game Awards spotlight fades. These resources include Unreal and Unity workshops, unpaid mentoring by previous Future Class nominees, and a slim amount of other opportunities. International inductees faced additional hurdles, as online events would sometimes be held in conflicting time zones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked about the presentation, Bouchac told Game Developer that the Future Class program regularly seeks feedback from inductees, and that while there is "always room to improve," a summer survey of participants showed the initiative and its benefits "improved" in 2024, with almost all saying the program was delivering on what it promised at the outset in January.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One-fifth of the 2023 class [ranked] the program as a 10/10 experience," she said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Future Class is providing extra support to members of the 2023 cohort">The Future Class is providing extra support to members of the 2023 cohort</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple Future Class inductees we spoke with praised the work the organization has done in the last year after the presentation. They explained the new resources and connections with industry veterans felt helpful—though there may still be some improvements to be made. "It did genuinely seem like they were trying to take the feedback into account," one 2023 cohort member explained, praising the survey described by Bouchac.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This individual's only complaint had to do with how The Game Awards has celebrated Future Class members this year on social media. A well-intentioned series of celebratory posts on X (formerly Twitter) were regularly mobbed by users spreading harassment. This followed the site's increasingly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/06/inside-elon-musk-x-twitter-austin-content-moderation/">lax approach to content moderation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-are-valve-and-discord-permitting-harassment-against-sweet-baby-inc-">a growing right-wing backlash</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to efforts at promoting diversity in games that exploded earlier in 2024. The Game Awards has since restricted replies on these posts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Future Class organizers apparently responded quickly to concerns raised by alumni over a lack of mentorship opportunities. Earlier in the year, they established a new networking program to support Future Class members and connect them with industry peers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some Future Class inductees have apparently greatly benefitted from this initiative, but others have reportedly had lackluster experiences, leaving them with just a few meetings with developers sometimes not skilled in mentoring junior developers. One source who participated in the mentorship process said they were frustrated by its limited structure, and that it wasn't as robust as those run by other professional organizations, like Academy of Interactive Arts and Science's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.aiasfoundation.org/news/2024-2025_scholarships_open.asp">Scholarship program</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple sources also confirmed to Game Developer that The Game Awards is hosting a two-hour "connections mixer" before this year's ceremony with industry professionals and Future Class members from the 2023 cohort, but it's not branded as a Future Class-focused event. 2023 inductees have also been offered free tickets to this year's show and a compensated hotel room. These accommodations for members of last year's cohort appear to be a significant change from what was offered before.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A 2023 class member told Game Developer they've appreciated the resources offered this year (praising "the free tickets, industry talks, and promotional opportunities") but offered a slightly cynical view of the program's mission. "I know this whole thing is just to launder The Game Awards' reputation so it doesn't look as disgustingly corporate as it is," they said. "But if they're taking advantage of me I at least like that I'm also taking advantage of them."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond the mentorship program and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://tgafutureclass.medium.com/">a Substack newsletter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> maintained by Future Class alumni, there seems to have been little communication from The Game Awards about the future of Future Class. Bouchac's response to Game Developer implies the program is still active, but she didn't directly state if a new class of inductees would be introduced at this year's ceremony.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The concerns expressed by Future Class alumni in 2023 and the ensuing slim communication raise uncomfortable questions about the program. Is The Game Awards offering enough support to the Future Class organizers in order to support the diverse group of rising developers inducted into the program?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now it appears the answer will have to wait until 2025.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p>
The Anti-Defamation League has accused Valve of "allowing the proliferation of hate", after publishing a report finding over 1.8m instances of extremist or hateful content - including Nazi imagery and support for foreign terrorist organisations - on Steam.
</p>
<p>
The Anti-Defamation League - which describes itself as the "leading anti-hate organisation in the world" - shared its findings in a <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism">report published on its website</a>, after conducting an "unprecedented, platform-wide" analysis of Steam. This is said to have spanned over 458m user profiles, 152m profile and group avatar images, plus more than 610m comments on user profiles and groups, with the ADL's Centre on Extremism saying it ultimately identified 1.83m unique pieces of extremist or hateful content.
</p>
<p>
Examples given include explicitly antisemitic symbols and copypasta, white supremacist copypasta, Nazi imagery - such as the swastika or Totenkopf - plus "tens of thousands of instances of users expressing support for foreign terrorist organisations like Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Hamas and others". The ADL also claimed to have found 184,622 keywords on Steam used in an extremist or hateful context - including "1488", "shekel", and "white power" - adding that 1.5m unique users and 73,824 groups had shared at least one example of potentially extremist or hateful content.
</p>
<p>
The organisation went onto claim Steam has no public-facing content policies specifically linked to hate or extremism. However, a quick search reveals Valve's <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding#5">developer</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/0/4337599680247610574/">community</a> guidelines do, in fact, explicitly prohibit hate speech, specifically "speech that promotes hatred, violence or discrimination against groups of people based on ethnicity, religion, gender, age, disability or sexual orientation".
</p><p>
That, then, raises questions around Valve's enforcement of its policies, as the ADL highlighted elsewhere in its report: "The fact that extremist and hateful content is relatively easy to locate on Steam, raises questions regarding the efficacy of Steam's moderation efforts." It noted, for instance, that while Valve deploys filters and other forms of automated content moderation on user summaries and comments, these do not apply to all user-generated fields - and filters can manually be disabled. Additionally, the ADL called Steam's keyword detection "easy to evade", noting altered words and ASCII art can be used to circumvent Valve's moderation tools.
</p>
<p>
"While Steam appears to be technically capable of moderating extremist and hateful content on its platform," the ADL continued, "the spread of extremist content on the platform is due in part to Valve's highly permissive approach to content policy. In rare notable cases, Steam has selectively removed extremist content, largely based around extremist groups publicised in reporting or in response to governmental pressure. However, this has been largely ad hoc, with Valve failing to systematically address the issue of extremism and hate on the platform."
</p>
<p>
"Valve needs to make significant changes to their approach to platform governance," the ADL concluded, "both in terms of policy and practice to address the ways in which hate and extremism have proliferated on the Steam platform." It finished by urging Valve to adopt policies prohibiting extremism and hate, to audit and "Red Team" content moderation practices to close loopholes, and to engage with civil society, academics, and researchers. More, including recommendations for policymakers, can be found in the <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism">full report</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Major gaming companies are selling their wares on a platform that is not addressing users' support of extremists and allowing the proliferation of hate," Daniel Kelley, director of strategy and operations at ADL's Centre for Technology &amp; Society, added in an interview <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-14/white-supremacist-nazi-content-spread-on-steam-gaming-platform?srnd=undefined">shared by Bloomberg</a>. This, he continued, "increases the likelihood that someone will travel all the way down the rabbit hole." Eurogamer has asked Valve for comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-update-teases-surprising-bonus-cameo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Hit PlayStation platformer Astro Bot looks set to add another game cameo to its ranks. 
</p>
<p>
Eagle-eyed Astro Bot fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gqsy21/a_new_thirdparty_character_credit_was_added_to/">reddit</a> have spotted a fresh tweak to the game's credits as of its latest patch, which now reference the inclusion of content from Tomba! Special Edition.
</p>
<p>
There's no sign of Tomba himself or the series' pig villains in Astro Bot yet, but its credits already point to the game getting further updates in the future with other extra characters.
</p>
<p>
This year's Tomba! Special Edition updated the 1997 classic PS1 platform adventure, originally published by PlayStation, for a fresh audience on PS5. It's been more than two decades since Tomba! 2 arrived to middling sales, but the franchise has continued to develop a cult following since.
</p><p>
Other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-credits-hint-at-unseen-cameos-potentially-in-forthcoming-free-dlc">mentions in Astro Bot credits already mention a range of franchises yet to appear </a>, including Ubisoft series such as Assassin's Creed, Rayman and Beyond Good &amp; Evil, plus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/team17">Team17</a>'s Worms and Croc: Legend of the Gobbos - which, like Tomba, also got a remaster this year.
</p>
<p>Still other characters have been glipmsed in concept art, but haven't yet appeared in the game - including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fat-princess">Fat Princess</a>, and Sweet Tooth from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/twisted-metal">Twisted Metal</a>.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Astrobot/comments/1gl7b6d/this_pleases_chop/">This pleases Chop...</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AssanCHOP/">u/AssanCHOP</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Astrobot/">Astrobot</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Astro Bot received a warm reception from critics and fans alike when the dinky platformer dropped on PS5 back in September. Since then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">more than 1.5m copies</a> have been sold.</p>
<p>
"Sony's glossy mascot gets an outing filled with imagination and loving craft," Chris Donlan wrote, awarding it top marks in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review">Eurogamer's Astro Bot review</a>.
