          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> No Man's Sky Switch 2 Edition Deep Dive Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"With the original Switch, we were pushing right at the edge of what was possible," explains Hello Games co-founder Sean Murray in the video. "No Man's Sky on Switch 2 is just a huge leap forward. The extra horsepower, it allows us to add full multiplayer for the first time on Switch 2. Cross save and cross play are there from day one, allowing players a seamless experience across devices."</p><p>The Switch 2 Edition is launching at the same time as No Man's Sky's latest free update, Beacon. One of the new additions in Beacon is the creation of robot cities, which Murray notes would have been impossible with the original Switch. He also noted that the Switch 2 version is launching with nine years of No Man's Sky updates and support.</p><p>Players who already have No Man's Sky for Switch can get the Switch 2 upgrade for free. That's unusual because every other Switch 2 Edition has been a paid upgrade. However, some games are getting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-switch-games-and-updates-from-todays-nintendo-direct-available-now/1100-6524364/" data-ref-id="1100-6524364">free Switch 2 updates</a>.</p><p>No Man's Sky Switch 2 Edition will be released on June 5 as one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">launch titles for Nintendo's new system</a>. The previous No Man's Sky update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-mans-sky-relics-update-lets-you-build-skeletons-from-ancient-bones-however-you-wish/1100-6530383/" data-ref-id="1100-6530383">Relics</a>, allows players to reconstruct skeletons and create unique species from archeological fossil beds. Hello Games added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-mans-sky-finally-has-a-cross-save-feature-with-latest-patch/1100-6527633/" data-ref-id="1100-6527633">cross-save functionality</a> to the game late last year.</p>

                <p>The original Nintendo Switch has long been a popular way to play Fortnite, but the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2's beefier specs</a> will bring the battle royale experience more in line with how it looks and feels on other platforms, with a frame rate and resolution boost at launch, and the promise of mouse controls coming in a later update.</p><p>Epic Games shared details about the Switch 2 version on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-comes-to-nintendo-switch-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Fortnite blog</a>, detailing the major improvements that players will experience after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">upgrading to the new console</a>. Unsurprisingly, the most significant enhancement is to the game's frame rate--Fortnite will run at 60fps on Switch 2, whereas the game was stuck at 30fps on the original Switch.</p><p>Resolution will also get a major boost, going to 2176x1224 docked and 1600x900 undocked. The Switch 1 version of Fortnite ran at 1560x880 docked and 1170x660 in handheld mode after a 2021 update. Additionally, the Switch 2 iteration of the game will sport "greater view distances," along with higher-quality textures, shadows, and water rendering.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4506873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4506873"></a><figcaption>Fortnite on Nintendo Switch 2 boasts 60fps gameplay, better draw distance, and increased resolution.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>Unlike the Switch 1 version, this release supports the game's Replay system and the console's Capture button. Like many multiplayer titles that will be on Switch 2, Fortnite will support the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-feels-better-than-it-looks/1100-6532016/" data-ref-id="1100-6532016">GameChat feature</a>, allowing players to stream their gameplay to three other friends.</p><p>After a patch drops on June 7, players can use one or both of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/" data-ref-id="2900-6517">Joy-Con 2 controllers as a mouse</a> in menus and battle royale gameplay--Epic did not list Lego Fortnite, Fortnite Festival, or other non-BR game modes as supporting mouse controls. The only glaring omission on Switch 2 is the Save the World game mode, which was also not purchasable on the original Switch version of Fortnite.</p><p>If Switch 1 owners transfer their data to a Switch 2, they'll have to delete the original "Fortnite for Nintendo Switch" from their console and download the Switch 2 version on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-eshop-looks-so-much-smoother-at-least-so-far/1100-6532069/" data-ref-id="1100-6532069">the reportedly more responsive Nintendo eShop</a>.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> might still be lacking an early access release date beyond a vague "2025" window, but that hasn't stopped Unknown Worlds from cranking the hype handling a little harder, with the studio having now shared a few additional details as part of a new video Q&amp;A.
</p>
<p>
Last time around, Unknown Worlds offered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">first, fleeting look at Subnautica 2 gameplay</a>, but for its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbvNYN76ArQ">latest video update</a>, creative producer Scott MacDonald and community manager Donya Abramo tackled a couple of burning fan questions. Admittedly, most of them ended with 'not yet', 'maybe at some point', and 'no', but there were still a couple of facts to glean.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most notable tidbit came in form of confirmation that Subnautica 2 will ditch the controversially chatty protagonist of 2021's standalone expansion Below Zero and return to the silent protagonist approach of the first game, although that doesn't mean other characters won't be voiced. The decision accompanies the introduction of customisable characters, with players able to select from a handful of pre-designed protagonists before diving in. Unknown Worlds notes there'll potentially be some further "freedom to express yourself as your character", but whatever that means, it won't be util after early access launch.

<p>
As for the world of Subnautica 2, it's set on a brand-new ocean planet promising "all-new mysteries, creatures, and experiences", and Unknown Worlds says it's aiming for the game to be the "biggest and most exciting" series entry "ever" when it hits 1.0 in a few years time. It isn't, however, exactly sure "how big and how deep [players will] be able to go over the course of early access", but says the initial early access launch map will be more sizeable than those of the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> and Below Zero at a comparative time.
</p>
<p>
And a vast new underwater world to explore means vehicles. Unfortunately for fans of the Cyclops, Seamoth, and even the Sea Truck seen in earlier games, none of those are returning for the sequel. However, Unknown Worlds says new vehicles are coming - including a big sub scheduled to arrive later in early access - that'll be "designed in the same spirit [as their predecessors], just more suited to the brand-new environment they need to navigate". Additionally, "some of your favourite tools [will return], but improved", and base building is set to offer "more customisation than ever before".
</p>
<p>
What else? The studio stresses that, despite supporting co-op for up to four players, Subnautica 2 is being designed as a solo experience first. That means it should retain the sense of "isolation and terror" that made the original such a winner, although the studio readily admits it "won't really be able to protect" that atmosphere if players opt to bring friends along for the ride. Sadly, there's no local split-screen option for those wanting to cuddlefish up on the couch, but cross-play is supported between Xbox and PC platforms, and as for proximity chat, that's currently being 'investigated'. VR support isn't on the cards at present, however.
</p>
<p>
And all of that brings us back to the big question of a release date, but Unknown Words says it's "not quite ready to share one just yet". Nor is it talking platforms beyond PC and Xbox, only teasing Subnautica 2 will hit other machines "when the time is right". It is, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-gets-first-trailer-and-its-launching-into-early-access-next-year">still scheduled for a 2025 release</a>, and will be available as part of Game Pass on day one.

			<p>Another video game to film adaptation has been announced, and this time it's horror movie powerhouse production company Blumhouse announcing that it is collaborating with Kinetic Games to make a Phasmophobia movie.</p>
<p>The news was announced with a<a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-film-adaptation-blumhouse"> blog post from Kinetic Games</a>, with the studio's director Daniel Knight saying he is "<em>thrilled</em>" for Kinetic Games to be working with Blumhouse and James Wan's production company, Atomic Monster, on this project.</p>
<p>"<em>We're thrilled to officially announce that a Phasomphobia film adaptation is in development - it's a big moment for the whole Kinetic team, and the start of something really exciting</em>," said Knight.</p>
<p>"<em>We never could've imagined the incredible heights this game would reach when it launched five years ago, and we're so thankful to our amazing community for the lasting impact Phasmophobia has had in the gaming space and beyond. Working with Blumhouse and Atomic Monster marks an incredible new chapter for the game, and we can't wait to share more as the project develops</em>."</p>
<p>No directors, writers, or cast members have been attached to the film so far, but in the same way that <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-announces-project-007-officially-called-007-first-light-full-game-reveal-coming-this-week/">IO Interactive making a James Bond game is a match made in heaven</a>, so is Blumhouse and Atomic Monster taking on any film adaptation of a horror video game, including Phasmophobia. Hopefully, we'll hear more about the film soon.</p>

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/679077/epic-games-fortnite-creators-ai-npcs-darth-vader"><em>Fortnite</em></a> is coming to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676901/nintendo-switch-2-launch-here">the Switch 2</a> with some massive visual improvements and new features that are going to make it feel like a new game for the Nintendo crowd.</p><p>While we knew that <em>Fortnite </em>would be playable on the Switch 2 at launch, today <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-comes-to-nintendo-switch-2">Epic announced</a> all of the new features that are being incorporated into the game via an update. After years of maxing out at 30 fps on the original Switch, <em>Fortnite </em>will now run at 60fps on the Switch 2. The game is also getting a resolution bump to 2176x1224 when docked and 1600x900 when undocked (up from 1560x880 docked / 1170x660 undocked). Draw distance, textures, shadows, and water rendering are also getting an overall quality boost that will make the game more crisp.</p><p>And on the newer side of things, <em>Fortnite </em>is also launching support for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">the Switch 2’s GameChat feature</a> as well as support for the console’s Joy-Con 2 mouse controls. While Epic has already pushed the <em>Fortnite </em>update for folks who have gotten their hands on the Switch, support for mouse controls — which work in Battle Royale, Zero Build, Team Rumble, Reload, and Fortnite OG — isn’t set to launch until June 7th. June 7th also just so happens to be the day when <em>Fortnite</em>’s ongoing <em>Star Wars</em>-themed season comes to an end with the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/death-star-sabotage-on-june-7-the-fortnite-live-event-concluding-galactic-battle">Death Star Sabotage live</a> event, which is probably going to look at lot better on the Switch 2 compared to its predecessor.</p><p>All of this might not seem too special to people who have been playing <em>Fortnite </em>on other consoles, but it truly cannot be stressed enough how <em>not great </em>the game has looked on the Switch in the past. Mouse controls aside, these updates might not change gameplay all that much, but they’re going to make squadding up a much, much more enjoyable experience.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That download turned out to be the first chapter of a new game, Deltarune, the name of which is an anagram for Undertale. After a cryptic introduction, the player controls a teenager named Kris who, with their school bully Susie, is dropped into a mysterious Dark World and tasked with saving its citizens by a goat-child named Ralsei.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapter-2-release-date-this-week-pc-mac">second chapter manifested in 2021</a>, revealing something like an adventure-of-the-week format where Kris and Susie repeatedly visit the Dark World in each chapter, meet a new villain, defeat them alongside Ralsei, and return home. In total, the game is expected to have at least seven total chapters, and we've known three and four were coming today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-launching-alongside-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-june">since Fox announced it in April.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune, like Undertale, is a turn-based RPG with bullet hell mechanics, and features a cast of both new and returning characters from its predecessor. However, its connection to Undertale itself is mysterious — the characters themselves have key differences from their Undertale versions, no one seems aware of the events of Undertale, and yet the game frequently winks and nods to Undertale's events in a way that players of both will recognize, even if its in-universe cast doesn't.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the game itself is beloved for its zany humor, lovable characters, unique combat, and fantastic soundtrack, much of what fuels the nearly-rabid online interest is related to the mystery of what, precisely, Deltarune <em>is</em>, and how it will ultimately connect with or solve some of the latent mysteries of Undertale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this writing, Deltarune already has over 100,000 players on Steam and is the 10th most-played game on Valve's platform. It's already surpassed the peak Steam player count of the free Deltarune Chapter 1 and 2 demo, despite costing $25. It's the top-selling game on Steam right now by revenue, ahead of the likes of Counter-Strike 2, Elden Ring: Nightreign, and Dune: Awakening. But its true popularity will be much bigger, given Deltarune is also out on PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series consoles now, and its Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 versions launch tonight at midnight when the Switch 2 officially releases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <p>The not-E3 week is about to begin as Sony readies a PlayStation State of Play broadcast for 10pm UK time (11pm CEST / 2pm PT / 5pm ET) tonight. We'll cover the broadcast live right here, reporting the major talking points in case you're out walking the dog or stuck somewhere else, and you can also - hi regulars! - assemble in the comments to watch along and chat with us.</p>
<p>What do we expect to see? Sony hasn't said much. We know the broadcast will be an enigmatic "40+" minutes long, but Sony hasn't mentioned anything about content beyond "the show highlights a selection of great games from creators across the globe", which isn't very helpful. But it does leave us free to speculate.</p>
<p>Fairly safe bets include seeing gameplay for the October-bound samurai sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, as well as something from Kojima's baby-powered walking game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, although note that there will be a separate Death Stranding 2 showcase this Sunday, 8th June.</p>
<p>We're hopeful of seeing more of the Wolverine game made by Spider-Man dev Insomniac, we've seen some rumours swirling about a possible 2.5D God of War game, and there are the perennial calls for a remake of Bloodborne. Will our dreams finally come true?</p>
<p>Also, Donlan would like a new Ape Escape game. Thanks.</p>
<p>Summer Games Fest gets into full swing as we approach the weekend. The opening broadcast will happen on Friday night and there's a busy weekend of shows to follow. Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Games Fest 2025 hub</a> has all the times and dates you'll need.</p><figure>

			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-mmorpg-to-hold-limited-time-steam-cbt-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first PC Closed Beta Test</a> for the upcoming fantasy MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-dev-diary-provides-the-first-in-depth-look-at-its-features-and-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrono Odyssey</a>, we were able to send a few questions to Chrono Studio to learn a bit more about the game's features. You can read the entirety of the interview below. As a reminder, the CBT will take place later this month, and you can still sign up for it directly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2873440/Chrono_Odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>The game does not have a full release date yet, but we know it will be available on PC and consoles.</p>

<p><strong>As far as we can see, the game's main twist is the Chronotector. What can you tell us about its concept and usage in the game? Will it be available in PvP, too?</strong></p>
<p>The Chronotector allows players to manipulate time and space—slowing down enemies or reverting parts of the environment to a previous state. While its use is partially restricted in PvP to maintain fairness, it still plays a key role in strategic map control and as a tactical tool for escape or repositioning.</p>
<p><strong>Can you discuss character progression in Chrono Odyssey? Will there be skill trees, respeccing? What about multi-classing?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we offer a detailed skill tree along with the ability to respec skills. While Chrono Odyssey does not feature a full multiclass system, players can freely switch between various weapon types, each supporting distinct playstyles. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and personalization in how players approach combat.</p>
<p><strong>How many weapons will be available in the beta? And what about the final game? Are there any class restrictions?</strong></p>
<p>In the beta, three classes will be available, and each class can wield three different weapon types. Weapons are designed to be freely chosen by the player, allowing for the development of hybrid playstyles that suit individual preferences and strategies.</p>
<p><strong>What can you tell us about Chrono Odyssey's open world? Are there any dynamic events that will freshen up the experience?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. The world of Setera features dynamic weather, time-based events, and region-specific bosses that appear depending on player activity and the in-game time cycle. Even when exploring the same area, players will encounter different experiences depending on the circumstances, ensuring that the world always feels alive and ever-changing.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share how group dungeons and PvE raids will work in the game? Are these staples of your PvE endgame plan?</strong></p>
<p>Dungeons and raids are core components of Chrono Odyssey’s PvE content. Designed as endgame challenges, they feature intense boss battles and offer some of the most rewarding progression-based loot. These encounters demand strategic cooperation, making them a central part of the game's long-term experience.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of PvP content can players expect to see in Chrono Odyssey?</strong></p>
<p>In this CBT, the available PvP content will be limited to 1v1 duels initiated by player choice and open-field PvP between characters who have enabled PvP mode. However, we are actively developing additional PvP-focused features, including open conflict zones and PvPvE battlefield content where players will compete over specific objectives while also contending with environmental threats. We look forward to introducing these features through our official channels in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to have several Closed Beta Tests before the full launch? If so, will there be a long wait between CBTs?</strong></p>
<p>We plan to conduct multiple closed beta tests, with each CBT followed by meaningful improvements and content updates. Our goal is to gather valuable feedback at every stage and steadily refine the game to deliver the best possible experience at launch.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <p>A game that sees you forcibly kidnapped, smuggled aboard a mega yacht dubbed The Avarice, and made to play demon billionaires at lethal dice poker just got a new trailer, and it looks as funky as you’d expect. Dead Finger Dice: A Billionaire Killing Game is its uber-snappy name, and it’s coming to Steam this summer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spooky-cyberpunk-mystery-psychroma-looks-like-detention-meets-observer">Psychroma</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/raptor-boyfriend-is-a-rare-coming-of-age-story-that-actually-respects-teenagers">Raptor Boyfriend</a> developers Rocket Adrift Games released a trailer for this roguelike dice builder as part of yesterday’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyRhu8kWv2E">The Mix showcase</a>, and as soon as I clapped my eyes on it, I was intrigued.</p>

<p>The big boat of these bad money creatures is rendered in a “grungy 1-bit aesthetic”. Aboard, you’ll be treated to an experience that looks quite <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>-ish except with dice instead of cards, and a lot more severing of fingers. Yep, you bet one of your digits each round, and if your five dice don’t boast the highest poker hand after three re-rolls, the demon billionaire you’re playing against gets to chuckle as you lose an appendage.</p>
<p>The first of you to be separated from all of your feelers loses the game and suffers a lethal punishment. In your case, being lobbed overboard in what’s a rather wet end to that particular run. Every failed run adds to the game’s “body count”, and you play as a new character every time, though with an option to pass useful items between runs via the “hidden compartment of your cell”.</p>
<p>You’ll need to craft custom dice with “demonically sealed special abilities” using your poker winnings as you strive to beat the game’s five bosses, as well as making use of charms and curses you unlock.</p>
<p>Also, Dead Finger Dice’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3512300/Dead_Finger_Dice_A_Billionaire_Killing_Game/">Steam page</a> notes that it features “class consciousness”, a “revolutionary body count”, and is “completely human-made” via its developers’ own fingers. Cool, the Che Guevara of deck builders that use dice. It’s got me convinced, even if I’ve spent about 6 million less hours with Balatro than most other people seem to have.</p>
<p>Hey, I’ve had fun with what I have played of it, don’t come for me joker mafia. Dead Finger Dice is set to drop on on Steam in Summer 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Epic says if you do a console transfer from Switch to Switch 2, you’ll need to delete the old port of <em>Fortnite</em>, download the new version, and log in. Then all your skins and goodies should be waiting for you. </p><p>Epic also says that <em>Fortnite </em>will support mouse controls on Switch 2 via the console’s advanced Joy-Cons. All modes in <em>Fortnite</em>, including Battle Royale, will support mouse controls on Switch 2. The new port works with the Switch 2's capture button and GameChat system, letting you stream your game while chatting with friends.</p><p>And for you super nerds out there, like myself, Epic shared a few more techy details about the new port: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>For the hardcore tech folks: full “desktop” renderer, high-detail geometry, distance field ambient occlusion in docked mode, shadow casting point lights, high-quality effects.</p></blockquote><p>All in all, it seems like the Switch 2 port of <em>Fortnite </em>will be a comparable experience to playing on PS4 Pro or Xbox Series S, though it won’t be as graphically advanced as the PS5, PS5 Pro, PC, or Xbox Series X ports of the popular game. Still, it’s nice that Nintendo players will have a better way to play <em>Fortnite </em>in the near future, assuming they can get their hands on a Switch 2 when it launches on June 5. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Epic Games has confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is upgraded on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> to include 60FPS support, higher resolution graphics, greater view distances and more. This will be available from tomorow, 5th June - the same day the Switch 2 launches.</p>
<p>This comes via a fresh news post <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-comes-to-nintendo-switch-2">on the Fortnite website</a>, which lists out all the improvements coming to the game for those able to get their hands on the shiny new console. The full list can be found below:</p>
<ul>
<li>60 FPS</li>
<li>Higher resolution (2176x1224 docked, 1600x900 undocked)</li>
<li>Greater view distances </li>
<li>Higher-quality textures, higher-quality shadows, and higher-quality water rendering</li>
<li>Clothing physics enabled</li>
<li>A replay system</li>
<li>Capture video clips using the Capture button</li>
<li>GameChat supported, allows you to stream your gameplay with up to three other friends.</li>
<li>Full "desktop" renderer, high-detail geometry, distance field ambient occlusion in docked mode, shadow casting point lights, high-quality effects</li>

<p>Using the mouse controls, the standard analogue stick will be disabled as players use both joycons to play the game and navigate the UI. Players will be able to choose in the settings whether or not they prefer to use the left, right, or both Joycons to play via dedicated control schemes.</p>
<p>For those who log on to Fortnite on the Nintendo Switch 2 before 31st March, 2026, a free emote will be their prize. This Wishing Star emote is exclusive to Switch 2 players for now, though Epic does note that the emote may be sold in the store following the March 2026 cutoff.</p>
<p>Epic also confirms in a FAQ that the Nintendo Switch pro controller will be usable when playing Fortnite on the Switch 2, and those who already linked their Epic and Nintendo accounts will not have to redo the process on the new console.</p>
<p>As a final note, the Save The World game within Fortnite is the only unavailable experience on the Switch 2 version, everything else is playable. Save The World, for those unaware, is the PvE Co-Op building game that first came out in Early Access in 2017,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-save-the-world-mode-will-no-longer-go-free-to-play-this-year"> before getting a full release in 2020</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/04/corsair-void-wireless-v2-gaming-headset-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Corsair make a whole heap of peripherals. From PC cases with RGB lighting to keyboards with RGB lighting, and even headsets… with RGB lighting. What I’m saying is, they have a thing for rainbow light effects, and with their brand-new Void Wireless V2 headset, that trend is set to continue.</p>
<p>Corsair’s headsets have their own distinctive design language, eschewing ovals, circles and rectangles in favour of less regular rounded trapeziums. They could be inspired by sails, perhaps even by tricorn hats, either of which would make sense if you know anything about corsairs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing VOID WIRELESS v2 | An Icon, Reborn" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKxgnv79MVI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here, that gives us a sleek black headset, which on first impression looks pretty understated, but when powered up they come alive thanks to two RGB strips down the side of each earpiece. It isn’t overpowering, especially compared to some other headsets, but it gives the Void Wireless V2 a unique look that’s well worth checking in for.</p>
<p>It’s also comfortable. Thanks to the Void V2’s mere 296g of weight, it goes very easy on your head and ears, helped by the plush fabric-covered ear cushions and thick padded headband. The only oddity for me was that its earcups don’t seem to want to fit entirely flat against the side of my head. I think this is partly because I have a slightly smaller head – and no hair to provide natural cushioning – and the feeling has lessened as I’ve spent longer using it, but it’s worth considering if you’ve got a smaller cranium. That also means there’s definitely more audio-bleed from outside, and the Void Wireless V2 has the lowest passive noise cancellation I’ve found in a while, whether the earpieces are entirely flat or not.</p>

<p>Connection comes via both Bluetooth and a sizeable 2.4Ghz USB-A wireless dongle, sticking way out of the front of your PS5 quite obviously if you’re not using a rear port. The advantage to that is it’s less likely to get lost, and since I’ve had various instances of wireless dongles disappearing, never to be found again, I’ll take it. The Void Wireless V2 doesn’t just work with PS5, as PC, Mac, PS4, Switch and Mobile are all covered by this pair of connection options.</p>

<p>The Void V2 opts for simplicity when it comes to controls, with a power button nestled next to the customisable multifunction button on the left earpiece. Over here, there’s also the volume toggle wheel, and it’s a slightly odd control, flicking up or down to change the volume, or pressing it in to alter the EQ setting. It’s solid enough, and the spring-loaded action makes using it feel suitably precise, but there’s something about it that I’m just not that keen on.</p>
<p>Besides that, there’s the omnidirectional microphone arm, automatically muted when flipped up, and on when angled down. There’s a great level of customisation here, with a metallic boom arm that moves exactly where you want it to, contorting and angling as you’d hope. When so many manufacturers are opting for solid, one-piece mic arms, it’s a welcome inclusion.</p>
<p>Charging is via a USB-C port, and you won’t have to reach for the included 1.8m charging cable all that often, with a maximum of 65 hours of playtime, if you’re using the wireless dongle and you’ve turned the RGB off. Even with the RGB on, it sips away at the battery, and it’s almost a surprise when it runs out, making the Void V2 very easy to live with.</p>

<p>The Void Wireless V2’s 50mm drivers have plenty of oomph – that’s a technical term – and their ability to shift air around is probably more than most ears can take. The standard EQ setting is surprisingly flat, and I wasn’t expecting to find a more understated bass response compared to peers like the Turtle Beach Stealth 500, especially considering the larger drivers.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing a spot of Fragpunk on PS5, and here the Void Wireless V2 didn’t sell itself incredibly well, with the standard EQ settings making for gunplay which sounds indefinite and muddy. No matter which EQ setting you’re using, the out-of-the-box response is too heavy on the mids, making the overall experience woolly. There are 4 EQ presets to choose from, but outside of the top-end focused FPS mode, they all perform fairly similarly. It’s a real shame, but there is something you can do about it.</p>
<p>You’ll need to use the iCUE software to get the most out of the Void Wireless V2, but it’s only available for PC and Mac. If you’re a console player, then you’re going to have to live with the standard, out-of-the-box experience, which isn’t particularly strong.</p>

<p>Utilising iCUE, you get access to saved profiles, custom EQs and the ability to update and alter your headset’s microphone performance. If you’ve got a compatible Nvidia card, you can also add Nvidia Studio to help block out further unwanted background noise from your microphone, all of which makes for a really compelling package. There’s none of that if you’re playing on console, though.</p>
<p>With the ability to tweak your EQ, the Void Wireless V2 comes to life. There’s great incremental control via the 10-band EQ, and listening to some of my favourite music like Dinosaur Pile-up and Bring Me The Horizon showcases that the Void V2 can be a great-sounding headset.</p>
<p>Similarly, diving into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> on PC, the Void V2 proved thoroughly brilliant, with plenty of detail in the top end, and the epic soundtrack dispensed with a suitable level of drama. None of this exists in the out-of-the-box experience, and you can’t save your EQ settings to take back to console, with only lighting settings able to be carried over, which seems like a huge oversight.</p>
<p>At £99.99, the Void Wireless V2 enters a very competitive area, and I’d choose the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/02/nacon-rig-600-pro-hs-gaming-headset-review/">RIG 600 Pro HS</a> over this every day of the week, with similar high comfort levels, but a far better audio response across the board. The Turtle Beach Stealth 500 is also a stronger choice, with more subdued looks that won’t look too out of place if you leave the house.</p>

Jordan) return to their hometown in the Mississippi Delta with dreams of building a juke joint for all the sweaty late-night dancing, and revenue, that comes with it. Before a vampiric threat descends upon the tale, the early parts of the film show the brothers using their charm, guile, and gun-toting intimidation tactics to assemble a team to help build and run  the juke joint for one night. While the original film gives glimpses into its creation as Delta Slim (Delroy Lindo) extols the magic of the Blues, the deleted scene presents a streamlined, uninterrupted look at the juke joint’s construction.</p><p>Watching the joy on everyone’s faces as they toil away to build a utopia of their own in the middle of the racist South is bittersweet since that very juke joint is where most of them  lose their lives at the hands (and teeth) of the undead later that night. Just spending a little more time with these characters frying catfish, marveling at the possibilities of the gigantic structure, and helping one another makes you want to stay in that world a bit longer. It also makes you want a sequel that will likely never happen.</p><p>When a film is as big a cultural and box office success as <em>Sinners</em>, you expect fans and film studios to clamor for more.

This one is actually a bit more active than most passive abilities and is different from a normal guard. By holding the guard button, tilting the left stick on the controller, and tapping the dodge button Guardian will plant his feet into the ground for a sturdier block, in exchange for your capabilities to dodge and run.</p><p>While his stamina will slowly drain in this stance, any attacks blocked while in Steel Guard will deplete much less stamina than usual. Attacks that would usually break his guard can now be more easily reflected back with Guard Counters. Steel Guard is particularly helpful against aggressive bosses as it makes them vulnerable to counter attacks from you and your teammates.</p><h2 id="h3703"><a id="2"></a>Ability: Whirlwind</h2><p>Guardian’s Character Skill is Whirlwind, where he whips up a giant storm to sweep enemies off their feet. This skill is amazing at crowd control, as smaller enemies within range will be thrust into the air, helpless as your teammates finish them off. Additionally, any physical projectiles like arrows will be deflected.</p><figure id="" data-id="352fc069527acd5a6b59222f9dafcf6d" data-recommend-id="image://352fc069527acd5a6b59222f9dafcf6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Guardian spins around to attack enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Guardian spins around to attack enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="352fc069527acd5a6b59222f9dafcf6d" data-recommend-id="image://352fc069527acd5a6b59222f9dafcf6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Guardian spins around to attack enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can charge Whirlwind to make its blast radius bigger, which is well worth it since it’s a very safe move.</p><p>Unfortunately, it does little against large enemies like bosses, although it can sometimes stagger them.

Smaller enemies will be eviscerated and you can influence the direction of the attack before Guardian dives down.
