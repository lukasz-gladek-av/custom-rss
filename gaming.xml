We were customizing a feminine Rook, and while adjusting body options - read </span></span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/13/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-expansive-character-creator"><span><span>Game Informer’s </span></span></a><span><span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/13/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-expansive-character-creator">in-depth feature about Veilguard’s character creator here</a> for more details – our Rook's shirt disappeared to let us customize things like chest size. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>And that's when Veilguard game director Corrine Busche smiled, likely knowing full well that nudity in the character creator means nudity elsewhere in the game, like in Veilguard's romances, something I know BioWare fans will be delighted to hear.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>"This is a mature RPG," she tells me.</span></span></p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d9b523b2-4d7b-4eeb-9d32-a3ede2420061" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p><span><span>I only see topless nudity in the character creator, and when I later ask BioWare if there is bottom nudity as well, I'm told that's something it wants to let fans discover for themselves in the game. Interesting answer, considering we're talking about genitalia here, but I don't push further.&nbsp; Though the game's leads wouldn't share too much about romance options in the game, I have a feeling nudity will play a part in some cutscenes and that's what BioWare is alluding to.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Nudity has been present in previous BioWare games, but it's almost always been implied. Characters are sometimes naked in romance scenes and elsewhere, but arms, legs, shadows, and pieces of scenery obscure characters' more… oogly bits. With some of those bits on full display in the character creator, I have a feeling Veilguard's romantic scenes will be the spiciest in the series' history. And the game's pretty visual design, running in EA's Frostbite engine, only adds to that.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Okay, I think I've hit the limit that I can write the word nudity on my work computer before it gets flagged by HR or something. You'll have to wait for the game's full release this fall to learn more about nudity, romance, and more.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>The internet has become ingrained in our daily lives that many of us don’t know what we’d do if it just disappeared. But that’s a realistic problem that many countries are working on should it ever happen. Specifically, what if the subsea cables that carry data ever came under attack and were taken offline? </p>



<p>Researchers from the United States, Sweden, Switzerland, and Iceland are working alongside NATO to develop a plan that would reroute traffic to satellites in space. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-08/nato-backs-effort-to-reroute-internet-to-space-in-event-of-subsea-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, NATO’s Science for Peach and Security Program has approved a grant  up to $433,600 to help with the $2.5 million project.</p>



<p>The report also states that the data carried by the undersea cables “account for roughly $10 trillion worth of financial transactions every day, and nearly all of the NATO’s internet traffic travels through them.”</p>



<p>With multiple risks — from anchors to attacks from adversaries — the belief is that finding a solution to avoid catastrophe sooner rather than later is paramount to keeping things stable.</p>



<p>“With enough time and banging our heads against the wall we are confident we can do it,” Gregory Falco, a space systems engineer at Cornell University, told Bloomberg.</p>



<p>Law professor Bjarni Már Magnússon added that it would take “three or four bombs to just cut off Iceland and its communications”.</p>



<p>In addition to rerouting communications, this project is also researching how to detect threats to the cables before anything happens to them. The goal is to detect potential problems to the cables “down to the nearest meter”.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-rings-igon-on-recording-his-role-in-the-erdtree-dlc-and-meeting-miyazaki-it-was-epic-in-there<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Richard Charles Lintern remembers what it was like to meet Hidetaka Miyazaki. Though he had never heard of the man until the day he recorded his voice role in Elden Ring, the game director made one heck of an impression:</p><p>“I walked in the [recording studio], and there were at least 12 or 15 people in the room,” Lintern recalls. “Mr. [Hidetaka] Miyazaki was there. So we shook hands, but he largely didn't communicate with me in English. Other people did…a man called Adam Chapman, who was the voice director on the piece for me, works with a company called Fire Poets – I want to sing his praises just for a moment or two, because it's quite intimidating when you walk into that room and there is clearly a god of the gaming world there.</p><p>“Now, I'm not entirely stupid, but I had not heard of Mr. Miyazaki before. I didn't know the game, and I didn't know the status of the game, and I didn't know his status. But when I walked into the room, his status was very clear, very clear immediately. Everyone was very friendly, but at the same time, I could see that this was a bigger deal than I'd imagined it was going to be. And Adam, to his immense credit, took me under his wing and said, ‘Look, this is what they're going to look for. This is what you need to do. Be open to moving in different ways with the character. No one's quite sure what they're going to end up with, but it's a journey that we go on together.’”</p><p>Lintern was there to record the role of Igon, a new character added in Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree who’s become a beloved community icon thanks to Lintern’s performance. Specifically, everyone loves a monologue he delivers when summoned to aid the player in the fight against Bayle the Dragon, an absolutely massive beast who Igon utterly <em>loathes.</em></p><p>“CURSE YOU, BAYLE!” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkILyL_Urn8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the monologue begins</u></a>. “I hereby vow! You will rue this day! Behold, a true drake warrior! And I, Igon! Your fears made flesh! Solid of scale you might be, foul dragon, but I will riddle with holes your rotten hide! With a hail of harpoons! With every last drop of my being!”</p><p>While the Elden Ring community has made dozens of memes of Igon, Bayle, and the above monologue, until I spoke to him last week, Lintern was largely unaware of how much the fans adored his performance. In fact, he hadn’t even seen the final cut of his monologue, didn’t know what his character Igon looked like, and had absolutely no clue why he was so pissed off at this Bayle fellow. All he knew was that his experience performing in Shadow of the Erdtree was one of the most intense and unusual roles in his acting career.</p><h2>From 0 to 5,000</h2><p>Richard Charles Lintern is an English actor with a robust resume across film, TV, and theatre. He’s perhaps best-known for his work at the English National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, and on TV as Thomas Chamberlain in BBC series Silent Witness. He’s also no stranger to voice acting, having taken on numerous roles over the past decade. But Elden Ring was his very first time performing in a video game.</p><p>“I had never engaged, or been used, or tried to be used, or even thought of myself as a possibility for use in voice work in the gaming world,” Lintern says. “And once you open that door, it's been a real revelation for me, actually. I've been astonished about how worldwide it is, how enormous it is. I had kind of imagined that the world of TV and film and theater was the largest grossing, or most important, or whatever. And my eyes have been opened, not even by the work on Elden Ring, but by the response to it, and the scope of the reach, and the contact that these stories, these worlds have with people all over the world has been a real revelation for me, and really, really interesting.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/10/img-4592-1720632164339.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Richard Charles Lintern</figcaption></figure></output><p>Lintern isn’t clueless about video games, to be clear. He has three sons, and he’s played games with them, including various Star Wars entries, Super Mario, GoldenEye 007, and others. But he tells me he had never really engaged with games where you “disappear into a fantasy universe” until his role in Elden Ring. Lintern says he’s still a bit confused as to why they picked him, saying that he feels his sample clips are a far cry from the work he ended up doing as Igon.</p><p>“Even though I'm an actor and you're expected to be able to adapt to the character that you are playing, usually that adaptation is from zero to ten, or zero to seven,” he says. “In the case of the character that I played in Elden Ring, it was from naught to 5,000. He was a long way away. He was either dead, or dying, or recovering.”</p><p>When Lintern first received his lines for Igon, he says they were “largely incomprehensible” to him. He understood that his character was in pain, and kept threatening someone named Bayle, but that was it. </p><p>“Largely with voice work, the characterization, or the work is done on the day in the studio,” he says. “If I'm doing a documentary voice, I will have a conversation with the producer. Someone will say, ‘Well, we need a voice with gravitas,’ or, ‘We need a voice with a little bit of sympathy,’ or a smile, or whatever it happens to be. But that work is largely done on the day. There's not much you can do prior to the actual meeting, other than turn up on the day sober and in good health, basically. And then you get on with it.”</p><p>In that regard Lintern’s work as Igon started off completely normal. But his day in the recording studio was anything but.</p><h2>Exploding Into Elden Ring</h2><p>Given the very, very small number of lines Igon has in Elden Ring, Lintern expected his recording session, taking place at a studio in Central London, to be short, maybe 40 minutes. It was not. He recalls being in the booth for maybe five or six hours, and that he had to return a week later to a follow-up session. “It was epic in there.”</p><p>“I would perform one of the lines,” he recalls. “And then there would be a quite extensive conversation between Mr. Miyazaki and various other people around him in the room. Largely, I think the way things worked was, one of the other people would then speak to Adam, and explain what direction Mr. Miyazaki wanted to move in. But he, the mysterious figure in the center of the room, was very much in control of the entire operation.</p><p>“I remember thinking when I left, A, I'm exhausted. That's never happened to me before. I'm absolutely, my voice is wrecked and I'm physically exhausted, and I'm emotionally exhausted as well. B, that was quite an experience. There were a lot of people in there…We were doing lines hundreds of times, literally hundreds, because if I was there for five hours, the actual total amount of lines that I spoke, I could've done in seven minutes.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>For Lintern, Elden Ring was an “eye-opening” experience, one that’s led him to appreciate the emotional possibilities offered by video game stories. But even though he went through a wide gamut of different types of expression, he notes that never once was he asked to bring his emotional levels back down, or temper or mute them in any way. He says every single note he received in that five hours was along the lines of “Do you have more? Can you explode?”</p><p>“I'm standing there with my arms outstretched,” he recalls. “And I think at the time, I don't think I even knew that Bayle was a dragon. I think I might've thought Bayle was a person. Anyway, I can't remember, but I'm giving it as much as I possibly can, vocally, emotionally, neck stretching, vocal cords ripping, everything. And then we would come back, and then there'd be silence again, during which I'd have a glass of water. And then we'd come and do it again with a tinge of sorrow, or with a tinge more rage, or slower, or faster, or whatever it happened to be.</p><p>“The attention to detail that was given to the character and the performance was pretty much greater than anything I've experienced before,” he adds. “Comparable with characters in Shakespeare that I've played and stuff. People were taking it extremely seriously.”</p><h2>Too Angry to Die</h2><p>At this point in our interview, Lintern asked me to explain his character to him – who he was, and how the player interacted with him. I explained that Igon is an NPC the player meets by a roadside who is clearly in great agony when he’s encountered. Unfortunately, there’s not much the player can do about Igon’s pain. </p><p>“You can't heal me? You can't give me water?” Lintern asks. </p><p>Sorry, Mr. Lintern, no.</p><p>In subsequent encounters it becomes clear that Igon is absolutely furious with a character named Bayle. The player will eventually learn from other sources that Bayle is a massive dragon – and not just any dragon, he’s widely regarded as <em>the absolute worst dragon, </em>one that even other dragons loathe. Igon, a guy who kills dragons and eats their hearts for a living, really wants to eat Bayle’s heart. But when we meet him, he’s already tried and failed, with Bayle leaving him injured, agonized, and near-dead. When Igon sees the player is capable of killing dragons, he throws in his lot with them in hopes of getting revenge. It’s basically Captain Ahab and Moby Dick, with Igon’s monologue giving off big “From hell’s heart I stab at thee” energy. Igon even uses a harpoon in battle! Lintern appreciates the comparison.</p><p>“A quest of the soul, a quest of morality, and strength, and pain, and terror, and doom,” he observes. “And an enemy that is so huge that you can't even comprehend it, but for some reason, the bravery of the individual comes through and manages to triumph over it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>An enemy that is so huge that you can't even comprehend it, but the bravery of the individual comes through and manages to triumph.</p></div><p>“Or, this is the other thing. I remember feeling rather foolish at one point, about an hour or two in, there was one line where I said something like, ‘You are defeated. I triumph over you.’ And then the next line on the piece of paper was, ‘So you have defeated me.’ And I remember saying something like, ‘I think there's a mistake on the script thing here, because one minute he wins and the next minute he loses.’ And there was this awkward pause on the other side of the screen. And eventually, someone came back to me saying, ‘It's a video game, Richard. Sometimes you defeat the beast, and sometimes the beast defeats you. We need both options.’ I hadn't thought about that.”</p><p>I eventually show him images of Igon (“I look like a kind of broken down, scarecrow kind of guy.”) and the enormous Bayle. Bayle elicits quite the reaction from Lintern: “How on earth? Do you fight alongside me? How does that work?” I explain Elden Ring’s boss fights and its summon system that allows us to fight alongside Igon, but Lintern remains impressed anyone can beat such a massive dragon even with Igon and all his harpoons at their side.</p><p>I can’t help myself - I show Lintern a couple memes of Igon, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1doin0s/whatever_they_paid_his_voice_actor_it_wasnt_enough/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of my absolute favorites</a>: </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/10/2024-07-10-1720627876817.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>"Man literally too angry to die,” he reads. “Is that me? That's genius.”</p><p>I’m not the only one who’s been showing Lintern Igon memes. He tells me his son keeps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU6_pabXADQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>sending references</u></a> and asking him what “Curse you, Bayle,” means, but up until now Lintern hasn’t had a helpful answer. Lintern tells me he knows better than to name search himself online, but between his agent and his son, he’s seen enough positive feedback to know his role was well-received. And he’s certainly up for more video game roles in the future, he says, even if the intensity level is similarly dialed up to 5,000.</p><p>“I remember thinking for quite a few days afterwards, ‘That was quite an intense experience,’” Lintern concludes. “It was very mysterious. Mr. Miyazaki was a very mysterious character, but it was enjoyable. It felt creative, and it felt engaged. And I didn't quite know what I was doing, but I knew that I'd had fun doing it. Put it that way.”</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip? Send it to rvalentine@ign.com.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Alas, none of the marketing has shown any giant robots (yet).</p><p>Black State is the first game from developer Motion Blur, an independent AAA studio based in Istanbul. Apparently the game will have few loading screens, using doors as portals to transition to and from a diverse set of areas. This acts both as a plot device and visual hook. The story itself concerns a soldier summoned by a group of scientists called The Architects for a mysterious hostage mission who encounters strange doors that teleport him across impossible distances. Other plot details are vague, though the trailer does show some of the characters you may meet including a Colonel Campbell-esque commanding officer heard in voiceover and an old man surrounded by clocks.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQOB0PLJeAY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="8">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JQOB0PLJeAY?start=8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Most of the trailer is a real-time vertical slice of the game. It shows the as-yet-unnamed protagonist decked out in a high-tech suit, as he opens a door to a subway, runs down the train corridor, and opens another door into a military installation. He proceeds to take out the base using a machine gun, shotgun, and stealth takedowns, and it also shows a robot companion that maps the installation, tosses explosives, and activates smoke bombs. The end of the trailer teases a boss fight against a black-horned figure called simply Horn. While the trailer displays a more action-orientated approach, it's clear that stealth will also be viable.</p><p>Black State is available to wishlist on Steam and Epic Game Store. The game currently has no release window.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/i-fucking-hate-ser-criston-cole-house-of-the-dragon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>House of the Dragon</em>, a show in the same universe as <em>Game of Thrones</em> but taking place centuries earlier, is great fun mostly because all the characters are so hateable. Much like <em>Thrones</em>, the show offers a succession crisis and introduces several factions that are vying for power. Also like <em>Thrones</em>, so many of the characters are either so vile or so stupid that I feel myself rooting for chaos more than anything else. I do have one character that I hope loses, though: Hand of the King and commander of the Kingsguard, Ser Criston Cole, played by Fabien Frankel.</p><p>If you’re not watching <em>House of the Dragon</em>, I’m sorry for spoiling some of the events of last season in this article. Cole is a stupid asshole who failed upward and isn’t even good at his job. He’s presumptuous and petty, has a nasty violent streak, is a horrible little misogynist and has a stupid haircut. I’m getting ahead of myself—apologies. I just hate this man so much.</p><p>I thought Cole might be fine when we were first introduced to him in the previous season. He was a new knight from a non-noble background, and he quickly hit it off with Rhaenyra, the heir to the throne. After Rhaenyra learned that she was supposed to marry another noble, Cole confessed his love to her and asked her to run away with him so she could fucking farm goats or something instead of being the queen. I don’t know what he thought was going to happen there; she refused him. Not soon afterward, to let off some steam, Cole beats a man to death over dinner. It’s genuinely horrifying to watch, and somehow it isn’t Cole’s worst moment.</p><p>From there on out, Cole goes from being so down bad for Rhaenyra that he was actively asking her to run away with him to hating her passionately. When Alicent, Rhaenyra’s best friend who married her dad (there’s a lot of incest in this show), eventually makes her <em>own</em> claim for the throne, Cole is her most ardent defender, going so far as to place the crown on her shitty son Aegon’s head. He also starts fucking Alicent, which I’m sure is unrelated to all the other stuff that’s happened before and has no bearing on his general opinions on women with power.</p><p>During every episode of <em>House of the Dragon</em>, I pray for Ser Criston Cole’s death at least once. Often, I wish for his death multiple times per episode. It’s not enough that he sucks as a human being. Aemond, who has now killed not one but two of his own family members, is a loathsome little asshole, but he has panache. He’s also extremely good at his job of being a scary fucker who intimidates his enemies. By contrast, Cole is an abject failure in basically every way. As commander of the Kingsguard, he often loses track of his King. In fact, while King Aegon’s son was murdered, Cole was nowhere to be found because he was fucking King Aegon’s mom. When he’s later elevated to Hand of the King, supposedly the King’s most trusted advisor, he approaches every delicate political situation as if he’s a hammer and they’re all nails.&nbsp;</p><p>Caught an assassin who killed the toddler-age prince? Time for torture. Torture didn’t produce the name of the second assassin? Okay, hang everybody who matches the only criteria they were able to glean, horrifying the King’s subjects. Because it turned out so well last time, just keep fucking the Queen Dowager, whose stupid son is your charge. Almost all of his choices are spurred by his fragile sense of pride, and then he makes his shame and guilt everyone else’s problem. To avenge the death of King Aegon’s son, he tells a knight to go impersonate his twin in Rhaenyra’s court and kill her. Not only does that obviously not work, it leads to the surviving twin killing himself out of grief. Great job, Ser Criston Cole! Better luck next time!</p><p>The most frustrating thing about Cole is the way he tries to become a political player, but without any of the knowledge or savvy of the people who have been at court longer than he has. Cole is smart enough to know that King Aegon is basically a big himbo, but not smart enough to know how to steer him away from extremely dangerous situations where he will most likely die. In fact, all he does is stoke Aegon’s bloodlust out of his own desire to secure his seat of power and win glory on the battlefield. While Cole’s battle tactics may be sound, he’s just unable to do his duty, which is make sure the King doesn’t die. He makes the mistake of thinking a vain twenty-something with absolute power will listen to him, despite the fact that Aegon <em>dismissed his previous Hand because he didn’t want to listen to him</em>.</p><p>At the very least <em>House of the Dragon</em> lets us all watch this blow up in Cole’s face constantly. While he and Aemond were able to engineer a narrow victory through their superior tactics, Cole yet again was unable to protect his King, who surprised them at the battlefield. This resulted in Cole getting severe burns and multiple broken bones. Frankel plays this moment perfectly in the episode—when Cole finally finds King Aegon’s body, he looks like a guilty dog that got into the toilet paper. The only way it could have been sweeter is if a dragon bit him in half.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But rather than aggressively double down on Game Pass as the future of Xbox by continuing to increase value and keep prices cheap, Microsoft seems to be slamming the breaks on its risky subscription experiment, announcing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-game-pass-price-increase-ps5-microsoft-1850561048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-game-pass-price-increase-ps5-microsoft-1850561048">not just the second price hike in a year</a></span> but a substantial retreat from the everything, everywhere, at one simple price ethos that launched it in the first place.</p><p>On Wednesday, Microsoft <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">revealed an overhaul of the subscription gaming program more confusing</a></span> than the pre-order bonus chart for your favorite Electronic Arts game. Game Pass will still have four tiers, three for console and one for PC, but the benefits, names, and prices are changing. Most notably, the basic Xbox Game Pass subscription tier, simply called “Game Pass for Console,” is turning into Game Pass Standard, going from $11 a month to $15, gaining Xbox Live, and losing access to day-one Game Pass releases and certain other games in the full Game Pass library.</p><p>The Game Pass library already got splintered once with Game Pass Core, which contains a very limited slice of first and third-party Xbox games, and now it’s happening again, though we won’t know the full extent of the fragmentation until more details are announced in the coming months. Current Game Pass for Console subscribers will stay grandfathered in as long as their membership stays on auto-renew. But for everyone else, the only way to keep access to day-one releases will be to sign up for Game Pass Ultimate, which now costs a whopping $240 a year, or roughly the cost of the frequently discounted Xbox Series S. </p><figure id="" data-id="9a081bc8ff7219cfa4c6a70eb4c51797" data-recommend-id="image://9a081bc8ff7219cfa4c6a70eb4c51797" data-format="jpg" data-width="2119" data-height="1415" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Xbox sits on a table.

It’s one of the games Microsoft spent $69 billion to buy Activision Blizzard for, an acquisition whose main legacy so far appears to be mass layoffs and fewer exclusives. Playing <em>Diablo IV</em>’s comeback season on Game Pass has been nice, but it wasn’t worth Tango Gameworks closing, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/xbox-studio-closures-microsoft-plans-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-layoffs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/xbox-studio-closures-microsoft-plans-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a decision seemingly precipitated in part</a></span> by newfound scrutiny on Xbox’s bottomline following the close of the historic merger.<br></p><p>When Game Pass launched in 2017, the fate of the Xbox One was sealed. A bungled launch and a lack of first-party hits to cut through the noise left Microsoft out in the wilderness. So it purchased a bunch of studios to bolster its portfolio and built up a subscription service Sony couldn’t compete with, one that had the potential to grow beyond consoles. Xbox players have spent the first half of a new console generation waiting for that to all change, but it effectively hasn’t. A stellar not-E3 showcase this summer was still aimed at the future, or in the case of a new Gears prequel, the ancient past.</p><p>But through all of it there was Game Pass, the service that you could recommend to friends and family without qualifiers or caveats. It had day-one access to <em>Halo</em> and <em>Forza Horizon</em>, timeless classics like <em>Fallout</em> and <em>Elder Scrolls</em>, and some of the biggest indie hits of the year, as well as a bunch you never would have discovered otherwise. Adding Blizzard games and <em>Call of Duty</em> should have made it even better. Instead, they’re turning the service into something that feels more like a toll booth than a bargain. Rather than basking in the freedom of a gaming buffet, there’s the guilt of trying to make sure you get your money’s worth.</p><p>Nothing puts the value trade-off as starkly as what Microsoft <em>isn’t</em> changing about Game Pass for PC. While the subscription is going from $10 to $12, it will still get access to day-one games and remains free of the monthly cost of playing games online on consoles. Instead of $240 a year for Game Pass Ultimate, PC players can play <em>Black Ops 6 </em>with their friends for just $144. There’s a version of Game Pass that’s still the best deal in gaming, it turns out. It’s just not on Xbox anymore. And maybe that’s the entire point: having potentially cannibalized its own console storefront by training some of its players not to buy things, Microsoft is trying to poison the well just enough to make buying<em> Indiana Jones </em>or <em>Avowed</em> outright <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Doctor_Cupcakes/status/1810822847977181497&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Doctor_Cupcakes/status/1810822847977181497" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">look that much more appealing by comparison</a></span>.</p><p>None of this is a business case for why Microsoft should do things differently. It may well be that soaking its most loyal customers is the best way for it to draw blood from a stone at this point. But the retreat from Game Pass makes it feel like Xbox is once again in need of a new story to tell about its future, and why it’s a platform worth investing in. Without it, the Xbox Series X/S console generation goes back to feeling like a jack-of-all-trades and master of none. I’m not the first person to point out that without strong games, strong hardware, or strong services, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-and-the-battle-for-xboxs-soul&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-and-the-battle-for-xboxs-soul" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you’re just another Microsoft brand</a></span>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Every year is an exciting one in the world of esports. From superstars rising to fame to multi-million-dollar tournaments surfacing and stunning audiences worldwide, it’s certainly an industry that never sleeps. It can be hard to track what’s going on – or what’s coming next. That’s why we’ve assembled a one-stop esports events calendar for 2024, so you can see what’s coming and plan your viewing activities accordingly. </p>



<p>As esports events wrap up through 2024, we’ll update this calendar with any applicable results – because that’s how nice we are at Insider Gaming. Read on to learn everything you need to know about the esports events being played in 2024.</p>

<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Tournament Name</th><th>Game Title</th><th>Prize Pool</th><th data-align="center">Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Honor of Kings Invitational 2024</td><td>Honor of Kings</td><td>$300,000</td><td data-align="center">TBC</td></tr><tr><td>Red Bull Wololo</td><td>Age of Empires</td><td>$138,000</td><td data-align="center">TBC</td></tr><tr><td>Thunderpick World Champs 2024</td><td>CS2</td><td>$850,000</td><td data-align="center">Oct 1 – 24</td></tr><tr><td>COD Mobile World Championship</td><td>COD Mobile</td><td>$1 Million</td><td data-align="center">Oct 4 – 6</td></tr><tr><td>PGL Wallachia</td><td>Dota 2</td><td>$1 Million</td><td data-align="center">Oct 4 – 13</td></tr><tr><td>IEM Rio 2024</td><td>CS2</td><td>$250,000</td><td data-align="center">Oct 7 – 13</td></tr><tr><td>DreamLeague Season 24</td><td>Dota 2</td><td>$1 Million</td><td data-align="center">Oct 7 – 13</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 id="h-november">November</h3>



<p>November is the last huge month in the annual esports schedule before things start winding down for the winter period. It’s one hell of a month for fans worldwide.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Tournament Name</th><th>Game Title</th><th>Prize Pool</th><th data-align="center">Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Clash of Clans World Champs 2024</td><td>Clash of Clans</td><td>$1 Million</td><td data-align="center">TBC</td></tr><tr><td>BLAST R6 Major Montreal</td><td>Rainbow Six Siege</td><td>$750,000</td><td data-align="center">Nov 7 – 17</td></tr><tr><td>FFWS Global Finals</td><td>Free Fire</td><td>$1 Million</td><td data-align="center">TBC</td></tr><tr><td>PUBG Mobile Global Champs 2024</td><td>COD Mobile</td><td>$3 Million</td><td data-align="center">TBC</td></tr><tr><td>M6 World Championship</td><td>ML:BB</td><td>$900,000</td><td data-align="center">TBC</td></tr><tr><td>IESF World Esports Championship</td><td>Multiple Games</td><td>$240,000</td><td data-align="center">Nov 11 – 19</td></tr><tr><td>BLAST Premier: World Final 2024</td><td>CS2</td><td>$1 Million</td><td data-align="center">Nov 13 – 17</td></tr><tr><td>OWCS Season Finals</td><td>Overwatch 2</td><td>TBC</td><td data-align="center">Nov 22 – 24</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 id="h-december">December</h3>



<p>And finally, we come to December, the last month in 2024’s esports events calendar. Presently, no major tournaments are confirmed to be starting in December, and it’s unlikely any will be announced. Are you looking forward to 2025?</p>

			<p>Riot Games has been dipping its toes into the world of fighting games after becoming well-known for its MOBA League of Legends and auto-battler Teamfight Tactics. Their latest game is on the horizon, with 2XKO, formerly Project L, currently in Alpha testing. However, they also had a second fighting game, code-named Pool Party, which was binned in May.</p>
<p>This fighting game was said to be in the style of Super Smash Bros, with melee fighting and platforming set in the League of Legends universe. Current and former Riot employees have spoken out about this game, saying that a team of 70-80 people was assigned to work on this project.</p>
<p>While the project has since been scrapped, at least half of the team has received an offer to be reassigned within the studio to other jobs. Ten people did not receive an offer and were subsequently laid off or left the company voluntarily.</p>
<p>A statement has been made by Joe Hixson, the senior communications director at Riot Games. He told <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mikhail Klimentov</a> of readergrev.com, "We always have a number of projects in various phases of R&amp;D, and spinning projects up and down happens multiple times a year."</p>
<p>While they haven't specifically said why the project was scrapped, it's possible that they felt that the scene was now becoming too saturated. While Super Smash Bros. remains on top as the ultimate melee platform fighter, Multiversus has now broken into the scene.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Riot Games had a <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-11-of-workforce-shuts-down-riot-forge-to-refocus-on-core-projects/">mass layoff of over 500 employees</a>, which was said to be due to budget cuts so that they could continue to have as many ongoing projects as they currently do.</p>
<p>Riot Games' newest project, 2XKO, a fighting game, is due for a 2025 release date. Registration forms for their Alpha labs are currently open for people who are interested in trialing the game for them.</p>

"The RPG game format is a lot of fun, and I've even thought to myself, 'You know, for the past 30 years, we haven't done a Sonic RPG.' And I'm questioning myself. 'Why haven't we done a Sonic RPG in all this time? How have we gotten to 30 years with no RPGs?!'"</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/10/maxresdefault-1720623046528.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Takashi Iizuka | Image Credit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Xwt7ka8KA">IGN France</a></figcaption></figure></output><p>Iizuka said he would "hopefully" get to work on a Sonic RPG before he retires from Sega, but made clear there was nothing "concrete" at this time. "So, I'd like to hopefully work on a Sonic RPG at some point before I retire from Sega," he said. "But you know, that's just a dream right now. There are no concrete plans at this point."</p><p>The only Sonic RPG released so far was <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-chronicles-the-dark-brotherhood">Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood</a>, a 2008 Nintendo DS game. However, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer Bioware worked on the project and not Sonic Team. </p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/09/24/sonic-chronicles-the-dark-brotherhood-review">our review of Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood</a>, IGN wrote: "There's fun to be had, and the game does pick up after the first few hours, but we'd be surprised to see many DS gamers get behind Dark Brotherhood while there are so many superior role-playing games on the platform. There's a good design in here somewhere; it's just lost in the shuffle of it all."</p><p>The closest that Sonic Team got to incorporating RPG-esque elements in a Sonic game was the blue hedgehog's first 3D game, Sonic Adventure, which implemented some RPG elements. In a <a href="https://soahcity.com/videos/sonic-adventure-dx-commentary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cut commentary for Sonic Adventure DX</a>, Iizuka explained that after work on NiGHTs into Dreams, he approached Naka, proposing that Sonic Adventure should be an RPG-style game. </p><p>Despite Sonic Team not making a Sonic RPG, the development studio has worked on role-playing games including the aforementioned Nights into Dreams and the Phantasy Star Online series. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

What do you think?</h2></div><section><p>Developer Motion Blur has announced Black State, a visually stunning new third-person action-adventure that, if the gorgeous announcement trailer is accurate, mixes the espionage action of Metal Gear Solid with the reality-bending portal tech of Portal. It's powered by Unreal Engine 5 and in development for PC.</p><p>After watching Black State's completely in-game trailer (seriously, watch it above), we asked the developers at Turkey-based Motion Blur a few questions about the project. First, what the story is about: "A former military legend is summoned for a mysterious mission: to rescue a captive scientist and uncover the truth behind a cataclysmic event. The mission, assigned by enigmatic Architects, is shrouded in uncertainty as some doors within the unknown territory lead to unpredictable and perilous destinations. Each door reveals new secrets and challenges, and he must navigate this treacherous landscape, discovering what awaits him behind each threshold, to complete his mission and unveil the hidden truths."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Black State - Exclusive First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Our next question was about that Metal Gear comparison: "Obviously, we love the Metal Gear Solid series. While working on our extensive, nearly 500-page game design document over 2.5 years, we constantly admired games like The Last of Us, Metal Gear Solid, Uncharted, and many others that push the limits of development and gameplay mechanics. Inspired by these influences, our small team is committed to delivering the highest development quality and exceptional gameplay mechanics, despite our limited size. We strive to create rich and deep storytelling combined with engaging gameplay mechanics, offering an impressive and unforgettable gaming experience. Our goal is to push ourselves to our limits and give gamers the best possible experience we can provide."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We constantly admired games like The Last of Us, Metal Gear Solid, Uncharted, and many others that push the limits of development and gameplay mechanics."</p></div><p>Black State has been in development for the better part of the past three years. The Motion Blur team says "the idea for Black State originated from the creative mind of Kadir Demirden. This concept has been evolving in his imagination for over a decade. During this period, extensive research and development were conducted to explore how a small team could produce a game with AAA quality."</p><p>IGN will have much more on Black State as development progresses.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-future-of-black-desert-online/">Black Desert Online</a> remains one of the biggest MMORPGs on the market, and it's time for their latest event to be made public. Their new event is titled "<a href="https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/Wiki?wikiNo=367">War of the Roses</a>," where you can participate in a grand battle of 300v300 PvP and see which team comes out on top. If this sounds right, the first global competition is scheduled for July 14th, where you can watch and participate in the ongoing chaos.</p>
<p>This massive-scale event is geared towards high-end players and guilds. Special roles have been created for leading players, and a brand-new tactical map will allow players to explore as they wrestle to take control of strategic control points in a battle of 600 players.</p>
<p>While the rules have not been announced as of yet, players can expect to see specific combat tactics and rules that will be enforced to ensure a fair match for everyone involved. Adventurers get to participate in a mass battle on both land and sea as you brawl to unlock powerful weapons to take down Sanctum Guardians and get the advantage on the other team.</p>
<p>As this event begins, so does the latest season in Black Desert Online. With the new season comes many new changes as the developers have taken on feedback from the players so that rewards are more substantial; there are brand-new Captain skills and some new strategic components that allow for a stronger comeback if you fall behind the crowd.</p>
<p>War of the Roses brings powerful siege weapons by activating the "Spirit's Altar," which then allows for Ancient Trolls, Ancient Chariots, and Elephants to lend you a helping hand to wrestle the victory from the other team and try to wipe out their players with speed and efficiency.</p>
<p>To participate in this grand event, players must have a combined AP and DP score of at least 700 before they can apply. Regardless of whether you win or lose, plenty of rewards are up for grabs for participating in this event.</p>
<p>Will you participate in Black Desert Online's War of the Roses?</p>

It basically amounted to him never picking a side and instead looking for a “middle ground” on all issues. This went over poorly online. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Here’s the paragraph where I take a moment to explain who <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/youtube-mrbeast-split-night-media-jimmy-donaldson-1851458070&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-mrbeast-split-night-media-jimmy-donaldson-1851458070">MrBeast</a></span> is even though it’s very, very likely that you—a reader of <em>Kotaku</em>—already <em>know </em>who this dude is and don’t need a refresher. You can skip ahead. For everyone else, let me explain real fast. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mr-beast-lawsuit-100-million-virtual-kitchen-burger-1850715158&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mr-beast-lawsuit-100-million-virtual-kitchen-burger-1850715158">MrBeast</a></span> is an extremely popular content creator known mostly for his “charity” work—giving people shoes, randomly giving away money, etc—which is then documented in videos with some of the most buck-wild thumbnails I’ve ever seen. Thanks to these charity videos and a good understanding of what kids will click on, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-accidentally-ordered-burgers-from-a-youtuber-1845965201&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-accidentally-ordered-burgers-from-a-youtuber-1845965201">MrBeast</a></span> has become one of the biggest creators in the world.  Naturally, that means some people have suggested he run for president, and he’s now shared his plan for that hellish potential timeline. </p><p>On July 6, MrBeast tweeted out that if the minimum age requirement to become the President of the United States was lowered, he’d “jump in the race.” Currently, you must be 35. And no, there’s no maximum age cap for this office, hence why two bloated corpses who can barely string together coherent sentences are running in 2024. Anyway, on Wednesday, a few days after that initial tweet, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MrBeast/status/1811014883317530846&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MrBeast/status/1811014883317530846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MrBeast shared how he would act as president</a></span>. </p><p>“If I were president I wouldn’t care about party lines, I’d just always truly make the American people my #1 priority,” explained MrBeast. “For problems I’m ignorant in I’d have experts from the left and right advise me on them and try to find the middle ground that’s best for America. Wouldn’t be buyable, don’t care about doing things just because my party says I should, and I would focus on uniting the country instead of dividing it.”</p><h2 id="h128519"><a id=""></a>People react poorly to MrBeast’s platform</h2><p>The reaction to this centrist, child-like pitch for president has led to a lot of people roasting the content creator online. Many have asked simple questions like “What’s the middle ground between universal healthcare and no universal healthcare?” or “What’s the middle option between providing LGBTQ people with rights and not doing that?” Some of his fans did reply to these questions and suggest the answer is to do nothing or not change anything, providing people with a great example of why centrists are worthless. <br></p><p>Re-reading his plan, but pretending it was written and read out loud by a 9-year-old child just learning about politics and the world, is not only funny but actually makes more sense. It’s almost cute. Ahh, MrBeast thinks the right and left are equally filled with experts and good people. That’s so adorable. </p><p>“Anyways, we can pick this up in 15 years when I’m old enough to run haha,” threatened MrBeast on Twitter. Conveniently, MrBeast didn’t suggest what party he would run with, likely to avoid alienating any of his fans.</p><p> I’m not surprised that someone as popular as MrBeast is hopping online to suggest he might run for president. The conversation online has lately been focused on replacing Biden following his dismal performance in the debate last month. And MrBeast is good at chasing a trend. Still, I can’t believe that I’d rather vote for zombie Biden than MrBeast. Yet here we are. </p><p>Now, someone pester Ninja into sharing his presidential platform on Twitter and we can get a sneak peek at what our options will be in like 10 years when all these popular creators are old enough to run and their fans are old enough to vote. Or maybe climate change will wipe us all out by then. Let’s hope! </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 106:single/related:14b14cdb06101ff6183bca1a1a457aca --><!-- empty -->
<p>For years now, Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass has set itself apart by offering subscribers launch-day access to new first-party titles in addition to a large legacy library of older games. That important "day one" perk is now set to go away for all but the highest tier of Game Pass' console subscribers, even as Microsoft asks for more money for Game Pass across the board.</p>
<p>Let's start with the price increases for existing Game Pass tiers, which are relatively straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Game Pass Ultimate" is going from $16.99 to $19.99 per month.</li>
<li>"Game Pass for PC" is going from $9.99 to $11.99 per month.</li>
<li>"Game Pass Core" (previously known as Xbox Live Gold) is going from $59.99 to $74.99 for annual subscriptions (and remains at $9.99 for monthly subscriptions).</li>
</ul>
<p>Things get a bit more complicated for the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/xbox-game-pass-for-console/CFQ7TTC0K6L8"> $10.99/month "Xbox Game Pass for Console"</a> tier. Microsoft announced that it will no longer accept new subscriptions for that tier after today, though current subscribers will be able to keep it (for now) if they auto-renew their subscriptions.</p>
<p>In its place, Microsoft will "in the coming months" roll out a new $14.99 "Xbox Game Pass Standard" tier. That new option will combine the usual access to "hundreds of high-quality games on console" with the "online console multiplayer" features that previously required a separate Xbox Game Pass Core subscription ("Core" will still be available separately and include access to a smaller "25+ game" library).</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Quick and dirty chart by me to display the new Xbox Game Pass structure (subject to correction).</p>
<p>I hope this helps. <a href="https://t.co/Qj6CX7i4kG">pic.twitter.com/Qj6CX7i4kG</a></p>
<p>— Klobrille (@klobrille) <a href="https://twitter.com/klobrille/status/1810852087678321071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>But while the current Xbox Game Pass Console option promises access to Xbox Game Studios games "the same day they launch," those "Day One releases" are <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/ad/51/ad517e36-25cc-4d7d-897d-c0f9c667e9cb.pdf?n=FINAL%20Xbox%20Game%20Pass%20options%20for%20consoles.pdf">conspicuously absent as a perk for the replacement Xbox Game Pass Standard subscription</a>.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>"Some games available with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on day one will not be immediately available with Xbox Game Pass Standard and may be added to the library at a future date," Microsoft <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024">writes in an FAQ</a> explaining the changes.</p>
<p>Players who want guaranteed access to all those "Day One" releases will now have to subscribe to the $19.99/month Game Pass Ultimate. That's an 81 percent increase from the $10.99/month that console players currently pay for similar "Day One" access on the disappearing Game Pass Console tier.</p>
<p>To be fair, that extra subscription money does come with some added benefits. Upgrading from Game Pass Console/Standard to Game Pass Ultimate lets you use <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/series-x-power-on-your-netbook-xbox-game-streaming-upgrade-is-now-live/">Microsoft's cloud gaming service</a>, access downloadable PC games and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/ea-play">the EA Play library</a>, and get additional "free perks every month." But it's the launch day access to Microsoft's system-selling first-party titles that really sets the Ultimate tier apart now, and which will likely necessitate a costly upgrade for many Xbox Game Pass subscribers.</p>
<h2>More problems, more money</h2>

<p>While Xbox Game Pass <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/02/xbox-apes-netflix-with-10-per-month-100-game-unlimited-pass/">launched in 2017</a>, launch-day access to all of Microsoft's new first-party games wasn't promised to subscribers <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/01/23/xbox-game-pass-expands/">until the beginning of 2018</a>. Since then, loyal Game Pass subscribers have been able to play dozens of brand-new first-party titles at launch, from major franchises like <em>Halo</em>, <em>Forza</em>, and <em>Gears of War</em> to indie darlings like <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, and <em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em> and much more.</p>
<p>Sure, access to hundreds of older games was nice. But the promise of brand-new major first-party titles was instrumental in driving Xbox Game Pass to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/23570040/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscriber-numbers-34-million">34 million subscribers as of February</a>. And Sony found itself unwilling to match that "day one" perk for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/breaking-down-sonys-confusing-playstation-plus-subscription-relaunch/">its similar PlayStation Plus service</a>, which only includes a handful of older PlayStation Studios titles.
</p><p>In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstations-jim-ryan-our-games-could-suffer-if-we-put-them-straight-into-ps-plus">a 2022 interview with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan said throwing new first-party games on their subscription service would break a "virtuous cycle" in which new full game purchases (at a price of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/70-game-prices-are-probably-here-to-stay-but-not-for-every-game/">up to $70</a>) help fund the next round of game development. "The level of investment that we need to make in our studios would not be possible, and we think the knock-on effect on the quality of the games that we make would not be something that gamers want."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>And Microsoft may be coming to a similar conclusion. Including first-party titles with cheaper, console-focused Game Pass subscriptions probably seemed like a good idea when Microsoft was still trying to attract subscribers to the service. But <a href="https://gamerant.com/xbox-game-pass-growth-subscriber-count-2023-report/">Game Pass subscriber growth is starting to slow</a> as the market of potential customers has become saturated. Microsoft now needs to extract more value from those subscribers to justify Game Pass cannibalizing direct sales of its own first-party games.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/codblops6-scaled.jpg" data-height="1440" data-width="2560" alt="Microsoft paid a lot of money to add the value of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> to a Game Pass subscription."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/codblops6-scaled.jpg" data-height="1440" data-width="2560">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Microsoft paid a lot of money to add the value of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> to a Game Pass subscription.</p><p>Activision</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>And let's not forget Activision, which Microsoft recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/microsoft-finally-owns-candy-crush-as-it-closes-69b-activision-blizzard-deal/">spent a whopping $69 billion to acquire</a> after lengthy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/judge-denies-ftc-injunction-improving-microsofts-activision-purchase-prospects/">legal</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/microsoft-is-finally-on-the-verge-of-closing-its-activision-deal/">regulatory</a> battles. Recouping that cost, while also offering Game Pass subscribers <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/05/10/every-first-party-xbox-game-will-launch-day-one-on-game-pass-sarah-bond/">launch day access to massive sellers like <em>Call of Duty</em></a>, likely forced Microsoft to maximize Game Pass' revenue-generating opportunities.
</p><p>“Let’s put it this way: If 7 million Xbox Game Pass subscribers were planning to buy ‘Call of Duty’ for $70 but now have no reason to (as it’s part of their subscription), that leaves almost half a billion dollars of revenue on the table,” MIDia analyst Rhys Elliott <a href="https://www.thedailyupside.com/technology/big-tech/microsoft-is-going-for-a-gaming-hail-mary/">told The Daily Upside</a> by way of illustrating the significant numbers involved.</p>
<p>For players who enjoy a wide variety of games and would likely purchase all or most of Microsoft's first-party titles at launch anyway, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate it still probably a good deal at its increased price. But players who subscribed to a relatively cheap console Game Pass option years ago may want to reevaluate if maintaining that launch day access is now worth $240 a year.</p>

On a screen of this size, playing a game at 1080p and tinkering with the graphical settings will still allow you to get most modern titles to play decently, while more modest indie games shouldn't give you any technical issues.</p><p>On top of that, this is a great little laptop for doing some quick video editing or other forms of content creation, and the lightweight design makes it great for when you watch some Netflix in bed. The overall design isn't too bad either, as the angular shape isn't as ostentatious as other models available right now.</p><p>For more, you can also see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/walmart-deals-prime-day-2024/2900-5577/" data-ref-id="2900-5577">everything that Walmart has on sale right now</a>.
