			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake is coming soon to PlayStation Plus Extra, according to renowned leaker billbil-kun. In a post <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ce-remake-sorti-en-excluvisite-console-sur-ps5-va-debarquer-sur-le-ps-plus-extra-60622">published on Dealabs.com</a>, the leaker said the game should join Sony's middle PS Plus tier on October 21.  Billbil-kun is well-informed on these announcements. Just recently, the leaker had revealed in advance that Remedy's Alan Wake 2 would be added to the PlayStation Plus Essential lineup, which Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-ps-plus-essential-october-the-last-of-us-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed during the latest State of Play presentation</a>.</p>



<p>Bloober Team and KONAMI launched the Silent Hill 2 remake a year ago, receiving widespread critical and fan acclaim after pre-release skepticism. On Wccftech, Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated the game 9 out of 10</a>:</p>



<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>



<p>To date, the game has sold more than two million units, persuading KONAMI to <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partner once again with Bloober Team to remake the first installment in the revered horror franchise</a>, too. Meanwhile, the incredibly prolific Polish studio has already launched another sci-fi horror game based on its own brand-new franchise, Cronos: New Dawn. This game also received a solid score (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8/10</a>) on Wccftech from reviewer Francesco De Meo: </p>



<p><em>Although its first hours do a frankly bad job of getting players involved from a gameplay perspective, Cronos: The New Dawn is ultimately a very engaging game, and one of Bloober Team's best games alongside the Silent Hill 2 remake. While its flaws remain evident throughout the adventure, the game's unique setting, engaging mystery-filled story, and gameplay, which starts coming together after the very first boss battle a few hours in, make The Traveler's mission one worthy of embarking on for all survival horror fans, especially those who love the Dead Space series.</em></p>

              <p>It feels like&nbsp;<em>forever</em> since we had a big gaming rivalry. Since the dawn of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> it has gone through patches of directly competing with other big-name shooter franchises, whether they were <em>Medal of Honor</em>,&nbsp;<em>Halo</em> or&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>, with everyone obliged to take a side. It’s kind of nostalgic to see it happening again, with the announcement that&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>‘s current beta is being extended by an extra 24 hours, to bring it close enough to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s release to creepily whisper in its ear.</p> <p>The current <em>CoDBlops 7&nbsp;</em>beta was due to come to an end at 12 p.m. EDT on Wednesday 8 October, but has now been given a 24 hour extension, along with a brand new map to play on and double XP rewarded until the new deadline of Thursday 9th. And you know this was planned from the start, designed to tread on <em>BF6</em>‘s heels as much as possible.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000632462" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000632462"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000632462">© Activision</figcaption></figure> <p>The sixth and final map is Toshin, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-ninja-gaiden-forza-2000628659">much vaunted Japanese setting</a> complete with cherry blossoms, a downtown shopping district, and a rather unfortunate central monorail crash. The update from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes"><em>Call of Duty</em> patchnotes blog</a> also mentions that double XP&nbsp;<em>and</em> double weapon XP will be running through the end of the beta on Thursday, trying to keep as many eyes looking toward this franchise and not glancing away at EA’s rival.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-blops7-beta-doors-ttk-2000632082">Reports from the beta so far</a> have suggested issues with mulitplayer matchmaking (which of course is one of the reasons these betas are run in the first place—to try to get on top of problems like this before the release), as well as grumbles about TTK and oddly enough, the game’s closing doors.</p>

 <p>Come the end of the beta, attention returns to&nbsp;<em>Blops 6</em> and season 6’s The Haunting event for Halloween from October 9, which also happens to be the day&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> comes out. At that point, FPS fans’ attentions will be torn, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">but many will be tempted by the shiny new object</a>.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> then has more than a month to itself, with <em>Black Ops 7 </em>not out until November 14 and not planning any more betas before then. It’ll be interesting to see if that’s long enough for <em>BF6</em> players to have had their fill and be willing to move across, or if both games can maintain their own audiences in the holiday season. Certainly Activision and EA are <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-two-new-maps-modes-roadmap-free-updates-dlc-2025-ea-2000630301">both planning</a> an awful lot of post-game content to try to keep everyone’s attention, and I’m looking forward to sitting back with popcorn to watch it all play out.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-65w-3-port-charger-is-down-to-pennies-amazon%E2%80%99s-nearly-giving-away-the-last-units.1318345/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Multi-device charging becomes a daily headache when you’re constantly swapping cables and hunting for available outlets. You need one charger that can handle your laptop, phone and tablet without compromising speed or taking up half your desk. <strong>Anker’s 65W Charger solves this with three ports (USB-C and USB-A)</strong> in a package roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case. These chargers haven’t seen meaningful discounts in months with the last comparable pricing showing up during July’s… Prime Day. Amazon’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4567/">bringing that record low price back for Prime members right now, dropping it from $39 to $25</a> for this Prime Big Deal Day event.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4567/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>GaN II Technology Redefines the Charging Game</h2>
<p>The Nano II Anker charger employs GaN II technology and it is <strong>running twice as fast as a typical silicon-based charger</strong>. That elevated speed creates smaller internal component sizes for the same output, hence how Anker managed to pack a whopping 65W into a tiny form factor.</p>
<p>With three devices plugged in simultaneously, the <strong>charger dynamically divides power across ports based on what’s plugged in</strong>. The dividing of power is by way of PPS protocols which speak to your devices to deliver only the wattage each is capable of receiving. If we say a MacBook Air, an iPhone, and an iPad are plugged in simultaneously, for example, the charger might deliver 45 watts to the laptop, 15 watts to the iPad, and 5 watts to the phone.</p>



<p>The three-port configuration includes <strong>a pair of USB-C ports and a USB-A port</strong>. The USB-C configuration for two ports is good for newer phones, tablets, and laptops, which have embraced USB-C but older devices like wireless headphones, fitness monitors, or Kindle readers, which are yet to conform, are dealt with by the USB-A port.</p>
<p>Also, GaN II technology <strong>enhances heat management</strong> better than traditional charger designs. The new circuit board architecture and stacked component arrangement allow for better heat dissipation, enabling the charger to remain cooler even for longer periods of use. It will warm up during high-charge sessions which is typical but it should not become unbearably hot, causing concern about leaving it on a charger for an entire night.</p>
<p>At $25, it’s costing about $8.33 per port for a charger that will do everything from our phones to our laptops. If we contrast it to getting individual chargers for each piece of equipment, we see how valuable it is. That it’s available at a price equal to July’s Prime Day’s cheapest, despite its absence of discounts for several months, makes it a good buy now.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meta-is-upset-amazon-has-dropped-the-meta%E2%80%AFquest%E2%80%AF3s%E2%80%AF128%E2%80%AFgb-price-for-the-third-time.1318339/</guid>

              <p>Getting into virtual reality has always meant making a tough choice: <strong>spend big on premium hardware or skip it entirely</strong>. Meta designed the Quest 3S to fix that problem, creating an entry point into mixed reality that doesn’t require a second mortgage. The catch? Meta rarely discounts their hardware. Instead of price cuts, they’ve traditionally thrown in free games or extended their Meta Horizon+ subscription for a few months. Actual savings on the headset itself simply didn’t happen.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Day is changing that pattern for the first time ever,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/"> dropping the 128GB Quest 3S with the Gorilla Tag Cardboard Hero Bundle from $299 to $249</a>. If you’ve been thinking about early holiday shopping or surprising someone with their first VR experience, this timing couldn’t be better.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Price Matters for Newcomers to Mixed Reality</h2>
<p>The Quest 3S is <strong>Meta’s most accessible path into current-generation mixed reality technology</strong>. At $249, you’re getting hardware that shares the same core processor as the more expensive Quest 3, the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip. This processor handles the demanding computational work of tracking your environment, rendering games at smooth frame rates, and blending virtual objects into your real-world surroundings.</p>
<p>Mixed reality overlays virtual information onto your own reality by way of passthrough cameras: You may play games where virtual entities speak to your furniture, construct virtual desks with multiple floating monitors all around your own workspace or work out and yet see your living room. This integration of worlds holds you <strong>anchored to your own space rather than isolating you from reality</strong>.</p>

<p>The headset runs at a whopping 1<strong>832 x 1920 pixels per eye at a 90Hz refresh rate</strong>. That type of resolution produces clear images for reading text within virtual worlds and perusing environmental objects within games. A 90Hz refresh rate also reduces motion blur during abrupt head movements, precluding motion sickness that plagued other VR headsets at lower refresh rates.</p>
<p>Installation is easy and <span><strong>cableless</strong></span>: The Quest 3S is a self-contained headset, so all of your processing occurs within the headset itself, eliminating your need for a gaming PC. You charge it through USB-C, mark your play space boundary with controllers, and are playing within a few minutes. <strong>Batter life averages two to three hours</strong> depending on your activity.</p>



<p>The 128GB of storage holds space for some 10 to 15 large games, depending on how large they are themselves. The physics-based <strong>multiplayer game Gorilla Tag, a game included here in this Amazon-only bundle</strong>, is incredibly popular among VR groups because after a little while of getting used to swinging your arms to build up speed, your movements end up feeling really intuitive. Themed cosmetic items for the game are included here as part of the Cardboard Hero bundle which means you can set your character before even getting going directly.</p>
<p>In addition to Gorilla Tag, y<strong>ou receive a three-month trial of Meta Horizon+</strong>, which grants access to more than 30 games through a rotating library. Games like Walkabout Mini Golf, Demeo, and Pistol Whip are offered, which allow for a change of pace directly without purchasing titles individually. New titles are released each month, so each month you have a new set of genres ranging from rhythm games through puzzle adventures to try out.</p>
<p>With games included at $249, Meta’s finally giving a real hardware discount on hardware actually delivering on promises of affordable mixed reality.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill 2 Remake Coming to PlayStation Plus, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-coming-to-playstation-plus-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-remake-coming-to-playstation-plus-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1318336/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Konami’s Silent Hill 2 Remake was delivered in scintillating fashion by Bloober Team. The reimagined horror classic smashed it in terms of sales and reviews, and PlayStation Plus subscribers could be in for an eerie Silent Hill 2 Remake treat.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-switch-2-xbox-rumor-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> captured the heart and soul of the terrifying 2001 original. If you’ve been waiting for it to be on sale or come to a subscription service, then you might want to sign up for PlayStation Plus Extra, if reports are to be believed.</p>



<h2 id="h-ps-plus-users-could-be-getting-silent-hill-2-remake">PS Plus Users Could Be Getting Silent Hill 2 Remake</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Free fear. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Word of the Silent Hill 2 Remake coming to PlayStation Plus comes from billbil-kun over at <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ce-remake-sorti-en-excluvisite-console-sur-ps5-va-debarquer-sur-le-ps-plus-extra-60622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>.</p>



<p>In an exclusive report, they had this to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“According to our recent information, we can say that&nbsp;Silent Hill 2, the remake of&nbsp;Konami’s&nbsp;classic released in 2021,&nbsp;will join the PlayStation Extra game catalog in October 2025. Barring any last-minute surprises, the title&nbsp;should be available on October 21.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It would make sense as a perfect Halloween treat. Furthermore, this announcement would come not long after the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-f-has-already-sold-over-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill f</a>—another launch met with universal praise and interest. We can tell you that if you’ve not had the chance to play the Silent Hill 2 Remake, yes, you should.</p>



<p>From its unnerving atmosphere to deranged nurses, it’s exhilarating from start to finish. If you get scared easily, you might want to have a couch to hide behind on standby.</p>



<p>Are you hoping this claim is true? Do you have PS Plus Extra or Premium already? If not, will the addition of Silent Hill 2 Remake push you to upgrade your subscription?

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marathon | Official Gameplay Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/techtestapply" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fill out the form on Bungie's website to sign up</a> now through October 16 at 4 PM PT / 7 PM ET. PC players can sign up there or via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/" rel="nofollow ">Steam</a> starting on October 13.</p><h2><strong>What's the closed technical test all about?</strong></h2><p>Bungie has held multiple closed tests for Marathon before, this one is similar in its objectives, which is to help give Bungie feedback about how the game is coming together.</p><p>"This is an important checkpoint for us as we test our improvements since Alpha, including three maps, five runner shells, prox chat, re-tuned combat pacing, solo queue, deeper environmental storytelling, and more," the developer said.</p><h2><strong>Sounds like Marathon is not coming soon</strong></h2><p>Bungie said it will share an update on Marathon's development with everyone "in the coming months" after this newest closed technical test concludes. The fact that there won't be an update for months suggests Marathon may not release very soon.</p><p>Marathon was originally scheduled to launch on September 23, but the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">delayed indefinitely back in June</a> to help give Bungie more time to shape and refine the experience.</p><p>Bungie owner Sony recently said it remains committed to pursuing live-service projects even amid some stumbles. The company said it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">put new systems in place to help ensure Marathon doesn't suffer the same fate as Concord.</a></p><p>PlayStation boss Hermen Hulst said feedback from Marathon's latest alpha test was "varied," but Sony maintains that the live-service category remains a "great opportunity" for the company. Concord, Hulst said, was "insufficiently differentiated" in a "hyper-competitive segment" of gaming, referring to live-service multiplayer games.</p><p>"We have reviewed our processes in light of this to deeply understand how and why that title failed to meet expectations and to ensure we're not going to make the same mistakes again," he said.</p><p>For Marathon, Hulst said the aim is to create a "very bold, very innovative, and deeply engaging title." The response to the Marathon alpha test was mixed, and Hulst said the whole idea of offering early tests is to gain feedback that can then be used to improve the product.</p><p>"This cycle of test, of iterate, test again, that is such a key component of the live-service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game," he said.</p><p>Hulst did not, however, comment on the controversy surrounding Marathon as it relates to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">Bungie admitting it found stolen art assets in Marathon.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" data-ref-id="1100-6530826">GameSpot's Marathon preview</a> said, "In a world of free-to-play titles, a paid game that is light on content but full of hopes, dreams, and ambitions may not be enough to inspire in others the same confidence I have in Bungie."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>First revealed at the start of the year during Xbox’s Developer Direct, Team Ninja and PlatinumGames have been working on a sequel to their HD trilogy of the long-running Ninja Gaiden series, with the first new title in more than a decade. While protagonist Ryu Hayabusa is still a driving force behind the narrative, this upcoming character action title focuses on a new hero: Yakumo, a Raven clan ninja and descendant of the Dark Dragon, who has been an antagonist of the Hayabusa clan throughout most of the series’ lifetime.</p>



<p>Not one to shy away from excessive amounts of blood and dismemberment, NINJA GAIDEN 4 is among the bloodiest action games I’ve played in a long time. Land a finishing blow on an enemy soldier, and their limbs will fly off, accompanied by a gratuitous shower of blood. While getting bathed in blood might be a core mechanic to the game, ala SUDA51’s recent roguelike Hotel Barcelona, it’s enough to make a squeamish ninja dog want to find the accessibility options and turn the blood splatter off. Yakumo can take advantage of the liquid potential to power up his Bloodraven form, a technique unique to him and a first for the series to take blood and utilize it as an attacking tool.</p>



<p>Yakumo is just as proficient in the art of the blade as series veteran Ryu Hayabusa and can bring a variety into combat, from the trusty katana to a thrusting spear and heavier hammer. Yakumo can don a pair of weapons at a time, with the second of the set being used for blood-based counterattacks and combo finishers. I gravitated towards the thrusting sword, something more akin to a war rapier than the type you’d find in fencing, that would transform into a massive drill in its bloodied form. While this wasn’t as effective against groups of enemies at a time, I still had access to the series staple Flying Swallow maneuver to dispatch enemies surrounding Yakumo, but just outside of melee range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Outside of boss fights, Yakumo is rarely caught in one-on-one situations, with enemy grunts preferring to group up on the solitary ninja from all angles. A soft target lock makes it easy to angle your attacks mid-combo from an enemy from one side to the next before launching them into the air and continuing your attacks in an aerial combo. Yakumo can also throw shuriken to preserve his combo momentum and temporarily stun enemies as he runs in for the approach. Swapping between weapon sets is just a button press away, and Yakumo can swap from his thrusting sword to a massive staff to twirl about and continue the onslaught, depending on the situation. Having this weapon transform into a massive rocket-powered hammer means it can be the best tool for breaking an enemy’s guard and armor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as the modern series is known for, Ninja Gaiden 4 is a masterclass in fast-paced ninja action and giving the player a multitude of tools to try and survive among the higher difficulty compared to other character action games. Yakumo can bring a limited number of healing items to battle, but he can just as easily recover a large chunk of lost health by way of his bloodraven form to absorb at least a portion of the health he’s lost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cyberpunk setting is something new for Ninja Gaiden and a natural evolution from the nighttime cityscapes that the modern trilogy showcased. Industrial grey buildings bathed in a curtain of constant nighttime rain and darker flooring and accents leave the perfect backdrop for the fast-paced combat to pop and not get lost in blurring the two together. While I personally would like to see a return to some of the more rustic landscapes of the Hayabusa Village, I would not be disappointed if the entirety of Ninja Gaiden 4 takes place in these futuristic cities.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 both surprised and delighted me with a challenge that I’ve found to be sorely missing from character action games of recent years. Besting the single boss of the Tokyo Game Show demo on the hardest difficulty available made me appreciate playing a far more aggressive playstyle and how the game allows players to adapt their fighting style differently to each type of enemy or boss. This was my first time getting to see Ninja Gaiden 4 firsthand, and it has already proven itself to be one of my most anticipated action titles of 2025. </p>



<p>The wait to play Ninja Gaiden 4 is nearly over, as the title <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will launch across Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 21st</a> and will be available day one on Xbox Game Pass for the Ultimate tier.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> modders continue to dig deep into the bag of tools Larian gave them and unleash their creativity on mods which don't just remix existing bits of the game, but add entirely custom elements. While custom campaigns and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-baldurs-gate-3-might-have-brought-back-candlekeep-the-library-fortress-where-baldurs-gate-began">new areas</a> rightly grab a lot of the headlines, custom companions have also been starting to arrive. The latest is a "cowboy wizard extraordinaire", a vocation that'll fit right in among the established party.</p>
<p>After all, people will likely be too busy staring at Withers' <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8738">modded big naturals</a> to question whether cowboys are a thing in the Forgotten Realms.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This conjuring cattlehand is called Jason Altea, and according to his creator Magnetuning was actually the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10086">first custom Baldur's Gate 3 NPC to be given proper custom voiced dialogue</a>, back when modders were initially working out how far they could push messing around with the game's dialogue system.</p>
<p>He's now morphed into a fully fleshed-out party member <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10000?tab=description">released in alpha form</a>, with around 200 lines of custom voiced lines and a range of interactions that'll make him feel like a proper member of the base game's crew, right down to getting involved in some of their chats. Altea also has his own quest, custom gear, spot in most camps, and the ability to approve or disapprove of your actions. He also comes with a sewing kit that can modify gear to match his unique body type.</p>

<p>While the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4928">ability to edit hirelings</a> has long been the easy way of making yourself a fairly rudimentary custom party member in BG3, as far as I can tell this might only be the second fully-blown new party member to arrive on Nexus Mods. Modder Queenplouton's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/13529?tab=description">The Bloodletter</a> is one, but aside from that, most of what I've found in a quick check have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12257">revolved around existing characters</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/3415">animal familiars</a>. This <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/18415">chest with teeth</a> may also count.</p><p>"Consider him in Early Access for the moment," Magnetuning wrote of Jason. "Some things in this initial release might be subject to change over time, he might not have as much reactivity as you'd expect yet, and you might run into bugs or edge cases I haven't accounted for. I put a list of known issues below, but please let me know if you run into anything else!"</p>
<p>They add that since Jason's an existing character they've previously written a <a href="https://herotune.itch.io/far-from-the-tree">visual novel</a> about, he's taken a bit of crowbarring into the established lore. So, maybe not one for the DnD purists.</p>
<p>If you fancy making orb bloke peeved by recruiting another wizard, the requirements to get this mod - dubbed A Candle In The Dark - are as follows: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8295">AV Item Shipment Framework</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16649">ImpUI_P8_Fork</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/353">P4 Patches</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/457">Tutorial Chest Summoning</a>.</p>

<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger’s Paradise Colosseum is packed full of battles to work through, which are crucial to completing The Great Omni Carnival side quest.</p>



<p>Unlocked by progressing through the main story, the Paradise Colosseum in Digimon Story: Time Stranger provides some of the toughest battles, so you’ll need to have the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-personality-guide-all-personalities-stat-boosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Personalities for each of your Digimon</a> and may require <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-digimon-story-time-stranger-digi-eggs-how-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">using Digi-Eggs</a> to unlock new Digivolutions.</p>



<p>Whether you’re new to the Colosseum or want to know how many more battles you need to tick off, we’ve got all the details in this guide.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Lots to do. Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Great Omni Carnival in Digimon Story: Time Stranger is unlocked relatively early, though you won’t be able to complete it until near the end of your journey.</strong></p>



<p>Completing the Great Omni Carnival side quest requires defeating all of the Paradise Colosseum matches, many of which are among the hardest battles available in the game. Even when you’re levelled up and comfortable against most opponents, these battles will still cause you trouble.</p>



<p>Matches in the Colosseum aren’t immediately unlocked either. Instead, they become available in intervals when certain unlock requirements are met in <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/digimon/digimon-story-time-stranger" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Time Stranger</a>, so you can’t sit down and grind all the battles immediately.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-digimon-story-time-stranger-paradise-colosseum-battles">All Digimon Story: Time Stranger Paradise Colosseum Battles</h2>



<p><strong>There are 22 total Paradise Colosseum battles to take on in Digimon Story: Time Stranger, the majority of which are not available immediately.</strong></p>



<p>The first six battles are unlocked as soon as you gain access to the Colosseum, with the others then becoming available when previous battles are completed, side quests have been ticked off, or specific spots in the story have been reached.</p>



<p>To make it easier for you to keep track of completed battles, all the details of the Colosseum battles are in the table below.</p>

                <p>One of the key talking points about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a> pre-release has been around the Open and Closed weapons playlists for multiplayer. For Battlefield 6, the developers are focusing on an Open weapons setup where people can pick any weapon, regardless of their class. The traditional Battlefield setup was that every class has its own unique and exclusive weapons. People <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-battlefield-6-is-approaching-locked-vs-open-class-weapons/1100-6534752/" data-ref-id="1100-6534752">made a lot of noise about this and how they wanted a Closed setup</a>, but data from the beta--which offered Open and Closed playlists--suggests statistically small differences in preference.</p><p>"The vast majority of players, after trying both playlist types, chose to stick with Open weapons. This reinforces our belief that Open weapons is the right path forward for Battlefield 6," the developer said in a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1975214752314937744" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. "We observed mostly identical class pick rates with 1-2% difference at most."</p>

            <p>Nintendo is seeking $4.5m in damages against a reddit moderator the company has accused of pirating its games.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed earlier this month with the US District Court for the Western District of Washington (thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3m2f3jyovbe2a">OatmealDome</a>), and according to a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.25.0.pdf">document</a>, Nintendo is accusing James Williams (known as "Archbox") of piracy having "facilitated a network of unauthorised 'shops'...that have offered to the public extensive libraries of pirated Nintendo Switch games for download."</p>
<p>Nintendo has accused Williams of copying and distributing its games, as well as actively promoting their distribution as a moderator on the SwitchPirates reddit group.</p>

<p>"Since 2019, Williams has been either directly or indirectly the owner, manager, operator, creator, administrator, supplier, and/or overseer of several online Pirate Shops, and has worked to actively promote these Pirate Shops to communities consisting of many thousands of individuals," the document reads.</p>
<p>Williams has been "instrumental in the planning, development, functioning, and proliferation" of these shops, while further promoting the shops, soliciting donations, and offering "technical advice and encouragement" through his position as moderator on reddit.</p>
<p>Further, Nintendo claimed Williams was "directly involved in creating, promoting, and  distributing the Circumvention Software to facilitate widespread use of the Pirate Shops".</p>
<p>Ahead of this lawsuit, Nintendo sent Williams a cease and desist letter back in March 2024. In response, Williams acknowledged his conduct violated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a>'s rights and "stated that he would work with NOA to satisfy its demands". However, Nintendo claimed he did not agree to cease his conduct and denied involvement with the piracy shops.</p>
<p>"When NOA requested that Defendant confirm in writing that he would comply with NOA's demands, he became combative and uncooperative," said Nintendo.</p>
<p>Since then, some of the piracy shops (or their content) have become inaccessible, while Williams is also accused of deleting or hiding evidence relevant to Nintendo's claims (such as social media posts).</p>
<p>Nintendo sent Williams a final opportunity to comply in May 2024, to which he stated an attorney would be in contact with Nintendo. However, "NOA never received any such outreach, and its efforts to contact Defendant's purported counsel were ignored," the document reads.</p>
<p>As a result, Nintendo has requested a default judgement be granted against Williams, along with damages of $4.5m due to a number of violations including copyright infringement, trafficking in circumvention devices, and breach of contract.</p>
<p>"Here, the amount of money sufficient to remedy NOA's injury would be extremely difficult to quantify; but it is indisputable that such amount would be large," the document reads. "Therefore, the money at stake by this Motion is nowhere near an amount that would compensate NOA for the seriousness of Defendants' conduct."</p>
<p>This lawsuit is the latest in Nintendo's ongoing actions against piracy.</p>
<p>Back in March, Nintendo claimed its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">victory over French file-sharing company Dstorage</a> was "significant…for the entire games industry". Then, in July, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbi-says-its-now-seized-multiple-rom-piracy-sites-claims-downloads-resulted-in-170m-losses-in-just-three-months">FBI seized a number of ROM piracy sites</a> it claimed had seen cumulative downloads of 3.2m in just three months, representing "an estimated loss of $170m.</p>

              <p>Having all your games in one place is not as impossible as it might seem. But with modern games pushing 100GB or more, the built-in storage on the Xbox Series X or S just doesn’t go far. The easiest way to boost your storage capacity is by getting your hands on a dedicated expansion card like this one from Seagate.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4557/">The massive 4TB version is now 24% off on Amazon, bringing the price down to $380</a>. It’s the largest officially licensed Xbox expansion card available on the market, but the deal might not be around for too long. We recommend acting fast to grab yourself one while it’s still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4557/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Enough Capacity for All Your Favorite Titles</h2>
<p>This expansion card is built in partnership with Xbox, so you can expect it to match the performance of your console’s internal SSD. Xbox Velocity Architecture support makes for fast load times and sharp graphics without any slowdowns. You can also play the games directly from the card without needing to transfer files back and forth. Simply insert it into the expansion slot on the back of your Xbox Series X or S, and it’s ready to go – literally within minutes.</p>
<p>The 4TB storage capacity is enough to house all your treasured titles across four generations of Xbox consoles. So, whether you’re after the latest releases or still can’t part ways with your Xbox 360 favorites, this card has enough room to keep everything in one place. Quick Resume support lets you jump between several games without losing your progress, both from the internal SSD and the expansion card. The switch is quick and will be especially appreciated by players who rotate between different games. You could be playing as a single player one minute, and then jumping into action with your friends the next!</p>



<p>Next-gen features are also taken care of. Plus, you’re getting a 3-year limited warranty with your purchase for some extra peace of mind. Should there be any issues down the line, you’re covered.</p>
<p>Altogether, this card does not just offer extra storage for your games. It also keeps up with the performance of your console. It’s designed around the Xbox Velocity Architecture, so speeds and output is going to be the same as what you get from your internal SSD. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4557/">It’s now down to $380, which is a $120 discount on the retail price of $500. If 4TB is too much space for you, consider going for the 1TB or 2TB version.</a></p>

<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger has a long list of Digimon available to add to your collection, though some are harder to obtain than others and require Digi-Eggs to be unlocked.</p>



<p>Time Stranger has plenty to sink your teeth into, ranging from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-personality-guide-all-personalities-stat-boosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all the Digimon Personalities</a> that provide stat boosts to the exact requirements needed to Digivolve into specific forms. Naturally, it’s impossible to remember everything.</p>



<p>That’s where we come in, though, as we’ve got all the details on every Digimon Story: Time Stranger Digi-Egg and how you can get your hands on them.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-digimon-story-time-stranger-digi-eggs">All Digimon Story: Time Stranger Digi-Eggs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Egg Thief! Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 10 varieties of Digi-Egg in Digimon Story: Time Stranger, all of which must be crafted in order for them to be obtained.</strong></p>



<p>Materials for crafting are gathered in both the human world and digital world, so exploration is key, and you’ll also require specific Attachments for the crafting recipe. However, you can remove them from Digimon if they are already equipped to them.</p>



<p>Aside from that, you’ll also require a hefty amount of Yen, as each Digi-Egg requires 10,000 yen. These eggs don’t hatch either; instead, they’re used to unlock specific Digivolutions.</p>



<p>A full list of Digi-Eggs in Digimon Story: Time Stranger and the required materials are shown in the table below. We’ve also detailed the Digivolutions they are needed for.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-digi-eggs-in-digimon-story-time-stranger">How to Get Digi-Eggs in Digimon Story: Time Stranger</h2>



<p><strong>Digi-Eggs only become available for crafting when you have unlocked Volcanusmon’s Crafting Shop via story progress in the game.</strong></p>



<p>Defeating Volcanusmon during the Incoming Conflict main mission unlocks the Crafting Shop, which is then the necessary point to visit for crafting Digi-Eggs.</p>



<p>Once this point in the story has been met, you can freely return to Volcanusmon’s Crafting Shop at any time to craft Digi-Eggs.</p>

            <p>Mina the Hollower, the next game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a> developer Yacht Club Games, has been delayed but is "<em>so</em> close to being done".</p>
<p>The Zelda-like adventure was intended for release on 31st October, but has been pushed back without a new release date, though the developer has stated it "isn't a major delay" but just "a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine".</p>
<p>"Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That's no hollow promise!" the studio stated.</p>

<p>"We don't want to announce another release date until it's submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line."</p>
<p>Yacht Club Games made its name with celebrated platformer Shovel Knight, which spawned a number of spin-offs.</p>
<p>Mina the Hollower is a change of pace, featuring a top-down adventure style reminiscent of Game Boy Zelda game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">Link's Awakening</a> in a gothic, Castlevania-esque world.</p>
<p>It continues the studio's penchant for retro aesthetics, then. Victoria <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-the-fabled-hollow-knight-the-much-anticipated-bloodlines-2-and-more">checked out the demo on Switch 2</a> a couple of months back and loved it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world%E2%80%99s-horror-themed-%E2%80%98nighthaven%E2%80%99-season-looks-so-good-it-has-players-eager-to-dive-back-into-the-mmorpg.1318264/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly a year since <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New World: Aeternum</a>, the relaunch of Amazon's MMORPG that introduced console versions with cross-play and a lot more. The developers were certainly hoping to get a big boost to the active player base, but that didn't quite happen.</p>



<p>However, that might change next week with the upcoming debut of Season 10, which is already garnering a lot of interest among MMO fans. Admittedly, it's not the most exciting time in the genre; sure, there's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-qa-homesteads-new-elite-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars 2 expansion Visions of Eternity</a> due later this month, and ZeniMax will release the Writhing Wall event for The Elder Scrolls Online, while Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has opened the Alpha test of World of Warcraft: Midnight</a>. But all those games are pretty old (if not very, very old) at this point. The only new MMORPG release of the year will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/mmo-game-pax-dei-launches-october-16-available-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pax Dei's 1.0</a>, which, unfortunately, does not look like it will be ready for prime time when it comes to polish and features.</p>



<p>Compared to the aforementioned games, New World is undoubtedly much more recent, having launched in September 2021. Some of you will even remember that it was quite popular at first, with Jeff Bezos <a href="https://wccftech.com/jeff-bezos-praises-amazon-games-for-its-first-success-with-new-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">applauding Amazon Game Studios for its first successful release</a>. That did not last due to a severe lack of content, which led players (myself included) to leave in droves.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="New World:  Dev Update - October 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vvYpd_GKLI?start=183&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It took a long time, but the New World development team is slowly getting there, and the new season is very appealing. Nighthaven will introduce an eponymous new zone that, in a lengthy dev diary, was described as the game's largest and most vertical map, contrasting with previous additions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-brimstone-sands-update-out-now-adds-a-new-zone-new-weapon-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brimstone Sands</a> (which was horizontal and barren). Visually, it is a love letter to classic horror with macabre, Eastern Europe-inspired aesthetics featuring towering castles, decrepit dungeons, and sweeping pine forests.</p>



<p>Not only does Nighthaven feature more points of interest, lore notes, and quests, it even adds some new interactive exploration and combat mechanics:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Falling Chandeliers:</strong> Shoot them to drop on enemies (or risk them falling on you), reinforcing "look up."</li>



<li><strong>Throwables and Flammables:</strong> Use torches or fire staffs to burn spider webs and rat nests, expanding on systems from Cutlass Keys' lightning fields.</li>



<li><strong>Doors and Secrets: </strong>Various doors (bookcase, metal, wooden, magic-locked) lead to hidden areas.</li>



<li><strong>Arcana Tarot System: </strong>Collect 22 major Arcana cards (with Aeternum twists) to unlock tarot towers, elite chests, and caches. Combines with ancient glyphs for puzzles; encourages exploration via jump pads instead of guides.</li>



<li><strong>New Exploration Elements:</strong> Swim through mazes, dodge lasers, use water jets/elevators for vertical traversal.</li>



<li><strong>Jump Pads:</strong> Borrowed from the OPR (Outpost Rush) mode for open-world traversal in the region.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are many horror-inspired creatures, from vampires to werewolves, bats, gargoyles, and even Frankenstein-inspired constructs, and a new story to follow, of course. But the most exciting additions to New World, at least for the long term, are arguably those that seek to expand the endgame.</p>



<p>First and foremost, there will be a new 10-man raid titled Isle of Night. This will be the new toughest PvE challenge in the game, featuring many new enemy types and three boss fights, each with unique mechanics to encourage group coordination. Amazon Game Studios is also adding a Catacombs mode where players venture into a procedurally generated dungeon with a countdown. Through a Catacombs run, they will obtain various power-ups and rewards and have to decide whether to keep going forward or exit before time runs out to retain the rewards. </p>



<p>Progression is getting a big shake-up as well. Level cap is increasing to 70, and the Gear Score is being raised from 725 to 800. Additionally, any Gear with Gear Score of 700 and more will be upgradeable all the way with the new Umbral system.</p>



<p>But there's more: gear can now have up to four empty sockets called Perk Charms, which are roughly split into four categories (offensive, defensive, skill, gems), allowing for greater build customization. Plus, the new gear from PvP, Catacombs, and the Isle of Night raid will feature set bonuses for the first time, making it even more important to get all the pieces in a set.</p>

<p>You need only <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1o02qyg/is_new_world_back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go to the MMORPG subreddit</a> to see that there are a lot of positive vibes among MMO fans about Nighthaven (which will go live on October 13 on PC and consoles) and New World as a whole. Could it be the start of a big comeback for Amazon's game? Hopefully, but even greater is the hope that the studio will have learned its lesson ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming The Lord of the Rings MMO they are making</a>.</p>

            <p>Right, it's time to get ahead of the game. Approach your router and force it to repeat the things Lightning McQueen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LaYn0541ro">says about speed</a> at the start of Cars, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has a launch patch coming and it sounds like it'll be weighty. EA say "over 200 changes" will be dropping as part of it and have also teased some potential future additions in their latest beta learnings post.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-play-your-way">said community update post</a>, EA said these 200 launch day tweaks are "focused on bug fixes, balance improvements, and polish for release". As a result, movement should feel more responsive, while the recoil of automatic weapons will be rebalanced and various gadgets have been tweaked.</p>
<p>Also among the list of changes the publishers have revealed here ahead of deploying the full notes on release are layout revision for Rush and Breakthrough maps "for better balance between attackers and defenders". Some improvements to the game's netcode should also "reduce desync, make time-to-death feel fairer, and address cases of invisible damage". Personally, I don't feel the time-to-death'll truly be fair until a person can live their entire natural lifespan within a Siege of Cairo skirmish, but this'll do for now.</p>
<p>While EA have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">already announced the stuff they'll be adding over the next few months as part of the shooter's first season</a>, they did also cheekily tease the potential return of some other features down the line. "Requests for naval warfare have not gone unnoticed, nor have the calls for a certain fan-favorite little helicopter, platoons, and more," they wrote.</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>That's far from the only observation EA have made through 92 million-ish hours of beta testing. They plan to offer both single and mixed mode playlists, but note that "players favoured playlists with combined modes". They said that "there were no differences of note" in terms of time spent battling in open weapons playlists vs closed ones, but found that players tended to stick with the former once they'd tried both. "This reinforces our belief that Open Weapons is the right path forward for Battlefield 6," EA declared, but noted that closed playlists will still be on offer at launch.</p>
<p>So, Call of Duty-style freedom in terms of weapon choice for different classes getting more of the spotlight, rather than the more traditionally Battlefieldy emphasis on running with the specific gun type your class is aimed at excelling with. The publishers also add they didn't spot one particular weapon type becoming dominant in terms of pick rate, instead saying things were "well-distributed", which is promising for the variety of bullet you're shot by each match if accurate.</p>
<p>There we go. Now the final few days' wait for Battlefield 6's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-release-time">full launch on October 10th</a> begin. If you can't stand five minutes without shootering, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/97-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-betas-early-cheaters-were-caught-within-30-minutes-of-sign-in-activision-say">ongoing beta</a> will <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes">run until October 9th</a>. It's like the two are trying to form their own mixed playlist.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite has a bunch of enjoyable modes and is regularly adding more, some of which prove to be extremely popular. Delulu certainly falls into that category, and we’ve got the full schedule of the mode.</p>



<p>Delulu mode in Fortnite introduced proximity chat to the game, leading to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-proximity-chat-led-to-thousands-banned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thousands being banned</a> over the first weekend of the mode, but those who have behaved have been able to enjoy a unique approach to Fortnite that allows for mid-game alliances and betrayals.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering when you can next dive into Delulu in Fortnite, take a peek at the full schedule. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-delulu-still-in-fortnite">Is Delulu Still in Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Squad up. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, the Delulu mode is still available in Fortnite for a limited time, though the doors are not open 24/7.</strong></p>



<p>The mode was initially planned to be a limited-time mode, but has proven to be extremely popular and has been extended significantly. In fact, we know that the Delulu mode will be available until the end of 2025.</p>



<p>That is significant as Chapter 7 in Fortnite is due to kick-off in early December, so confirmation that the mode will be available for at least the first month after that huge update suggests Delulu could be a long-term addition.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-delulu-fortnite-schedule">Full Delulu Fortnite Schedule</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite Delulu will be available every weekend until the end of 2025, starting at 6 AM PT on Friday and ending at 6 AM PT on Monday.</strong></p>



<p>Outside of these times, Delulu will not be available in Fortnite, so you’ll have to wait until the weekend calls to dive into the mode.</p>



<p>The table below shows the full Delulu schedule until the end of 2025.</p>

            <p>Physical copies of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> are in people's hands early, ahead of the official launch date of the 10th October. As such, it's been revealed the physical PS5 version of the game is entirely contained on the disk itself. No download required.</p>
<p>This was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nzhg5l/comment/ni2iofv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">stated by Reddit User Grecea_Vlad</a>, who posted their early copy of Battlefield 6 online and answered a few questions from the community. They confirmed that no download was required to boot up Battlefield 6 days ahead of launch.</p>
<p>This makes Battlefield 6 a bit of an irregularity. Other large AAA games have required additional content downloads once a disc is inserted due to the hefty file size of these games. It's also so these games can load faster, as it's faster for a console to load files from its internal storage than from the inserted disc.</p>

<p>What this means for Battlefield 6 players who buy a physical version is you'll simply be able to slap in your physical copy and get straight to playing, which is a bit of a rarity these days.</p>
<p>Other info was revealed about the game courtesy of Grecea's early copy, including the online servers being up-and-running already. Apparently there are even a few people already online and playing, which is fun.</p>
<p>EA and Battlefield Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-battlefield-6-seasonal-content-plans-unveiled-first-batch-arrives-a-few-weeks-after-launch">recently revealed the post-launch content plan for Battlefield 6</a>, which will start coming to the game on the 28th October. New modes, new maps, weapons and more will be added to the game entirely for free.</p>

            <p>Bungie has announced a closed technical test for its forthcoming shooter Marathon, which will take place later this month.</p>
<p>The limited, invite-only test will be in North America and Europe across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam, with players able to <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/techtestapply">sign-up now</a>. The test itself will take place from 22nd - 27th October.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">Marathon was fully revealed</a> back in April, but in June <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">Bungie indefinitely delayed the extraction shooter</a> due to "passionate" fan feedback that was heavily critical.</p>

<p>Since then, Bungie has run several closed tests to gather further feedback. Now, it's opening the playtests further.</p>
<p>"This is an important checkpoint for us as we test our improvements since Alpha, including three maps, five runner shells, prox chat, re-tuned combat pacing, solo queue, deeper environmental storytelling, and more," said Bungie. "That said, the Technical Test build is a work in progress and will only include a portion of what’s planned for Marathon’s full release, focused on the early player experience."</p>
<p>A public update on Marathon's development is due "in the coming months", following this playtest.</p>
<p>The test is also under NDA, meaning feedback won't be made public.</p>

<p>Development of Marathon feels like a critical time for Bungie. Following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">acquisition by Sony</a> back in 2022, Bungie has failed to release a hit game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> player counts have dropped, and the company has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue">rocked by accusations of toxicity right up until this year</a>.</p>
<p>Bungie admitted after Marathon's reveal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">the game used an external artist's work without permission</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">morale was reportedly in "free fall"</a> as it dealt with the response to the game.</p>
<p>CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-steps-down-following-years-of-criticism-layoffs-and-that-infamous-classic-car-collection">Pete Parsons has since left the company</a> after years of criticism and layoffs.</p>
<p>As for Sony, it's keen not to repeat mistakes made in the release of the ill-fated live-service shooter Concord, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-concord-developer-hits-back-at-criticism-of-bungies-marathon-reveal">Marathon has already been compared to</a>. Back in August, chief financial officer Lin Tao admitted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-concord-and-a-string-of-delays-and-cancellations-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly">the company's live-service strategy is "not entirely going smoothly"</a>.</p>

<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger has plenty to keep you occupied in the hunt to boast full completion, with an extensive trophy list and achievements to hunt down.</p>



<p>The Bandai Namco title arrived to mark the start of a huge period for fans of the creature-catching genre, landing ahead of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and there’s more than enough to digest—including mulling over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-personality-guide-all-personalities-stat-boosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which Personality is best for each Digimon</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re planning to tick off every task in the achievement and trophy list in Digimon Story: Time Stranger, we’ve got the full to-do list for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-digimon-story-time-stranger-trophies-amp-achievements">All Digimon Story: Time Stranger Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>

<p><strong>The trophy and achievement list in Digimon Story: Time Stranger has plenty to keep you occupied, with rewards for story progression and completing specific tasks.</strong></p>



<p>Many of the achievements and trophies that are not hidden are unlocked through generic progression, which should be unlocked with ease by just playing through the game. However, there are tasks to train on the Digifarm a specific number of times and to spend YEN in shops.</p>



<p>A full list of the Digimon Story: Time Stranger trophies and achievements are below, with the hidden tasks separated later in this article.</p>

<p><strong>There are 46 achievements and trophies to unlock in Digimon Story: Time Stranger, including the illustrious Platinum trophy for obtaining all other trophies.</strong></p>



<p>That task is still present for those on Xbox, though it awards zero Gamerscore and is merely the mark of a completionist. As usual, Xbox players have 1,000 total Gamerscore to hunt down.</p>



<p>Additional trophies and achievements could arrive in post-launch content, with the Season Pass offering plenty of DLC in the first year of the game.</p>

<p>Looking for a pick-me-up on a chilly morning (or afternoon, or whenever you happen to be reading this)? This five-minute arrangement of classic Koji Kondo tracks from the Mario series just might do the trick.</p>
<p>Recorded back on 23rd August, the WDR Funkhausorchester takes a delightfully brisk jog through some classic platforming tunes, spanning 1985's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a> (yes, that is now retro, folks) by way of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">SMB3</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">SM64</a>.</p>
<p>It's such a short and sweet arrangement that you may not want the included pieces spoiled. We'll put the timestamped titles at the bottom of the article, though - scroll down if you want 'em.</p>
<p>To those unfamiliar with this orchestra's oeuvre, the <a href="https://www1.wdr.de/orchester-und-chor/funkhausorchester/index.html">West German Broadcasting Cologne orchestra</a> has a broader focus beyond Classical...er, classics. So, in amongst your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo0Ys6caA_o">Blue Danubes</a> and your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4_i-CEoVQs">Paso Dobles</a>, they like to mix in some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5mU41YusfQ">Skyrim</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkdCADxlYXs">Great Giana Sisters</a>.</p>
<p>And no, <em>Funkhausorchester</em> doesn't mean 'Funk House Orchestra'. Unfortunately.</p>
<p>Anyhow, this cropped up on our feed and made us smile, so we thought we'd share. Let us know below if it gave a wee power-up on a Tuesday AM.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person according to Forbes, made a big claim yesterday when he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1975064769729327545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that the xAI Game Studio would release a 'great' full-scale AI generated videogame by the end of next year.</p>



<p>It was nearly a year ago when Musk, a known videogamer, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1861801046949191686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that xAI, known mainly for the Grok generative AI chatbot, would 'make games great again':</p>



<p><em>Too many game studios that are owned by massive corporations. @xAI is going to start an AI game studio to make games great again!</em></p>



<p>Grok is considered to be one of the top chatbots, but making a full-fledged AI generated game (and a 'great' one at that) seems like a task far beyond the currently available technology to xAI and anyone else, for that matter.</p>



<p>It was just two years ago when NVIDIA's VP of Applied Deep Learning Research Bryan Catanzaro, who can be considered the father of the DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling technology, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-predicts-dlss-10-will-offer-full-neural-rendering-interfaced-with-game-engines-for-much-better-visuals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>I do not believe that AI is gonna build games in a way where you just write a paragraph about making a cyberpunk game and then pop comes out something as good as Cyberpunk 2077. I do think that let's say DLSS 10 in the far future is going to be a completely neural rendering system that interfaces with a game engine in different ways, and because of that, it's going to be more immersive and more beautiful.</em></p>



<p>Over the last couple of years, there have been great advancements in the field of LLMs, but not nearly enough to create a great triple-A game yet, something I'm sure game developers are thankful for. That's not to say it will never happen, and AI will undoubtedly be used more and more in the gaming space, but to speed up and enhance the work of humans, not replace it outright. At least for the foreseeable future.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps%E2%80%99-secret-28-minute-cutscene-bizarrely-mentions-game-of-thrones-naughty-dog-and-bagels.1318228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans of the recently released Baby Steps have been humoured by the surfacing of a nearly 30-minute cutscene in the game that’s only unlocked after ticking some major boxes. If you skip every cutscene in the game (which is no simple feat), you’ll unlock a secret cutscene that runs for a whopping 28 minutes, but it’s <strong>bizarre</strong>.</p>



<p>The secret Baby Steps cutscene is simply the game’s two lead actors (and developers), Gabe Cuzzillo and Bennett Foddy, sitting outside a log cabin and chatting about their real lives, including Game of Thrones rewatches, bagel fillings, and Naughty Dog’s games.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-miss-uncharted-i-wish-they-d-bring-it-back">‘I Miss Uncharted, I Wish They’d Bring it Back’</h2>



<p>In a video uploaded to YouTube, one creator uncovered the full, secret cutscene in Baby Steps, which comes in at a staggering 28 minutes and is seen by some as a ‘punishment’ for skipping every cutscene in the game.</p>



<p>That’s how you unlock the secret cutscene – you have to skip <strong>everything </strong>that comes before.</p>

<p>It’s a mildly motion-capped sequence that sees Nate (Gabe Cuzzillo) and Moose (Bennett Foddy) sitting outside a log cabin and chinwagging about life, pulling away from Baby Steps entirely, and gassing about all manner of things.</p>



<p>They test the limits of their motion capture equipment, rib the player for skipping cutscenes, and determine whether or not they should take a nap while being filmed.</p>



<p>At one point, they dive into the topic of Naughty Dog:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Foddy: </strong>I miss Uncharted, I wish they’d bring it back.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>It has been a while.</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> I don’t think they’re going to do another new one.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>That new one looks alright.</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> Which one? The ‘space Uncharted’?</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>Yeah, that one looks good. I’m going to play that.</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> I’m not going to skip any of those cutscenes.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>You see how they put her jacket on, that’s insane!</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> People don’t know what’s involved in that.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>That’s the most impressive thing I’ve seen in my life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The pair go on to talk about putting broccoli in bagels, what else they had for lunch, and how Foddy’s Game of Thrones rewatch is going on, with Cuzzillo slipping in some casual spoilers for the viewers.</p>



<p>They even take a sidestep into talking about famous clowns, including Pennywise, The Joker, and Ronald McDonald.</p>



<p>As the segment unravels, the two actors discuss whether or not the player has skipped <strong>this </strong>cutscene before stressing that they need to use the bathroom and they can’t leave until things have played out to an undetermined end.</p>



<p>It ends with them ‘going to find the credits guy’ to get them rolling, suggesting that they’d ‘rough him up’ to bring in the end of the game. </p>



<p>This is probably one of the best secret cutscenes ever seen in a game, and it really humanized the actors quite nicely. Let me know if you already found this cutscene over on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Activision has unveiled a poster for this year’s iteration of The Haunting, the annual Halloween-themed event that hits the Call of Duty platform every October. This time around, players will come face-to-face with Predator.</p>



<p>The first news regarding this year’s The Haunting event was featured in a blog post published yesterday on the Call of Duty site. It was mentioned that The Haunting lands with the final season of Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone, and that <strong>all</strong> studio partners have weighed in on the event in some capacity.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-happening-with-the-haunting-this-year">What’s Happening with The Haunting This Year?</h2>



<p>The recent <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty blog post</a> didn’t do much to clear up what’s coming in The Haunting 2025:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Haunting will return with Season 06 of Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone, and we (including all our studio partners) have some Halloween fun just around the corner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>All we know is that The Haunting starts this week, on October 9th. It arrives as the Black Ops 7 beta comes to an end, marking the closure of a divisive, debate-laden trial period that has produced mixed feelings about this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>Here’s the post (and poster) that was uploaded to social media by Activision:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Shortly after announcing The Haunting 2025 with the poster, the Call of Duty team responded ‘ok’ <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1975327267858293053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a post</a> from September 2023 requesting that Activision add a Predator skin to the game. It was a strange throwback, but perhaps it reveals how long the team has been considering this idea.</p>



<p>Last year’s The Haunting event ran between September and October and introduced Mike Myers, a character tied to the Call of Duty series, in a rather nostalgic way (IYKYK). Activision’s studios prepared spooky map variants, new modes including Zombie Royale and Hordepoint, and a fresh reward path for those participating in the event.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that The Haunting 2025 will be a similar affair.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The announcement for PowerWash Simulator 2’s release date was slated to drop this week, but in an early trailer upload, the beans have been spilled. It has been three years since the first PowerWash Simulator game dropped, entertaining gamers everywhere and allowing them to clean everything from skateparks to carnival rides, and from trains to planes, with high-powered power washers.</p>



<p>The trailer has since been removed from YouTube, but not before eagle-eyed gamers were able to capture the release date for PowerWash Simulator 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-powerwash-simulator-2-coming-out">When is PowerWash Simulator 2 Coming Out?</h2>



<p>In the leaked trailer (which no longer exists), <strong>it was revealed that PowerWash Simulator 2 is coming out on October 26</strong>.</p>



<p>Early impressions of PowerWash Simulator 2 have been positive, even if it’s understandably tough to improve upon such a simple concept. In PowerWash Simulator 2, you’re still cleaning things with power washers and utilizing an array of attachments and cleaning liquids, but previews have remarked on how ‘different’ it manages to feel.</p>



<p>The news regarding the leaked trailer was published on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nzlvtg/powerwash_simulator_2_release_date_trailer_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, with one user sharing the link to the now removed release date trailer for PowerWash Simulator 2. Using an archive platform simply reveals that the video now sits in a private state, ready to go live soon.</p>



<p>In the comments under the original post on Reddit, fans of the original PowerWash Simulator game were raving about how good it was. There are recollections of users pouring over 100 hours into the game, spraying endlessly, and cleaning dirt from surfaces in a game that’s pure relaxation and satisfaction.</p>



<p>Many have dubbed it an incoming Game of the Year contender, but that’s tongue-in-cheek at best.</p>

                <p>FromSoft's massively popular--and just plain massive in general--received a co-op spinoff called Elden Ring: Nightreign earlier this year. The game sees groups of 1-3 players teaming up to take on the titanic threats in the new realm of Limgrave. It's been a hit with fans and critics alike, but it's also a big departure from the gameplay of the original Elden Ring. If you've been on the fence, now is a great time to give it a chance, as the Amazon-exclusive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elden Ring: Nightreign Deluxe Edition</a> is discounted to $45 for Big Deals Days.

Players team up, choose a boss they want to fight, and then set off on an expedition that takes around 35- to 45-minutes to complete. This journey is split across three in-game days, as during the day your team will explore the land of Limveld--an alternate version of Elden Ring's Limgrave--and level up for the fight ahead of them.</p><p>Before your squad gets to the main boss, they'll have to take on smaller bosses as the map closes in on them, and on the third day, the grand showdown begins. This core gameplay loop has gone over well with fans, and it has been further polished with post-launch support since then.</p><p>"Elden Ring's DNA is ever-present, but Nightreign is also a game of striking subversions: a From Software game that asks you to play it unconventionally, disregarding meticulous exploration, isolation, and measured combat for a cooperative multiplayer game built on speed and aggression. In many ways, it's the antithesis of what people typically come to From Software games for, and yet somehow, someway, this experimental non-sequel is an absolute triumph," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/">Elden Ring: Nightrein review</a>.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you haven't played it yet, the original Elden Ring game is also on sale. Amazon is offering the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SPYK271?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4 physical edition</a> for $30 (was $40), while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09743F8P6?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 and Xbox Series X versions</a> have been discounted to $40 (were $50). If you're planning to play on PS5, the PS4 deal is the best one here because Bandai Namco released a free upgrade for it a few years ago. This added an optional performance mode on PS5 that targets 60fps, increased graphical quality, ray tracing, and several other tweaks to Elden Ring's visuals. Elden Ring is considered to be one of From Software's greatest games, and is well worth picking up while it's discounted.</p><h2>Elden Ring Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4576173-eldenringroadtoerdtree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576173" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4576173-eldenringroadtoerdtree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576173"></a><figcaption>Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4576173-eldenringroadtoerdtree.jpg"></figure><p>For a different spin on Elden Ring, check out the official Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree manga.

It's also part of Bandai Namco's infamous "UGSF" crossover universe that includes Galaga, Galaxian, Dig-Dug, Mr. Driller, and even Ace Combat 3 as canon entries--which means fans of classic Bandai Namco series can expect plenty of easter eggs and in-universe references to all those games and more. </p><p>Looking for more metroidvanias? You'll find a digital code for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hollow-Knight-Silksong-Standard-Nintendo/dp/B0FPJHY6T3?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> on sale at Amazon as well. The highly anticipated game has lived up to the hype--though many find it to be remarkably difficult, thanks to punishing bosses and tricky environmental hazards.</p><p>For additional Pac-Man gear, check out the vibrant <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-PAC-MAN-5-foot-tall-full-size-stand-up-linux/dp/B0BYQNPTCF?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcade1Up Pac-Man Deluxe Arcade Machine</a>. Along with several classic Pac-Man games, it lets you play titles like Dig Dug, Galaga, Mappy, and other retro hits. If you don't have the space for a full cabinet, the tiny <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Classics-Pac-Man-4-Color-Screen/dp/B0CRX25RKK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcade Classics: Pac-Man Edition</a> might be a better fit. It's much cheaper and fits in the palm of your hand, yet still comes with a color screen, classic music, and a tiny control panel.</p><p>For more Prime Big Deal Days discounts on video games, anime, and beyond, be sure to check <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">GameSpot's deals hub</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-powera-cheap-wireless-controller-super-mario-amazon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Super Mario And Kirby Switch 2 Wireless Controllers For Up To 50% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-audible-premium-plus-sign-up-prime-big-deal-days-black-friday-holiday-2025-deal/1100-6524536/">Audible Premium Plus Holiday Deal: Get 3 Audiobooks For $3</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-big-deal-days-4k-blu-ray-best-deals/1100-6535093/">Prime Big Deal Days Movie Sale: Check Out Amazon's B2G1 Free 4K Blu-Ray Catalog</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/">ROG Xbox Ally X Preorders In Stock At Best Buy, Sold Out Everywhere Else (September 27)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-trading-cards-restock-where-to-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target/2900-6271/">New Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Chocobo Bundle &amp; Scene Boxes Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-game-boy-restocked-at-amazon-and-its-shipping-early/1100-6533358/">You Can Get The $60 Lego Game Boy Early From Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/history-of-middle-earth-5440-page-box-set-drops-to-all-time-best-price-for-big-deal-days/1100-6526926/">Complete History Of Middle-Earth Collector's Box Set Restocked With $170 Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-shining-movie-4k-blu-ray-special-edition-steelbook-the-film-vault/1100-6534223/">The Shining's New Numbered Limited Edition Is Up For Grabs At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

That could be an expensive undertaking at any other time, but thankfully, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Big Deal Days</a> is here with plenty of discounted titles to help you achieve that goal.
