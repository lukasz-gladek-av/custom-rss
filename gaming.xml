<p>Announcing the 'Woolhaven' expansion</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Every developer is rushing to get their last announcements of 2025 out the door, and with this in mind, the team behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cult_of_the_lamb">Cult of the Lamb</a> has today locked in a date for their new expansion, which will be dropping on Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>The Massive Monster family confirmed in a special "mid-winter showcase" that <strong>Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven</strong> would be releasing on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong> for <strong>$16.99</strong> (<em>or your regional equivalent</em>).</p>
<p>This expansion will continue from the main story, and begins when an "unexpected calling from the forgotten God takes you on a perilous new adventure" across a mountain to Woolhaven, the "ancestral home of the Lambs".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yngya, the God of Winter, unleashes frost and snow across the land, making keeping your flock safe, warm, fed and watered the greatest – and most <em>rewarding</em> – challenge faced by The Lamb yet."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will come loaded with new dungeons, buildings, weapons, characters, quests and systems. There's also a new "ranching system" – allowing you to tame, ride...and <em>eat</em> majestic beasts. You can find out more in the showcase video below:</p>

<p>For a limited time, you can also pick up the base game of this roguelite for 50% off its usual price in select regions (bringing it down to <strong>$12.49 / £11.24</strong>). In some other news today, a new expansion has also been announced for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:135857,195359 @ 1765869935 -->
<p>Will you be returning to Cult of the Lamb on the Switch to try out this new expansion? Or do you still need to play through the base game and other content? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Liam is a news writer and reviewer across Hookshot Media.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/infinity-ward-debunk-recent-modern-warfare-4-leaks/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, a claim surfaced on social media suggesting that 2026’s Modern Warfare 4, the rumored next release in the Call of Duty series, will be ‘a complete copy of Modern Warfare 2’ from 2022. It was suggested that the upcoming game’s multiplayer platform is a carbon copy of the 2022 title, right down to the ‘excessive visual recoil’ mechanics.</p>



<p>However, Infinity Ward recently signed off social media for the festive window, chiming in with a comment that directly flies in the face of this claim, prompting Call of Duty fans to lose their minds.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-modern-warfare-4-a-copy-or-not">Is Modern Warfare 4 a Copy or Not?</h2>



<p>TheGhostofHope, a reliable Call of Duty leaker, recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-4-multiplayer-is-reportedly-a-complete-copy-of-modern-warfare-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to social media</a> with a bombshell claim:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Modern Warfare 4 Multiplayer in its current state is currently a complete copy of Modern Warfare II except for no perk charging system and less ADS/slide penalties.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He expanded soon after:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There is A TON of visual recoil on weapons in Modern Warfare 4 just like Modern Warfare II. Like I said in my last tweet it’s pretty much a complete copy outside of a few little things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were quick to criticize the comments, while others revelled in the news. Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer platform wasn’t <strong>that bad</strong>, all things considered.</p>



<p>However, in the days that followed, Infinity Ward snapped onto social media with a clear message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Happy holidays everybody! </p>



<p>Wishing our community an awesome holiday season and looking forward to talking soon. </p>



<p><strong>Don’t believe everything you read on the Internet.</strong> </p>



<p>See you in 2026.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team is almost certainly disputing the recent Modern Warfare 4 claims, and TheGhostofHope was quick to respond as he came under fire:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Just gonna address this cause it seems like the perfect time to do so. I have been leaking Call of Duty for years and anybody who has followed me for a long time knows that. </p><p>I have leaked a ton of things about Vanguard, MWII, MWIII, BO6, BO7 before anybody else. Have I gotten…</p></div>— Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/2000713405204988390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>TheGhostofHope’s followers rallied, suggesting that the leaker has ‘never been wrong’ about anything in the Call of Duty space.</p>







<p>What do you think? Do you believe Infinity Ward is trying to save face, or is Modern Warfare 4 genuinely a copy and paste of Modern Warfare 2? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fewer-than-escape-from-tarkov-players-completed-game/</link>
            <guid>1384276</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Before Escape from Tarkov hit 1.0 on November 15, Battlestate Games professed how difficult it would be to ultimately <strong>complete the game’s</strong> new campaign. The crushing difficulty and lengthy challenges of the story mode added with 1.0 would push even the most talented players to their limits, and the latest numbers indicate they weren’t lying.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, Battlestate Games revealed that one million copies of the game have been sold since November 15, on top of the millions that were purchased before 1.0 was released.</p>



<p>They also shared that just 500 PMCs have completed the game, representing a drastically small minority.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-is-the-hardest-game-ever-made">Escape from Tarkov is the Hardest Game Ever Made</h2>



<p>If you take the 500 PMCs that have successfully run through to the end of Escape from Tarkov since the one million copies were sold post-launch, you get 0.5% of players.</p>



<p>If we assume that at least five times as many copies were sold <strong>pre</strong>-launch, you drill down to fewer than 0.1% of players having completed the game. The numbers are rough, but as Battlestate Games has never been transparent with the figures, it’s the best we have to go on.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that the Escape from Tarkov campaign has only been around for <strong>one month</strong>. In that time, the concept of completing it has been available to very few people, and casual players will likely spend months trying to conquer it.</p>



<p>On December 1st, Battlestate Games revealed that Tigz, a streamer, was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first person in the world</a> to complete Escape from Tarkov, and in the days that followed, 500 more players managed to secure that accolade.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Since its release, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EscapefromTarkov?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EscapefromTarkov</a> has sold over one million copies.</p><p>In the first month alone, players spent a total of 135,000,000 hours (or 15,410 years) in the Norvinsk region. This is equivalent to over 200 million full Customs raids, had each lasted until the final minute… <a href="https://t.co/dZnCBV7Bdg">pic.twitter.com/dZnCBV7Bdg</a></p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/2000619759784583446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Now, in a new social post, the team has set up more numbers, alongside a celebration of one million sales post-launch and a new promo code (<strong>ONEMILLIONPLUS</strong>) for all players to enjoy.</p>



<p>But why is this important?</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has always been considered one of the toughest games ever made. It’s a punishing thing that breaks gamers every day, offering a soul-crushing gameplay loop that requires players to load up, run a raid, and hopefully make it out alive.</p>



<p>At any point, a single, well-placed bullet can end everything, stripping them of their progress and their equipment.</p>



<p>There are no maps, no markers, no guidance lines, and no hand-holding mechanics. It’s a brutal experience, and that’s why only 500 players in the world have managed to complete the game thus far.</p>



<p>The number proposed here is 0.1%, but it’s likely lower than that. Escape from Tarkov was on the market for almost a decade in alpha and beta states, and that’s assuming that it sold just five million copies in that time.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has just shared the news that Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter, has sold <strong>one million copies</strong> since hitting 1.0 on November 15. The game underwent an overhaul in November, marking it as a fully released game, and since that happened, it has been going like gangbusters.</p>



<p>The team also revealed that players have spent a collective 15,410 years in the game since November 15, equivalent to over 200 million full raids on Customs.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-still-on-top">Escape from Tarkov (Still) on Top</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is, in the eyes of many, the best extraction shooter ever made. It has stiff competition these days and more on the horizon, but regardless of what surfaces, it almost always remains the number one extraction game going. The most challenging threat the game has faced in recent years is ARC Raiders, but it’s still holding its own.</p>



<p>On November 15, Battlestate Games released the 1.0 update for Escape from Tarkov, bringing the game into a graduated state from the alpha and beta stages it sat in for almost a decade. With this full release having been logged, the team now looks to future projects, including new games, post-launch DLC, and even a console release.</p>



<p>To celebrate the one million milestone, Escape from Tarkov’s developers released a new promo code for all players to enjoy:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>ONEMILLIONPLUS</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s also important to stress that this is the first time Battlestate Games has shared sales figures for Escape from Tarkov. Over the years, estimations have been made, but the team has never been transparent about how many copies Tarkov has shipped. </p>



<p>This figure gives us an idea of how popular Escape from Tarkov has been since its release, but it doesn’t account for the (potentially) tens of millions of copies sold in the last decade.</p>

US Steam showed the largest lift." For December 13th, Circana notes that daily active users reached 13th on Steam, 30th on PlayStation, and 33rd on Xbox, all in the US. For added context, Piscatella told GameSpot that, "In this example, engagement means anyone that started the game. If someone just looked at the menu or played for 24 hours straight it counts. Active player means the percentage of all people who played any game that day on PS, XBX or Steam."</p><p>Expedition 33 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">made history at The Game Awards</a>, by winning nine out of the 13 categories it was nominated in.

<p>This follows Nintendo releasing a "year in review" feature for the Nintendo Music app last week. It allows users to see their most-played tracks, playlist and soundtrack. Nintendo also recently added the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yoshis_crafted_world">Yoshi's Crafted World</a> soundtrack to the app as well as a "special" sample of tracks from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a Pokémon Trainer or have one in your life, today's Daily Deals is going to save you a small fortune. From the best Pokémon TCG bargains to a great deal on the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, I've got you. You can also check out my more comprehensive list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-gift-ideas-2025">best Pokémon gifts for 2025</a> for more options than what I've listed here.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Top Pokémon Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've even taken the liberty of finding the best deals on the top chase cards for every Pokémon TCG expansion in the Mega Evolution and Scarlet &amp; Violet eras, so you can pick up some awesome chase cards instead of busting a bag full of Pokédollars on booster packs. I even found some awesome Pokémon Squishmallow deals to boot, so let's get straight into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Single Card Price Crash</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG stock levels are getting better and better across the board, which means there's more chance of buying off store shelves and a much bigger chance of scalpers losing out. It's a win-win, especially for Pokémon card collectors, as single cards are finding a new floor when it comes to market values.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the best time this year to snap up some of those grails you've been eyeing up, so I've found the top 5 chase cards in every Pokémon TCG expansion and base set from the previous Scarlet and Violet era, as well as Mega Evolution, the current era of Pokémon cards. There's some serious bargains to be had here, and I reckon we'll see prices tick back up when Ascended Heroes launches early next year, so don't wait around.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Best Pokémon TCG Sealed Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best deal here for me is the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra Premium Collection that's currently at market value on Amazon and close to MSRP. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>4 x Phantasmal Flames</li><li>4 x Mega Evolution</li><li>4 x Destined Rivals</li><li>4 x Journey Together</li><li>2 x Surging Sparks</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The main pull of this UPC is the Mega Charizard X ex Mega Attack Rare and Oricorio ex SIR promo cards, which, frankly, are the best couple of promo cards we've had in a big box collection for a while. It also contains Mega Charizard X-themed card sleeves, deck box, damage counter dice, playmat, and a metal coin.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Legends: Z-A and More Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Need to get Pokémon Legends: Z-A sorted for Christmas? Here's the cheapest way: the Nintendo Switch 1 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A for $44.99 on Woot, then upgrade it to the Switch 2 version for $9.99 via the Amazon digital code service. You're saving $15 over buying the usual Switch 2 copy of Legends: Z-A.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot also has more discounts on top Pokémon Switch games, such as Legends: Arceus alongside Scarlet and Violet. It's a great time to build up your library if you've got a few Pokémon-sized gaps on your shelf.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Squishmallow Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nothing beats cuddling a Squishmallow, and I'll admit that to anyone. Well, getting a $69.99 massive 20-inch Sprigatito Squishmallow for $37.99 definitely beats that feeling, but there's some great deals on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-plushies">best Pokémon plushies</a> right now (in my opinion, which is correct).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <title><![CDATA[Team Cherry Announces Hollow Knight Silksong: Sea of Sorrow, A Free DLC Expansion Arriving in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/team-cherry-hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-sea-of-sorrow-release-date/</link>
            <guid>1384222</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Team Cherry has <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">announced its first DLC expansion</a> for Hollow Knight Silksong, due to arrive next year. Hollow Knight Silksong: Sea of Sorrow will arrive on all platforms sometime in 2026, and when it does, it'll be free for all players. Not only that, but Hollow Knight will make its Nintendo Switch 2 debut next year, and since launch, Silksong has sold over seven million copies. </p>



<p>After so much silence, followed by one very loud boom, to already know about Hollow Knight Silksong DLC, and to be hearing so much about what's coming for both Hollow Knight games, doesn't feel right. It's exciting, though, particularly because you can't imagine that Team Cherry <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-team-cherry/">would take seven years on a project that is initially meant to be just an expansion again.</a> At least not with back-to-back games, right?</p>



<p>That means Sea of Sorrow will arrive in 2026, barring any delays. The initial teaser trailer doesn't showcase any gameplay, unfortunately, but it does feature more of the game's excellent art, and it's an exciting proposition to be getting a more water-based area.</p>



<p>"<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong - Sea of Sorrow is coming in 2026!</em>" the teaser's description reads. "<em>Voyage across and beneath the salt-stricken seas in this thrilling expansion, free for all players.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>With Hollow Knight: Silksong’s launch year coming to a close, we wanted to take a moment and share a peek at what we’ve been working on, what’s available now, and what’s coming in 2026</em>," Team Cherry began in a blog post.</p>



<p>"<em>But firstly, and most importantly, we wanted to say a huge thank you to all the players who’ve braved Silksong’s distant and dangerous lands. That’s over seven million of you who’ve purchased the game, alongside millions more playing on Xbox Game Pass!</em> <em>It’s a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected (enough to crash all of the storefronts!). Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game’s challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home. Your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further. That first big expansion is already well underway!</em>"</p>



<p>The blog post goes on to confirm that the "<em>nautically themed expansion</em>" will feature "<em>new areas, bosses, tools, and more</em>." Team Cherry says it'll reveal more about Sea of Sorrow "<em>shortly before</em>" its release date next year.</p>



<p>As for the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Hollow Knight, this new version will include: "<em>all the updates and enhancements that Silksong received on the platform: High frame-rate modes, higher resolutions, and many additional graphical effects</em>," and, like the update between the Switch and Switch 2 version of Silksong, be entirely free.</p>



<p>If you have the game on PC on Steam or GOG, you can check out the new changes now through a public beta branch that's now live. It also includes support for 16:10 and 21:9 monitors, so players with an ultrawide screen can take advantage of the update right away if they like.</p>



<p>Silksong launched this past September, and since its arrival, it's been one of the biggest games this year. We already knew that Team Cherry <a href="https://wccftech.com/team-cherry-hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-thinking-about-non-hollow-knight-games/">was working on DLC</a>, but it's even more exciting to know that we can all ring in the new year knowing that we'll be able to check it out sooner than later.</p>

                <p>A few years ago, Nightdive Studios resurrected the classic Nintendo 64 FPS series, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, with enhanced remasters on PC and consoles. While all three games in the series were originally released as standalone digital editions between 2018 and 2023, they were recently collected into the physical The Turok Trilogy Bundle, which launched for PS5 and Nintendo Switch on October 31. And now, just a few weeks since launch, the collection is up to $30 off at multiple online retailers. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Save+Up+To+30%25+On+The+Turok+Trilogy+Bundle+For+Switch+And+PS5&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-12-15+14%3A13%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-15+18%3A20%3A50&amp;fnarticle_id=6536984&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3DTurok%2BTrilogy%2BBundle%26lang%3Ddefault%26start%3D0%26sz%3D20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnightdive-turok-trilogy-bundle-physical-ps5-switch-deal%2F1100-6536984%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a> currently has the best deal, offering the PS5 and Switch editions for just $28 (was $40).

The game was followed by two single-player sequels, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil and Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion--both released on Nintendo 64. The trilogy follows various warriors who take up the mantle of Turok--warriors who protect Earth and a parallel dimension known as the Lost Land from prehistoric monsters, high-tech super soldiers, and inter-dimensional aliens. The series also features the multiplayer deathmatch spin-off for N64, Turok: Rage Wars, and the prequel entry, Turok: Evolution, which launched on GameCube, PS2, Xbox, and PC in 2002.</p><p>A reboot set outside the original series, simply titled Turok, launched in 2008 on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC, but received middling reviews and poor sales. The series was largely considered dead until Nightdive's remaster trilogy, and now the franchise is set to return with its first all-new entry in almost 20 years with Turok Origins, a new third-person shooter reboot in development from Saber Interactive.

This one is much smaller than the 1.4.0 update that dropped at the start of December.</p>
<p>Here's what you can expect from Version 1.4.1, according to the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world">official Nintendo support page</a>. It addresses an issue tied to controller disconnects and reconnects. If there is anything else going on behind the scenes with this latest update, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<h2>Mario Kart World: Ver. 1.4.1 (Released December 15, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where, if a player disconnects and reconnects a controller, the game may not progress as normal.
<ul>
<li>When this issue occurs, there are times when ghost data from Time Trials will be deleted without warning from “View Rankings.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Free update and free upgrade confirmed</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Before the talented developer Team Cherry signs off for 2025, it's got <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">some exciting news</a> to share. The "first big" <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> expansion is already in the works and is scheduled to arrive in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This new content, officially titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow">Hollow Knight: Silksong - Sea of Sorrow</a>, will come packed with new areas, bosses, tools and much more. Perhaps, best of all, it's free to all players when it arrives next year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We’ll keep further details a secret for now, but expect additional info shortly before <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong - Sea of Sorrow</em> releases."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Alongside this, the team has revealed <strong>seven million</strong> people have now purchased Silksong (alongside "millions more playing on Xbox Game Pass").</p>

<p>In addition to the expansion, the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> game will also be getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a> at some point in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This will incorporate all the updates and enhancements that Silksong received on the new hybrid platform, including "high frame-rate modes, higher resolutions and many additional graphical effects".</p>
<p>If you already own the Switch version of this title, you'll be able to download the Switch 2 release for free when it launches in 2026. In the lead up to this, Team Cherry is also updating the original game for current platforms with added features and bug fixes, and says it's got "even more plans" for next year.</p>
<p>Various Hollow Knight game sales will also be appearing across storefronts during the holiday season, so if you haven't already played these titles, you'll be able to get them at a discounted price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The 2017 indie Metroidvania, Hollow Knight, is making its way to Nintendo Switch 2. A port of the game was announced by Team Cherry alongside <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-expansion-sea-of-sorrow-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a free DLC expansion</a> for Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>



<p>Released in 2017, Hollow Knight started as a Kickstarter before becoming the game it’s known as today. As the nameless Knight, you’ll tackle a multitude of hard bosses and explore the bug-infested world of Hallownest. Known for its brutal difficulty and beautiful visuals, the Team Cherry title has become one of the most successful indies of the 2010s. Its spinoff, Hollow Knight: Silksong, released in 2025 and went on to receive multiple awards and nominations, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several Game of the Year nods</a>. Now, the team is bringing the world to a new console: the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>







<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition-announced-free-upgrade-for-nintendo-switch-owners">Hollow Knight: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Announced, Free Upgrade for Nintendo Switch Owners</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog from Team Cherry</a>, the team announced that <strong>a Nintendo Switch 2 version</strong> of <strong>Hollow Knight</strong> is <strong>in the works</strong>. The game will feature a bevy of additions, like <strong>high frame-rate modes and resolutions</strong>, as well as <strong>new graphical effects</strong>. <strong>No release date for the edition was revealed</strong> outside of a 2026 release window. Screenshots of the game can be found above and on the blog.</p>



<p>Additionally, <strong>all those who own Hollow Knight for the Nintendo Switch can upgrade to the Nintendo Switch 2 edition for free</strong>. An update bringing new features and bug fixes will launch on current consoles around its release. The news comes after Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced to get a new DLC expansion, Sea of Sorrow. Both Hollow Knight: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and Sea of Sorrow will launch in 2026.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch was one of the first consoles to get Hollow Knight back in June 2018, months before PlayStation and Xbox. Originally, Silksong was planned as DLC for the title, but shifted to its own game. Now, fans can enjoy both series titles on the Nintendo Switch 2, enhanced and with new content to enjoy for free.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-drops-to-new-all-time-low-now-cheaper-than-basic-quietcomfort-model-2000653515</link>
            <guid>1384189</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium noise-canceling headphones are a big investment, but they can turn your commutes, flights, and focus sessions into private audio bubbles anywhere. The <strong>Bose QuietComfort Ultra</strong> headphones in <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6405/">this limited edition Deep Plum color are on sale for $279 on Amazon, down from their list price of $429</a> and it is<strong> the lowest price ever</strong> which makes them almost half the price of Apple’s Airpods Max.</p>
<p>This “Ultra” version is Bose’s ultimate model and it is (way) better than the standard QuietComfort line and has many improvements that make it worthy of the “Ultra” name. The new features are <strong>spatial audio with head tracking</strong>, <strong>CustomTune technology</strong> that changes the sound to fit the shape of your ear and <strong>Immersion Mode</strong> which combines the best noise cancellation with three-dimensional audio.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6405/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Head Tracking and Spatial Audio Make Personal Concert Halls</h2>
<p>The QuietComfort Ultra has Bose’s spatial audio technology which turns stereo tracks into<strong> immersive three-dimensional soundscapes</strong> where instruments are placed around your head in specific ways. This technology doesn’t just add fake reverb or widening effects but it actually moves audio elements around to make depth and separation that make music sound more real and interesting. Head tracking sensors know when you turn your head and change the soundstage so that vocals stay in front of you and instruments stay in their places which makes it feel like you’re in a room with speakers, where sound sources stay in one place instead of moving with your head like regular headphones.</p>



<p>CustomTune technology looks at the shape of your ears and how sound travels through your ear canals, and then it automatically changes the audio profile to make up for any differences in how sound travels through your ears. Because of the shape and size of your ears, they respond to different frequencies in different ways. This <strong>personalization makes sure you hear music the way the artist intended</strong>, not a generic tuning that works okay for everyone but not great for anyone. When you first put on the headphones, the calibration process only takes a few seconds and Tone sweeps are played through the drivers while microphones measure how your ears respond.</p>
<p>Immersion Mode uses Bose’s <strong>best noise cancellation and spatial audio processing to make it so that outside noise completely goes away</strong> and music surrounds you in three dimensions. This mode turns flights or commutes into private listening rooms where the sound of engines and people talking goes away completely and when you want to be alone but still want standard stereo imaging, Quiet Mode gives you traditional noise cancellation without spatial processing. Aware Mode sends outside sounds back through the headphones so you can hear announcements, traffic, or conversations without taking them off.</p>



<p>The microphone array uses beamforming technology to focus on your voice while filtering out background noise which means that calls sound clear even in busy streets or coffee shops. The call quality on older Bose models was okay, but <strong>the Ultra is much better because it has better signal processing</strong> that separates speech from background noise more effectively.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery lasts for 24 hours of regular audio playback</strong> and 18 hours of Immersion Mode, which is enough time for several international flights or a full work week without needing to be charged. The quick charge feature lets you listen for 2.5 hours after just 15 minutes of being plugged into USB-C which is great for when you forget to charge overnight and need to leave quickly.</p>
<p>Dropping from $429 to $279 makes the <strong>QuietComfort Ultra cheaper than the standard QuietComfort models</strong> typically sell for during sales which is a rare opportunity to get flagship features at mid-tier pricing. The combination of personalized tuning, immersive spatial processing and exceptional call quality delivers outstanding value at this discounted price point.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new DLC expansion for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, called Sea of Sorrow, is officially in the works. Furthermore, it will be free and releasing sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is the long-awaited spin-off to the acclaimed 2017 indie Metroidvania, Hollow Knight. Playing as Hornet, you’ll take down many hard bosses and explore the bug-infested land of Pharloom. Its release had been anticipated by many for years since being announced in 2019, before finally launching in September 2025. The game was met with critical praise from fans and outlets, even earning several year-end awards, including Best Action/Adventure Game at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> last week. Now, Team Cherry has revealed what’s next for Hornet with a small but intriguing tease.</p>







<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow-dlc-expansion-announced-by-team-cherry-coming-in-2026">Hollow Knight: Silksong – Sea of Sorrow DLC Expansion Announced by Team Cherry, Coming in 2026</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog on Team Cherry’s website</a>, the team revealed new plans for the Hollow Knight series. High among those was the announcement of a <strong>new DLC expansion</strong> for <strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong>, titled <strong>Sea of Sorrow</strong>. The announcement teaser can be found above. As of writing, no specific release date was given outside of 2026. However, <strong>the DLC will be free for all owners of the title</strong>. According to the blog, the expansion will give Hornet <strong>an all-new sea-themed area to explore</strong> with <strong>new tools and new bosses to fight</strong>. More information will be revealed before its release.</p>



<p>The news comes after Hollow Knight: Silksong’s win for Best Action/Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2025. Silksong was up for multiple awards, including Game of the Year, but lost a majority of them to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-broke-all-time-the-game-awards-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record-breaking Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. Still, for the amount of hype the title generated and delivered on is huge, and it won’t be surprising that many are pumped for Sea of Sorrow.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-era-100-bluetooth-and-wifi-speaker-drops-to-record-low-price-amazon-offloads-last-units-before-christmas-2000653537</link>
            <guid>1384162</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are a lot of Bluetooth speakers to choose from, from cheap ones to expensive ones. But Sonos always comes out on top in the mid- to high-end range, where sound quality matters more than just getting loud. The<strong> Era 100 is Sonos’s small smart speaker</strong> for rooms where full-sized speakers are too big <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/">and it’s now $169 on Amazon, down from its original price of $199</a>. This is the lowest price ever just before Christmas which makes it a great gift for music lovers who value good sound quality over flashy features.</p>
<p>The Era 100 has <strong>WiFi streaming, Bluetooth connectivity, and Trueplay room correction</strong> all in one small package that can fit on a kitchen counter or nightstand. It also has stereo separation that most single-unit speakers can’t match which makes it the perfect way to get started with Sonos or a useful addition to an existing multi-room setup.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Architecture with two tweeters</h2>
<p>Sonos designed the Era 100 with t<strong>wo tweeters that point outward to create real left and right channel separation in one box</strong> which makes music sound wider and more open than regular mono speakers. The two tweeters in this design let you hear instruments spread out across a soundstage instead of all coming from one point in space. The new Sonos speakers have a processor that is 47% faster than the old ones and lets them process audio more accurately, even at high volumes, so they don’t distort like other speakers do when they are pushed too hard. The<strong> midwoofer is 25% bigger and handles bass frequencies with authority</strong>, and gives you a low-end punch that you can feel in your chest without needing a separate subwoofer for most types of music.</p>



<p>Trueplay tuning technology turns the Era 100 from a good speaker into one that works best in your room by <strong>using your iPhone’s microphone to figure out how sound bounces off of walls, furniture, and other surfaces</strong>: You walk around the room waving your phone, which lets the speaker map the room’s acoustic features and change its output as needed. Trueplay makes sure that the sound quality is always the same, no matter where the speaker is. For example, a speaker in a corner sounds very different from one on a bookshelf or kitchen counter.</p>
<p>WiFi streaming is what makes the Era 100 connect: You can access music services like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and many more directly through the Sonos app. This network-based method gives you better sound quality than Bluetooth compression and lets you play different content in each room or group speakers together. The speaker also works with AirPlay 2, which makes it easy to connect to Apple devices.</p>



<p>The <strong>small size is just under 7 inches tall and 5 inches wide</strong> and makes it easy to put almost anywhere without taking up too much space. The matte black or white finish on the Era 100 makes it look good on both modern minimalist shelves and traditional wood furniture. The top panel has touch controls for play, pause, volume, and skip, so you can interact with it even when your phone isn’t right there.</p>
<p>At this price, the Era 100 is now competitive with mid-range Bluetooth speakers that don’t have WiFi streaming, room correction, or multi-room capabilities.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sonos Offloads Beam Soundbar at Record Low, Now Cheaper Than Basic Alternative and Perfect Christmas Gift]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-offloads-beam-soundbar-at-record-low-now-cheaper-than-basic-alternative-and-perfect-christmas-gift-2000653510</link>
            <guid>1384141</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Flat-screen TVs are getting thinner and better looking all the time, but this design change means that the sound quality suffers because manufacturers can’t fit good speakers into panels that are only a few millimeters thick. A good soundbar fills this gap by giving your beautiful 4K or OLED display the sound it needs and make movie nights and music listening truly immersive.</p>
<p>The good news is that the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">soundbar is now on sale on Amazon for $369, down from its list price of $499</a>. This is the lowest price ever which makes it a great <strong>Christmas gift for yourself or anyone whose TV audio sounds flat and lifeless</strong>. This small soundbar works just as well under wall-mounted TVs or on entertainment centers and brings Dolby Atmos spatial audio and multi-room music streaming to living rooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dolby Atmos</h2>
<p>The Beam Gen 2 processes <strong>Dolby Atmos audio tracks to make height channels that make sound seem to come from above and around you</strong> and adds a vertical dimension to the usual left-right stereo field. This technology for spatial audio makes it sound like helicopters are flying over you, rain is falling from the ceiling, and background noises put you in the scene instead of just in front of it. Psychoacoustic processing and carefully angled drivers that bounce sound off your ceiling make it sound like you have dedicated height speakers without actually installing them.</p>



<p>The Beam’s center channel focuses on voice frequencies to make sure you hear every word without turning up the volume, which is one of the most common complaints about TV audio. With this dedicated dialogue processing, you won’t miss important plot points when people are whispering or need subtitles to understand speech with an accent. When you watch news or dramas with a lot of dialogue, the <em>Speech Enhancement</em> feature in the Sonos app boosts voice frequencies even more. It gives you customizable clarity that works with different types of content.</p>
<p>Trueplay tuning technology <strong>uses your iPhone’s microphone to figure out how sound bounces off the walls</strong> and other surfaces in your room and then automatically changes the Beam’s output to make up for any problems with the sound. Rooms with hard floors and bare walls that make harsh reflections get tuned differently than rooms with carpet and soft furniture that absorbs sound. This calibration process only takes about two minutes, but it makes the sound much better than using generic soundbar settings that assume the same room acoustics.</p>



<p>To set it up, all you need are two cables: <strong>one HDMI eARC cable that goes from your TV to the device and one power cord that goes to an outlet</strong>. The soundbar automatically finds your TV and works with your current remote, so you don’t have to switch between controllers or set up universal remotes. With Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Sonos Voice Control, you can change the volume, skip songs, or switch inputs without using a remote. With Apple AirPlay 2 support, you can stream music wirelessly from iPhones, iPads, and Macs.</p>
<p>The Beam Gen 2 is now competitive with mid-range soundbars that don’t have Dolby Atmos or multi-room capabilities because the price dropped from $499 to $369. Anyone who wants to improve their TV’s sound quality beyond the mediocre built-in speakers will get a lot of value from it.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/15/wardrum-is-what-would-happen-if-you-mixed-fire-emblem-with-parappa-the-rapper/</link>
            <guid>1384123</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I love a good elevator pitch, and Wardrum, the latest from Team17 Digital and Mopeful Games, has an absolute doozy. “Fire Emblem meets Parappa the Rapper” sounds absolutely brilliant, but only if you can wrap your head around a world that mixes those two utterly different games together. What could it possible mean? Well, Wardrum is a Tactical Rhythm Roguelite – though, that alone would make it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/lost-eidolons-veil-of-the-witch-review/">Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch</a> – that’s taken a note out of games like Parappa the Rapper, or perhaps the Mario and Luigi games, so you have to perform your actions in time with the music to maximise your damage, or secure your defence. Whatever it turns out to be like, the idea of it alone already has me sold. </p>
<p><iframe title="Wardrum | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EUDV13huGew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The beat-heavy trailer gives you an impression of what kind of beats and tunes you’ll be banging along to, and there’s already some Patapon-like tones in there that have me even more excited. Wardrum is set in a harsh and unforgiving fantasy landscape, and you have to plan and execute your tactical moves in time with the primal pounding of a tribal wardrum for maximum impact. </p>
<p>Off-beat magic has infected the lands, neighbouring settlements have fallen and it’s up to you and a band of five warriors to keep the beat. You’ll have to venture out into the harsh fantasy world and stop the source of this off-beat threat once and for all. </p>
<p>We’ve seen a number of games marry turn-based combat with timed elements, not least one of this year’s biggest hits, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Given how successful that game has been, maybe the general public will be more open than ever to a cool, well-executed tactical game with rhythm-action elements. </p>


<p>Your ongoing quest will take place across six distinctive biomes with randomised map paths, navigating through battles, sanctuaries and other events to go toe to toe against dangerous bosses. Alongside the big guys, there’s a great lineup of 35 menacing enemies that require careful tactical planning to overcome.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of Fire Emblem, Wardrum looks like it’ll give you a very different take on tactical action, and it’s one that I’m already looking forward to trying out. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-i7-1tb-laptop-rated-5-5-stars-drops-73-off-on-amazon-crashes-to-all-time-low-with-200-bonus-pack-2000653526</link>

              <p>Smart shoppers know that paying full price on official brand websites often means leaving hundreds of dollars on the table that could stay in your pocket. A capable laptop doesn’t require a $2,000 investment when strategic shopping reveals the same specs at drastically lower prices through different retailers.</p>
<p>This Dell Inspiron 15″ touchscreen <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6406/">laptop sells for $759 on Amazon right now, marked down from its typical $2,799 price tag</a>, while Dell’s official site shows no such promotion. This is <strong>a record low that slashes over $2,000 off</strong> a machine featuring a 13th-generation Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD that handles everything from office work to content creation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6406/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>13th-Gen Intel Core i7 Has Processing Power That Lasts for Years</h2>
<p>The<strong> Intel Core i7-1355U processor has 10 cores</strong> which are split between performance and efficiency cores which lets it handle demanding applications while still having a good battery life. This hybrid architecture gives performance cores to heavy tasks like video rendering or compilation and efficiency cores to light workloads and background processes. The processor can boost up to 5.0 GHz, which gives it the power it needs to run professional software like Adobe Premiere, AutoCAD, or Excel spreadsheets with thousands of rows.</p>



<p>The <strong>15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen</strong> is useful in a way that some touch-enabled laptops aren’t. When editing photos, adding notes to documents, or scrolling through long web pages, it feels natural to directly interact with interface elements. The WVA panel doesn’t glare, so you can still see it in bright offices or near windows where shiny screens turn into mirrors. Windows 11’s touch support is better than in previous versions and it has better palm rejection and gesture controls that are more responsive, which makes people more productive instead of annoying them with accidental inputs.</p>



<p>The <strong>85% screen-to-body ratio</strong> makes the bezels around the display as small as possible, giving the laptop a modern look and maximizing the amount of screen space within its physical footprint. The wide range of ports, <strong>which includes both legacy USB-A ports and modern USB-C ports</strong>, fixes one of the most annoying trends in modern laptops. For photographers and videographers who need to transfer footage from their cameras, <strong>the SD card reader</strong> is a must-have and <strong>HDMI 1.4</strong> makes it easy to connect to external monitors without needing dongles.</p>
<p>The Windows 11 Pro edition has business features that the Home edition does not, such as BitLocker encryption, Remote Desktop, and Hyper-V virtualization. This makes this laptop good for workplaces that need extra security. With the Pro license, you also have more control over Windows updates. With Copilot AI integration, Microsoft’s generative AI assistant is built right into the operating system and can help you write, generate code, and provide contextual help without having to switch to other apps or websites.</p>
<p>This i7-powered laptop is now in the same price range as budget Chromebooks and entry-level Windows machines with much worse specs, thanks to a savings of more than $2,000. At this price point, many laptops still come with older i5 processors, 8GB of RAM, and smaller SSDs and this Dell configuration stands out from the rest.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-hits-mini-pcs-hard-apples-newest-mac-mini-at-record-low-price-makes-mid-range-options-obsolete-2000653505</link>
            <guid>1384105</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Mini PCs are a niche category where lesser-known brands dominate by assembling components into compact machines that prioritize space-saving over brand recognition. Apple’s Mac mini faces virtually no real competition in this segment, and combines<strong> iconic industrial design with performance and connectivity that generic mini PCs struggle to match</strong>.</p>
<p>The latest Mac mini with <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage currently sells for $479 on Amazon, reduced from its $599 list price</a>, and hits a record low that eclipses the competition just before Christmas. This newest generation shrinks the already-compact form factor down to five by five inches while packing a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU that outperforms most desktop computers twice its size.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Desktop Performance</h2>
<p>The M4 chip is Apple’s fourth-generation custom silicon and it <strong>has a 10-core CPU that is split into performance and efficiency cores</strong> which handle demanding tasks and background processes in a smart way. This architecture gives the Mac mini performance that is on par with Intel and AMD desktop processors, but it uses much less power.</p>
<p>This means that the Mac mini can run quietly without the loud fan noise that comes with most desktop towers. The <strong>10-core GPU can handle graphics-heavy tasks</strong> like editing photos in Lightroom, editing 4K videos in Final Cut Pro and even playing moderate games through Apple Arcade or native Mac games. Unified memory architecture gives the CPU and GPU 16GB of memory to share and gets rid of the slowdowns that happen when separate graphics cards have to move data back and forth between system RAM.</p>



<p>The new chassis is only five by five inches which is about the same size as a big coffee mug on a desk. It can do the same things that a full-size desktop tower can do. This smaller size makes the Mac mini perfect for minimalist desk setups, small apartments where space is at a premium, or workstations with multiple monitors where tower PCs would take up too much space. The aluminum construction passively dissipates heat while keeping the high quality that Apple products are known for.</p>
<p>Port configuration finally fixes one of the Mac mini’s long-standing problems by adding <strong>USB-C ports on the front and a headphone jack</strong> that makes it easier to reach around than in previous generations. The front ports make it much easier to connect USB drives, charging cables, or headphones on a daily basis. The back panel still has<strong> Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI output, and Gigabit Ethernet for permanent connections</strong>. Thunderbolt 4 can connect up to three 6K displays or one 8K display and gives creative professionals and productivity users the ability to use more than one monitor at a time.</p>



<p>With Apple Intelligence integration, AI-powered features are built right into the operating system: These features include help with writing, summarizing emails, and organizing photos intelligently without sending data to other servers. This <strong>processing on the device keeps your information private</strong> while also giving you features like smart replies, automatic transcription, and suggestions based on what you’re doing that help you get more done.</p>
<p>Right now, <strong>the M4 Mac mini is now cheaper than many prebuilt Windows desktops</strong> that don’t come with a monitor and have worse processors.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/game-awards-2025-protest-future-class-uvw/</link>
            <guid>1384102</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>As is tradition, Geoff Keighley kicked off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-BDeU3R5ic&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>last week’s Game Awards</u></a> with a speech. Defying the show’s established norms, he took things in a personal direction, informing the audience that in 2025 his house burned down in the LA fires, and his father passed away. He found solace, however, in games: “Games have this incredible ability to hold us when we’re hurting, to lift us up when we feel small, to give us somewhere to go when the real world feels unsteady,” he said. “That’s why we’re all connected in this moment: We’re here to celebrate the artists, technicians, and storytellers who help this medium soar to new heights.” But outside the show’s gilded walls, many felt ignored rather than celebrated.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-game-awards-confirms-its-future-class-program-will-remain-on-ice?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Game Developer</u></a> broke the news that the Game Awards’ Future Class – a program meant to honor and facilitate annual cohorts of industry professionals who “represent the bright, bold, and inclusive future of video games” – has effectively been put on ice. This followed a prolonged period of silence from the organization after Future Class members began demanding more from Keighley and those running it: travel, resources, funding, and networking opportunities more in line with the way the program had been presented over the years, as well as public statements acknowledging ills those in the world of games and beyond could no longer afford to ignore, like <a href="https://aftermath.site/keighley-summer-game-fest-layoffs/"><u>layoffs</u></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/one-week-and-2600-signatures-later-game-awards-havent-acknowledged-future-class-palestine-letter/"><u>the genocide in Palestine</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Thursday, anger around the Future Class’ dissolution – as well as the callousness with which many companies handed shimmering trophies at The Game Awards continue to cast aside thousands of workers – coalesced into a protest organized by <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">United Videogame Workers</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/uvw-cwa-video-game-union-microsoft-trump-musk/"><u>the union anyone, even laid-off workers, can join</u></a> announced by Communications Workers of America (CWA) at GDC earlier this year. </p><blockquote>"The moment we actually tried to ask for something better – or for them to put their money where their mouth is – they just quietly killed the program.”</blockquote><p>The theme of the protest was “The Industry Is Dead,” and many of the 50 or so developers who showed up took that to heart. A handful dressed in grim reaper outfits, while others carried signs shaped like tombstones. One read “RIP Future Class, Died Of Performative Allyship.” The UVW chair who made it, freelance writer and narrative designer Anna C Webster, was a former Future Class member.</p><p>“You’d think that we as the Future Class would at least know what the future of our program looks like,” she told Aftermath. “But they basically did not communicate that at all until we got together and said ‘Hey, what’s going on?’ To say that we’re disappointed is probably an understatement. It’s very disappointing that someone with the platform Geoff has is not using it for good. The moment we actually tried to ask for something better – or for them to put their money where their mouth is – they just quietly killed the program.”</p><p>Younès Rabii, a former Future Class member who organized an open letter urging Keighley and co to acknowledge Israel’s inhuman treatment of Palestinians, expressed a similar sentiment.&nbsp;</p><p>"The way that Future Class members were treated by The Game Awards, it feels like we outlived our usefulness of diverse faces smiling for the camera,” Rabii, who did not attend this year’s Game Awards, told Aftermath. “Once we tried to ask the structure to put money where its mouth was, the facade crumbled. I vividly remember that during the only meeting we had after the 2023 show, when I asked Geoff Keighley why he ignored our open letter, he angrily replied ‘This is my show, and nobody gets to tell me how I should use my platform.’ What else is there to say?"</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:5gdejlhcswjbzraadoltdpps/app.bsky.feed.post/3m7qp7qq7ck2f" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiain5szjiftjjaxnk3gah3rgzceafnniziltvxuo73xrxpshxo5fq"><p lang="en">around 40 game developers affiliated with @videogameworkers.bsky.social have gathered outside the peacock theater, where the game awards will take place in a few hours, for a “the industry is dead” demonstration</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5gdejlhcswjbzraadoltdpps?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Nathan Grayson (@nathangrayson.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5gdejlhcswjbzraadoltdpps/post/3m7qp7qq7ck2f?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-12-11T23:13:36.959Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>Despite the outcry that followed the initial headlines last month, Webster said that she and other Future Class members haven’t heard a peep from Keighley or program organizers since: “Nope. Nothing.”</p><p>The protest outside The Game Awards focused on far more than just the Future Class, with pro-union and anti-CEO chants filling the air. “Our industry is dead, lay off CEOs instead,” protesters shouted at various points. “No more layoffs, no more lies, no more playing with our lives.” A pamphlet handed out by UVW members summed up the grim truth of the day: “In 2025 alone, upwards of 3,500 video game workers have lost their jobs, healthcare, and security. That number skyrockets to more than 40,000 workers when you include all tech and game workers laid off in the past three years.” </p><p>Kaitlin “KB” Bonfiglio, a writer and designer who also serves as UVW's local secretary, pointed to recent reporting that suggests a Game Awards trailer spot <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">can cost between $450,000 and over $1 million</a>.</p><p>"There's a lot of pomp and circumstance around it," she told Aftermath, "so we wanted to make sure that we were here representing game workers – the people who make these games – raking in millions for these executives."</p><p>This was not an entirely hassle-free process. Security attempted to prevent protesters from claiming a spot outside the theater. "We had to produce our own statutes regarding this particular terrace, which is part of LA Live," said Webster. "We also have legal council, and we had them prep the information we'd need to say 'Hey, we're allowed to be here.' Eventually, they let us in, but they were trying to turn us away."</p><p>There is a history of protests outside The Game Awards, with SAG-AFTRA leading two in <a href="https://aftermath.site/at-this-years-game-awards-nobody-won/"><u>2023</u></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-the-game-awards-2024/"><u>2024</u></a> as part of the since-concluded voice actor strike. Members of SAG, though not representing the guild at large, were among those who attended Thursday’s protest. Sherveen Uduwana, a freelance game developer and treasurer with UVW, said others’ past efforts served as inspiration for this year’s protest.</p><p>"This is an escalation. People have shown up in previous years to push these issues forward,” Uduwana told Aftermath. “We want to make it clear to the bosses that this is not a problem they can just wait out. We're gonna be prepared to speak to these issues: mass layoffs, taking away healthcare, generative AI. And make sure we win on those issues and workers have protections."</p><p>Midway through the protest, a procession of developers gave speeches into a megaphone.</p><p>"We are the ones who poured our blood, sweat, tears, sanity, and health into these games,” shouted one who paid tribute to a friend who’d just passed, who he said loved video games and hated corporate exploitation. “The ones who made the games are outside. [Bosses and executives] are inside patting themselves on the back. ... And what was our reward? Many of us were cast aside as soon as the products were created because we weren't needed anymore. And those who were lucky enough to stay [now] find themselves debugging ChatGPT code."</p><p>Some present had direct personal experience with the video game industry’s current layoff-centric strategy. Earlier this year, Timothy Staton-Davis, who attended the protest dressed in a grim reaper cloak and holding a plastic scythe, was part of a small round of layoffs at Brass Lion Entertainment, which is currently working on <em>Wu-Tang: Rise Of The Deceiver</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>“There were a few of us they had to let go of because of monetary issues,” Staton-Davis told Aftermath. “It’s their first game. They’re trying to pull through. They’ve been negatively affected by the current industry situation in a lot of ways because of mismanagement of money. It’s not the studio’s fault, but from our partners and all that kind of stuff.”</p><p>“My first studio gig was at Monolith,” he continued. “Now <a href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down/"><u>they’re gone</u></a>. Unfairly so. All these studios I’ve been connected to have been negatively affected in some way, shape, or form by people not doing the right things with their money and taking advantage of folks.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Colton "Anarche99" Childrey / UVW-CWA</span></figcaption></figure><p>Others were there to show solidarity.</p><p>“I’ve had so many friends affected [by layoffs],” said a developer doing organizing work with UVW named Audrey, who declined to provide their last name or place of employment, but who noted that they’ve yet to be laid off despite four years working in games. “I’m out here for the industry. I’m afraid that if I lost my job, I’m not gonna be able to find another one. The amount of power that gives our employers is just insane. I’ve had to work three crunches so far. The last one sent me to the hospital. I was in some of the most excruciating pain of my life. I thought my appendix had burst. Turns out, it was just stress.”</p><p>There are silver linings, though. Webster views UVW as a more authentic attempt at paving the way for a better games industry than Future Class ever was.</p><p>“We are disappointed in Geoff,” she said. “We are building the future of the games industry with or without his branding, and if he wants to join us, he can anytime.”</p><p>“UVW as an organization, a lot of the stuff that benefits Future Class members – whether it’s visibility or financial support or community – we have resources to also do all those things,” added Uduwana. “We’re looking to actually be able to make that kind of tangible change that The Game Awards and Geoff have shirked the responsibility of.”</p><p>“They decided that’s too hard,” said Webster, “so we’ve gotta do it ourselves.”</p><p>Webster and Uduwana also noted that as of now, UVW boasts 560 members.</p><blockquote>"I’m afraid that if I lost my job, I’m not gonna be able to find another one. The amount of power that gives our employers is just insane."</blockquote><p>"The main thing [UVW] has done for me so far is build connections – and not in a controlled forum, where we can actually be honest and have real conversations about the industry," said Aubrey. "Especially as a queer person, companies will have affinity groups and stuff like that, but HR is always there. If you say something too out there, you never know. You can't be too honest in those spaces."</p><p>Emma Kidwell, one of the Future Class members who ultimately forced an answer about the program’s fate out of The Game Awards, likes what she’s seen so far of UVW.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think UVW-CWA and the solidarity they've shown the [Future Class] alumni has been really great," Kidwell told Aftermath. "They're doing good, important work and using their platform to make the industry a better place."</p><p>In addition to supporting UVW, Staton-Davis is taking matters into his own hands. This year he opened a worker-owned studio called <a href="https://melanatedgamekitchen.itch.io/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Melanated Game Kitchen</u></a>.</p><p>“I’m also trying to contribute to the work of a more sustainable, equitable industry by starting a co-op studio myself,” he said. “We focus on fun gameplay, obviously, but narratives as well that tell cultural stories. It’s BIPOC-led, and we’re trying to bring that to the forefront. We don’t see enough of those stories in the industry, so we want to do more of that – and collaborate with everyone else who’s also trying to do that same thing.”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-2024-future-class-game-changer-geoff-keighley/"><div><p>With The Future Class On Hold, The Game Awards’ Attempts At Doing Good Produce Mixed Results [Update] - Aftermath</p><p>This year The Game Awards introduced a new distinction: “Game Changer,” which went to Amir Satvat for his efforts to help laid-off workers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Rockstar's firing of 34 workers <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">(31 at its Rockstar North studio in Scotland, 3 in Canada at Rockstar Toronto)</a> has been the big topic of conversation around the studio at a time when it realistically should be more about <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">why Grand Theft Auto VI was delayed</a>. While Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/">alleges that the fired workers were distributing and discussing confidential information</a>, the fired workers, the IWGB (Independent Workers of Great Britain) and other Rockstar employees <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-workers-union-fires-back-again-at-rockstar-gta-6-maker-attempt-to-downplay-controversial-firings">deny these allegations</a>, claiming the fired workers were simply discussing work policies.</p>



<p>Since the dismissal of the 34 workers was made public last month, there have been demonstrations at Rockstar and Take-Two offices across the world, most <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/">notably at Rockstar North in Edinburgh</a> and at Take-Two offices in Paris, London, and New York. On Friday, December 12, that stretched to Canada, where a small group of protestors, comprising representatives from the Communications Workers of America Canada (CWA Canada), local game developers, academics, and labour organizers, braved the cold to protest and make their presence known at Rockstar Toronto.</p>



<p>And make themselves known they did, as the small group of seven, not including myself and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/author/jonathan-ore-1.3300194">CBC's Jonathan Ore</a>, who were the only two press representatives there, "<em>Definitely caused a bit of a stir at the office</em>." That's how Declan Peach, a local game developer and former IWGB organizer who now works and lives in Toronto, described the demonstration to me on the train ride back into the city from Oakville.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: Declan Peach at the Oakville GO transit station ahead of the demonstration.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>The fact that they closed the blackout blinds, I think, suggests that it was effective,</em>" added Felan Parker, professor of media studies at the University of Toronto, whose research and teaching mostly relate to the video game industry, and who was also in attendance to show solidarity with the fired workers.</p>



<p>I followed and spoke to the group of protestors at the Oakville GO transit station in Oakville, a town within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), at midday on Friday, as they made the short walk from the station to Rockstar Toronto, putting up posters along the way, going to the studio with the intention of delivering some literature outlining their solidarity for those fired workers.</p>



<p>The CWA Canada representatives, Katherine Lapointe and Nasr Ahmed, had <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/events/solidarity-picket-for-fired-rockstar-workers?source=direct_link&amp;">set up this demonstration as a show of solidarity</a>. Following the protest, Ahmed spoke to Ore and me together about why he and Lapointe were there and the message they wanted this action to send.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: Nasr Ahmed glueing a poster to a pole along the path from the Oakville GO transit station towards Rockstar Toronto.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>When CWA Canada and CWA's direct-join video game workers union, <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/">United Video Game Workers</a>, had heard about what had happened at Rockstar, we wanted to throw our full weight, our full solidarity behind these workers. But to also show the workers on the inside that they cannot simply discipline workers for talking about working conditions without a response from the broader community."</em></p>



<p>Of the 34 fired workers, only three are based here in Canada; the other 31 are all based in the UK, and all of them are part of the unionization effort growing at Rockstar. Ahmed told us that the three workers fired from Rockstar Toronto were not actively engaging in efforts to unionize their studio, but that they were fired because they were "<em>caught up</em> <em>in this</em>" with the other 31, "<em>simply for being in the UK-based organizing Discord</em>."</p>



<p>Even if the three fired workers from Rockstar Toronto weren't actively engaging in getting their studio unionized, their involvement in that server suggests that they at least want to be in proximity to organizing efforts. Although they would not be involved in any of the UK efforts, it would make sense for them to be part of the UK-based Discord server to gain knowledge as to how they may want to lead their own organizing efforts, if that was indeed the reason they were involved in the server in the first place.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-3-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: Declan Peach holding a CWA Canada flag.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>And that was the case, according to one of the three workers fired from Rockstar Toronto, who spoke to Wccftech under the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. They confirmed their involvement in the Discord server<em> </em>they described as being run "<em>by and for employees</em>," and confirmed that the founding members were all members of the IWGB. "<em>We were there mostly to talk about working conditions. Sometimes we would socialize, but the only reason we would ever be there was to discuss working conditions among the studio. I will also mention that we had a very thorough vetting process."</em> </p>



<p>(A note on the server, I asked the source about reports that there were employees who remained in the server after leaving Rockstar. The source told me that if there were people still in the server after having left the company, they had "<em>no idea</em>" of their presence, adding, "<em>everyone I've ever spoken to [in that server] was a current employee</em>.")</p>



<p>As far as the source knew, there had been no previous efforts at Rockstar Toronto to unionize. They joined the UK-based server to discuss working conditions and, one day, hopefully, see a union form at Rockstar Toronto and at every Rockstar studio.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-6-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: Protestors outside of Rockstar Toronto</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While they did not lay direct claims of union-busting by Rockstar as others have, the source admitted that "<em>The only common link between anyone who was fired is being a member of this community, and this community had the explicit</em> <em>purpose of trying to unionize all of the studios, at some point. The focus was on the UK, but the goal was to unionize all of the studios, so it has to be connected to that in some way, just because that's the only common link</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>It is definitely connected with that server in some way,"</em> the source added.<em> We've never discussed any product details there; all we ever discussed was our working conditions [in that server]</em>. <em>So it has to be connected to that in some way, because that is the only common link</em>."</p>



<p>Whether they intended to organize an immediate effort at Rockstar Toronto or not, they should not be fired for simply being close to unionization efforts, and Ahmed, like the IWGB, rejects the allegations of gross misconduct from Rockstar management entirely.</p>



<p>"<em> The official story from management is that they were, quote unquote, leaking sensitive information</em>," Ahmed said. "<em> But we know that this is patently false.</em> <em> They [Rockstar] have not provided any proof for these claims,</em>  <em>either for the Canadian workers or the UK workers. At the end of the day, discussing workers' rights and discussing working conditions is not against the law as far as I know, in either Canada or in the UK, which is exactly what these workers were doing.</em>"</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-7-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Ahmed and Lapointe admitted that part of why they chose December 12 for the demonstration was because they had been tipped off that employees would be having a team lunch that day, and could likely see the protestors from the windows.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When I asked the fired worker from Rockstar Toronto about the details of their dismissal, they described a similar situation to what we've previously heard about how the firings took place in the UK.</p>



<p>"<em>I was fired on October 30, 2025. The process was about the same as what you've heard from all the other UK people. They brought us into a room, we were told by an HR person there that we had broken the non-disclosure agreement and broken social media policy. Anyone in the UK or in Canada who chose to, not necessarily push back, but anyone who chose to question and press for evidence was refused, they [Rockstar] said that they couldn't give anyone any evidence, and then they didn't let anyone collect their things, they just gave them their essentials and shipped them home in an Uber</em>."</p>

<p>To the source's recollection, Rockstar also declined to say why it could not provide evidence of the alleged misconduct. When I asked them directly as to whether Rockstar's claims of discussing and distributing confidential information had any truth to them, the source said, "<em>If there is, I am not aware of it; moreover, I would like them to show what there is, because when I read that, I was just confused as to what they were referring to."</em></p>



<p>When we arrived at the very unassuming building where Rockstar Toronto commands the third floor, two security guards, one of whom identified themselves as part of Rockstar's security and not part of the building's operational security team, allowed us inside the building, but prevented us from taking the elevator upstairs. </p>

<p>"<em>This is a haphazard attempt by Rockstar management to try and curb this," </em>Ahmed said about Friday's events<em>. "But we know that they're not going to be able to curb this because this wave of organizing is not just a wave, it's a tidal wave. It's hitting the sector fast, and it's hitting them hard, and, you know, I'm really disappointed that Rockstar is not welcoming efforts to organize with open arms,</em> <em>like some other companies have been so far</em>."</p>



<p>One of the protesting party members, Erin Carr, executive director of the <a href="https://www.solidarityplace.ca/">Solidarity Place Worker Education Centre</a> in Hamilton, who was there on his day off to support the fired workers and his longtime friend Ahmed, was one of the only two members of the protest who made it up to the third floor to try and deliver the letters.</p>



<p>"<em>They were sort of nice enough,</em>" Carr told us about the reception they got once they both made it to the third floor. "<em>[They were] asking us to go downstairs, and we said we would like to be able to drop off the letters outlining the workers' very valid concerns</em>."</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-5-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Rockstar Toronto is located on the third floor of the building.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Carr made it clear that the confrontation did not escalate in any way and described the scene as "<em>just conversation</em>" between him, the other protesting member and someone from Rockstar who Carr assumed was a manager.</p>



<p>"<em>Once we made it up to the lobby and the, I'm assuming, manager, confronted us, you could see that the blinds were coming down. I mean, you couldn't see much through the doors, but clearly they didn't want the rest of the workers [to] know that we were outside supporting this cause</em>," he said. "<em>We were pretty firm</em> <em>in our position that, you know, if you're going to be sending someone out to take those letters, we would like to know who that person is, what their position is,</em> <em>etc, etc,</em> <em>and unfortunately, we can't take your word that that's actually going to happen. So we stood firm</em>." </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-9-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: The stack of letters intended for Rockstar Toronto employees left at the bottom of the Christmas tree that decorated the office building's lobby.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>No one from Rockstar Toronto was sent to retrieve the letters, and no one else from the party made it to the third floor. With the building's holiday decorations already up, the party opted to leave the stack of letters under the Christmas tree standing next to the elevator. What happened to the letters afterwards is currently unclear.</p>



<p>The group then stood outside the building and across the street, and chanted "<em>Say sorry! Be nice! Stand up for workers' rights!</em>" for a short time before heading home. Overall, it wasn't a particularly grand demonstration, but it did accomplish one of the goals Ahmed said were part of the day's effort.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-Chanting-Video.mov"></video><figcaption><em>Protestors outside of Rockstar Toronto chant "Say sorry, be nice, stand up for workers' rights!"</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>I think there's multiple goals with this demonstration. Number one, and maybe most importantly, is showing solidarity with those workers that were impacted in the UK, where it was a very blatant form of union-busting, where those</em> <em>30-plus workers were directly engaged in trying to form a union.</em>"</p>



<p><em>"As far as my understanding goes, there is an active case in the UK trying to take Rockstar to court, and right now, there are solidarity efforts outside Rockstar locations all across the world. As far as I know, it's been happening in Edinburgh, in London, in Paris, and most recently in New York. And we wanted to show them that this anger that they [Rockstar] have caused</em> <em>is global, and that includes here in the Greater Toronto Area as well."</em></p>



<p>"<em>But secondary, amongst this, we want to show those workers on the inside of that building that Rockstar is not able to do whatever they want without a response from the broader gaming community. So I can't say that this will necessarily be the last action, but it's certainly the first</em>."</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-8-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: Protestors in the lobby of the office building where Rockstar Toronto is located.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>And they definitely showed that they are there, and that they are willing to show up and support these workers. Like their 31 colleagues at Rockstar North, the three workers fired at Rockstar Toronto would like to be reinstated, Ahmed confirmed. "<em>Let's be clear,</em> <em>these are workers who love what they do. When workers engage in union organizing, it's not to burn down the studio, it's to make the studio better</em>," he said.</p>



<p>"<em>It's to make the games that they create, that they put their heart and souls into, better in the long run. Oftentimes, management does not have the betterment of the games in mind. When they go and do their day-to-day practices, it's usually for shareholder value. These workers, on the other hand, that's not their main goal.</em> <em>Their main goal is to put out the best product possible. And for those reasons, these workers would love to have their jobs back</em>."</p>



<p>The anonymous source confirmed that they had knowledge of the demonstration ahead of it taking place, and while they don't know how the studio reacted to it internally on the day, they said they appreciated the show of support, particularly because they and their fired colleagues could not be out there themselves. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-4-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: The office building where Rockstar Toronto employees work on the third floor.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>Honestly, it made me happy to see that there was support for us, that there was a lot of people who cared about our situation enough to try and advocate for us. It made me feel nice that there were people advocating for us when none of us could have been there to advocate for ourselves, and it felt empowering to see the community all rally behind us."</em></p>



<p>Which was honestly one of the biggest takeaways from the protest. Again, it wasn't a big demonstration; the protestors did not stand outside chanting for hours, nor were they a particularly large group. But they were all there because they felt it was important to be there, to stand up in advocacy for those who can't do it themselves, because they felt it was the right thing to do, and, especially for everyone present that day who works in video games, they all know how vulnerable they are if they don't advocate for their rights.</p>



<p>"<em>There needs to be some addressing of the issue of the power disparity between a huge workforce of people who are super desperate to get a job in their passion," </em>said Jim Munroe, co-creator of Toronto Games Week, who was there to support the fired workers.<em> "Games is a passion-based industry, and if you don't have any guardrails or any ways of dealing with this power differential between the people who are in charge of hiring and firing and the people who are doing the work, you get a lot of abuses that just happen naturally.</em>"</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-13-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: Protestors stand in front of the sign indicating where Rockstar Toronto is located in the building.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>So there needs to be some way to address it. Unions are one way, and I think it's a good thing to start</em> <em>seeing in this time, especially when the precarity of tech workers at large is really being made apparent by the enormous amount of layoffs, as the bosses are kind of drooling at the idea of replacing people with server farms running AI</em>."</p>



<p>It's also worth noting that when I asked Munroe, Parker, and Peach as we took the GO train back into the city, if they were there supporting workers they directly knew at Rockstar Toronto, they admitted that they didn't know anyone currently working at the studio. Fighting to protect the rights of people you don't even know is one of the strongest shows of community support, and exactly what this kind of effort is about.</p>



<p>"<em>I've known people who have worked, gotten burnt out, and left that particular</em> <em>studio,</em>" Munroe added, though he admitted he did not know anyone currently working at Rockstar Toronto. "<em>I mean, there's an enormous amount of churn of people, not just at Rockstar, but in the triple-A</em> <em>game studio</em> <em>world in general. It's not surprising, but in general, I do identify with the people who work really hard to get into a position where they get to do their dream job, getting there and feeling like 'Oh, there are lots of amazing things about it, but there's also weird dynamics in the workplace that can really make them feel repressed and unlikely to want to speak out, because their livelihood is depending on it now</em>."</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-14.png"></a><figcaption><em>Protests have been happening in front of Rockstar buildings across the globe since the 34 workers were fired. Image credit: IWGB</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ahmed also made the case that labour issues in the video game industry is something all Canadians should be rallying behind, which is why a letter campaign has been underway to try and make local politicians aware of what's happening, similar to how local UK politicians have spoken up. Ahmed told us there has been no response as of yet, but that they have over 300 signatures after only starting the campaign days before the demonstration this past Friday.</p>



<p>"<em>At the end of the day, these are companies that are taking millions of dollars in taxpayer money in incentives, right? These are highly subsidized studios that are setting up shop not only in Ontario but all across the country, because multiple provincial have set up environments for these companies to grow and be subsidized to set up shops here. At the end of the day, if you're going to be taking Canadian taxpayer dollars, you have to respect Canadian jobs, and right now, Rockstar is showing that they are not respecting Canadian jobs, and that is our message to these politicians, whether they are Conservative, Liberal, or New Democrat</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>If politicians want to be sure that their constituents are protected as these companies are being bought and sold at this dizzying pace, then they need to have a voice at work. They need to have a seat at that table while these big international moves are being made</em>."</p>

<p>As for what's next for the three workers fired from Rockstar Toronto, our source indicated that they were considering legal action, but due to the differences between UK employment law and employment law in Ontario, they were opting to "<em>wait and see</em>" how the situation continues to unfold before filing anything similar to what has happened in the UK. But of course, they'd rather not have to do any of that.</p>



<p>"<em>We just want our jobs back, man,</em>" the source told me with an exasperated breath. "<em>We poured our souls into this game, we loved our team, we loved our work. We poured our souls into this game, and we discussed our working conditions amongst ourselves because we believe in the potential of what Rockstar is. They've shown a willingness to change in the past, and because of that, I believe that they have the potential to be a leader in the games industry, in terms of what is good for workers. They've shown they can change in the past; they can change again." </em></p>



<p>"<em>We've poured our heart and soul into this project, and we just want to get back to work and keep going at it because we were good at what we did. Every single one of us was talented;</em> <em>we wouldn't have gotten into Rockstar if we weren't talented, if they didn't see our potential, if they didn't see how talented and how good we are at what we do, we wouldn't have gotten in in the first place. We just want to get back to work on the game. We poured our heart and soul into</em> <em>it, and to be let go just for discussing our working conditions amongst ourselves and wanting the company to be better, it's heartbreaking</em>."</p>



<p>Wccftech reached out to Rockstar for a comment on the protest, but did not receive a reply in time for publication.</p>

            <p>
I do not know if a black hole is something we should feed. Ostensibly they are things (anti-things? I'm not a black holeologist) that I would like to be far away from, given what I've heard. And yet here I am, having tinkered around with the demo for A Game About Feeding A Black Hole, which is a game about feeding a black hole, left with the feeling that this is not only a thing I can do, but find tranquility in.
</p>
<p>
The thing about A Game About Feeding A Black Hole is that it is more or less what it says on the tin. It is also a game about inaction and reaction. You have a tiny circle which every second or so, to start with, does a bit of damage. So, you break down the handful of asteroids you see around you, their remnants being swept up in the nothingness that is the black hole, trying to increase its size as the clock counts down.

<p>
This then gives you money, money which you can spend on a skill tree, a skill tree that can grow your circle, or strengthen it, or increase the length of the timer, or increase the mass of certain asteroids, or make some of them shoot out forks of lightning, or turn some of them radioactive, all of which works in tandem with one another. As your skills increase, so does your ability to destroy asteroids and feed the black hole, growing it in size incrementally. This is one of the reactions, as well as how a lightning bolt might hit another asteroid helping to destroy it, even more effectively on the radioactive rocks.
</p><p>
The inaction is the fact that all you really do is move your mouse around. After a while, in the demo, the game does half of the work for you, but oh that sweet satisfaction of seeing a plethora of numbers and destroyed bits of space boulders flying into deep, dark, nothingness. This is a game to spend perhaps 15 minutes on, the kind of thing you might do on a cigarette break during your shift at the busiest brunch spot in town, a way to get away and calm yourself down.
</p>
<p>
A Game About Feeding A Black Hole is also a game that came out today, December 15th, so for the price of a fancy pastry, you could instead, well… you know. It's available to pick up on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3694480/A_Game_About_Feeding_A_Black_Hole/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Leder Games has announced the cancellation of the <em>Take</em> board game Kickstarter campaign. The publisher behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/root-review-woodland-warfare" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Root</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arcs-review-fun-unbridled-space-chaos" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Arcs</em></a> had its next project fully funded, but due to a notable departure at the studio, the game will not be coming to gaming tables.</p><h2>The <em>Take</em> Board Game Kickstarter Cancellation</h2><p>According to a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/12/12/root-arcs-publisher-leder-games-scraps-impending-take-kickstarter-after-games-designer-abruptly-leaves-studio/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, the <em>Take</em> board game was a passion project by Leder Games' accounting manager, Ted Caya. It was a passion project of his that he was working on outside of his day job at the company as Executive Director of Operations.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The game focused on risk management and negotiation. Up to five players took on the role of criminals executing a series of heists. The Kickstarter campaign launched about four months ago and was fully funded with more than 8,700 followers. However, in the latest update post on the campaign, Leder Games' founder, Patrick Leder, stated the following:</p><blockquote><p>“Take’s designer, Ted, has decided to move on from the studio and onto his next grand adventure. He will be bringing Take with him. Due to this, we are cancelling this crowdfunding campaign. We wish him the very best!</p><p>“As for the future of Take, that is squarely in the designer’s hands. We enjoyed our play tests in the studio, and will certainly celebrate if/when Ted takes that next step toward production.</p><p>“We are grateful for the enthusiasm you’ve all shown for Take. Nearly 8,700 followers is nothing to sneeze at! We look forward to returning to Kickstarter in the future with another amazing project. Stay tuned!”</p></blockquote><p>What this means for the <em>Take</em> board game is unclear. If you backed the original Kickstarter, you will need to contact Leder Games about a refund. But, there is a chance that the board game may return elsewhere, just not as it was sold under Leder Games.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/rog-strix-g16-laptop-with-rtx-5070-1tb-ssd-and-ryzen-9-hits-new-low-amazon-cuts-all-profit-margin-2000653501</link>

              <p>Serious gamers demand hardware that won’t bottleneck their competitive edge or compromise visual fidelity when maxed-out settings matter most. The <strong>Asus ROG Strix G16</strong> (2025 edition) targets this exact audience with bleeding-edge components that few laptops currently offer, including the brand-new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 GPU powered by Blackwell architecture.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6404/">is offering this powerhouse for $1,699 right now, marked down from its $2,099 list price</a>, hitting a record low just before Christmas arrives. This represents one of the rare gaming laptops shipping with the <strong>RTX 5070</strong> and gives early adopters access to DLSS 4 technology and next-generation ray tracing performance that won’t become mainstream for months. The combination of <strong>AMD’s latest Ryzen 9 9955HX processor, 32GB of DDR5-5600 RAM, 1TB SSD and a 240Hz display</strong> creates a no-compromise gaming machine built for competitive esports and demanding AAA titles.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6404/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Changes the Game for Mobile Gaming</h2>
<p>The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 is a big step forward in technology and its Blackwell architecture makes ray tracing and AI-powered frame generation through DLSS 4 much better. DLSS 4’s multi-frame generation can make games run three times faster by making up to three AI frames for every traditionally rendered frame and it can effectively triple frame rates in games that support it. Max-Q technologies improve power efficiency without lowering performance which means that the RTX 5070 can deliver desktop-class gaming in a portable form factor that doesn’t use up battery life right away.</p>



<p>The AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX processor has a Zen 5 architecture with a lot of cores and boost clocks that go over 5GHz and gives the CPU the power it needs to keep GPU bottlenecks from happening in competitive games. This processor can handle background tasks like streaming, Discord, and playing music without slowing down games which makes it perfect for content creators who game or streamers who need encoding power. The DDR5-5600 memory runs faster than the DDR4 memory from the previous generation and lowers latency and raises bandwidth for games that use a lot of memory and for multitasking.</p>
<p>The 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD loads things so quickly that you only have to wait a few seconds between matches or loading screens. This drive has enough space for your operating system and important apps, as well as modern games like Starfield or Baldur’s Gate 3 that require more than 100GB to install. PCIe Gen 4 speeds can reach up to 7,000MB/s for sequential reads and makes asset streaming smooth and almost completely stops texture pop-in, which is a problem with slower storage solutions.</p>



<p>The ROG Nebula Display has a 2560×1600 resolution and a 16:10 aspect ratio which means it has more vertical screen space than standard 16:9 panels, but it still has the same pixel density needed for clear images. The<strong> 240Hz refresh rate and 3ms response time</strong> get rid of motion blur and ghosting in fast-paced shooting or racing games where every millisecond counts. The new ACR film technology makes contrast ratios better and glare less, so the display can be used in brighter places without reflections washing out darker scenes.</p>
<p>The Intelligent Cooling system from ROG <strong>uses tri-fan technology, a full-width heatsink, and well-placed vents</strong> to get rid of heat without making noise like a jet engine. The advanced thermal design keeps the CPU and GPU from getting too hot during long gaming sessions, which would slow down performance if it weren’t for it. Cooler parts also make hardware last longer because high temperatures over time cause parts to wear out faster.</p>
<p>The RTX 5070 laptop is now at a price point where it competes with last-generation RTX 4070 machines that can’t match the Blackwell architecture’s performance improvements. Most gaming laptops with similar specs cost between $2,200 and $2,600, so this Asus deal is very good for cutting-edge hardware.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bungie has released a new ViDoc for their upcoming extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a>, confirming a new release window for the game, changes that have been made <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/marathon-has-been-delayed-as-bungie-commit-to-building-on-player-feedback/">since the delay</a>, and setting a price.</p>
<p>Marathon will now launch in March 2026 for PS5 and PC, and it comes with a $39.99 / €39.99 / £34.99 price tag.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon - Bungie ViDoc: Vision of Marathon | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4J91kh56jiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Since the game’s delay earlier this year, Bungie has been playtesting in private and gathering more feedback, making the following changes to the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proximity chat is now featured in the game</li>
<li>Rook is a new solo scavenger character type</li>
<li>Solo Runner queue</li>
<li>Updates to visual fidelity across the board</li>
</ul>
<p>These are really key changes, given the success and popularity of Arc Raiders. Proximity chat that enables collaboration with other players ad hoc has greatly shaped the gaming community within that extraction shooter, and having a solo queue has enabled distinct playstyles.&nbsp;The Rook character shell is specifically designed to enable you to join matches in progress, coming in with less gear but more potential to quickly scavenge and get out.</p>

<p>Also important is the change to the visuals, which will allow for dead runner bodies to remain in the world, adding a darker layer to the sci-fi visuals.</p>
<p>All of this is good (and so too is a price point that matched Helldivers 2 and Arc Raiders), but we’ll have to wait and see if this helps the game come out from under the long shadow cast by its aborted announcement earlier this year. The game’s public testing and the reaction to this went so badly that Sony and Bungie had to pull back to avoid another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>-like disaster. Bungie has also been under pressure with Destiny 2, the company enduring&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">rounds of layoffs</a> last year, following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>, and some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/15/bungie-finally-admit-they-messed-up-destiny-2-and-are-going-to-make-changes/">underwhelming reactions to the Edge of Fate</a> expansion this year, which they’ve finally admitted was a misstep and will work to rectify.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Season 2 Will Start Streaming Early]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Less than two years after it debuted, Amazon’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2s-first-real-trailer-is-here-and-its-bonkers-2000644032"><em>Fallout</em> TV show</a> is back with season 2, and even earlier than originally promised. New episodes will now kick off a whole 24 hours earlier than previously planned. The company used the Las Vegas sphere to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSShMHRkmpY/">reveal the reverse-delay</a>.</p> <p>Originally set to launch on December 17, 2025, <em>Fallout</em> season 2 will now begin streaming on December 16 at 9:00 p.m. ET instead. New episodes will be released weekly, with the latest batch wrapping up on February 4, 2026. Walton Goggins’ Ghoul, Ella Purnell’s vault dweller, and Brotherhood of Steel squire Aaron Moten will return as the show moves the focus to New Vegas, the subject of the critically acclaimed video game spin-off by Obsidian Entertainment.</p>   <p>Season 2 adds Macaulay Culkin in an unknown role and Justin Theroux as Mr. House, the guy in charge of New Vegas. It’s unclear exactly how Lucy and the Ghoul’s roundtrip through the desert will unfold, but the show has already <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-season-2-tv-show-new-vegas-location-deathclaw/">teased Deathclaws</a> and other big monsters making brief cameos. Will we see some Super Mutants too?</p> <p>The show seems likely to wade even more deeply into wasteland conspiracies and factional disputes, but none of it will be resolved in the eight upcoming episodes. Amazon has already renewed <em>Fallout</em> for season 3, and probably will make as many more as showrunner Jonathan Nolan is able to give them. Remember, <em>Fallout</em> isn’t on Netflix or HBO. You’ll need a Prime subscription to watch. Or the password to your friend’s account.</p>
