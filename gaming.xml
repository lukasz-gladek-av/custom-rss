			<p>After <strong>Bethesda</strong> gave The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion the Unreal Engine 5 remaster treatment with <strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered,</strong> according to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">Jez Corden at Windows Central</a>, both <strong>Fallout 3</strong> and <strong>Fallout New Vegas</strong> are due for the same treatment "<em>eventually</em>."</p>



<p>This isn't the first time we've had reports pointing to Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 getting some kind of remake/remaster treatment. This is actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/">the second time in the span of the last few months</a> that Windows Central has claimed a remaster/remake similar to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is on its way for two of the most beloved Fallout games. </p>



<p>That said, Windows Central is not the only source for these claims. <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-fallout-3-remaster-hundreds-of-people-working-on/">Other outlets have reported</a> that these <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiple-fallout-projects-in-the-works-including-one-everyone-wants/">remasters/remakes are in development</a>, and considering the booming success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/">Amazon's Fallout TV show</a>, and the commercial success of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">it was one of the top 12 best-selling games on Steam by revenue in 2025</a>), it feels like it's just a matter of time before Bethesda proves the rumours and reports to be correct with an official announcement.</p>



<p>"<em>Some have been wondering if a mysterious countdown on the Fallout TV show's Amazon Prime website is hinting at a shadow drop for a new Fallout game or remaster. I'm told that is not the case</em>," Corden writes. "<em>However, we are <strong>eventually</strong> getting a Fallout 3 remake in the vein</em> <em>of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, as well as Fallout New Vegas on top</em>."</p>



<p>So while there's no apparent timeline for when these remasters/remakes will be announced and released, all signs point to them happening. Hopefully, we'll have some official announcements soon.</p>

              <p>Oh great gaming gods, hear our prayer: Please may 2026 prove to be the year in which the AI bubble bursts. Amen. A rather splendid sign of at least one big-name tech company backing away from the bullshit claims comes from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/dells-ces-2026-chat-was-the-most-pleasingly-un-ai-briefing-ive-had-in-maybe-5-years/">a <em>PC Gamer</em> interview</a> with Dell’s head of product, Kevin Terwilliger, who outright stated that consumers just don’t care about AI, and aren’t drawn in by its addition to products.</p> <p>“What we’ve learned over the course of this year,” says Terwilliger to&nbsp;<em>PCG</em>‘s Dave James, “especially from a consumer perspective, is they’re not buying based on AI. In fact I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them understand a specific outcome.”</p>

 <p>This is not to say that Dell is backing away from AI as a feature within its tech (baby steps), but rather is just avoiding mentioning the topic during its latest raft of announcements during CES 2026. James reports that the Dell presentation from vice chairman Jeff Clarke only mentioned the near-meaningless two letters once, and in a pejorative fashion, saying “we have this un-met promise of AI.” Instead, the speech focused on new laptops and desktop computers, the challenges of tariffs, and some shiny new monitors. You know, like hardware manufacturers used to do.</p>

 <p>So when Dave James spoke to Dell’s Kevin Terwilliger, he brought up how conspicuous the topic was in its absence, given the tedious ubiquity of the subject for the last few years. “One thing you’ll notice is the message we delivered around our products was not AI-first,” Terwilliger told <em>PCG</em>. “So a bit of a shift from a year ago where we were all about the AI PC.”</p>

 <p>What strikes me most about this is not the lack of being AI-forward, but the willingness to call out that it was dumb to have been so in 2025. While he adds that “we’re very focused on delivering upon the AI capabilities of a device,” the change in emphasis feels very significant.</p>

 <p>The reality is, “AI” as a term means so many different things in so many different circumstances that it’s useless. For decades, in gaming, it was the term used to describe the programmed behavior of NPCs, until it was clumsily repurposed by companies like OpenAI, Google, and X to instead be shorthand for “generative-AI” like LLMs, the plagiarism machines that are fed all the content of the internet and then regurgitate it in slightly different, significantly less accurate forms. But when computer manufacturers use it, it’s something else all over again, software that “learns” based on experience, allowing for high-speed adjustments to ideally improve performance. In that sense, it’s somewhat more like the algorithms being used in scientific research to dramatically speed up fields like medical research, also usually just called “AI.”</p>

 <p>So hurrah to Dell for being bold enough to back away from the bullshit. May it be the first of very many, as we start to see “AI” exposed as the grift it truly has become, and hopefully a new emphasis on celebrating creativity and originality, whether it’s aided by AI-driven GPUs or not.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ID Software Could Be Returning To Quake]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It seems that ID Software might be returning to one of the most famous franchises under its belt, Quake. </p>



<p>The Quake series is one of the most popular franchises in gaming, redefining how the industry approaches first-person shooters. However, it’s been a very long time since we saw a new Quake instalment, with the latest being Quake Champions, along with some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quake-2-remaster-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enhanced versions of older titles</a>, so it’s high time we received a new game. </p>







<h2 id="h-id-software-rumoured-to-return-to-quake-or-hexen">ID Software Rumoured to Return to Quake or Hexen</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, which talks about Xbox’s plans in 2026, discusses the rumours about ID Software returning to Quake or Hexen, as Microsoft now owns all the rights to both franchises. There’s a chance that we could hear about these games at Bethesda’s Quakecon event; however, if it is a big reveal, then it might be featured during the Xbox Showcase. Regardless, players should take this information with a grain of salt, as it’s just a rumour. </p>



<p>As mentioned above, the last Quake game was Quake Champions, a free-to-play title that was released in 2022. However, the previous mainline Hexen game was Hexen 2, released in 1997. At the last QuakeCon, definitive versions of Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders and Hexen: Beyond Heretic were released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and Switch. However, we haven’t received a new mainline instalment in close to three decades. </p>







<p>In other news, Doom: The Dark Ages was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-biggest-launch-id-software-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest launch</a> in ID Software’s history. Additionally, read about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-bethesda-must-go-back-to-the-drawing-board-after-doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Year in Review story</a>, which talks about Bethesda having to go back to the drawing board after Doom: The Dark Ages.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why Clair Obscur Expedition 33 Is GameSpot's Game of the Year 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>"Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content," Nohra said. "And that's something I underestimated, which made people [who] wanted a challenging end boss fight feel a bit disappointed. I don't regret doing it the way we did it, but [we could have] had more explanation about your choice [in Act 3]."</p><p>Lead programmer Tom Guillermin echoed Nohra's sentiment, saying it was a "surprise" that so many players opted to do and see everything Clair Obscur had to offer rather than just mainlining the game's story. Guillermin chalked this up to "humility," as the developers didn't think they had a hit on their hands.</p><p>"We weren't sure if our game was going to be that good," Guillermin says. "And if it's not, people may just want to see the story, and go directly to the end of the story. So it was a surprise for us [that] people were doing every single thing there is to do in the game before going to the final dungeon. We're happy about that, but we didn't see it coming."</p><p>If there was one regret, Nohra said the team could've been clearer about the intended difficulty for the final boss, explaining that players should've gone to "beat it down now" instead of overleveling with side content. That didn't impact the opinions on the game, though, as Clair Obscur reviewed very well and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">broke The Game Awards' trophy-snatching record with nine awards</a>.</p><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-game-of-the-year-winners-to-date/2900-7352/#6" data-ref-id="2900-7352">joins a growing list of GOTY winners</a> that includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war/" data-ref-id="5000-455388">God of War</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-107502">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/" data-ref-id="5000-483352">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>.

This, at the time, gave the developer a "lucrative and stable business," as well as a base to build an expansion into other platforms. Now, looking at 2026, it seems that potential is waning.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"(...) ultimately you are one step removed from your audience, and you are dependent on their content strategy, so it is not a solid base to build a long term business around," the CEO says.

            <p>The analyst who forecasted a Witcher 3 expansion release in 2026 has told me they're "100 percent certain [CD Projekt Red] will release significant new content this year".</p>
<p>I messaged Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski following a prediction made in a company report</p>
<p>that said: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-there-really-going-to-be-a-2026-witcher-3-expansion">We expect the next paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3 to be released in May 2026</a>." I wanted to know how confident Chrzanowski was in that prediction and what it was based upon.</p>
<p>If you recall, I asked a similar question of Borys Nieśpielak, who is the other person credited with originating rumours of this unexpected Witcher 3 content release. Nieśpielak stood by the information and said it had been verified by several independent sources.</p><p>Chrzanowski - whose information I'm told comes from a mix of publicly available sources and conversations with CD Projekt Red - seems similarly confident. "I'm 100 percent certain CDPR will release significant new content this year," Chrzanowski told me, "as the incentive program is still 700 million PLN short [GBP 144m]."</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHuw6gZxqcg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>This "incentive program" is at the core of Chrzanowski's reasoning. It's a part of the salary for key employees at CDPR, usually management, and it aims to incentivise them by granting additional shares should certain financial targets be met. Do well, gain wealth, basically.</p>
<p>In order to meet the requirements, CDPR has to earn PLN 2bn (£412m) cumulative net profit between 2023 and 2026, PLN 3bn (£617m) between 2024 and 2027, and PLN 4bn (£823m) between 2025 and 2028, Chrzanowski explained. And it's the first threshold bracket the pressure is particularly on. "Currently, PLN 700 million [£144m] is needed to meet the first threshold, with only five quarters remaining," Chrzanowski said. "This implies the need for something significantly larger than just another update or a version for a niche platform."</p><p>But what has CDPR got that it can release? The company hasn't released a new game since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> in late 2023, though it did bring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-three-quarters-of-cyberpunk-2077s-nintendo-switch-2-sales-were-physical">Cyberpunk 2077 to Switch alongside the console's release last year, which seemed to work very well</a>. Cyberpunk 2077 continues to sell surprisingly well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-a-lot-more-copies-than-you-think-and-faster-than-the-witcher-3">passing 35 million sales-mark</a> last year and holding strong as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-games-performed-really-well-on-steam-last-year-shaking-the-dominance-of-the-same-old-live-service-games">a top-grossing game on Steam</a>, but in order to make up the incentive program shortfall it will need something more. The next announced game in the pipeline, however, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-whole-new-witcher-trilogy-of-games-released-within-six-years-of-each-other-is-that-even-possible-cd-projekt-red-thinks-so">The Witcher 4, which won't be released before 2027</a>, and probably not for a while after. In other words: after the first threshold bracket ends.</p>

<p>Incidentally, <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">CDPR referenced this incentive program in an earnings call at the end of last year</a>, when it said there was "a chance" it would release new content to help achieve the first stage of it. "Given our current progress, there is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year, having an impact on our results and increasing the likelihood of achieving the earnings condition for the first stage of the incentive program."</p>
<blockquote><em>"90 percent of the time it's pointed to a Witcher 3 expansion"</em></blockquote>
<p>This is what's behind Chrzanowski's prediction. "90 percent of the time it's pointed to a Witcher 3 expansion," Chrzanowski said. "This is a natural direction in terms of the required revenue scale. However, a Witcher-themed game like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-thaumaturge">The Thaumaturge</a> (Fool's Theory's latest production) would also be possible. Remember, Fool's Theory was built on a foundation of Witcher veterans."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-thaumaturge-review-a-refreshingly-different-polish-rpg">I reviewed The Thaumaturge in 2024</a> and was encouraged by it. Presentationally, it was a bit dated, or rather limited by what a small team could achieve, but excitingly, it felt different. It told a story set in Warsaw, Poland, at the turn of the 20th century - a setting I hadn't played in before - that revolved around a magic user known as a Thaumaturge: a person capable of reading people's thoughts and battling literal demons living there. It was strategic, thoughtful, authentic and unique.</p><p>Naturally, my interest was also heightened by The Thaumaturge being the debut game of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-1-remake-will-be-open-world-modern-reimagining">a studio hired to remake The Witcher 1</a>. We know that remake has stalled a bit as Fool's Theory helps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> team grapple with Unreal Engine 5, which The Witcher 1 remake will also use - CDPR's Red Engine has been left behind. But Fool's Theory is rumoured to be making this new Witcher 3 expansion as well.</p>
<p>"It's worth noting that CDPR is sparing with words," Chrzanowski added, "so such a strong indication of new content in the report and during the conference provides certainty, especially since declarations about meeting the incentive program goals have been communicated for a long time. The Thaumaturge premiered in March 2023, so The Witcher has been a priority since then. The team has grown from 60 to 100 people. However, some support the development of The Witcher 4 and are waiting for joint assets to be developed."</p>
<p>It's a convincing argument but there remain plenty of reasons to be sceptical. If something as considerable as a Witcher 3 expansion were in development - something which will be compared to existing Witcher 3 expansions Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine - would CDPR risk not making it in-house? Those previous expansions have been generous, celebrated things. But to make it in-house would mean re-establishing a team that moved on nearly 10 years ago and working on old tech, and it has its more than full making The Witcher 4. Perhaps Fool's Theory has been entrusted with it.</p>
<p>There's also the question of what an expansion would be if it were in development. Geralt effectively retired at the end of Blood and Wine, and The Witcher 4 is led by Ciri. Presumably Ciri's story will be handled by The Witcher 4, so would that mean Geralt would come back? Wouldn't that be confusing in terms of stealing thunder away from Ciri? Or could it be a game about someone else entirely - the sorcerer Yennefer, perhaps? And how big would it be and how much would CDPR charge for it? Questions, questions. Let's hope we get some answers, and soon.</p>

            <p>We've been hearing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">rumblings of a full-blown remake of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> for the longest time now. After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-review">Skull &amp; Bones</a>' troubled development, those current-gen assets could boost the production of such a project, so the idea never sounded too far-fetched. We've yet to receive official news on it though. Now, a new <a href="https://raidshadowlegends.com/">Raid: Shadow Legends</a> event has got hungry Assassin's Creed fans all hot under the collar.

</p><p>The free-to-play "battle collection RPG" has been enjoying lots of success on mobile devices since it launched in 2018, but we don’t blame you if you’ve never heard about it (other than in sponsored intros in YouTube video essays). That said, a quick glance at YouTube’s massive community around the Plarium Games-developed gacha will shock you: it's one of those games that trundles on quietly in the background, seemingly forever.</p>
<p>This week, it's been getting ready to welcome characters from the Assassin’s Creed series via a new event which starts tomorrow, 8th January (hat tip to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/accesstheanimus.com/post/3mbtha4s4u22z">Access the Animus on BlueSky</a>).</p>
<p>The key here is the short teaser - which hasn’t hit YouTube yet as far as we can tell - that ends with pirate-turned-assassin Edward Kenway joining the fantasy battleground. We don’t get to see the full design, which seems to resemble the original CGI model rather, than the in-game one we got in 2013.</p><p>Given the choice to end on him and <em>not</em> to reveal his full look, all the recent info we have about <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-remakes-official-title-ign-daily-fix">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced being real</a> and close by, and buzz suggesting <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/the-long-rumored-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-finally-be-announced-soon-as-leaked-domain-registration-surfaces-online">Ubisoft might have a surprise in store for us before Q1 2026 ends</a>, it’s easy to see why fans are shaking right now.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m of the opinion the January release schedule is looking a bit light on big new releases. With February and March looking way more packed, could Ubisoft be planning to shadow-drop the Black Flag remake on us out of nowhere? Considering <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-a-shadow-dropped-title-made-it-into-the-top-10-best-selling-games-of-2025.1387183/">last year’s Oblivion remaster snuck into the list of best-selling video games in the US</a> with no lead-up marketing, such an approach to Black Flag Resynced and/or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> would make sense. That’s just me theorizing, however, so don’t cannonball us if the ship isn’t ready to sail yet.</p>

            <p>Apparently, there are many studios out there that are interested in making a film or TV show based on Embark's shooter, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>.</p>
<p>We live in an age where every game under the sun seems to be - at least in the eyes of producers - ripe for adaptation. These range from the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">Amazon's Toejam and Earl movie</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivor's TV show</a> (both of which are still to materialise), to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-is-now-an-emmy-winning-series">acclaimed dramatisations like The Last of Us and Fallout</a>.</p>
<p>And, well, it seems that Arc Raiders could be joining the ever growing list of games-to-screen releases, if it gets "done in the right way".</p>

<p>Embark founder Patrick Söderlund was recently a guest on GamesBeat's YouTube channel, when the subject of an Arc Raiders adaptation came up. "I can't tell you how many companies have reached out to us wanting to make a TV series [or] a movie out of this," the exec revealed.</p><p>When asked if he was tempted to go for it, Söderlund said it could be "fun" to see an adaptation of Arc Raiders. "It needs to be done in the right way," he added. "I hope that we will do that."</p>
<p>Closing down this train of thought, Söderlund said he believes the Arc Raiders "IP fits quite well with something like that". 

So, would you be keen to see an Arc Raiders film? I assume it would have to feature plenty of rubber ducks to be totally lore accurate. Also, would any adaptation be able to stand out from other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-film-adaptation-officially-in-the-works-from-paramount">already confirmed film projects like Helldivers and Call of Duty</a>?</p>
<p>You can check out the full conversation with Söderlund via the video below.</p>

<p>According to analyst estimates, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">Arc Raiders recently passed the 12m sales milestone</a>, bringing in over $350m in revenue. Meanwhile, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">one of Steam's best selling games over the festive period</a>, thanks in part to a well-timed discount as well as an ongoing wave of positive word-of-mouth.</p>

The X5 Alteron features similar functionality to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24187539/gamesir-g8-bluetooth-mobile-controller-ios-android-nintendo-switch-pc">GameSir’s GameSir G8 Plus</a> that debuted in 2024 with an expanding telescopic mechanism that can clamp onto smartphones, tablets, and several versions of the Nintendo Switch, replacing the Joy-Cons. What sets the X5 Alteron apart is a modular design allowing most of the controls on the front to be swapped out with alternate layouts, buttons, and joysticks.</p><p>Neither company has announced when the X5 Alteron will be available, how much it will cost, or how the alternate control modules will be sold. But there’s already quite a few of them to cater to various gaming preferences. You can configure the controller with symmetrical or asymmetrical thumbsticks, change the location, number, and layout of the action buttons, and even customize the look and feel of the D-pad to your preference. There are also modules that recreate the N64 and GameCube’s controllers for a more authentic experience when playing older titles on Nintendo Switch Online, and a module with a track pad for replicating a mouse.</p><p>The X5 Alteron connects to various devices over Bluetooth which means you can also use it as a standalone controller with consoles and PCs. But you’ll also have to remember to regularly charge it over USB-C, and batteries do add some weight. On the back of the controller you’ll find Hall effect analog triggers that can be switched to a shorter travel to improve reaction time, and there’s rumble motors providing force feedback effects.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/857428/hyperkin-gamesir-x5-alteron-clamp-bluetooth-wireless-controller]]></content:encoded>

I found the opening 15 minutes of EvoCreo’s demo to be a laugh riot, mostly because I accidentally named my character “Help”, not “Helen”. This lent a certain urgency to all the routine scene-setting and tutorial dialogue. Help, Farmer Whatshisname is looking for you! Help, I’m adding a map feature to your tablet! Help, there are over 170 Creos to discover! Given that RPGs can be sluggish at first, I think I’m going to adopt this as standard practice going forward. Nothing gets you over the opening hump like the impression that everybody you speak to has just escaped from a burning house.

Based on the little time I’ve spent as a budding <del>Pokémon Trainer</del> Creo Evoker it feels like derivative but entertaining genre fare, transplanted to desktops with minimal ceremony.

According to developer rioneye, posting on the Steam forums, the new PC version won’t feature an in-game shop, and will include some of the mobile version’s separately sold DLC and premium items, though I’m not clear on final pricing. The demo’s 2D anime visuals and big-buttoned interface feel like a straight lift from the mobile game, but the presentation and controls have apparently been improved for the full Steam release. I think if you’re really into this kind of thing, the sense of playing an emulated version won’t bother you much, but this isn't exactly a posh remaster project.
</p><p>
It hits many of the beats you’re likely expecting. Taming monsters during open exploration. Arena fights. Evolutionary paths. Scraps with elite tamers. The devs seem especially proud of the combat system, which they say is about “more than matching types”, in a gentle jab at older instalments of Nintendo’s monster-taming series. “Manage move cooldowns, status effects, and powerful passive traits in deep, turn-based battles that reward smart team building and tactical thinking,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3791450/EvoCreo/">the Steam page explains</a>. There's a longer primordial account of the differences on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1727119297/evocreotm-a-monster-collection-rpg/description">the original 2013 Kickstarter</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can expect online PvP at some point after release. Maybe give the demo a shot, while it’s live? And let me know if you think of any amusing character names. I guess “Argh” or “Achoo!” would kindle a similar mood.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Marshall makes some of the best audio gear on the market. If you want to hear bold, rich sound with deeper bass on the go, we recommend checking the Marshall Major V on-ear headphones out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3934/">These typically sit at $170, but you can grab a pair for just $90 at Amazon today, after the retailer took 47% off the usual price</a>. This offer applies to the black color option. Other models are discounted, too. For instance, the brown and cream versions are sitting at $87. The blue option, on the other hand, is going for $100.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3934/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Durable Design, Bold Sound</h2>
<p>Major V headphones feature a rugged design that’s durable and made to handle everyday wear and tear quite well. The pair folds down for compact storage, making it easy to carry these around with you. When not in use, fold the headphones down, toss them into a bag, and get going!</p>
<p>You’ll enjoy the classic Marshall sound for all your favorite tracks. Expect thunderous bass, smooth mids, and crisp treble that bring music to life. Whether you’re listening to a podcast, streaming a show, or just vibing to an energy-filled song, audio comes through with exceptional clarity, with tunes felt deep into your bones. Even better, the audio doesn’t distort when you pump the volume all the way up, which is great for when you really want to immerse yourself in a track.</p>



<p>Getting started couldn’t be simpler. All you need to do is push and hold the control knob on the headphone until the LED turns to a slow blue pulse. Enable Bluetooth on your phone and select Major V from the list of available Bluetooth devices. Once the devices have been paired, download the Marshall Bluetooth app and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup. There’s a customizable M-button on one of the earcups, which can be used to access custom actions. By default, the button action is Spotify Tap, but you can tweak it to something else using the Marshall app. For instance, you can use it to launch EQ settings on the app or enable a voice assistant for hands-free management.</p>
<p>Battery life is exceptional and better than most other options in the same range. A single charge gets you up to 100 hours of playback, which is more than enough to go an entire week without running low! When it comes to recharging, the headphones support wired and wireless options. For wireless charging, you can place the right ear cup flat down on a compatible charging pad. When the LED light turns on, it indicates that the headphones are successfully being charged. It takes around 3 hours to fully recharge the pair.</p>
<p>Just note that Major V headphones aren’t water resistant, so we won’t recommend taking them to the pool or in the shower. If this isn’t a dealbreaker for you, now is a great time to pick the pair up without paying the full price. These deliver superior sound that helps you enjoy your favorite music to the fullest. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3934/">Act fast, though, as we’re expecting the discount to wrap up soon. Multiple color options are discounted, so you can pick the version that fits your aesthetics the best.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A report about the next Xbox has surfaced online, and it seems that it will heavily lean into the Windows experience. </p>



<p>We were informed late last year that Windows 11 would receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/windows-11-xbox-full-screen-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-screen support</a> for the Xbox App, allowing players to easily switch between desktop and Xbox’s “full-screen experience” when playing games. It seems that Microsoft will be leveraging the same technology for its next Xbox console. </p>







<h2 id="h-next-xbox-console-s-only-difference-from-a-traditional-pc-is-the-ability-to-run-xbox-one-and-series-x-s-games">Next Xbox Console’s Only Difference from a Traditional PC is the Ability to Run Xbox One and Series X/S Games</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Central</a> provides a lot of details on what to expect from Xbox in 2026, revealing exciting details about the upcoming console. The report shows that the plan to run “full bore Windows” on the next Xbox console has remained the same. Thanks to their partnership with AMD, this console’s interface will be delivered through the “Full Screen Experience” in the Xbox PC app, and Microsoft is hard at work to make the app capable of executing it. </p>



<p>The report says that the main difference between the next Xbox console and a traditional PC is the ability to run Xbox One and Series X/S, allowing players to bring forward their existing libraries to the next-gen console. The Xbox President has also confirmed that the next console will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-consoles-backwards-compatible-ai-enhance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backwards compatible</a> and will be enhanced with AI. The report also discusses “credible rumors” about an OEM “Xbox” PC in 2026; however, players are asked to treat this information with caution until it is properly verified.</p>







<p>Earlier last year, Corden had already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-not-a-console-at-all-insider/">stated</a> that the next Xbox console would lean more towards a PC experience, stating “a PC in essence but with a TV-friendly shell that also has a specific set of specs in mind.’ Xbox President Sarah Bond has also stated that they are hard at work developing their next-generation hardware and that it will be a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-double-down-powerful-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">powerful experience</a>“. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Closes Halifax Studio Just After Employees Unionized]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The layoffs across the video game industry are getting started early in 2026. Ubisoft has announced the closure of Ubisoft Halifax.</p>



<p>The closure will see 71 people lose their jobs.</p>







<p>The news of the studio’s shutdown comes just days after it was announced that 61 of the studio’s employees joined the Game &amp; Media Workers Guild of Canada, Local 30111. The certification for the union came on December 18, 2025, and was branded as the Ubisoft Workers of Canada, Halifax.</p>



<p>In a statement, Ubisoft says that decision comes after two years of “company-wide actions to streamline operations”.</p>



<p><strong>“Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs,” </strong>the company said. <strong>“As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. </strong></p>



<p>“<strong>We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance.”</strong></p>







<p>The decision, Ubisoft claims, was made “well before” the staff unionized. Ubisoft added that it respected its employees right to join a union. Insider Gaming has reached out for a statement from members of the Union. Should that be received, it will be added to this story. </p>



<p>Prior to its closure, Ubisoft Halifax was working on mobile games for Rainbow Six and Assassin’s Creed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[What If I Don't Fantasize About Having A Friend In A Jar]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/razer-project-ava-ces/</link>
            <guid>1399489</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Of course AI was going to be big at this year’s CES, but somehow I was still surprised by the latest developments in Razer’s Projet Ava. In 2025 it was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K46-vHL4Ouo&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>disembodied voice</u></a> that promised to be “the ultimate AI gamer copilot,” dispensing emotionless advice about MOBAs and shooters. In 2026, it’s rebranded itself as “your AI desk companion” and morphed into a sycophantic human hologram in a jar that’s currently–steel yourself–running off Grok.</p><p>On the Ava <a href="https://www.razer.com/concepts/project-ava?ref=aftermath.site"><u>site</u></a>, Razer writes, “Building on the 2025 esports AI coach concept, Project AVA has evolved into a fully integrated AI desk companion designed to support every facet of modern life. Razer aims to bridge the gap between virtual assistance and physical companionship by providing a 24/7 digital partner that lives right alongside the user.”</p><p>In a trailer, Ava–first in the form of an anime girl named Kira who Razer describes as “always ready to level up with you,” and then as a muscular man named Zane–wakes users up, gives them vague fashion and work advice, and shouts gamer nonsense while the users play. According to Razer, Ava will be able to offer self-care and meal-planning advice, analyze your work spreadsheets, and cheer you on in video games–or, as it awkwardly told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854705/razer-ai-anime-waifu-hologram-desk?ref=aftermath.site"><u>The Verge</u></a> in a hands-on demo, “I look forward to partnering up with you and sharing the laughter and rage in gaming.”&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_QDthx_WjwE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Razer Project AVA: Your AI Desk Companion"></iframe></figure><p>The Verge noted how frequently their experience with the Kira character got flirty, and maybe that’s no surprise–Razer writes on the Ava site that it “currently utilizes xAI’s Grok engine to demonstrate its sophisticated reasoning and dynamic personality.” You know, the thing that’s making <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x?ref=aftermath.site"><u>thousands</u></a> of nude images, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/02/elon-musk-grok-ai-children-photos?ref=aftermath.site"><u>CSAM</u></a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/05/elon-musk-ashley-st-clair-grok-fake-sexualised-images?ref=aftermath.site"><u>revenge porn</u></a>, for Twitter users lately, not even for the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-grok-ai-is-as-gross-as-you-might-expect-2000599098?ref=aftermath.site"><u>first time</u></a>. At least Razer seems to be leaving the door open to other AI platforms, including developing its own. </p><p>Razer apparently believes this thing is launching this year, taking $20 <a href="https://www.razer.com/concepts/project-ava/reservation?ref=aftermath.site"><u>pre-orders</u></a> for people in the US. I’d certainly believe they could do it, in that Ava could plausibly be an object that could be put in a box and sent to people to place on their desks. Less believable is any of its purported functions besides the one Razer is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/razer-project-ava-ai-companion-hologram-2026-1?ref=aftermath.site"><u>trying to not just come out and say</u></a>: Here is the fantasy of a pretty girl (or handsome man, though even Razer defaults to using “she” at one point on its site), what Razer calls a “Friend for Life” in a bit of wordplay that probably sounded clever in a marketing meeting but really just belies the fact that this is a person-shaped facsimile that can witness your life and be witnessed by you, all the time, with no priorities beyond hyping you up and being “prettiest for you.”&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="113" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E2Y0dmwJd8A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Razer Holographic AI Voice Assistant Kira (Project Ava) CES 2026 Demo #razer #ces2026 #technology"></iframe></figure><p>The whole thing has the same pathetic vibes as Amazon’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/no-amount-of-money-can-buy-being-goated-with-the-sauce/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>recent Alexa ads</u></a>, with an added dash of being gross as hell. You’d think in 2026 both the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/31/podcasts/the-daily/chatgpt-ai-relationship.html?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">failures</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">dangers</a> of personifying AI would be clear, and you’d think we’d be over the lonely gamer stereotype as a marketing tool, but, well, here we are on both counts. No one needs to buy the line Razer and other companies going all-in on AI are selling, that human relationships can be approximated and that their peak form is availability and attention. You, as a person who plays video games, does not need to fall for the con that you have whatever need Project Ava purports to meet, or that it embodies the form you want your relationships to take. There's plenty of online gaming advice out there, including from the people you're playing online games with. And you don't need an imaginary friend to tell you you'll feel good in your favorite shirt.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/moxie-robot-ai-dying-llm-embodied/"><div><p>AI Company That Made Robots For Kids Goes Under, Robots Die - Aftermath</p><p>Embodied, maker of the AI robot called Moxie, is shuttering.

Hopefully the upcoming patch will iron things about.</p>

<p>Ubisoft Halifax's best-known export is probably the mobile game <em>Assassin's Creed Rebellion</em>, and Ubisoft will apparently be halting live operations for <em>Assassin's Creed Rebellion </em>following "a steady decline in the game's revenues", <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-shuttering-freshly-unionised-halifax-studio-71-jobs-affected" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">according to Gamesindustry.biz</a>.</p><p>As such, while the timing of Halifax's shutdown might seem a little suspicious, I'd be inclined to believe Ubisoft when it says the decision has been made for cost-cutting reasons, as callous as that might sound. After all, it's been a rough year for the publisher.</p><p>2025 saw Ubisoft making layoffs across a number of studios, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-entertainment-ubisoft-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="eb337fd6-aaaa-412a-8249-337dc274de4e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>The Division</em>'s Massive Entertainment</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-redlynx-restructuring" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c40ca2ba-0c2c-453f-a503-eb81293d2704" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Trials</em>' RedLynx</a>, with longtime <em>Assassin's Creed </em>boss Marc-Alexis Côté apparently leaving the studio after two decades back in October.</p><p>Although <em>Assassin's Creed Rebellion </em>might be coming to an end, Ubisoft is still moving full steam ahead with the series; a <em>Black Flag </em>remake is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-pegi-rating" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="292d641e-bf40-464f-b78f-b4b27493ed71" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">probably about to be announced</a>, although <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows </em>will seemingly buck a recent trend by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-no-second-expansion" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b1580231-9303-463b-86b1-da6f728202d4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">not getting a second big expansion</a>.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Senara: The Sacrament</em>'s setting of a derelict ship is pretty original.</figcaption>

<p>In gameplay terms, Influsion says it's going back to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinion/what-makes-survival-horror-game" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bac7feef-be60-4457-85f4-9b44e7d6dac3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">"classic survival horror design"</a> for <em>Senara: The Sacrament</em>, which means you can expect a "massive escape room" in which you'll need to solve puzzles and manage your resources carefully.</p><p>The game will very much feature combat, too, if its new trailer is anything to go by; you can expect to come across monsters wandering the Senara's corridors, and you'll need to choose whether to put them down or sneak past them to conserve ammo.</p><p>Narrative-wise, meanwhile, Influsion is promising a tale that's "open to interpretation", with "snippets of truth scattered across documents, objects, and conversations between characters" to discover. You'll need to piece the story together yourself based on what you find.</p><p>You can check out the new trailer for <em>Senara: The Sacrament</em>, which features a few tantalizing glimpses of gameplay, right here.</p>
<p>Influsion says it's used technology like LiDAR and photogrammetry to create a "scan of a real-life documentary-accuracy 6,000-ton ship" for <em>Senara: The Sacrament</em>, too, although I'm not sure the monsters can claim the same honor.</p><p><em>Senara: The Sacrament </em>doesn't have a release date yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3915120/SENARA_The_Sacrament/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">wishlist it right here on Steam</a>, and a demo is on its way in February as well.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/against-mac-mini-deal-this-mini-gaming-pc-drops-below-black-friday-pricing-intel-core-i9-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-2000657686</link>
            <guid>1399450</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Not a fan of big, bulky PCs taking over your workstation? You might want to consider investing in a mini PC. These options pack significant power in a compact frame and are easy to carry around on the go.</p>
<p>The market is filled with options, but if you’re after something muscular that can handle both regular work and some resource-intensive projects with ease, the mini gaming PC by Acemagician is worth a look, especially at its current price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6688/">Amazon has now dropped the model by 30%, offering it for just $599, down from $856.</a> You’re saving a whopping $257 on a powerful option that comes with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed. Delivery is free, too, which sweetens the offer even more!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6688/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Incredible Performance, Spacious Storage</h2>
<p>This PC runs on the efficient Intel Core i9 13900HK processor, which features 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) with 20 threads, and turbo boosts up to 5.4GHz. It’s built on Intel 7 process technology with 24MB Smart Cache and 54W TDP to deliver speedy, reliable performance for all your tasks, whether you’re working on an office project or trying to get creative with a personal assignment. The processor outperforms options like i9 12900HK, 7840HS, and 6800H in overall performance, too. You can rely on it for content creation, 4K editing, business workloads, studies, and even gaming.</p>
<p>There’s a massive 32GB DDR4 RAM to keep things snappy as you push through productive days. It’s more than enough to help you multitask like a pro with ease. Think juggling multiple applications at the same time, hopping through a ton of tabs on a couple of different browsers, taking back-to-back video calls, and streaming while gaming – all this without experiencing noticeable slowdowns. Storage capacity is just as impressive, thanks to a 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD. It’s roomy enough to house all your multimedia files (photos, videos, movies), work documents, research papers, important programs, and more. Best of all, both the memory and storage are expandable up to 64GB RAM and 4TB, respectively. This means you can always upgrade the system as your needs grow, without relying on external solutions.</p>



<p>All these specs also make this mini PC great for playing your favorite games. While it won’t offer the performance of a full-fledged gaming PC, it’s more than capable of running titles like Fortnite, League of Legends, and Valorant on medium settings. Those who prefer a larger, more productive work/play setup will appreciate how it can support up to three displays at the same time. Other connectivity options include WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, and a 2.5GbE LAN port. Additionally, USB4 ports take the performance even further by offering up to 40Gbps transfer speeds. For reference, it can easily move a 3GB 4K video in just 1 second – quite literally.</p>
<p>Despite all this power, the mini PC stays fairly quiet while working. It comes with an advanced dual fan that ensures quiet and efficient operation, regardless of the task at hand. The PC itself is quite compact and can even be mounted at the back of a monitor for a cleaner setup. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, too, so you can get started with using the device right away.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to give your desktop setup a refresh, now is a great time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6688/">This efficient PC is now available for less than $600, and is sure to make both work and play a lot more enjoyable.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-starcraft-shooter-revealed-blizzcon-2026/</link>
            <guid>1399444</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long-rumored StarCraft shooter looks set to be revealed this year. </p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden at Windows Central</a>, the StarCraft third-person shooter is “likely” to be revealed at BlizzCon 2026 in September.</p>







<p>“The headline for BlizzCon 2026 is most likely going to be&nbsp;StarCraft,” Corden writes. “It was&nbsp;previously reported that StarCraft is getting the third-person shooter treatment, and I confirmed these rumors true via my own sources a while back.”</p>



<p>As mentioned, rumors of this new game are nothing new. As far back as September 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-starcraft-shooter-in-development-at-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported</a> on this new title, which first came from Jason Schreier. It was mentioned as being in development in his latest book&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jason-schreier/play-nice/9781538725429/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future Of Blizzard Entertainment</a>, and former Far Cry head Dan Hay was leading the team.</p>



<p>No other details about this game are known at this point, but to hear it’s still moving forward has to be excited for fans of the franchise. Of course, this isn’t the first time Blizzard is attempting a shooter based on the StarCraft franchise. </p>







<p>Back in 2002, Blizzard announced StarCraft: Ghost, a stealth-action shooter. Eventually, the game was put on an “indefinite hold” in March 2006 before being canceled. </p>



<p>Overall, there hasn’t been a new release in the StarCraft universe since StarCraft: Remastered in 2017. The last new original release was StarCraft 2 in 2010.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mysterious Fallout Countdown Isn’t Related to Fallout 3 Remake, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-3-remake-not-linked-to-mysterious-countdown/</link>
            <guid>1399441</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re at all invested in the Fallout space, you’ll have heard about the ‘mysterious countdown’ that’s running on the Amazon Prime platform. It’s set to expire when the last episode of the Fallout TV show’s second season drops on February 4. From the moment the countdown popped up, fans have believed it to be counting down to a reveal of the Fallout 3 remake.</p>



<p>However, a new report from a notable source has suggested this <strong>is not the case</strong>. It’s not counting down to a shadow drop or announcement of the Fallout 3 remake, <strong>but </strong>the project <strong>is </strong>on the way.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-3-remake-is-coming-but-nobody-knows-when">Fallout 3 Remake is Coming, But Nobody Knows When</h2>



<p>In a new and extensive report from Windows Central, the future of Xbox and the many studios under the gaming titan’s banner was explored. It’s a huge year for ‘Team Green’, and several high-profile anniversaries promise some sizeable announcements should be lined up.</p>



<p>Fans of the post-apocalyptic series from Bethesda Game Studios have been expecting a reveal of the Fallout 3 remake for quite some time. However, despite references to the project being found in documents some years ago, <strong>nothing concrete </strong>has been announced by the studio.</p>



<p>That might be about to change soon, but what’s suspected to be the biggest indicator of an impending announcement has been <strong>debunked</strong>.</p>



<p>In Jez Corden’s <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent supersized breakdown</a> of what’s coming in the Xbox space, the insider stressed that the Fallout countdown running on the Amazon Prime site is <strong>not </strong>related to a Fallout 3 remake announcement.</p>



<p>He wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m told this is not the case. However, we are&nbsp;<em>eventually&nbsp;</em>getting a Fallout 3 remake in the vein of&nbsp;Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>

<p>It’s not clear when Bethesda Game Studios plans to announce the Fallout 3 remake, but at this point, it’s almost guaranteed that it’ll be unveiled soon. In the last couple of years, the Fallout TV show, updates to Fallout 4, and the ongoing expansion of Fallout 76 have all combined to push franchise sentiments sky-high.</p>

                <p>The Switch is already lacking in video-streaming apps, and the platform is set to lose one of the biggest ones next month. Nintendo confirmed that the Hulu app is already off the eShop, which appears to be a part of a larger change for the Disney-owned media service.</p><p>Nintendo's <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71201/~/discontinuation-of-hulu-app-on-nintendo-switch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">support website</a> states that official support for the Hulu application ends on February 5. The Switch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-quietly-introduces-its-first-video/1100-6454815/" data-ref-id="1100-6454815">app silently launched back in November 2017</a>, months after the console came to retail. The app is not compatible with Nintendo Switch 2, and a native version of the app never came to Nintendo's new console.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How Nintendo Won The Console War</p>
      </div>
<p>Disney confirmed last year that the <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/hulu-app-phased-out-disney-plus-fully-integrating-1236480450/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu app will be fully integrated into Disney+</a>, unifying both of the company's streaming services. Standalone subscriptions for both services will still be available once the platform merger occurs sometime this year, but anyone wishing to watch Hulu offerings at that point will have to do so on the Disney+ app.</p><p>That proves troublesome for Switch owners, as Disney+ has never been available on Nintendo consoles, skipping support for the Switch and lacking any support for Switch 2. Disney+ isn't alone, as the likes of Netflix, Prime Video (both of which supported Wii U), and HBO Max are also no-shows on Switch platforms.</p><p>It's a frustrating development for Switch users who would prefer to watch their streaming media on their hybrid consoles. The only noteworthy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-apps/1100-6495947/" data-ref-id="1100-6495947">streaming apps on Switch 1 are YouTube</a> and Crunchyroll, though neither functions on Switch 2. A Twitch app was also available on Switch, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-losing-twitch-app-soon/1100-6518803/" data-ref-id="1100-6518803">it was discontinued in 2023</a>.</p><p>Of course, Nintendo fans can continue to stream their favorite media on smart TVs--or other consoles they own.</p>

            <p>If you haven't been watching, Fallout Season 2 is pretty great and has been enjoying a good deal of success. So much so that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-3-now-being-written-collaborations-between-show-and-games-discussed">Season 3 is already well into the writing stage</a>. New games are sadly still a ways off, however, which is why both veteran and new players are flocking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> and other entries to go post-apocalyptic.</p>
<p>That’s what <a href="https://steamdb.info/">SteamDB</a> has been saying, at least. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fallout-season-2-has-doubled-the-number-of-people-playing-the-fallout-games-on-steam/">PC Gamer</a> took a look at the data before and after Season 2 premiered back in December 2025. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>, which recently received an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-announces-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-confirms-nintendo-switch-2-version-for-2026">Anniversary Edition</a>, seems to be the biggest winner, with its concurrent players count going from 20,000 on average to 40,000 as of last Sunday. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and 2010's New Vegas also saw similar bumps, with the latter being the most relevant to Season 2's plot and setting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> has also doubled its concurrent players from a hundred-ish to around 200. For a single-player game released on 2008 that’s also available elsewhere and doesn’t have as many direct ties to the TV show as the other three we’ve mentioned, that’s not bad. Even free-to-play, mobile-oriented <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a> saw an increase in activity.</p>
<p>The New Vegas-oriented second season of Fallout, which is currently airing new episodes each week via Amazon’s Prime Video, takes Lucy, The Ghoul, Maximus, and many other characters to very familiar places, yet the key creatives behind the show have been smart enough to avoid the usual interconnected universe, franchise-building issues.</p><p>Needless to say, Microsoft-owned and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>-led <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> has done a great job of shepherding the show alongside the creative team led by Jonathan Nolan, Lisa Joy, Graham Wagner, and Geneva Robertson-Dworet, making it not just the perfect gateway into the video game franchise, but also a respectable companion piece that’s defining the post-Fallout 4 timeline <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-5-will-exist-in-a-world-where-the-stories-and-events-of-the-show-happened-or-are-happening-says-todd-howard">the fifth game will be acknowledging when it finally arrives</a>. For now, we have more Fallout 76 content updates and the Switch 2 port of Fallout 4 to look forward to.</p>

            <p>Kazutaka Kodaka is one of the most recognizable names in the games industry for those who really enjoy anime-inspired visual novels. Recently, he led <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a>'s development, and the his name may be familiar to anyone au fait with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/danganronpa-and-the-surprising-joys-of-clumsy-queer-representation">Danganronpa</a> series. But the creator's journey to get back into the world of game development wasn't exactly a straight line.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/danganronpa-creator-became-a-game-dev-because-of-an-argument-he-had-while-working-part-time-that-made-him-think-what-am-i-doing-with-my-life/">Automaton</a> (who also translated the original comments), we've learned that, during last year's Computer Entertainment Developers Conference (CEDEC+KYUSHU 2025), the director explained how he landed the position his Spike Chunsoft, which led to the creation of the original Danganronpa. The main twist? He decided to focus on games after having a heated exchange with a co-worker while working part-time at a game shop.</p>
<p>After a few games-related gigs, Kodaka spent quite some time in his twenties making indie films and working part-time jobs. One day, at the aforementioned game shop, he scolded a fellow university student working alongside him for a mistake she made, saying she wouldn't make it in society. Her answer was pointing out that he "hadn't been out in society" for a while, which made him stop, ask himself "What am I even doing", and rethink his life choices and how he interacted with others (as revealed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1zJH-dl-kw">another interview</a>) going forward.</p>
<p>This exchange ended his game development hiatus after working in minor roles on projects like Clock Tower 3 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil 2</a>, as he started a job hunt which landed him a position at Spike. The rest is history. Danganronpa became a hit praised for its mix of dark comedy, heavy themes, and engaging mystery before spawning a larger series of well-recieved titles. By the late 2010s, he departed Spike and founded the studio Too Kyo Games alongside other veterans.</p><p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-hundred-line-and-danganronpa-creator-says-there-would-be-more-uniquely-japanese-games-if-development-was-more-creator-oriented-and-focused-on-individuality/">Kodaka has been vocal in the past</a> about the huge impact anime, manga, and "borrowed" video games had on his personal storytelling style and the visual aspect of Danganronpa and The Hundred Line. It's nice to hear about his life before becoming a massive name in the Japanese games industry, though. Yet another reminder you never know what might be around the corner.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/splitgate-dev-responds-to-low-player-counts-steam-charts-dont-measure-fun/</link>
            <guid>1399408</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/">on December 17, 2025</a>, Splitgate developer <strong>1047 Games</strong> relaunched Splitgate 2 as <strong>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</strong>. The new title is meant to signify a fusion of the best of the first game and its maligned sequel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-back-to-beta-re-launch-2026-og-splitgate-servers-shutdown-1047-games-layoffs/">after Splitgate 2's initial launch went terribly</a>, and 1047 Games co-founder <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">promised to "<em>make FPS great again</em>."</a></p>



<p>If you didn't know that Splitgate 2 had relaunched under its new moniker, or that it had relaunched at all, then don't worry; you're not alone. Arena Reloaded doesn't seem to have fared any better than Splitgate 2, at least according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#max">its concurrent player numbers on SteamDB</a>. The game <strong>currently struggles to hit 1k concurrent players,</strong> and two days after some publications reported on those poor numbers, 1047 Games has taken it upon itself to respond.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982">In a statement posted to its official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, the caption reads, "<em>1047 Games Responds to Recent Steam Charts Conversations</em>," almost like it was trying to write a headline for publications to use. The statement goes on to begin with, "<em>Steam Charts don't measure fun</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>They show one number, on one platform, at one given moment. They don't show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don't capture the community that's actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale).</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Over the past six months, we rebuilt Splitgate from the ground up because we believe in the game, our team, and our community. The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of Splitgate possible. To our amazing community: thank you. Your feedback and passion have helped make Arena Reloaded better every day. And to everyone who hasn't</em> <em>played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay's the best it's ever been, and we'd love for you to jump in and form your own opinion. A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The thing is, 1047 Games is absolutely right. It's not the best thing to get stuck in the weeds of SteamDB numbers when it comes to multi-platform games. Those numbers are only showing one platform, and we can't even take it as a proper read of PC players because Arena Reloaded is also available on the Epic Games Store. </p>



<p>Console platforms like PlayStation and Xbox don't share concurrent player numbers, so we can't really know how popular the game is outside of Steam. And SteamDB charts are only ever worth keeping an eye on when it comes to multiplayer games; they absolutely do not matter for single-player titles. </p>



<p>With all that said, if 1047 Games felt the need to make a statement like this, that can't be a sign that things are actually going fine internally when the team looks at its player numbers. If its numbers on Steam were low, but on consoles, it has thousands or even hundreds of thousands of players each day, then why care about chatter surrounding a platform that isn't the one your community is on? Some games are more popular on PC, while others are more popular on consoles.</p>



<p>So yes, SteamDB charts are never the full picture and anyone claiming that Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is dead in the water based solely on those numbers doesn't have all of the facts. But making a statement like this two days after initial reports of the low numbers seems more like an attempt to keep Splitgate in the news as much as possible, hoping more people will remember that it exists and give it a chance.</p>



<p>That's just speculation, of course, but if Splitgate: Arena Reloaded's concurrent player numbers on Steam are an accurate representation of how unpopular the game currently is, and the dire straits it is in, then that also feels like the exact kind of thing you would do if you were desperate for anyone to play your game.</p>



<p>Let us know below if we've got the situation completely wrong, and you're playing Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on your console or PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Japanese company Hitachi has announced a new voice command software protocol for the Switch 2, and I, for one, am daring to hope it could be used to finally bring old DS games to the system.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hitachi-launches-multilingual-intuitive-voice-command-recognition-software-for-nintendo-switch-2-game-devs/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Automaton Media</a>, the Ruby Spotter software allows developers to incorporate voice command features beyond simply using the microphone for communication. It's actually already available in a number of other places, including "car navigation systems" and "industrial equipment", according to Automaton.</p><p>Hitachi's decision to bring the software to the Switch 2 is driven by a desire to create an environment for developers to include "highly flexible operations" for the microphone in their games, including menu selections and issuing in-game commands.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>New voice command options will soon be available to Nintendo Switch 2 developers.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The possibilities are endless; developers could use Hitachi's Ruby Spotter software to allow you to issue commands to troops in a strategy game, for instance, or to communicate with an in-game character, <em>Nintendogs</em>-style.</p><p>That might as well bring us onto what I really hope this software can be used for: porting DS games to the Switch 2. Since there's already a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-klonoa-mr-driller" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="201c59bf-eb51-4121-bbf8-ae2b52eff44c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">robust library</a> of Game Boy Advance <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-gba" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="40d7514b-1ab5-4518-bcb1-2874c7dd70bf" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">games</a> on the Switch Online service, I think the debut of DS titles is way past due.</p><p>Games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass </em>and the aforementioned <em>Nintendogs </em>used the Nintendo DS' microphone as part of their gameplay, and Hitachi's Ruby Spotter could allow Nintendo to bring those games (which are otherwise unavailable) to the Switch 2.</p><p>As it stands, there are tons of DS games, including the ones I've mentioned, that you'll need to turn to the second-hand market to enjoy, and so this would seem like the perfect opportunity to port them to modern systems. Come on, Nintendo. You know it makes sense.</p><figure role="group">

            <p>Right, get ready for some chatter about where the contents of our collective wallets have gone over the past year. Valve's list of the highest-grossing games on Steam in 2025 has emerged from the great mists, and in a nice revelation, features a larger number of fresh releases than last year's ranking. That's alongside all of the moderately to quite old stuff which more folks keep hopping on the train of with every passing 12 month period. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025?tab=2">data</a>'s been dissected, shared, and otherwise <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18eg0P-P-swZ8v6kWyA4XkJpIEhr7UZospSWqJMEmDK4/edit?gid=0#gid=0">spreadsheeted</a> by <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/who-won-steams-best-of-2025-revenue">GameDiscoverCo</a> in their latest newsletter. The big news is that of the top 100 highest grossers, 31 were new games - that meaning games released in 2025 or 2024 in this case. Fresh games made up 24 of the 100 spots in last year's version of this ranking, so things have trended marginally newer.</p>
<p>"It’s possible that 2025 was just a super-strong year for new games," GameDiscoverCo boffin Simon Carless wrote of potential explanations for this shift. "It’s also possible that with more and more ‘catalog games’ being sold cheaply on discount, sorting by revenue will favour $60 newcomers &amp; viral hits (vs. games at 25-50% of the price that still do good ‘long tail’.) It’s probably...a combo of these things?"</p>
<p>As for the new games which made the cut, Valve split these rankings into four tiers of moneyness - platinum, gold, silver, and bronze. Platinum's the top ranking, with seven of its 12 this year meeting the new game requirements. Those were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>, plus viral hits Schedule 1 and REPO. There's also Call of Duty, which technically counts as new thanks to Activision's switch to dishing out its latest shootering via an app. The remaining four platinumers are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, all of which have shot their way to defending the honour of the non-brand new games.</p><p>Moving down to gold tier, you find newbies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a>. They're hanging out with a number of other well-established big hitters - your Cyberpunk 2077 and Baldur's Gate 3. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead By Daylight</a> are also in that club, proving their staying power. The tier below that, silver is home to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, while Hades 2's nestled in bronze. Taking a glance at the list of most played Steam Deck games, both Silksong and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> have vaulted straight into the platinum section this year.</p>
<p>As Carless eludes to, pinning down exactly what's caused this year's shifts is complicated, but the wider trend at least appears to suggest the continued strangulation of folks' ability to spend on new games without worrying they might suddenly need that money because they've been laid off isn't pushing things even more starkly away from newer games which're usually more pricey than their older brethren.</p>
<p>Then again, the fact Steam's free of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a> - two perennial stalwarts of lists like these for other platforms - is probably helping make that sunny assessment easier to reach.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After the destructive shitstorm that happened when </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131"><span>collaborated with Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum</span></a><span> in 2023, I’m surprised any esteemed establishment wants to partner with Pikachu and friends. Videos of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>scalpers pulling a Black Friday-level raid</span></a><span> on the museum’s store are still lodged in my brain, and when I heard the Natural History Museum in London was going to have a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>exhibit later this month, I started bracing myself for a repeat. It may still happen, but now that The Pokémon Company and the museum have </span><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/pokemon-natural-history-presents-pokecology"><span>announced the card</span></a><span> they’ll be giving out at the event, some fans are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1q6bqwn/new_natural_history_museum_promo_for_the/"><span>letting out a sigh of optimistic relief</span></a><span> that scalpers might leave the whole thing alone.</span></p> <p><span>The “Pikachu at the Museum” promo card is super cute, and shows the little yellow guy excitedly walking through a museum adorned with what look like fossils of Aerodactyl and Tyrantrum. At a glance, it doesn’t look like a great card for competitive play, with reasonably low stats and good but not great damage output for the amount of energy cards you’ll have to feed into it, but none of that actually matters because this card won’t be used in a deck. It’s a jumbo card, not suitable for use in a playable deck or, perhaps more notably, for placement into a collector’s binder.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657715" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657715"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657715">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This is significant because jumbo cards tend to go under scalpers’ radars, specifically because they’re often harder to sell. Though its rarity may still bring in vultures, fans are hopeful this choice will take the wind out of resellers’ sails. On top of this, the card will be available at select UK retailers on January 30, so if scalpers want it that badly, they might have better luck bothering a store than a museum.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I love how their scalping prevention is ‘let’s make it a jumbo, nobody cares about jumbos,’” ZVAARI wrote on Reddit. “Hope someone makes a nice normal sized reproduction of it, the art is cool and I’d like to have it in my binder.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Its both a shame it’s oversized (won’t fit in my collection nicely), but also will hopefully prevent too much hype,” PlopTheOwl wrote in the same thread. “Love the art. Would have liked it to be a full art, but honestly so pleased to see some Pokémon bones like in-game Pokémon museums.”</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657714"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657714">© The Pok<span>émon Company</span></figcaption></figure> <p><span>After this announcement, I’m more concerned the collab’s exclusive merchandise might be targeted by scalpers, rather than the card itself. The museum will also be selling an exclusive collection of art, stationery, clothes, collectibles, and a Pikachu plush showing him hugging a miniature museum. These will also be sold online at the UK Pokémon Center shop and the museum’s online store. If nothing else, it seems the museum and Pokémon Company are trying to avoid a second Van Gogh debacle, but we’ll see if these safeguards actually amount to anything, as scalpers still find a way to ruin anything with Pikachu’s face on it. If nothing else, I hope the fans who show up to see the exhibit are able to have a good time without being trampled by someone looking to flip the merchandise.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>x Natural History Museum event will last from January 26 to April 19.</span></p>
