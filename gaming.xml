True to form, that's exactly what we got today, and here's everything that was announced during said showcase!</p>

<hr><h2>New episodes of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge&nbsp;</em>are on the way</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-concierge-new-episodes-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=UJGGkGeW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-concierge-new-episodes-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=AngXE7QU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge&nbsp;</em>episodes are coming in September.</figcaption></figure><p>To kick the show off, The Pokemon Company announced new episodes of the charming stop-motion animation&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge</em>. They're set to air via Netflix in September, and you can watch the first four episodes of the show for free via YouTube from now until March 9th.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>Tour: Unova - Global coming this weekend</h2>

<p>Next up, we got a look at the next&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>Tour, which is happening this weekend. It'll see Black Kyurem and White Kyurem appearing in Raid Battles, and you'll also get the chance to get your hands on Victini and a shiny Meloetta.</p>

<h2>Mobile-focused&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>announcements are go</h2>

<p>Three mobile-focused&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>titles got updates next, namely&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Masters EX</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Cafe ReMix</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Sleep</em>.</p>

<p>In the former, Champion May and her shiny Primal Kyogre, as well as Champion Brendan and his shiny Primal Groudon, will be making an appearance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Cafe ReMix&nbsp;</em>is getting a new apple-themed menu item along with appearances from Flapple and Appletun, while a new Cresselia versus Darkrai event is coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Sleep</em>.</p>

<h2>New&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>fighters announced</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-unite-new-fighters-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=2Lo2DDvE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-unite-new-fighters-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=OrhC4s9w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Three new fighters have been revealed for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Three new Pokemon were announced for the MOBA&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite</em>. Suicune is coming to the game on March 1st, followed by Alolan Raichu in April and Alcremie later in the year.</p>

<p>What's more, the game will also see the return of the Remoat Stadium map, as well as a brand new mode called First to 500, which will reward you with unique battle effects when reaching certain point thresholds.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s Triumphant Light set revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-pokemon-presents.jpg?itok=TO6J_eU9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-pokemon-presents.jpg?itok=g_fQUaSE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new set is coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>The next major expansion set for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has been revealed in the form of Triumphant Light, and this one looks like it's themed around the deific Pokemon Arceus, which makes sense given that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous expansion Space-Time Smackdown</a> was built around Dialga and Palkia.</p>

<p>Cards include new Eevee, Magnemite, and Golbat variations, as well as a rather pretty Arceus ex card, a full-art Shaymin, and a pretty sweet-looking shiny Raichu. The set launches tomorrow.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>is getting Mega Evolutions</h2>

<p>Mega Evolved Pokemon are coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG</em>&nbsp;this year! The trailer showed off some snazzy-looking ex cards for Mega Lucario and Mega Gardevoir, but it didn't reveal a release date for the new feature.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>is getting some fun stuff</h2>

<p>If you're still playing&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>, you'll be pleased to know that you can grab yourself a nifty-looking Rotom Phone cover for each game. Simply input SB00KC0VER for&nbsp;<em>Scarlet&nbsp;</em>and VB00KC0VER for&nbsp;<em>Violet&nbsp;</em>(those are zeroes, not Os).</p>

<p>New Tera Raid Battles for Meowscarada, Skeledirge, and Quaquaval are also coming on February 28th, March 7th, and March 14th, respectively, with more (including Metagross, Garchomp, and Dragapult) on the way in the future.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Champions&nbsp;</em>brings battling to Switch and mobiles</h2>




<p>Next up, The Pokemon Company announced a new game called&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Champions</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Stadium</em>-style game with an emphasis on battling.</p>

<p>The game will connect to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Home</em>, allowing you to use 'mons you've teamed up with in your games to battle trainers around the world. This one's coming to Switch and mobile devices, although we don't know when yet.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>coming "late 2025", new gameplay revealed</h2>




<p>Finally, we got to see some new info about&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, and we now know roughly when to expect the game as well, although certain details still seem conspicuous by their absence.</p>

<p>The game will take place in a Lumiose City currently undergoing a "high-tech urban redevelopment plan" in order to "turn it into a city that people and Pokemon truly share".</p>

<p>It looks like the game will largely take place within the confines of the city, and you'll find Wild Zones inside Lumiose where Pokemon live. That's where you'll be doing the majority of your catching and battling, too.</p>

<p>During the trailer, The Pokemon Company introduced some of the fun characters you'll meet in&nbsp;<em>Legends: Z-A</em>, including two new friendly rivals, Urbain or Taunie, one of whom you'll meet (seemingly based on the gender you pick).</p>

<p>We also got a new look at combat in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and it comes with a brand new feature in the form of areas of effect for moves; Rollout, for instance, hits in a straight line, while Rock Slide hits across a wide area. You'll have to dodge alongside your Pokemon to keep up.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>launches in late 2025 for Switch, but we didn't get a specific release date, nor did we learn whether the game will be coming to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Ho hum.</p>

<hr><p>That's everything revealed during today's Pokemon Presents showcase! Stay tuned for more on all other things&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-related.</p>

It’s Pokémon Day, which commemorates the anniversary of the launch of the original <em>Pokemon Red</em> and <em>Green </em>in Japan in 1996. Each year, The Pokémon Company puts on a livestream to talk about upcoming games, updates on current ones, and other projects within the franchise. Last year’s was a little lowkey because it was the first year in a while that Game Freak didn’t release a new RPG or DLC, but this year, the studio is releasing <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, the second installment in the <em>Legends </em>subseries set in Kalos. That wasn’t the only announcement, although things were still pretty quiet. If you want to watch the full livestream, you can check that out below. If you just want the highlights, read on:</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8847c43705ebfb4c498387d5ccccde5c" data-recommend-id="image://8847c43705ebfb4c498387d5ccccde5c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1991" data-height="1120" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arcanine in Pokemon Concierge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arcanine in Pokemon Concierge." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8847c43705ebfb4c498387d5ccccde5c" data-recommend-id="image://8847c43705ebfb4c498387d5ccccde5c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1991" data-height="1120" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arcanine in Pokemon Concierge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>First up was the announcmenet that the second season of <em>Pokemon Concierge</em>, the excellent stop-motion Netflix series, will premiere in September.

Not much is known about their appearance, but they’re both known for being able to affect dreams and nightmares, so they’re appropriate for a sleep app.</p></div><div><p>Three new Pokemon are coming to the MOBA <em>Pokemon Unite</em>. Suicune, Alolan Raichu, and Alcremie are all joining the roster in March, April, and “soon,” respectively. Also, a new mode called First to 500 is coming, which requires either team to reach 500 points through scoring goals.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-arceus-leak-rank-1851766589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-arceus-leak-rank-1851766589">As previously leaked</a></span>, <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket </em>is getting a new booster set called Triumphant Light. The Arceus-centric set will be added to the app tomorrow, February 28.</p></div><div><p>Outside of the app, we also saw some new Mega Evolution ex cards coming to the standard Trading Card Game. The only two we saw were Mega Lucario and Mega Gardevoir, but more will be added, as well.</p></div><div><p>After some updates on some small events in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, we got into a brand new game called <em>Pokémon Champions</em>. The Switch and mobile game was only shown through a cinematic teaser, but it was described as a core-style battle simulator outside of the typical RPG structure. It’s being developed by Pokémon Works, and will let you connect to <em>Pokémon Home</em> to import your parties from mainline games.</p></div><div><p>Closing out the show was <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. The Switch RPG deviates from <em>Legends: Arceus</em>, in that it takes place in modern day Kalos, rather than a historical setting. Your character will start their journey with either Chikorita, Totodile, or Tepig, while Lumiose City is undergoing an urban redevelopment plan. There will be discreet wild areas where you can capture more Pokémon, but it doesn’t seem like <em>Z-A</em> will include the open zones of <em>Arceus</em>. The game will launch on Switch in late 2025.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Before today, all we knew about the Switch game was what was revealed on Pokémon Day 2024. <em>Legends Z-A</em> is set entirely in the Kalos metropolis of Lumiose City, which debuted in <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y</em> back in 2013. Now, we’ve finally seen the game in motion and, despite sharing the <em>Legends</em> name, it seems like a far cry from <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>’ open-zone structure.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195519,195905" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Unlike the countryside setting of the past game, <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>revolves around Lumiose City which is currently undergoing a major urban renewal program with new construction and skyscrapers going up. More importantly, players will get to choose from Gen 2 and Gen 5 starters Chikorita, Tepig, or Totodile during their adventures. The hybrid turn-based combat also looks a bitt different this time around. The game won’t arrive until late 2025.</p><p>One of the major mechanics in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>is the return of Mega Evolution. These superpowered forms transform regular fully-evolved critters into somewhat overdesigned versions of themselves for a hefty (but temporary) stat boost. It’s unclear if we’ll be getting new Mega Evolutions in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, however.</p><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> is probably one of the last <em>Pokémon </em>RPGs that will be developed for the Switch before the Switch 2 launches later this year. However, it will also be playable on the new device, which will play original Switch games through backward compatibility. So maybe we’ll see it running on the more powerful hardware when Nintendo holds a dedicated Direct presentation <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848">in April</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After being initally leaked, both the new Triumphant Light A2A Set and Ranked Battles have been confirmed to arrive in Pokémon TCG Pocket—and their debut is very soon.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-triumphant-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a> A2A aptly came to light on Febraury 27 when a leak revealed the new set. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 28 Pokémon Presents</a> presentation confirmed that it’s a brand-new mini-set—like Mythical Island—and features an array of news cards and ex beasts.</p>



<p>If this wasn’t enough, the also-leaked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-reportedly-adding-ranked-battles-very-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Battle</a> system is also official. It is expected to be a way for Pocket players to flex their best decks in a competitive environment.</p>



<h2 id="h-triumphant-light-amp-ranked-battles-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Triumphant Light &amp; Ranked Battles Coming to Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New possibilities await. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The February 205 Pokémon Presents showcase unveiled a ton of cool content across the company’s vast selection of mobile and console titles. But <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/?pubDate=20250225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> fans have been hearing murmurs about game-chaning features and content updates for a while now.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-a2a-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Set A2A</a> was leaked a while back, and now we’ve seen it all for ourselves. The debut trailer is the usual eye-candy of shiny new cards and special Pokémon that will be hard to get. There’s likely to be new Events, Drops, and more Solo Battles to contend with too.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Ranked Battles will be added to test decks, skill, and as we all know—a bit of luck here and there too! </p>



<p>The showcase didn’t go too deep into the system’s details, but I’d expect a league-based system based on skill ratings like most Ranked Modes. The more matches you win, the higher you ascend up the ranks, the better your rewards are, and the sterner the opposition.</p>



<p>You can check out the full Triumphant Light trailer for yourself right here.</p>

    <p><span>An extended look at the world and gameplay.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Pokemon Legends: Z-A [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a></em> will launch for <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,708 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> in late 2025, publisher <a title="Companies > The Pokemon Company [405 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/the-pokemon-company">The Pokemon Company</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Game Freak [268 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/game-freak">Game Freak</a> announced. <span id="more-946962"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><em><a title="Series > Pokemon [44 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/pokemon">Pokemon</a> Legends Z-A</em> is a new title in the <em>Pokemon</em> series.</p><p>The story takes place in Lumiose City, the largest city in the Kalos region. Prism Tower stands tall at the center of this city of beautiful vistas. These days, Lumiose is undergoing a high-tech urban redevelopment plan to turn it into a city that people and Pokemon truly share.</p><p>After you arrive in Lumiose City to see the sights, you’ll meet three Pokemon, one of which will become your first partner—Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile. You’ll choose one of these Pokemon to accompany you on a new journey as you get to know Lumiose City and its inhabitants.</p><p>When you arrive in Lumiose, you’ll meet a new friend and ally—either Urbane or Tawny. The hotel where you’ll be staying is run by AZ. You’ll also meet his partner, Floette. Lumiose’s redevelopment is being managed by Quizartico Inc. You’ll become acquainted with the company’s CEO Jet and her secretary, Vinny. The different people you meet will make your time in Lumiose all the richer.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>To help people and Pokemon coexist, the city has set up Wild Zones. These areas, located throughout Lumiose, give wild Pokemon habitats where they can thrive. To catch one of these wild Pokemon, aim carefully, then throw a Poke Ball. If you’re having a hard time catching one, have one of your Pokemon use its moves to weaken the target, making it easier to catch.</p><p>This game offers a style of Pokemon battling not seen in previous titles. Moves can have a longer or shorter reach, or different areas of effect, so choose your timing and positioning carefully to gain the upper hand. Lead your partner Pokemon through battles and dodge incoming attacks. Swap Pokemon if you need to and find the right moment to unleash a move.</p><p>What’s more, certain Pokemon can go beyond evolution by undergoing Mega Evolution. When a trainer’s keystone resonates with the Mega Stone held by their Pokemon, the Pokemon will do more than just change shape. It’ll unlock a new level of power, turning the tide of battle in its favor.</p><p>As Lumiose continues its transformation into a city that belongs to both people and Pokemon, who knows what kinds of encounters and experiences will await you.</p></blockquote><p>More information is available via the <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.

                <p dir="ltr">Today is Pokemon Day, the annual celebration of the original Pokemon games--Red and Green--releasing in Japan. With it comes a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6286/" data-ref-id="2900-6286">Pokemon Presents video</a>, and today's ended with a new look at Pokemon Legends: Z-A, along with a release window of "late 2025."</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Z-A will take Trainers on a tour of Lumiose City, the bustling Paris-themed city from Pokemon X and Y's Kalos region, which in this game is undergoing a "high-tech urban redevelopment" by a company called Quasartico for both people and Pokemon to enjoy. The city will feature multiple open areas for exploration, including rooftops--which players can jump off and glide back down to the ground--and Wild Zones where new Pokemon can be battled and caught.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_KNDtKJJ-8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M_KNDtKJJ-8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">We see multiple Pokemon encounters during the trailer, some of which resemble the turn-based battling featured in many previous games, as well as the "throw a Poke Ball without battling" mechanic seen in Legends: Arceus. Along with those came a new type of battling system where distance and movement play a key role, as attack moves have a certain amount of reach, and moving a Pokemon out of the way will cause the attack to miss.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Legends Z-A will also mark the return of Mega Evolutions--which originated in Pokemon X and Y for the Nintendo DS. Multiple Mega Pokemon are shown in the trailer, including Mega Lucario, Mega Ampharos, and Mega Kangaskhan.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer also introduced many of the characters inhabiting this version of Lumiose City, which include both new and returning faces. We see the player character's friends Urbain and Taunie, Quasartico CEO Jett and her bodyguard Vinnie, and the return of AZ--the mysterious former king of Kalos--as the owner of the hotel the player-characters stays in during the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Legends Z-A is the second installment of the Pokemon Legends franchise, as it follows 2022's Pokemon Legends: Arceus. It is scheduled to release in late 2025.</p>

                <p>EA Sports College Football 25 was a huge success for the company, and the franchise is coming back this year with potentially even more features that the studio didn't get into 2024's game.</p><p>EA Sports executive Daryl Holt told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6161718/2025/02/27/ea-sports-college-football-26-video-game-sales/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a> that the team knew it was never going to be able to get everything it wanted to in 2024's game. "So there's a lot of meat left on the bone," he said.</p><p>Holt declined to get into specifics regarding new features for CFB 26, but teased, "We've got a lot of things still to come."</p><p>He added: "We release a game, we understand what's important to players and what they play and what they would like changed, improved or added. This is a game for fans built by college fans ourselves, and we want it to be that type of relationship to understand what's important to them."</p><p>For CFB 25, many people mentioned how the single-player career mode, Road to Glory, felt underwhelming, so that's one area that fans will hope to see expanded upon in 2025's game.</p><p>CFB 25 came to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but not PC. Sources told The Athletic that CFB 25 skipped PC due in part to how the game's primary audience is in North America, whereas launching on PC is more important for global releases. Holt said EA "started" with Xbox and PlayStation, but said, "We'll look at other opportunities, other platforms" for future releases.</p><p>EA never disclosed a sales number for CFB 25, but it was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 2 overall best-selling game of 2024 in the US</a>, only eclipsed by Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Holt said the game "outperformed all our expectations" and became "part of the cultural landscape of college football."</p><p>Another change for CFB 26 could be how much the student-athletes are paid to be part of it. The original deal for CFB 25 was a payment of $600 and a free copy of the game to more than 11,000 players, amounting to a total cost of more than $6 million for EA. Some players got more money for promoting the game. For CFB 26, a Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) company called Pathway Sports &amp; Entertainment is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-college-football-26-could-offer-bigger-payouts-to-players/1100-6529500/" data-ref-id="1100-6529500">attempting to sign players with $1,500 up front with the potential for a revenue-sharing deal as well</a> based on copies sold. EA has not commented on Pathway's proposed plans.</p>

Specifically, it looks like more content is coming to the game for players who beat the story and want more of a challenge.</p><p>Title Update 1 will come out in early April, placing its launch over a month after the base game's release. That might seem like a big gap between launch and the first update, but the official Monster Hunter X account explains that Capcom wanted to "give hunters enough time to prepare for the new content, and challenges, that await them!"

Today brought our first look at gameplay footage from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, courtesy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-pokemon-presents-broadcast-here">the Pokémon Presents presentation</a> - as well as a narrowed release window for the Switch 1 game.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Legends Z-A will arrive in "late 2025", it was revealed - a little later than some were expecting. No mention at all was made of Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Pokémon Legends Z-A is scheduled to release in late 2025," said Takato Utsunomiya, chief operating officer of The Pokémon Company. "We hope everybody can wait just a little longer for their adventures in Lumiose City to begin."

<p>As we knew already, Pokémon Legends Z-A was shown to be an action RPG spin-off from the series' main games set in a redesigned version of Lumiose City, the Kalos region's Parisian-inspired metropolis. The action looks set to take place entirely within the city limits, though there are rooftops to explore and suburban wild areas with roaming Pokémon.</p>
<p>These areas, gated by green neon fences, contain various familiar creatures inside. Today's trailer showed off Buneary, Spewpa, Fletchling, Sandile and more. Numerous other species can be seen alongside humans in the game's other areas - this surburban setting filled with Pokémon reminiscent of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detective-pikachu">Detective Pikachu</a> games.</p>
<p>Today's trailer was devoid of any new Pokémon species or Mega Evolutions, though it did at least confirm the three Starter Pokémon you'll use in the game: Gold and Silver's Grass-type Chikorita and Water-type croc Totodile, plus Black and White's fire hog Tepig. 
</p>
<p>Presumably the evolved versions of all three will get to Mega Evolve - though we didn't see that today. This new footage did at least confirm what was hinted at last year, which was that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-goes-futuristic-in-2025">the Kalos region's Mega Evolution mechanic is back in Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> and will work in the same way - with select Pokémon capable of Mega Evolution requiring a Mega Stone.</p>
<p>Also on show was a new battle system, where it looks like you can lead your monster around the battlefield, and where attacks will differ in power based on their range.</p>
<p>More to follow.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This month, NVIDIA also added a few extra games to the library compared to the original plans for February, including the Batman: Arkham games (the first step for <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-add-wb-games-titles-starting-with-batman-arkham-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warner Bros.

<p>On another note, NVIDIA <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1iz2xas/membership_updates_free_1month_and_6month_options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> an update on its transition to an internal payment processing system. According to a representative, starting today, new members are once again going to be able to sign up for GeForce NOW, whether they are planning on a free, 1-month or 6-month membership. These memberships will be available in the US, Canada, and Europe. New members can sign up using a credit card, PayPal, Google Pay, or Apple Pay. However, there's no update yet on existing GeForce NOW members being able to make changes to their current membership. As a reminder, in the meantime, they can enjoy free gaming without billing.</p>

There are three main components to building Ludoscene. The first is human curators like <em>My Perfect Console</em> podcast host Simon Parkin and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/videoverse-game-review-online-gaming-forums-vn-kinmoku-1850780173&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/videoverse-game-review-online-gaming-forums-vn-kinmoku-1850780173"><em>Videoverse</em></a></span> designer Lucy Bundell. The second is a database of great games with over 3,000 entries categorized based on the team’s input. And finally there’s the creative interface: a <em>Balatro</em>-like deck of cards you slowly build up by swiping based on what you like and don’t like. </p><p>It reminds me of a scene from <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em>, the cult AMC drama about the rise of computers, in which Lee Pace is filling up a whiteboard with colorful post-it notes in an attempt to fully map out the nascent world wide web in the early ‘90s. Before Google used algorithms to sort everything and eventually ended up breaking the internet in the process, life online was catalogued and curated by regular people just looking to connect over shared passions and hobbies. It’s inefficient and clumsy but also more intimate and meaningful. </p><p>I have no idea if Ludoscene could be that for game recommendations but it could certainly be the start of trying to move game discovery and recommendations back toward something more personal and authentic. And unlike mapping the entire internet, you only need a dozen really good game recommendations to keep you busy for a long time. The dating-app-like aspect of just getting presented with one choice at a time rather than being bombarded with 100 critically acclaimed games from the last five years is also very appealing. </p><p>The plans for Ludoscene also sound quite robust. It’s not just giving you names of games to go look up later. You can flip each game’s card over and see quick snippets of actual gameplay taken from trailers, what platforms the game is on, its price, and links to immediately go buy and download it on the platform of your choice. It’ll also tell you if the game is available on one of the subscription services like Game Pass or PS Plus so you know before spending the money.</p><p>“There’s quite a lot of nice,  ongoing curation so it really is about creating a relationship person to person, both in terms of game suggestions and the experts, which is quite a different approach to just purely algorithms, or  just using tags to try to float stuff up to the top, which works for some games, but not for others,” Robertson said. “It’s really about that human connection.” The team is looking at recruiting more than the few dozen experts it’s currently working with and hopes that personal touch will be a big part of Ludoscene’s draw.</p><p>Another thing the project has going for it is just how terrible the existing storefronts are at showing players games they might like. Despite years of information on what I own and play, the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, and Switch eShop are effectively useless when it comes to browsing for anything outside of broad genres and the games that are already popular in them. Steam is much better relatively speaking, but still not great in the broader scheme of things.  Ludoscene sounds like a good antidote to those shortcomings. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pokémon has announced Pokémon Champions, a new title developed for mobile and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>The announcement was made during the Pokémon Presents showcase, where it was said that the title will be focused on Pokémon battles that “you know and love from core Pokémon games.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Pokémon Champions will be a multiplayer game where players can matchmake with others around the world.</p>



<p>GAME FREAK is said to be carrying out the planning for the project, while development will be handled by The Pokémon Works.</p>



<p>Players will also be able to connect with Pokémon HOME, meaning you’ll be able to use Pokémon from previous Pokémon games in Pokémon Champions.</p>



<p>No release date was announced for Pokémon Champions, but base on the announcement, it seems like it could be a ways away from release.</p>

The studio behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Job Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vacation Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—two games that helped introduce players to virtual reality—isn't resting easy on its laurels. With its latest omnidimensional diner/garage simulator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://dimensionaldoubleshift.com/">Dimensional Double Shift</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the company is once again shifting strategy with new ways to make VR games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But this time, its experiments aren't just technical or design-led in nature. In 2024 Owlchemy Labs released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dimensional Double Shift </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">as a free-to-play open beta, a first for the company that packaged its previous games as standalone products. It's also the company's first-ever multiplayer game, joining the ranks of popular titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gorilla Tag</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>VR Chat</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. So while it's a little late to the multiplayer party, Owlchemy Labs "chief executive owl" Andrew Eiche told Game Developer in a chat at DICE 2025 that the game is part of the studio's strategy to keep up with the ever-shifting VR market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's always worth checking in where great studios think the next opportunities are—and in our chat, Eiche was glad to unpack how the studio is keeping up with new trends like social multiplayer while not sacrificing quality along the way.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="VR players want to hang out with their friends">VR players want to hang out with their friends</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gorilla Tag</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has shown us, a growing number of VR users are surprisingly young, and not interested in the same kinds of games that dominated in the early days of the HTC Vive and Oculus Quest (now the Meta Quest). As has been harped on many times in conversations about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and other games popular with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/7oC45CC1s-0">the youths</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the next generation of players is way more interested in "social experiences" than their predecessors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that's a clinical (and maybe creepy) way of saying it. Eiche says when Owlchemy's been speaking with players, they hear it put more plainly and simply. "They're not even going 'can you add multiplayer?' It's more like, 'why can't I play with my friends?'"</span></p><p>Image via Owlchemy Labs/Google.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Owlchemy Labs/Google.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The subtle difference is that the first question is a request for a new feature, and the latter is an understanding that "playing with my friends" is a default expectation. So when Owlchemy started work on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dimensional Double Shift</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, getting players in groups with their friends was the number one goal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a goal that became more challenging when picturing the economics of VR. Owlchemy's previous premium games only cost $20, but if four players want to run their multidimensional diner/garage, the game would max out at around $80. "Consumers care about where their dollars go," he said. "So for us it was a product of necessity to be like, 'if we want to make a multiplayer game, we need people to not feel the friction of playing.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, Owlchemy had observed that the Meta Quest Store—currently the de facto leader in the VR landscape—was shifting to a more "App Store" style algorithmic system that surfaced more free-to-play games with in-app purchases. Owlchemy has no experience with free-to-play, so committing to a long dev cycle with no firm understanding of monetization was going to be difficult. Hence, the decision to launch in open beta.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our job is to make sure it doesn't shift to the dark part of [monetization]," he said, nodding to how some games rely on player compulsion to drive spending and keep them hooked (a topic </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/greenheart-necromancer-reinvents-the-idle-game-shows-how-to-rethink-predatory-mechanics">many developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are examining lately).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The open beta launch has done more for Owlchemy than just help them crack monetization, it's helped them learn where they should be putting focus on their game development. As they suspected, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dimensional Double Shift</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> players do indeed prefer casual sci-fi diner/garage shenanigans over stiff competition (sometimes making their own ad hoc minigames). They also enjoy having game modes (referred to as "shifts") that do offer some competition, but it's not the center of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What did surprise them? When they launched, they didn't expect players would want to play with anyone other than people they already knew. But they quickly got feedback that players did in fact want matchmaking options. They wanted to meet people and experience omnidimensional life with new pals.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="VR multiplayer turns game development on its head">VR multiplayer turns game development on its head</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers aren't likely to be surprised that switching from single-player to multiplayer development introduces a whole host of challenges. Eiche said that Owlchemy had to make major changes to its usual formula and "rip out" all of their previous tech solutions and build it all for multiplayer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The biggest breakthrough, he said, was in the world of player proximity. The "secret" to VR multiplayer up to this point is that player "spheres"—the area around their avatars—are never supposed to touch. If they do, it can be violently disorienting or (or at worst, grounds for harassment. Eiche said that Owlchemy spent 3 years aggressively tackling that problem. In a game about working shoulder-to-shoulder in a diner/garage, it definitely helps to not have to give players wide spaces to avoid each other's bubbles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other pain points, he said, include fluid physics and hand-tracking data. Continued improvements to hand-tracking capabilities allow players to be more communicative when in VR—but they also add millions of data points that have to be networked across up to 4 machines.</span></p><p>Image via Owlchemy Labs/Google.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Owlchemy Labs/Google.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fluid physics, he said, almost didn't make it into the game. The team came to grips early on with the fact they didn't think they could implement the feature, despite it being a popular part of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cosmonious High</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Job Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vacation Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But he said in Owlchemy's history, "we can't do that" often turns into more of a dare than a barrier.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We confidently say we can't do something like 'we can't make sandwiches and pick them up.

            <p>
Obsidian role-playing game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> now has an official mushroom kit, which you can use to grow a crop of colourful fungus at home similar to the infestation that covers your hero's face.
</p>
<p>
Not convinced? How about if we told you this creeping mass of plague-like fungi was designed to be enjoyed as a snack? Just peel the mushrooms from the Avowed-branded box, and pop one in your mouth. Delicious.
</p>
<p>
This official kit comes from mushroom mail order service North Spore, which sadly does not seem to ship to the UK. Maybe that's for the best.

US residents keen to grown their own plague (actually, perfectly edible oyster mushrooms of various colours) can order an Avowed kit online for <a href="https://northspore.com/products/organic-spray-grow-avowed-grow-kit">$30 plus shipping</a>. Each kit comes with a random colour selection included, which only reveals itself when the spores bloom.

Optionally, you can also download 3D printing details for a bear ornament to grow your mushrooms on, similar to the infected hulking enemies found within the game. Yummy.

<p>
Avowed looks to have done well enough for Obsidian, which has now hinted at more to come from its plague-ridden role-playing game. The game's director, Carrie Patel, was recently asked whether her next project would be something new - but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-director-hints-at-a-future-for-the-franchise">said it was likely she'd be back for more Avowed</a> - be that more content for the first game, or sequels.
</p>
<p>
"What Avowed lacks in gloss it makes up for with charm, depth and a playful heart," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a>. "It's one of this year's most pleasant surprises."

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-program-march-3rd-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/special-suikoden-program-set-to-air-next-week-konami-announces.1120335/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-program-march-3rd-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that a special&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>broadcast is set to air next week, bringing more news about the cult JRPG franchise.</p>

<p>In a rather brief <a href="https://x.com/Konami/status/1894938037122957766" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Konami says that the broadcast, which will air on March 3rd at 3pm Pacific (that's 6pm Eastern), will bring you "all the latest news on&nbsp;<em>Suikoden</em>".</p>

<p>That's a particularly interesting way of wording it, because we already know the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Suikoden II&nbsp;</em>remasters, so presumably, the broadcast will contain some new information about the future of the series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suikoden-special-program-remaster.jpg?itok=pZdUOGOa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suikoden-special-program-remaster.jpg?itok=q7rTwVNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>news could be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>If Konami does have more to reveal about the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>franchise, I'd put my money on potential remasters for the third, fourth, and fifth games in the series.&nbsp;<em>Suikoden V</em>, in particular, is well-liked by many fans, although the other two were perhaps a little more cautiously received.</p>

<p>I think more remasters are significantly more likely than a brand new game in the franchise, although Konami must be pretty confident in&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>if it's doing more than just the upcoming remasters of the first two games.</p>

<p>News of the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>broadcast comes as Konami revisits some of its biggest franchises in the form of remasters and remakes. Last year, for instance, the company worked with Bloober Team for the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">amassed more than two million sales</a> around the world so far.</p>

<p>The studio is also gearing up for the release of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, a remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">in August</a>. The game will feature a visual overhaul thanks to the magic of Unreal Engine 5, as well as updated gameplay mechanics.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>itself, the snappily-titled&nbsp;<em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars&nbsp;</em>collection is due to launch next week.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the collection remasters the first two games in the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>series, which are connected by a number of recurring characters and narrative elements. The remasters will feature updated visuals, new animations, and extra quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>remasters when they land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1932640/Suikoden_III_HD_Remaster_Gate_Rune_and_Dunan_Unification_Wars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10004292" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/suikoden-iii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-pre-order-bonus/9P9FM62WZXR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on March 6th.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>broadcast, meanwhile, is set for March 3rd, and you can watch it via Konami's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KONAMI573ch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. The link in Konami's post on X leads to the Japanese channel, but the post itself is in English, so it's not clear whether the show will air in English or just in Japanese.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-financials-2024-revenue-falls<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. has released its financial summary for both the fourth quarter of 2024 and the year as a whole, and it probably won't surprise you to learn that it's been a pretty bad year for the media giant's gaming wing.</p>

<p>In its earnings <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_earnings/2024/q4/earnings-result/WBD-4Q24-Earnings-Release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release</a>, Warner Bros. says its gaming division's revenue dropped by 29% in Q4 when compared to the previous year's quarter, which the studio puts down to the "better performance" of big sellers&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">Hogwarts Legacy</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-sales" rel="nofollow">Mortal Kombat 1</a>&nbsp;</em>last year.</p>

<p>This is likely at least one of the figures that caused Warner Bros. to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">close three of its studios recently</a>, namely Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego. They're not mentioned in the financial report, but that could just be because the report covers the period ending December 31st last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-monolith.jpg?itok=b5odTwrZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-monolith.jpg?itok=rIJTz3Ba 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros. recently closed&nbsp;<em>Middle-earth: Shadow of War&nbsp;</em>developer Monolith, as well as two other studios.</figcaption></figure><p>The weak performance of two major Warner Bros. games last year, namely superhero live-service looter-shooter&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>&nbsp;</em>and crossover fighter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow"><em>MultiVersus</em></a>, both contributed to WB Games' weak year.</p>

<p>Both games performed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">so poorly</a> that they were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-offline" rel="nofollow">shut down</a> before being on general release for a year (although&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>technically spent some time in a sort of beta-Early Access limbo between mid-2022 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-open-beta-will-close-in-june-full-release-coming-in-early-2024" rel="nofollow">spring 2023</a>).</p>

<p>Back in January, it was revealed that Warner Bros. gaming head David Haddad <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow">would step down</a> after over a decade with the company. The reason for his departure wasn't officially announced, but I can't imagine&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>' failures had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>As for what the future holds for Warner Bros., the company says it's planning to refocus on "proven IP" like&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em>,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>, and the wider DC universe, including "top tier characters like&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-batman.jpg?itok=64LAPPnr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-batman.jpg?itok=wkA8H8fr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros. says it wants to refocus its efforts on proven IP like&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>To that end, it was recently revealed that DC Studios boss James Gunn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dc-boss-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-to-develop-dc-universe-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has been talking</a> to Warner Bros. studios Rocksteady and NetherRealm to develop DC games, although it's not clear which games those might be.</p>

<p>Given that the closure of Monolith also includes the cancellation of that studio's&nbsp;<em>Wonder Woman&nbsp;</em>game, though, I wouldn't hold your breath for anything but a new game starring Batman or one of his extended family. Stay tuned for more.</p>
