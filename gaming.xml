<figure data-uuid="74e94187e2855"><a title="Mega Garchomp Z Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/74e94187e2855/mega-garchomp-z-pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Looking for a new Mega Evolution to add to your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> team? Well, there's a brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-mystery-gift-codes-list">Mystery Gift Event</a> for you, then.</p>
<p>From today, players can get Mega Garchomp Z, a brand new Mega Evolution for a Gen 4 favourite Garchomp. However, this is exclusive for those who own the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, they already <em>have</em> a Mega Evolution, but what's a second one, hey? The difference with this variant is that it's fully ditching its dual Dragon/Ground-typing and going full Dragon-type. It's now even faster and constantly hovering, making it more-deadly than ever.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7pnltqh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>To claim your Garchompite Z, you'll need to claim a new Mystery Gift, which will then unlock a special hyperspace dimension where you'll need to defeat this fearsome creature to get that precious Mega Evolution stone. It could be tricky, so bring your best team and donuts!</p>
<p>If you claim the Mystery Gift without the DLC, you'll get the following message (and can't do anything with it):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Meet the conditions to find a pocket of hyperspace where you can obtain a Garchompite Z stone"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the latest post-launch Mega Evolution to be added to Z-A via a Mystery Gift following Mega Mewtwo Z and Mega Diancie, who are available to everyone, regardless of having the DLC.</p>
<p>And, if you haven't grabbed Mega Dimension yet, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">we think it's okay</a>, but incredibly grindy and repetitive. So keep that in mind.</p>

<p>On March 12th, to be exact. Bring along some voxel mates, and as devs Liquid Swords have announced, you'll be able to play the campaign in co-op, hop into sandbox for some hijinks, or try some new multiplayer game modes. Catching my eye is the fact that the studio say they've also got a "multiplayer racing experience" planned to arrive later this year.</p>
<p>Honestly, it's been a little while since I played Teardown. I've really enjoyed what I've played of it, with the destruction-heavy take on a Minecrafty level of freedom to shape the environment, but I did find it ran out of steam a bit once I'd breezed through a few weeks of solo booming with the aid of various mods.</p><p>Graham (RPS in peace), brought in a communal element to his booming simply by reaching out to mates during his time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/teardown-review-a-glorious-crime-caper-about-smashing-open-buildings-like-chocolate-eggs">booming for review</a>. "Much like in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/opus-magnum">Opus Magnum</a>, I've been recording my efforts and victories and sharing them with friends who are doing the same, just for the fun of comparing the radically different ways we solved the same problems. Our solutions are impressive and entertaining to watch, at least to us, even as they pale in comparison to what others are doing. My hope is that the game will develop a long-lasting and fabulous speedrunning community."</p>
<p>So, maybe upon dipping back in with this update, I'll find that multiplayer hijinks have been the thing missing in turning me from an occasional boomer of houses that burst into then thousand little pieces and driver of blocky cars into other blocky cars into someone who does those things for thousands of hours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After quite a few leaks, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398"><i><span>Pokémon Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i></a> <span>have finally been officially unveiled today as part of the series’ 30th anniversary. In </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-winds-waves-trailer-breakdown-presents-pikachu-2000674465"><span>the first trailer</span></a><span>, we saw </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-winds-waves-gen-10-starters-pikachu-vacation-reactions-2000674403"><span>the games’ starter trio</span></a><span>, but otherwise we only saw old monsters that debuted in previous games. However, fans think the few minutes of footage we got may offer a hint about one of the Legendary Pokémon we’ll meet when the games launch next year.</span></p> <p><span>In two sections of the trailer, you can see a cloud formation that looks kind of like a dragon. The first time is in the opening cinematic when a trainer is looking through their drawings of Pikachu in various regions. The final image in this section is one of Pikachu looking out a window into </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>’ ocean region, and you can see the dragon-shaped cloud in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh hey it appears in the art at the start too <a href="https://t.co/RXHtwi1iOY">pic.twitter.com/RXHtwi1iOY</a></p> <p>— Puppi 🏳️‍⚧️ (@PuppiPoppi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PuppiPoppi/status/2027403817147412543?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Later, in one of the environmental shots, you can see the dragon-shaped cloud prominently in the sky in-game. Given the games’ titles, I wouldn’t be surprised if </span><i><span>Winds</span></i><span>’ mascot legendary was a flying-type Dragon Pokémon and </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>got some kind of sea creature. Some are speculating this is a Gyarados’ silhouette, and while the one in the initial sketch from the beginning of the trailer definitely resembles the Water/Flying monster from Kanto, the one we see in the actual game itself doesn’t look like it much at all. Could this be a nod to a Pokémon we haven’t met yet?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>However, there might be a different explanation based on </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>’ leaks. Though it hasn’t been officially revealed, the games’ equivalent of raid battles will reportedly be signified in the open world by Pokémon-shaped clouds. So it’s possible this might actually be a Gyarados rather than a new monster, but this also doesn’t preclude it from being a different monster entirely.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Based on the Teraleak, the Pokémon shaped clouds are just the new equivalent raid mechanic. <a href="https://t.co/xG0gUHfu0H">pic.twitter.com/xG0gUHfu0H</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2027400325032779788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>are coming to Switch 2 next year, making them the first exclusive </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPGs on the system. I would’ve expected the original Switch to get at least one more </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPG given how many Switches have been sold in the past nine years, but if you’re looking for a system seller, the new </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games will do it.</span></p>

<p>Pokémon Day 2026 was full of big announcements, with the most significant being the reveal of the 10th generation, Pokémon Winds and Waves.</p>



<p>As part of the 30th anniversary celebrations, marking three decades since the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Red and Green in Japan, a major showcase on Pokémon Day detailed a wide array of what fans can look forward to.</p>



<p>The first Pokémon Winds and Waves trailer was packed with information, and Insider Gaming has highlighted the main things we learned.</p>







<h2 id="h-7-things-we-learned-from-pokemon-winds-amp-waves-first-trailer">7 Things We Learned From Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves First Trailer</h2>



<h3 id="h-new-starter-pokemon">New Starter Pokémon</h3>



<figure><figcaption>New faces. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the biggest standouts from the Pokémon Winds and Waves first trailer was the reveal of three starter Pokémon that players will choose from at the beginning of their journey.</p>



<p>Pokémon does not always reveal the starters immediately when dropping the first tease for a new generation, and doing so this early is eye-catching. However, the trio are already starting to make an impression on fans.</p>



<p>Browt, Pombon, and Gecqua are the three Pokémon available at the start of the journey in Winds and Waves, and while they’re already fully revealed, there’s still plenty of mystery.</p>



<h3 id="h-costumed-pikachu">Costumed Pikachu</h3>



<p>The Pokémon Wind and Waves trailer began by showcasing artwork from the various locations seen in previous games, before a knock on the door from two costumed Pikachu. </p>



<p>It turns out that they weren’t just there for the holiday vibes, as the two costumed Pikachu will appear in Gen 10. The exact version of the costumed Pikachu depends on which game you purchase.</p>



<p>No details have been shared on further details on the costumed Pikachu and how they fit into the game, but more is sure to be revealed soon.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<h3 id="h-returning-pokemon">Returning Pokémon</h3>



<p>While Pokémon Wind and Waves will be headlined by a new generation of Pokémon, adding to the already-bloated list of 1025 to find and collect, there will also be returning Pokémon. During the trailer, plenty were shown.</p>



<p>The likes of Wailord, Tangela, Wingull, Sandygast, Tympole, and Duskull were among those seen, which confirms their evolution lines will also feature, meaning there will be a host of familiar faces to encounter on your journey.</p>



<p>More Pokémon<strong> </strong>returns are certain to be shown in the future, and we could also see the debut of new regional forms.</p>



<h3 id="h-island-landscapes">Island Landscapes</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sea and Sky. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pokémon Winds and Waves will be an island-sprawling adventure, similar to what fans experience in Sun and Moon on the Nintendo 3DS, but with the added gem of being an open-world title.</p>



<p>Pokémon has moved away from the traditional linear structure in recent years, debuting a semi-open-world in Pokémon Legends: Arceus before a fully-fledged open-world adventure in Scarlet and Violet, and Winds and Waves will take this up a notch.</p>



<p>Further details on the environment will be revealed in the future, but there are already some stand-out landscapes.</p>



<h3 id="h-underwater-exploration">Underwater Exploration</h3>



<p>Pokémon Winds and Waves, as the name suggests, has big ties to the ocean, so bringing underwater exploration back for the 10th generation of the franchise was a natural step.</p>



<p>Although not explicitly stated to be the case, underwater exploration in Winds and Waves was leaked previously, and a tease toward the end of the trailer heavily suggested it will feature.</p>



<p>The footage showed the camera diving beneath the surface of the waves, with a variety of Pokémon swimming along and walking along the sandy floor.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2026-everything-announced/" id="180847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everything Announced In Pokémon<strong> </strong>Day 2026 Presents</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-switch-2-exclusive">Switch 2 Exclusive</h3>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the trailer confirmed that Pokémon Winds and Waves will be a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, with no mention of the original Switch console.</p>



<p>This was to be expected, considering Pokémon Pokopia is a Switch 2 exclusive, albeit also playable on the original Switch with gameshare, but similar features are unlikely to be present for Winds and Waves.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of time to secure a Switch 2 before Pokémon<strong> </strong>Winds and Waves releases, however.</p>



<h3 id="h-2027-release-window">2027 Release Window</h3>



<p>While there was a lot of expectation that Pokémon Winds and Waves would be released this year, that is not the case, and a tentative 2027 release window has been set.</p>



<p>That would make it a five-year gap between the release of Gen 9, Scarlet and Violet, to Gen 10, the biggest gap between two generations of the Pokémon franchise. However, considering the performance problems Gen 9 had at launch, there’s unlikely to be many complaints.</p>



<p>A more precise release window will be announced in time, and it does leave the door open for Pokémon to drop something else in Fall 2026.</p>

		<p>We have our first picture of Kratos and Atreus in Ronald D. Moore’s TV series of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war/">God of War,</a> which is coming to Amazon Prime.&nbsp; I don’t think anyone can complain, although Kratos looks more like the Greek era version of the character rather than the more elderly Norse version, and Atreus is perhaps slightly younger than expected.</p>



<p>Kratos is being played by Ryan Hurst, he has previously voiced Thor in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/">God of War Ragnarok</a>, while Atreus is played by Callum Vinson. Callum has appeared in The Night Agent and has also been cast as a young Jason Voorhees in the upcoming Friday the 13th prequel series.</p>
<p>The show has had two seasons ordered before the first scene has been filmed, with pre-production currently underway. The series will be skipping the Greek video game trilogy and beginning in Norse mythology.</p>
<p>Amazon’s TV adaption of Sony’s God of War games landed an Emmy award-winning director for the first two episodes. Frederick E.O. Toye has signed up and should be familiar with historical violence, having directed Shogun for Disney, and also The Boys for Amazon.</p>

<p>He joins Ronald D. Moore, creator of the highly acclaimed Battlestar Galactica remake, who will be the showrunner. The series was announced in 2022 with Rafe Judkins as the showrunner, but he left the project in 2024 due to creative differences.</p>
<p><em>“’God of War’&nbsp;is a compelling, character-driven franchise that we believe will captivate our global customers as much with its expansive and immersive worlds as its rich storytelling,”</em> Vernon Sanders, head of global television at Amazon Studios, said. <em>“We are honored to share in the adventure of exploring the&nbsp;God of War&nbsp;mythology in such a momentous way with Sony Pictures Television, PlayStation Productions, and Santa Monica Studio.”</em></p>

<p>Coming later</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a> is out now on the Switch eShop, and for those of you worried about whether you'll be able to transfer your team to other games, fear not, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon HOME</a> support has been confirmed.</p>
<p>Compatibility with the storage app will be arriving at a later date, But transferring your 'mons will be a one-way deal, with anything you trade from FireRed / LeafGreen won't be able to come back.</p>
<p>Thankfully, transferring to Home will allow you to send the 'mons to other Switch and Switch 2 games such <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legends: Z-A</a> (coming soon) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_champions">Champions</a> (though the latter is just a "link").</p>
<p>The details are all laid out in the visual below:</p>
<figure data-uuid="4e6ff679596e8"><a title="Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen with HOME" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e6ff679596e8/pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-with-home.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We all thought Home would be coming to FireRed &amp; LeafGreen initially, as the details were initially included on the eShop pages for all versions of the game last Friday. But shortly after the games were announced, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">the description was changed to removed mention of Home</a>.</p>
<p>Well, this cleared things up a bit, didn't it?</p>

<p><em>Are you picking up FireRed or LeafGreen today? Happy to hear that Home compatibility is coming? Let us know in the comments!</em></p>

<p>In that time, it's evolved from a mere Game Boy monster-catching RPG into the world's biggest media franchise, with generations of gamers catching 'em all over three whole decades. To celebrate, we asked Nintendo Life readers to send in their most treasured Pocket Monster memories, and today we're going to highlight a nice, round 30 of them.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fqnsogi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<p>These memories come in all shapes and sizes, running the emotional gamut, which feels appropriate for a series that's been with us for the ups, downs, and everything else that life throws at you. So many of us have had a Pokémon by our side (or in our pocket) at important life moments since 1996, it's lovely reading these letters and seeing the breadth and depth of interactions this fandom inspires.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who wrote in - we've split the selections across three pages, with a bonus section at the end. Some have been lightly edited, some are just a line or two, while others smash through the word limit (but let's not be sticklers!) to tell longer tales. Save data snafus, surprising Shinys, Master Ball blunders, Mew, and maybe a tear or two - we've got them all and more below.</p>
<p>So let's look at just a handful of the Pokémon memories you hold near and dear...</p>
<h2>Pokémon at 30 - Three Decades of Pokémemories</h2>
<figure data-uuid="26e3e70767140"><a title="Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/26e3e70767140/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h3>"the elusive 1/4092 chance"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever since falling in love with the Pokémon franchise in grade school, one of the number one things I'd always wanted to call my own was my own shiny Pokémon— nothing traded to me, nothing guaranteed like Generation 2's red Gyarados— one that I found and caught by my own hand.</p>
<p>Pokémon X was the first game in the franchise where I really made a point to start looking for one. Because I wanted the success of just finding one to feel as worth it as possible, I employed no strategies and just walked around absolutely everywhere. I recall spending hours in bed roaming around in a random route of my choice with nothing (Save for a team-wide level up or ten) to show for it.</p>
<p>One day, I took my 3DS with me to a friend's birthday party. There were like four or five of us in a big SUV, and I was just kind of whittling away time by wandering around in-game. When all of a sudden, I rolled the elusive 1/4092 chance and was met with a shiny wild Quagsire! I'm surprised the noise of shock I made didn't make us go off the road, ha ha.</p>
<p>If I recall— and I spent, like, ten minutes in battle perfectly planning everything— I ended up catching it without resorting to a Master Ball. Before then, Quagsire was such a milquetoast 'mon to me, but it has since earned a place if respect in my heart for being my first shiny, one I wasn't actively looking for.<br>

<h3>"a tiny mention"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>My parents come from a small country called Guyana, and as a kid I was a little embarrassed about it because no one seemed to know it was a real country. One day I was exploring the Pokémon Mansion and I discovered a journal that said the legendary Pokémon *Mew* was first found in Guyana! It was such a tiny mention but it left such an impact as a kid. It felt like I had something in common with one of the coolest Pokémon in the series.<br>

<h3>"my still spouse"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>My introduction, which I'm guessing was 1997, was when we were visiting my mom's friend, who has just come back from Japan. Her kids were watching Pocket Monsters, and we, my sibling and I, didn't understand any of it, but we were fascinated by it.</p>
<p>We then caught the series pilot on syndicated TV, back in September of 1998. I was so glad when that version of St. Anne was found back in 2016. Rewatched it for nostalgia after it was found.</p>
<p>My dad was a volunteer for our local terrestrial TV carrier, itself a volunteer organization. Our rampant viewing certainly helped him troubleshoot issues with our local Fox repeater signal lmao</p>
<p>We got the games not too long after, from our Toys R Us. I also met one of my best friends in Middle School, who had also come back from Japan, and had a copy of Pocket Monsters Green. That was neat to see in the late 90's!</p>
<p>We also used to visit a site called Pojo waaay back around 1999 and 2000? Went looking, pleasantly surprised to see it's still around in some form or another. We also had the magazine, which ran for a year or so. I'd love to have copies of the included posters, I had quite a few on my bedroom wall.</p>
<p>I also remember the Pokégods, the Mew Truck, and other rumors, back when they were earnest playground rumors. When TRs Rockin posted how to do the RB Mew trick, the legit one involving glitching how battles load, that was a very special day indeed.</p>
<p>Heck, these rumors persisted through meeting my still spouse. We met in High School a couple decades ago, and I remember him asking me, who had a Gameshark, if you could really find Togepi by heading south of Cinnabar Island. The answer was no, but it certainly gave us plenty to talk about. He's still big into Smogon and the Pokémon Meta, and we both love the games to this day. His starter was always Bulbasaur, mine was Squirtle.</p>
<p>This series has shaped my life in so many ways, and I have to say, my life wouldn't be the same without it. I've stepped away from the larger fandom, for the most part, but still enjoy the games.<br>

<h3>"all you can do is move forward"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a weird, minor thing, but something that's always been a defining moment in these games to me is in gen 1 when you have to jump the ridge outside of Mt. Moon to get to Cerulean, keeping you from going back the way you came. Of course it ends up just being an hour or two detour before you can get Cut and go back, but as a kid it always felt like this big significant milestone, like your journey's far enough in where all you can do is move forward.<br>

<h3>"accidentally KO-ing it"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I played Pokémon Blue to death (shout out my mate John who had Red!), and Kangaskhan was the last Pokémon left to capture to complete all 150. It could only be found in the Safari Zone, so you could only use the (rubbish) Safari Ball to capture it - and I just remember soo many times playing through that tortuous Safari Zone, and never coming across it, or it running away (sometimes immediately), or accidentally KO-ing it BEFORE it could run away… before I could get it down to that tiny sliver of health needed to get it to stay the ball. When it finally did, it was incredible!<br>

<h3>"my Igglybuff was green"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Pokémon Crystal changed my life as a kid. The day and night cycle, the new Pokémon at night, egg hatching, everything.<br>
I got a shiny from the daycare on my first play-through. I was too young to understand why my Igglybuff was green and had sparkles near its sprite, and back then, I couldn’t find the answer without buying a guide.<br>
I still have that Crystal cartridge 30 years later. I only learned 5 years ago it was shiny. By then my batteries died, but still to this day, its continued to be a fond memory for me.<br>

<h3>"I didn't speak the language"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I was 8 years old in a family travelling on business in Austria. I didn't speak the language, but a local kid saw I had Pokemon and invited me to trade. He gave me a Mew, which I didn't know existed. And I wanted to give him something valuable, so I traded my starter.<br>
<strong>flightsaber</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>"A once-in-a-lifetime trade offer"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I grew up in the '90s, so I was there when the holographic base-set Charizard first hit the scene. My local card shop had one in the display case for $120. To a 10-year-old, that might as well have been behind bulletproof glass. Everyone talked about it. Everyone wanted it. Nobody I knew actually had one. I lived in a condo complex split from another set of apartments by a deep, man-made creek, and there was a girl on the other side who had a crush on me. One day she shouted across that she had the Charizard… and would give it to me if I did one simple thing: kissed her. A once-in-a-lifetime trade offer, negotiated creek-to-creek like we were negotiating across enemy territory.</p>
<p>And I really did think about it. I was 10. That card was the dream. But even then something in me was like… this isn’t the move. (In hindsight, for numerous reasons, including the fact that I’m not into girls, which would’ve been useful context at the time.) So I declined and never saw her again. To this day I have no idea if she actually had the card, if she would’ve honored the deal, or what kind of condition it would’ve been in. I never got the Charizard, but Pokémon very much stuck. My car’s license plate literally reads POKEDEX, which feels like the more rewarding win than gambling it all on a cross-creek kiss and a maybe-real Charizard!<br>

<h3>"a walking Pokédex"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I might be the only person who <strong>first</strong> saw Pokémon in Smash Bros. It was before the anime series or any merch reached my country, and I saw it in "this fighting game with Mario, Link, and Kirby". The whole concept of Pokémon looked super interesting to me, and I loved the designs, so from the day the phenomenon properly reached Hungary, I was a die-hard fan and basically a walking Pokédex.<br>

<h3>"you have no idea how much this meant to me"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I still remember going to my first World Championships in London in 2022. After two pandemic delays, it made it all the more worth it. Got to meet Serebii, see the Arceus Chronicles premiere and be around likeminded people.<br>
I'm on the autism spectrum so it's not easy to talk to people about most things except Pokemon so you have no idea how much this meant to me. I've been to EUIC in London every year since, even appearing on Pokémon's social media accounts dressed as Hop where I pulled a full art Snom and participating in both cosplay showcases.<br>

		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p><strong>PlatinumGames</strong> fans may have a lot to look forward to, if the latest rumour is indeed correct. Spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bayonetta/comments/1rg4sx7/unconfirmed_rumor_new_bayonetta_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a>, but originating from a Chinese games forum, it's been claimed that Platinum has <strong>three titles</strong> in the works. A <strong>new UE5-based Bayonetta game</strong>, a <strong>remake of the first Bayonetta game</strong>, and a remake of <strong>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</strong>.</p>



<p>It's definitely a lot for one rumour, and it's also coming through a translation layer, both of which should be indications that you should, like all rumours, take it with a <strong>grain of salt</strong>. What at least makes this rumour worth pointing out is that this is a source that has accurately reported information about <strong>Ninja Gaiden 4</strong> ahead of its release.</p>



<p>So that lends it a shred of credibility, but it's just a shred all the same. All we're saying is don't get your hopes up too much, and at the same time, PlatinumGames has to be working on something now that Ninja Gaiden 4 is out the door and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-two-masters-dlc-release-date/">first bit of DLC is arriving next week.</a></p>



<p>Basically, the notable points of the rumour begin with there being a new Bayonetta game in the works, that is being made with Unreal Engine 5, which we likely won't see until sometime in <strong>2028</strong>. The source also claims that this game will have a budget that's on-par with <strong>Final Fantasy XVI</strong>. That's what we supposedly have to look forward to in the long term.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we'll be treated to remakes of the first Bayonetta game and Metal Gear Rising; Revengeance, both of which the rumour claims are also being made in UE5. They'll supposedly be announced sometime in 2026, with a release set for <strong>2027.</strong></p>



<p>Again, there are elements to this rumour that can definitely raise a suspicious eyebrow or two. In particular the notion that the new Bayonetta game will get the same scale of funding that a company like <strong>Square Enix</strong> can put behind a major<strong> Final Fantasy</strong> game. </p>



<p>But at the same time, PlatinumGames has to be working on something now that Ninja Gaiden 4 is out the door, and that could very well be a new entry in the Bayonetta series, especially if we go back to the fact that series creator <a href="https://wccftech.com/bayonetta-series-continue-kamiya/"><strong>Hideki Kamiya</strong> shared that the series would likely continue without him at PlatinumGames.</a></p>



<p>And with <strong>Konami</strong> putting in the work to finally make the full <strong>Metal Gear Solid</strong> library playable on modern consoles with the<a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-pc-system-requirements/"> <strong>Metal Gear Solid Collection</strong></a> titles, who's to say that Konami wouldn't continue to exhaust its remake/remastering options for new MGS content by getting PlatinumGames to bring back the most action-packed Metal Gear game? That's probably an easier sell to players than trying to make a new MGS game without <strong>Hideo Kojima</strong>.</p>



<p>Still, take this all with a grain of salt, especially because the more credible bits of news we've heard with regard to what PlatinumGames could actually be working on next are the recent confirmations that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nier-automata-continue-game-breaks-10m-units-sold/"><strong>NieR: Automata</strong> will continue,</a> which came alongside the news that the game had sold over <strong>10 million copies</strong>, and a job posting from <a href="https://wccftech.com/platinumgames-appears-to-be-hiring-for-an-online-action-game-despite-babylons-fall-spectacular-failure/">August 2025</a> that pointed to PlatinumGames hiring for an online action game.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll have some official word on what PlatinumGames is making sooner rather than later. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>This morning, Game Freak </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-30-anniversary-stream-recap-winds-waves-2000674383"><span>officially announced </span><i><span>Pokémon Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i></a><span>, the games that will </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398"><span>kick off the next generation on Switch 2</span></a><span> next year. We saw around three minutes of footage of the game in motion, and though it is brief, there’s a fair bit to glean from what we saw. Let’s break down the first trailer.</span></p>  <h2><b>The opening cinematic pays tribute to 30 years of </b><b><i>Pokémon</i></b></h2> <p><span>Starting off the trailer is a cinematic showing several illustrations of a Pikachu traveling around the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world. Each drawing shows Pikachu in a different region from the first nine generations, from Kanto in </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span> to Paldea in </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>. It’s a cute way to lead into the next generation and also pay homage to the series’ 30th anniversary. As the trainer flips through their scrapbook, we end on an image of Pikachu looking out a window to a beach, which is revealed to be the space we’re in now.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Who are these Pikachu?</b></h2> <p><span>After strolling through memory lane, the trainer opens their house door and is greeted by two Pikachu that are glammed up and also notably darker than the average mouse, so fans are speculating that they’re Shiny. Their names are Mr. Windychu and Ms. Wavychu, but we don’t know much about how they’re involved in the story just yet. Given their names, they might be exclusive to the different versions similar to the professors in </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, but that’s just a theory.</span></p> <h2><b>Well, it certainly looks better than </b><b><i>Scarlet </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>Violet</i></b></h2> <p><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>is the next open-world game in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>series, and for whatever it’s worth, it does look like a significant graphical improvement over </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, which was raked through the coals for looking like a GameCube game. The environments have texture and character to them, which is more than you could say for the bland, flat appearance of the Paldea region. Could this finally be the end of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>graphics debates? Arceus, I hope so.</span></p>

 <h2><b>The new region feels like a bit of a throwback</b></h2> <p><span>While a lot of recent </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games have been defined by city skylines, </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span> seems like it has a much more nature-driven region than the series has routinely sported of late. Yeah, there are some human structures like what appears to be a giant water-based lab, but by and large we don’t see much of human civilization, and it gives it more of that grounded, earthy feel that is much more akin to previous generations. It makes me wonder if it will have the same gyms and Pokémon League structure of previous games, or if we might be spending more time exploring the wild environment instead.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Different outfits for both games</b></h2> <p><span>Like </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span> will change some of the player’s outfit accents depending on which version they’re playing. It’s unclear if this is justified in the story the way it was by having different school uniforms in </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, but the </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>protagonist sports a white and blue rancher hat, while the </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>hero wears a darker blue cap. Hopefully </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>doesn’t pull back on the excellent fashion and customization options from </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> and we still get a plethora of looks and outfits to choose from.</span></p> <h2><b>The Pokédex seems eclectic</b></h2> <p><span>We didn’t see many of the new Pokémon that will debut in </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>, but we did see a lot of the returning ones and it looks like a nice spread from the previous nine generations. So don’t worry too much about it being another Kanto-filled adventure.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Pikachu didn’t get a makeover</b></h2> <p><span>Early leaks for </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span> included what </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-wind-wave-pikachu-leak-generation-10-redesign-2000635674"><span>appeared to be a redesign for Pikachu</span></a><span> that would have further slimmed him down from his original round look. However, based on the footage we’ve seen, it looks like Game Freak didn’t use this updated design, which is fine by me.</span></p> <h2><b>The starters are the star of the show</b></h2> <p><span>The only new Pokémon we saw in this first trailer are the three starters: Browt, Pombon, and Gecqua. The grass-type bird is described as “lively, but it can also be a bit clumsy” and we know it photosynthesizes the leaves on its brow. Pombon is a Pomeranian fire dog that has a “heat-generating organ within its lungs” and is “guileless and friendly.” Lastly, Gecqua rounds out the trio with its water attacks that it springs from its tail, and is “intelligent and maneuvers shrewdly while putting on airs​.”</span></p> <h2><b>There’s a focus on underwater exploration</b></h2> <p><span>Game Freak made a point to focus on underwater exploration, which is one of the new ways you’ll be able to move through the environment in </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>’ open world. It’s unclear how we’ll do that, whether it’s through some kind of vehicle or if Dive is returning from the previous games, but it looks like you’ll be able to encounter wild water Pokémon under the sea, rather than just having to fish for them or see them swimming at the surface.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Ugh, they’re gonna make me wait for it</b></h2> <p><span>I guess now that </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet </span></i><span>was a huge technical disaster, Game Freak is trying to put more space between each of its games. </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>are coming to Switch 2 in 2027, which means we’ll probably have about a two-year gap between it and </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, which came out in October of last year. The company didn’t get any more specific than the year, though, so the games could conceivably launch in the first half of 2027. I’ll just have to sustain myself on </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>for a while.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gray Zone Warfare’s 0.4 Update is a ‘New Game, New Experience’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-04-update-new-game-new-experience/</link>
            <guid>1448683</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gray Zone Warfare’s 0.4 update is on the horizon, and Insider Gaming has received a behind-the-scenes look at what’s coming in this supersized overhaul. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/madfinger-games/" id="2643">MADFINGER Games</a> has dubbed the 0.4 update a ‘new game, new experience’, and it’s easy to see why.</p>



<p>From the open-world experience to the weapons you use, and from the in-game bosses to the visual palette, <strong>everything </strong>has been impacted in the 0.4 update, which represents a major turning point for the PvE-first tactical shooter.</p>







<h2 id="h-gray-zone-warfare-faces-immense-changes">Gray Zone Warfare Faces Immense Changes</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gray-zone-warfare/" id="1330">Gray Zone Warfare</a> came out in 2024, emerging to a curious audience that wasn’t really sure what to expect. It began life as an extraction shooter with a twist, adopting an open-world approach that facilitated sandbox-style play. The game’s identity has changed since then, and most recently, MADFINGER branded the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-now-pve-first-tactical-shooter/">a PvE-first tactical open-world shooter</a>.</p>



<p>Since it was released, Gray Zone Warfare has undergone some monumental changes, but the most important updates are yet to come, and that <strong>starts with </strong>the 0.4 patch.</p>



<figure><figcaption>No pun intended, but Gray Zone’s changes are night and day</figcaption></figure>







<p>To give you an idea of what’s coming, here’s a high-level overview of what’s coming or being impacted by the 0.4 update:</p>



<ul>
<li>New onboarding mechanics</li>



<li>New weapons, gear, and weapon skins</li>



<li>New customization elements</li>



<li>Fresh lore and storytelling elements</li>



<li>Updated movement mechanics</li>



<li>New character models, bosses, and allies</li>



<li>Upgraded loot pools</li>



<li>100 new tasks <strong>and </strong>50 <strong>reworked </strong>tasks</li>



<li>Finer optimization and audio tweaks</li>



<li>New progression mechanics and strange ‘mysteries’</li>
</ul>



<p>As you can see, this represents one of the most important updates to hit Gray Zone Warfare since it dropped in April 2024.</p>



<p>The breadth of the game is being blown wide open with 0.4. The 100 new tasks bring the count up to 263, and the world has been made more diverse to accommodate them. MADFINGER will introduce 25 new locations and four new biomes in 0.4, fine-tuning the sandbox vibes of Gray Zone and making things feel denser in the world of Lamang.</p>



<p>MADFINGER’s CEO, Marek Rabas, admitted in a briefing that Gray Zone felt too linear at times, despite boasting a massive open-world map. With that in mind, the team has sharpened – and continues to evolve – the game’s sandbox elements, adding more depth, threats, dynamic events, and mechanics.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Upgraded weather, a day/night cycle, better lighting, and more, and you can see the difference</figcaption></figure>







<p>New players will find it easier to get to grips with Gray Zone Warfare based on the fresh onboarding model and ‘Field Guide’ created to help newcomers. Thanks to a new in-game radio system and tactical screen, players can spend longer in the field, doing and finding more things, and extending their session without needing to dip back to their faction base.</p>



<p>It’s impossible not to be impressed by Gray Zone Warfare’s 0.4 update, but it’s important to stress that this is just another node on a massive roadmap, so there’s more to be excited about.</p>

But it was the 10th generation of the beloved series, featuring a whole new region and set of creatures, that fans tuned in to see. And they were certainly not disappointed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Pokémon Winds and Waves trailer opened with a nostalgic look back at earlier locations from the franchise so far via a book of illustrations, before a male and female Pikachu in vacation attire drop by to welcome our first proper look at the franchise's next generation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These Pikachu are officially named Mr. Windychu and Ms. Wavychu — yes, really — and will indeed be characters in Winds and Waves.

During this adventure, you’ll team up with all kinds of Pokémon to overcome both the difficult road ahead and even the forces of nature that block your path at times."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer concludes on a more ominous note, as the noises of swirling winds and crashing waves sound like they're being whipped up into a storm.

They <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1rg8juu/we_really_got_the_angry_bird/">were not alone in connecting these dots</a>, but despite his moody mannerisms Browt seems to have gone down a treat.</p> 
<p>"I have never not picked a grass starter in a Pokémon game, and I'm not about to start now," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/petestewart.bsky.social/post/3mftyhnzszc2w">wrote Respawn Entertainment's Pete Stewart</a>. "but I'll damned if Pombon isn't everything to me (but also I love you very much, angry little Browt)."</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>The similarity is uncanny...</p> 
<p>But how can you hate this moody boy!</p> 
<p>Bombon, a cheery pomeranian, has gone a long way in winning the hearts of thousands. "You have no idea how excited I am to have my pup be with me in Waves" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1rg8j5v/you_have_no_idea_how_excited_i_am_to_have_my_pup/">wrote Impressive-Eggplant6</a>, seeing a lot of Bombon in their own, real life adorable dog.</p><p>Others, still throwing adoration to the Fire-type starter, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/petrana.bsky.social/post/3mftx2c5scs2m">did so with a disclaimer</a>: "Please don’t turn into a Man please don’t turn into a Man PLEASE don’t turn into a Man" begged Petrana Radulovic, a desire born of the series' tendencies to take four-legged Pokémon and pull them up on their hind legs.</p>

<p>The final starter, Gecqua, is also getting their flowers. One <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1rg86dz/comment/o7pfkhe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Key_Amazed proclaimed</a>: "I'm in love with Gecqua's design. I really love elegant water type Pokemon like Milotic. Hopefully the final evolutions aren't bipeds."</p> 
<p>Artists spared no time paying homage to the new starters!</p>
<p>But putting aside the starters, what else did fans like the look of? Well, for the first time in a while, a Pokémon game looks visually impressive! In a post titled 'If this is representative of the game's visuals I am cautiously optimistic', user _AntiSocialMedia shared their thoughts on the early gameplay footage shown off today.</p>
<p>"Low image quality aside, the last few games have looked pretty rough so I am cautiously optimistic about this game looking good," they wrote. "What really got my attention was the lighting on the Slugmas in the caves."</p> 
<p>SpaceShipRat<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1rg8543/comment/o7pfork/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"> shared the sentiment</a>: "They've done it. After 10 years, they've managed to make a full 3D game that's not painful to look at."</p>
<p>So as far as first impressions go, it looks like Pokémon Winds and Waves are off to a grand start. Whether this momentum continues throughout the year as we near the 2026 release date for both titles, is the big question. Especially since, in a bold move, this new Pokémon  generation will be exclusive to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>

            <guid>1448647</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Launching a new video game has never felt more precarious. It doesn’t matter if it’s received prime placement in a major awards show, has journeyed through early access, or is a sequel to a genre-leading sensation, things can always go a bit off the rails. That’s what happened to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rennsport">Rennsport</a>, a sim racer with a fair bit of promise as it went through public testing, but where changing plans and reality set in at launch.</p>
<p>Marco Ujhasi&nbsp;co-founder and co-CEO of Competition Company admitted that “Of course you want to to deliver great product, want to get applause everywhere, and so on, but I learned a very, very, very important lesson in motorsport and I’m very grateful that an experienced colleague told me that when I was thrown into that, and he said, “The most important thing is that you and your team judge the performance you did, and then you look at the officially visible result and the comments on it.” This helped me in racing and this was also something I said to the guys when we got the reviews. This is not a product which should be judged only on the race, but maybe in 10 or 15 years.”</p>



<p>So where did it go wrong? The game arrived at launch with two main problems: a low number of cars and tracks compared to rivals in relation to the price tag, and with some truly shonky AI drivers that barely knew how to get around corners.</p>
<p>“At a certain point, you have to release, and we said, ‘okay, the idea is game as a service, which means we [can] release.’ So that was a plan, but then we saw the opportunity with the console, and console not only means [meeting] the technical capabilities, but you cannot release on console without singleplayer.</p>

<p>“But this was a few months of development to have the championships in the current state, also with the AI, all of what we talked about today. So, yeah, at the end, now, I would say we were not ready. […] It was maybe a bit of a misjudgement about what was needed, and especially when you put a price tag on it which was too high for what you deliver. It’s minus and minus. This doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>The positive here is that Competition Company is in the place where they can keep on pushing ahead and build on the technical basis and driving model that they already have.</p>
<p>“A cross platform, online multiplayer game is the most complex thing you can do. And especially in racing, it is maybe even more complex because the other genres do not operate on such a demanding physics. So to be capable to develop that is premium for a team, and on top of that, enabling such close racing between all the platforms where we need to sync everything and so on? This is an achievement. This is nothing that you can sell, but this is technically so demanding and this is what we delivered, and this is the part where we can be proud.”</p>

<p>As has now been outlined, there’s a lot happening for Rennsport through 2026. The first step is a major price adjustment to bring value better in line with content – unrelated to this, the publishing partnership with Nacon that helped to bring the game to consoles has been terminated and it will now be self-published. March will see the first batch of paid DLC, free content and game updates, and this will be followed month-by-month with more.</p>
<p>“It’s not just about the content, but also giving more reason to play. If you play on your own, if you virtually or on demand race against others, if you have something with your friends or if you go into the into the online multiplayer, we offer you a path if you want to walk through and develop, but we also give you the choice to just jump in. This is one part and giving you a reason also means, okay, why should I spend time in there?</p>
<p>“So this is why we why we changed the system of the [single player] championships. You also saw that we will integrate some one make series for manufacturers, so there’s a purpose of racing on our service as well.</p>
<p>“Step by step, we will hopefully get enough interesting stuff, maybe also some funny stuff at a certain point. So, yeah, why should we be there? I guess it’s fun and serious at the same time.”</p>
<div id="attachment_469280"><p id="caption-attachment-469280">Placing obstacles or making A-to-B races could be the foundations for new gameplay mods.</p></div>
<p>Some of that fun stuff will come from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/26/interview-modding-is-coming-to-rennsport-but-how-will-it-work-with-consoles/">the plans to release modding tools</a>, starting with track modding through the second half of 2026 – see more about that here – but another key lynchpin to this will be the redeveloped AI. We’ve seen a number of different approaches to this over the years, with machine learning having been used by some titles, abstracted player avatars, even drivers with names and distinct personalities. I was curious about Rennsport’s new approach.</p>
<p>“So in general, in racing, and this is then also the baseline for the AI thinking, the ruleset is pretty clear. What is the ruleset? You have tyre limits, you have to operate within those track limits –&nbsp;more or less at least – and in between those track limits, there is an ideal line and something can force you to not be on the ideal line. So, in general, this is racing. And when you do one lap in that case or from A to B in the shortest possible time, you win.</p>
<p>“You can describe it more complicated, but at the end it is exactly like this. And what would a classical machine learning system do within that?</p>
<p>“For the principle functionality, you don’t need that because the pattern is clear, no pattern needs to be identified, nothing. Where it’s getting interesting, because this you can programme, […] is that we are really simulating driver inputs to stay within those boundaries. And this enables us then, like [Lead Gameplay Programmer Rikard Häggström] also described, over time to make that part more flexible, more human, or whatever the right description is.”</p>

<p>“With those variables in, I think we have a pretty good idea, also with my background. What are the variables? A human being is dealing with. So somebody is more good in this, more good in that, more skilled in this. So one is breaking later than the other, for example. So in those parameters, if you first of all, have them separated, that you can tune them separated.”</p>
<p>“And on top of that, when you have that separation, then a bit of the machine learning comes in because then you can observe what’s specific people are doing, and you can try to imitate that.”</p>
<p>It’s certainly an interesting for the specific AI approach to be discussed in this detail, and stronger AI will make for a much stronger single player experience. Of course, it’s obviously worth remembering that so much of Rennsport’s initial plan and expectations for the future will remain with the online multiplayer, paths it can provide to pro esports racing, and embracing the modding community. The next few months will be key to getting Rennsport back on track, but the ambition here and the long-term plans are exciting and optimistic for what’s possible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We are under a week away from the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> on Switch 2 on <strong>5th March</strong>, but that hasn't stopped The Pokémon Company from revealing a <em>little</em> more info as a part of today's Presents showcase.</p>
<p>If you weren't already sold on the adorable vibes of Pokopia from everything we've seen so far, this brand-new trailer isn't going to change your mind. If, however, you were already on board, then we just know that you're going to love meeting DJ Rotom and Chef Dente — a culinary Greedent who wears a large pot on his head.</p>
<p>The stereo Rotom is your go-to aux guy for Pokopia and can swallow up any CDs you happen to stumble across to change your crafting soundtrack to whatever takes your fancy. We heard tunes like 'Pallet Town Theme', 'The Academy', 'Fortree City', and 'Road to Cerulean City' in the trailer, and all of those empty slots promise more to be collected, too.</p>
<p>Your Greedent pal is around to expand your cooking skills. Each Pokémon you come across has different tastes and favourites, so you'll want to learn as many recipes as possible to keep everyone happy.</p>
<p>The trailer also showcased a little more of the multiplayer content, highlighting how you'll be able to choose select Pokémon to journey to a friend's island and assist with their crafting. You can even play hide-and-seek with your pals by morphing into everyday objects and scattering around the island — oh gosh, we're going to spend <em>too much</em> time doing that.</p>
<p>There are just a few days to go before we all get our hands on this one, and yes, the new trailer has left us even more excited.</p>

The games will launch in 2027 and are exclusive for the Nintendo Switch 2. Nintendo also shared a trailer showcasing a new trio of starter pokémon — Browt, Pombon, and Gecua — and a number of different environments you’ll be able to explore as you play through the games.</p><p>In addition to establishing that <em>Wind </em>and <em>Waves</em> takes place in an island setting, the trailer really highlights how much more detailed and complex the games’ environments are compared to past titles like <em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet </em>and <em>Legends: Z-A. </em>It seems like you’ll be able to explore dense jungles, caves full of magma, and beneath the ocean all while encountering wild pokémon. In a press release, <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-Continues-30th-Celebrations-with-the-Unveiling-of-Pokemon-Wind">Nintendo</a> said that <em>Wind </em>and <em>Waves </em>will be open-world games, and the company also noted that Brazilian Portuguese will officially be supported as a selectable language.</p><p>2027 is still a ways out from now, but <em>Winds </em>and <em>Waves</em>’ definitely seems like it’s going to be worth the wait.

              <p>As is by now traditional, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398">initial announcement of the existence of <em>Pokémon Winds</em> And <em>Waves</em></a> was accompanied by the reveal of the three new starter Pokémon that trainers will be able to choose from at the beginning of the game, and by extension the first three Pokémon revealed as part of Gen X. They are Browt, Pombon and Gecqua. Let’s meet ’em.</p> <h2>Browt</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000674445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674445"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674445">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>First up is Browt, an owl-ish baby bird with big eyebrows. Just imagine the long nights spent trying to figure out that name. It’s the Grass-type starter, described as a Bean Chick Pokémon, and we already have its vital stats:</p> <p>Height: 1′ (0.3m)<br> Weight: 7.7lb (3.5KG)<br> Ability: Overgrow</p> <p>It does seem a bit odd that the game’s gone back to owls as a starter inspiration, given Rowlet was only three generations ago. Although this might be more bizarre design choice than actual species, given it’s described as a “chick.” Given the leaf-like brows on the beast, we can assume it’ll lean into those Bulbasaur-like planty attacks.</p>

 <h2>Pombon</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000674443" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674443"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674443">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>This fluffy pup is yet another dog-like pocket monster, although the first time one’s been a starter. It’s the Fire-type for the set, and classified as a Puppy Pokémon. Its stats are:</p> <p>Height: 1’4 (0.4m)<br> Weight: 14.8lb (4.3KG)<br> Ability: Blaze</p> <p>There’s not a lot more to discern about this little doggo, other than its obvious inspiration by a Pomeranian. It’ll be interesting to see if it stays cute as it grows, or if things head in a more wolf-like direction.</p>

 <h2>Gecqua</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000674444" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674444"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674444">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>Hardest to spell is Gecqua, who we can infer from the name alone is an aquatic gecko. Water-type, of course, and with its huge eyes my immediate favorite of the three, with the unimaginative category of Water Gecko Pokémon. Stats are:</p> <p>Height: 1′ (0.3m)<br> Weight: 9.5lb (4.3KG)<br> Ability: Torrent</p> <p>It was only Gen VIII that we last saw a reptilian starter, and a Water-type to boot, with Sobble. And given the visual similarity between the two, especially when you think about Sobble’s final form, Inteleon, it’s another oddly overlapping design. Still though, Gecqua is completely adorable and is already my pick.</p>

 <hr> <p>So, who stands out to you? Have you already fallen in love? Or are you just bemused that Game Freak couldn’t think of any other species to be inspired by for the new starters?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[All Pokémon Winds & Waves Starters—Every New Pokémon Gen 10 Starter, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-winds-and-waves-gen-10-starters/</link>
            <guid>1448626</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Winds and Waves was revealed to the world during the Pokémon Day showcase on February 27, including the first look at the Gen 10 starters.</p>



<p>Releasing as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive in 2027, Pokémon Winds and Waves is the tenth generation of the franchise and will bring a heap of new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> into the fray.</p>



<p>While there were no new wild Pokémon revealed in the trailer, a detailed look at the Gen 10 starters was shown, and Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-are-the-pokemon-winds-amp-waves-starters">What Are The Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves Starters?</h2>



<h3 id="h-browt">Browt</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Angry bird. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Browt is a small, angry-looking bird-type Pokémon that serves as the Grass starter in Winds and Waves, standing at a measly 0.3m tall and weighing 3.5kg. It is described as the ‘Bean Chick Pokémon’, with the Overgrow ability.</p>



<p>Bird-like starters are not a new concept for the Pokémon franchise, with Browt joining the likes of Torchic and Rowlet in the category.</p>



<h3 id="h-pombon">Pombon</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Bark. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pombon is a brown, dog-like Pokémon that resembles a pomeranian, though it’s mane has some lion similarities. Pombon is 0.4m tall and weighs 6.7kg. </p>



<p>Described as the “Puppy Pokémon,” Pombon has the Blaze ability, and joins a long list of dog-like Pokémon in the franchise’s history, including Growlithe and Arcanine, who are also Fire-type.</p>



<h3 id="h-gecqua">Gecqua</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dive in. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gecqua is the Water-type starter in Pokémon Winds and Waves, standing at 0.3m tall and weighing 4.3kg. Described as the “Water Gecko Pokémon,” it has the Torrent ability.</p>



<p>Similarities will certainly be made with Treecko, another Gecko-like starter Pokémon from Ruby and Sapphire, but it’s a good choice to fit the environment of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-evolved-forms-of-the-pokemon-wind-amp-waves-starters">Do We Know The Evolved Forms of The Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves Starters?</h2>



<p>No further details are known about the Pokémon Winds and Waves starters, including their evolved forms, and reveals could be hidden until the game releases in 2027.</p>



<p>While there is certainly more to be shown from Pokémon Winds and Waves ahead of release, Pokémon always keeps a tight lid on major reveals like the fully-evolved forms of the starter Pokémon.</p>



<p>Additionally, the mid-evolution lines for the Gen 10 starters are unlikely to be shown until release, and spoilers will be at a minimum as the game is Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, meaning it can’t be datamined.</p>
