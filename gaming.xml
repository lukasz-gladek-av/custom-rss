<p>Just one day before the theatrical release of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Paramount Pictures has confirmed the next movie in the series. First reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-release-date-2027-1236254778/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 will release in theaters in spring 2027.</p>



<p>No other details about what Sonic the Hedgehog 4 would be about were revealed. The only thing we can guess comes from spoilers of the latest movie, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-credits scene</a> that reveals another new character.</p>



<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 features the return of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles along with Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik. Joining the cast for the third film is Keanu Reeves who voices Shadow the Hedgehog. And, yes, Shadow does have his gun.</p>



<p>Based on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sonic_the_hedgehog_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">early reviews</a>, the latest movie in the franchise is going to be yet another success. According to Variety, it’s expected to make anywhere from $55-$60 million at North American theaters on opening weekend. The first two movies pulled in roughly $725.4 million.</p>

          <p>When the impossibly punctuated <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/"><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl</em></a> released on November 20, after many delays (that included <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq843dg4geo">the Russian invasion of the developer's native Ukraine</a>), it seemed like it could have used even more delays.</p>
<p><em>Stalker 2</em> had big performance issues and game-breaking bugs, along with balance and difficulty spike issues. Some things that seem "wrong" in the game are just going to stay that way. The first-person survival/shooter series has always had a certain wobbly, wild feel to it. This expresses itself in both the game world, where a major villain can off themselves by walking through a window, and in the tech stack, where <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/03/new-stalker-patch-breaks-saved-games/">broken save games</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/04/st-a-l-k-e-r-proves-you-can-have-just-as-much-fun-tweaking-as-you-can-playing/">DIY optimization</a>, and other unmet needs have created <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl">thriving mod scenes</a>.</p>
<p>Developer GSC Game World has been steadfastly patching the game since its release, and the latest one should nudge the needle a bit from "busted" to "charmingly wonky." Amid the "Over 1,800 fixes and adjustments" in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525329871842312365?l=english">Patch 1.1</a>, the big changes are to "A-Life." In porting&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em> to Unreal Engine 5, the developer faced a challenge in getting this global AI management system working, but it's showing its weird self again.</p>
<p>A-Life, as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-is-a-life-in-stalker-and-why-is-it-important/">detailed by Destructoid</a>, is the idea that "the characters in the game live their own lives and exist all the time, not only when they are in the player's field of view." In a certain radius around the player, events happen "online," in real time, such that you could stumble upon them. Farther out, things are still happening, and non-player characters (NPCs) are trekking about, but on an "offline," almost turn-based, less resource-intensive schedule. Modders have had quite a bit of fun tweaking A-life in prior versions of <em>Stalker 2</em>.</p>
<p>With the latest patch, the weirdly engaging feel that the world goes on without you returns. There will be more NPCs visible, NPCs out of range will pursue their "goals," and a more diverse range of human factions, mutants, and weirdos will exist. Perhaps most intriguingly, an issue where "Human NPCs didn't satisfy their communication needs and talks" is fixed. If only that could be patched for most of us player characters here in the real world.</p>

			<p>It's been reported today that 11 bit studios have canceled the development of their console-centric game, which was codenamed Project 8. The development of this title first started in 2018, and approximately 37 people were working on it by September 2024. With this game being canceled, there have been a number of layoffs, which are yet to be determined. It's been estimated that 11 Bit Studios has spent PLN 48.4 million ($11.8 million) on the development of this project up until now. The <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information was released</a> on the 11 bit studios website, where they talked about the reason behind the project's cancellation.</p>
<p>"Our vision for Project 8, which was intended to be our first title designed specifically for console gamers, was bold and exciting. However, it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rick games held stronger appeal," says Przemysław Marszał, President of the Management Board at 11 bit studios. It has been stated that the shifting market trends were not the only reason behind Project 8's cancellation. The game was being developed during a very rocky period, as the game had to continue development through a global pandemic.</p>
<p>"With Project 8, we experienced both breakthroughs and setbacks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, stabilizing the development team proved particularly difficult, yet progress continued. While we achieved noticeable quality improvements in certain areas, several critical aspects of the game and its development process remained problematic despite multiple iterations. Over time, delays accumulated, and with each milestone, the project's budget grew," explains Marszał.</p>
<p>It has been confirmed that there will be a reduction in staff of those who were involved in the development of Project 8. However, Marszał has confirmed that the employees affected by layoffs will receive severance packages, as well as assistance in finding new work and psychological counseling for those who need it.</p>
<p>From the report, it seems that they are hoping that the layoffs will be minimal, as Marszał says that more than half of the current team who were working on Project 8 will be offered opportunities within the company, allowing them to transition to existing teams or to begin on new, unannounced projects.</p>
<p>"Looking ahead, 11-bit studios is continuing intensive work on several key projects, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-already-profitable-sales-top-350k/">Frostpunk 2</a>, which recently became the Company's first title to win the industry's prestigious The Game Awards. The team is also gearing up for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-preview-and-qa-11-bit-studios-adds-branching-narrative-layers-to-base-building-survival-genre/">the launch of The Alters</a>, another highly anticipated release."</p>
<p>At the moment, there isn't much information about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601570/The_Alters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The&nbsp;</a><span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601570/The_Alters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alters&nbsp;</a>other</span>&nbsp;than that it's a sci-fi game with base-building elements. The game is set to release in Q1 2025, but with this announcement, it's uncertain whether they will be able to keep to that time frame.</p>

It takes inspiration from Blizzard’s game in plenty of ways, from general game modes to its style of monetization. Another way it takes inspiration is in its characters.</p><p>Some hero abilities in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> are clearly taken right from <em>Overwatch </em>characters. Many characters are pretty conceptually similar as well. For instance, Hulk comes to mind as a very similar concept to D. Va, both heroes have a “transformation” to make them immensely more powerful. That can be useful to keep in mind if you’re coming into <em>Rivals</em> fresh from <em>Overwatch</em> and want to roll with characters that feel familiar. </p><p><br>Luckily for you, we’ve put together a collection of five  characters so similar to <em>Overwatch </em>characters that many will find themselves right at home when jumping in. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-recommend-id="image://37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Widowmaker and Black Widow are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Widowmaker and Black Widow are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-recommend-id="image://37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Widowmaker and Black Widow are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, if you can believe it, the two characters with “Widow” in their name play incredibly similar. Black Widow’s sniper will be incredibly familiar to Widowmaker veterans, and she has a movement ability to help get her into the perfect sniper position. Their close-quarters combat varies a bit, and they have different Ultimates, but Black Widow is an easy main for former Widowmaker players.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-recommend-id="image://4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hanzo and Hawkeye are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hanzo and Hawkeye are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-recommend-id="image://4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hanzo and Hawkeye are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Another obvious Avengers parallel, Hawkeye and Hanzo are natural counterparts. Their abilities differ a bit, though. Hawkeye’s slashing abilities are unique to his kit, and his Ultimate is something completely new. However, the similarity in their main bow and arrow shots is undeniable. Hanzo mains should absolutely be running to try Hawkeye as their first character in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-recommend-id="image://680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Junkrat and Squirrel Girl are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Junkrat and Squirrel Girl are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-recommend-id="image://680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Junkrat and Squirrel Girl are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Squirrel Girl is already proving to be a force to be reckoned with in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, just like her very similar counterpart, Junkrat. Squirrel Girl’s primary fire grenade launcher is similar to Junkrat’s. And the similarities go far beyond the main weapon. She has a traversal ability to bounce on her tail to give her extra height, not too dissimilar from Junkrat. In addition, her secondary fire helps stun people. While it’s more active than Junkrat’s Steel Trap, these two abilities work in much the same way. Overall, Junkrat fans may find a lot of muscle memory transfers over to Squirrel Girl.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-recommend-id="image://1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Winston and Venom are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Winston and Venom are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-recommend-id="image://1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Winston and Venom are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Winston is a tank that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-problem-with-overwatchs-dive-meta-1796828151&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-problem-with-overwatchs-dive-meta-1796828151">dominated <em>Overwatch</em>’s infamous dive meta</a></span>, and Venom has a lot of similar shades. Both are tanks that rely on leaping headfirst into trouble. Once they’re in the enemy backlines, their primary attacks are both short range “beams” that don’t do heavy damage but can really add up over time. Venom’s other abilities are more focused on self-sustaining than providing specific cover for teammates, but if you played Winston in <em>Overwatch</em>, a switch from the simian to the symbiote may be in order for you.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-recommend-id="image://f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Baptiste and Rocket Raccoon are juxtaposed next to each other." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Baptiste and Rocket Raccoon are juxtaposed next to each other." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-recommend-id="image://f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Baptiste and Rocket Raccoon are juxtaposed next to each other." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rocket Raccoon plays like a much simpler version of <em>Overwatch</em>’s high-flying support, Baptiste. Like Baptiste, Rocket fires healing grenades with a secondary fire, and uses a traditional ballistic weapon as their primary. They also have a powerful ability that requires a lot of trigger discipline: Immortality Beacon for Baptiste, and the B.R.B. for Rocket. Finally, both have a damage-boosting Ultimate ability. While Baptiste’s is a screen, Rocket’s shoots damage boosting beams surrounding his device.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, everyone. 11 Bit Studios has announced that it has cancelled its game known as Project 8 will have layoffs at the studio because of it.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement released</a> earlier this week, 11 Bit Studios says they had 37 people working on the game up until the decision to end it was made. As far as why it was cancelled, a number of reasons were given by 11 Bit Studios President Przemyslaw Marszal.</p>



<p>“With&nbsp;Project 8, we experienced both breakthroughs and setbacks,” he said. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, stabilising the development team proved particularly difficult, yet progress continued. While we achieved noticeable quality improvements in certain areas, several critical aspects of the game and its development process remained problematic despite multiple iterations. Over time, delays accumulated, and with each milestone, the project’s budget grew.”</p>



<p>He then said that the “tipping point” happened after what Marszal called a “thorough evaluation” of the game’s latest milestone.</p>



<p>“When assessing a project, the Management Board always considers its development progress, including internal reviews and independent surveys,” Marzal said.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, in this case, our findings revealed unresolved issues and challenges that would require further extensions of the production timeline and corresponding budget increases to address. This, coupled with revised sales forecasts, largely reflecting the changing market environment, raised significant doubts about the project’s overall profitability.”</p>



<p>The exact number of layoffs at 11 Bit Studios weren’t revealed. However, it was said that “more than half” of the Project 8 team will be offered the opportunity to move to other projects within the company. Those who are being let go will receive severance packages, counselling, and assistance with finding new work.</p>



<p>The company estimates to have spent $11.8 million on the game’s development at the time of cancellation. Marszal said that the full cost of ending Project 8 won’t be known until the release of the company’s Annual Report for 2024.</p>



<p>The games industry has seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 15,000 known jobs</a> lost in 2024. The real number is likely approaching 17,000 when taking into account unconfirmed numbers.</p>

Outside some brief mentions in-game, the most information I can find on it was just a bunch of players in the official Discord asking questions and occasionally getting an evaluated guess of an answer from a fellow player. But after some rigorous testing and cross-references with other materials, I’ve put together a handy breakdown of everything you need to know about Season Bonuses.</p><h2 id="h671"><a id="whatis"></a>What is a Season Bonus?</h2><p><strong>Season Bonuses are class-specific buffs provided to a set of characters: </strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Vanguards get extra health </strong></li><li><strong>Duelists get a damage boost </strong></li><li><strong>Strategists get a healing bonus</strong>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Each of the characters receiving these bonuses is involved in Team-Up Abilities. More specifically, each one serves as an anchor or initiator for them.</p><p>We’re assuming that this isn’t just a massive coincidence and the characters mentioned above were chosen for their Team-Ups role. The yellow symbol for Season Bonus is also used to infer to Team-Up Anchors after all. Adjusting these bonuses could be a way to motivate players to use these characters, or perhaps be a method of balancing on the developer’s part. Something that ties into both of those is the presumption that Season Bonuses will only last throughout the season. </p><p>The next season could adjust the values of these bonuses or provide them to entirely different characters. If these are indeed meant to be tied to Team-Ups, we could also see the debut of new ones and potentially the shelving of others. Again, we can only make guesses about Season Bonuses since we don’t have a proper explanation. Fingers crossed we have a detailed breakdown come time for Season One.</p><h2 id="h672"><a id="activate"></a>How to activate a Season Bonus</h2><figure id="" data-id="522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-recommend-id="image://522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hero Profile page for Groot, shows his Team-Up Anchor Season Bonus in the bottom left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Hero Profile page for Groot, shows his Team-Up Anchor Season Bonus in the bottom left." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-recommend-id="image://522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hero Profile page for Groot, shows his Team-Up Anchor Season Bonus in the bottom left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is a good chance that the first time you saw mention of a Season Bonus was while you were picking a hero to play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-cult-classic-rpg-off-gets-surprise-steam-and-switch-release-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a piece of news I certainly didn't see coming in the waning hours of 2024, today it was announced that indie cult classic game OFF is getting released on Steam and Nintendo Switch next year in a new and "improved" version, including a physical edition.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar, OFF is an RPG that first released in 2008 from Belgian studio Unproductive Fun Time. It was made in RPG Maker, originally released in French, and has never received an official English translation, though multiple fan translations have sprung up over the years. It's also never been available on typical, popular PC storefronts such as Steam or itch.io, but instead has circulated over the years as a direct download, gaining a cult following due to how utterly weird, unsettling, and at times inscrutable it can be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OFF puts the player in control of a mysterious baseball player-looking figure known as the Batter, who is instructed by a talking cat calling itself the Judge to travel through four Zones and kill ghostly creatures known as Spectres. The Zones themselves are haunting, upsetting places run by cruel leaders, composed of strange elements such as smoke, metal, plastic, meat, and sugar, and populated by confused and often suffering individuals who seem to be tormented by the Spectres. However, as the game progresses, the player is encouraged to question the actions of the Batter and themselves as a player, with multiple endings possible depending on the player's decisions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite never hitting the mainstream, OFF has served as an inspiration for a number of other hit RPGs, most notably Undertale (and most notably Undertale's absolute creepiest, freakiest stuff). The game is coming to Steam and Nintendo Switch in 2025 both digitally and as a physical edition via Fangamer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<strong>Giorno</strong>: Godly Level DPS, only 1 can be placed globally, big range, Slow passive, passive which chips enemies HP by 0.95% per hit and has an ability which sends all enemies to spawn, takes 10% of their HP, and slows all affected enemies down by 90%<br>
<strong>Rudeus</strong>: Terrible DPS, but a support ability to buff all units in range of his same element’s damage<br>
<strong>Makima</strong>: Very good DPS, passive to summon enemies that she killed equal to their original HP, no special status effect, no ability<br>
<strong>Denji</strong>: Meta DPS when girl in range, Best bleed unit in game, no ability"</p><p>With all of these changes, it will be interesting to see how players adapt. Alongside the new Boss Rush mode, these changes could make players have to rethink their team composition. While none of the buffs and nerfs were catastrophic, there are rumblings that the development team behind Anime Last Stand may be working on even more buffs and nerfs to change things even further. I'm intrigued to see what we could expect to see next time around. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Shaun Cichacki is a Freelance Contributor with IGN, covering features, guides, and news.

They also say that the dock is rated for 60W and the Switch 2 itself is rated for 45W, both much higher than the model that launched back in 2017. And finally, the dock has two USB-A ports and one for USB-C, presumably the one that powers it, which is the same as the current model. </p><p>“I spoke with [NextHandheld], and I’ve now heard and seen enough to think they might be legit,” wrote<em> The Verge</em>’s Seaon Hollister. </p><p>Whether it ends up being 100 percent accurate or not, everything shared by the latest alleged Reddit leaker continues to line up with the rest of what we’ve been hearing, as well as with alleged <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185">CAD mockups of what the Switch 2 looks like</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alleged-images-of-nintendos-new-switch-have-appeared-online/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alleged-images-of-nintendos-new-switch-have-appeared-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which circulated back in the fall</a></span>. Basically, the Switch 2 will look a lot like the current Switch, just slightly bigger, with a more rounded profile and a number of spec upgrades and design tweaks to improve handling and quality of life. </p><p>That’s not surprising in the context of the rest of the gaming hardware market. The Xbox Series X/S were not a major departure from the Xbox One. The PlayStation 5 is basically just a much more powerful PS4 with two ugly white fins. No one expects the Steam Deck 2 to look dramatically different than the existing one, and most PC gaming handhelds at this point all basically look the same: like a thick tablet with controllers on the sides. </p><p>But it is surprising given Nintendo’s own history of constantly trying to innovate in spaces where no one else is working. The company clung to cartridges longer than anyone and now uses SD cards. The Wii chased motion controls instead of HD graphics. The Wii U prioritized a second screen instead of beefier specs. And the Switch used smartphone specs to take gaming on the go. The notion of the company just iterating on the existing Switch, already the second most popular gaming console ever and fast closing in on the number one PS2, both made a ton of sense and seemed like it might still be too un-Nintendo to be real. </p><p>As we approach an eventual reveal of the Switch 2, every new potential leak points to Nintendo surprising fans by <em>not</em> doing the unexpected and instead doubling down on what already works. The only official thing we know about the upcoming hardware—that it will be backwards compatible with existing Switch games—only reinforces that seeming inevitability. </p><p>I’m sure the company might still have a few tricks and surprises up its sleeve. We’ll find out for sure whenever Nintendo actually announces the dang thing. It’s promised to do so before April 2025. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-on-mobile/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Counter-Strike is already the biggest multiplayer game in the world, and a mobile version would be a total game changer. As big as the PC gaming industry is, the mobile gaming industry is that much bigger with the amount of phones out there.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-counter-strike-on-mobile">Is Counter-Strike on Mobile?</h2>



<p>There is no official version of Counter-Strike available on mobile. Other first person shooters have stepped into the mobile space though. Call of Duty Mobile is one of the most popular and highest grossing mobile shooters ever. Riot plans to eventually launch their tactical shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-mobile-china-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT on mobile</a>, and Ubisoft is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-china/">working on a mobile version of Rainbow Six Siege</a>.</p>



<p>Counter-Strike is technically playable on phones through apps that can stream Steam to mobile devices, but if it does work, it won’t be well optimized. The closest thing to CS2 on mobile is playing it on Steam Deck, but the game is not Steam Deck Verified. While it’s not impossible for Counter-Strike to eventually reach phones, it’s extremely unlikely, as Valve has never prioritized mobile game development.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for a mobile game like Counter-Strike though, there’s plenty to choose from.</p>



<h2 id="h-mobile-games-like-counter-strike">Mobile Games Like Counter-Strike</h2>



<p>Just by searching “Counter-Strike” on the iOS or Apple app store, you’ll see tons of games clearly trying to emulate the iconic first person shooter. Even the names of the games are trying to capitalize on the popularity of CS: Critical Strike, Modern Strike Online, Critical Ops, Counter Attack. All of these games advertise CS-like tactical gameplay and weapon skins, and many of these games have just ported over nearly exact copies of iconic maps.</p>



<p>Top-down camera versions like Bullet Echo are also similar to Counter-Strike, but offer a different perspective. Both Call of Duty Mobile and Arena Breakout are also really good, popular mobile shooter games. However they’re more similar to arcade-like action shooters than tactical shooters. As mentioned above, both VALORANT and Siege are eventually making their way to mobile, but not for some time.</p>



<p>Do any of these mobile copies of Counter-Strike interest you?&nbsp;Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p><em>If you’ve got spare CSGO or CS2 skins and you’re feeling lucky,&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;(18+ only)</em></p>

Witcher games Geralt was the protagonist, and I think everyone really loved playing as Geralt," Narrative director Phillip Weber said in <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interview-cd-projekt-red-wants-the-witcher-4-to-be-a-deeper-open-world-not-just-a-larger-one/" rel="nofollow ">a recent interview</a>. "I really loved playing as Geralt, so I think we're aware that if some people think right now that they would still prefer to be Geralt, I do think that’s a legitimate concern, so if this is where that concern [about Ciri] is coming from, that's valid."</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, The Witcher 4 won't be the first time players step into Ciri's boots--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/">The Witcher 3</a> saw players alternate between playing as Geralt and playing as Ciri, though Geralt was still the main focus of the game. This time around, it seems the story will be told primarily through Ciri's eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">"Ciri was already being set up as a second protagonist in the Andrzej Sapkowski novels and as the second playable character in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, so for us, it really was the natural evolution of what we've already been making for so long," Weber continued. "Also, for people who really love Geralt, it lets us honour the ending that Geralt had in The Witcher 3 and in Blood and Wine."</p><p dir="ltr">Weber also added that the choice to make Ciri the game's main playable protagonist wasn't one that was made lightly, nor was it made recently.</p><p dir="ltr">"The best thing that we can do--and I think this is really our goal--is to prove that with Ciri, we can do a lot of interesting things so we can really make it worth it, because this decision to have Ciri as a protagonist wasn't made yesterday, we started making this [choice] a very long time ago," Weber explained.</p><p>CDPR hasn't announced an official release date for The Witcher 4, and has yet to reveal which platforms the game will launch on, though the studio has, dating back to The Witcher 3, launched games on both console and PC.

In a statement, the department explained these exits came about in light of concerns about their positions on the board being anti-competitive and in violation of Section 8 of the Clayton Act.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similarly, Tencent has amended a part of its shareholder agreement and "relinquished its unilateral right to appoint directors or observers to the Epic board in the future."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the statement explains, Section 8 stops directors and officers from "serving simultaneously on the board of competitors."
