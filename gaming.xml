            <p>You'd think Talha and Jack Co would have earned themselves a nice custard cream and a sit down after having just released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judero">Judero </a>last September, but they're back already with a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/637042083/mashina">crowdfunder for Mashina</a> - a robo-stuffed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> where you'll "Dig, build, discover and mend in a chill, stop-motion world." Now I think about, you could probably eat quite a lot of custard creams in five months, although less so if you were using your hands to build model robots. Have a trailer. It's got robots in it.</p>

<p>A very nice, digital press release with zero custard cream crumbs on it tells me that Mashina is based around "positive verbs" like 'build', 'nurture', 'discover', 'mend', and 'bomb'. It uses traditional stop motion capture with digital techniques, and the music is a tribute to Gamecube-era soundtracks, with the same synth used in Metroid Prime. "Warm and crunchy digital baths" is the phrased used, which I enjoy immensely. Track below. Jack's games always have such fantastic music.</p>

<p>Here are some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3395930/Mashina/">Steam</a> features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Dig to excavate rare minerals.</li>
<li>Build helpful machines to aid your excavations</li>
<li>Find robot pals, treasures, trinkets and more</li>
<li>Meet locals and get missions</li>
<li>Decorate your surroundings</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The Kickstarter is very close to its £12,000 goal already, but still has around 3 weeks to go. If you've got a spare £500, you can even get yourself your own robot. They are very nice robots but I reckon I could probably draw a face on a dustbin lid and spend the rest on chips and Ric Flair action figures and a utility bill or two and be roughly as content. Again though, very nice robots.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The developer of the GTA 6 parody game Grand Taking Ages has returned to Steam after being taken down. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A little over a month ago, a title called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-iv-grand-taking-ages-ps-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Taking Ages VI </a>popped up on Steam and PlayStation Store, and it felt eerily similar to Rockstar’s highly anticipated 2025 release, GTA 6, with both games even having the same acronym (GTA VI). After a closer look, it was revealed that Grand Taking Ages VI was a game development simulator where the player manages a studio while tackling obstacles that developers encounter while creating the game. The title was recently pulled from Steam and PlayStation Store due to its controversial appearance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulled-gta-6-parody-game-grand-taking-ages-from-the-playstation-store-but-its-now-cleared-for-release-on-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> reveals that Grand Taking Ages, the GTA 6 parody game, is now back on Steam while remaining pulled from the PlayStation Store. The developer, Violarte, stated that their approach towards Steam differed, as they “engaged with the team” early on with the game’s concept before the official submission. After it was pulled, the game underwent a “thorough” review process to be relisted on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After returning to Steam, you can spot key differences in the GTA 6 parody game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3464800/Grand_Taking_Ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listing</a>. Grand Taking Ages has dropped the number ‘VI’ from the title. Additionally, they have new screenshots, a fresh trailer, and a revamped description. These changes were made to “clearly differentiate Grand Taking Ages from the original inspiration, GTA 6, and to emphasize its unique direction.”</p>



<p>Grand Taking Ages developer also addressed the PlayStation Store listing, stating they “strongly believe” that the new changes should be enough for the game to return to the platform. The game is slated to release in July 2025, check out its new description:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Coming Soon Since Forever! Start your game dev journey in Mom’s garage! Battle angry fans, dodge ruthless journalists, and perfect the art of “creative” deadlines. Survive on pizza and energy drinks while building your dream studio into… a slightly better garage!</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/insomniac-founder-ted-price-announces-his-retirement-after-30-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Insomniac founder and president Ted Price has announced his retirement from the games industry, having led the company for the past 30 years. He will step down at the end of March 2025 and will be replaced by three studio co-heads.</p>
<p>Ted Price has been integral to Insomniac throughout its history, the creative director behind Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and Resistance: Fall of Man. All of them are PlayStation icons for their respective generations, with Ratchet &amp; Clank continuing to be a family friendly favourite to this day.</p>


<p><a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/">In his retirement blog post</a>, and after initially addressing the hardship facing many in the wake of the wildfires in California, Price said:</p>
<p>Another aspect of our culture I hold dear is the Insomniacs’ ability to pull together and successfully overcome what often seem like insurmountable obstacles.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, despite a challenging 2024, Insomniacs stayed fully focused on building games for our fans. As a result of the team’s persistence and collaboration, we’re in one of the strongest positions we’ve experienced in years, with each game in development looking beautiful and playing fantastic.</p>

<p>Therefore, last week, I felt comfortable announcing to the Insomniac team that after having been incredibly fortunate to enjoy such a fulfilling career in games, I’ll be retiring from the industry at the end of March. Today, I’m sharing this news more broadly.</p>
<p>I actually made this decision last year. For me, after over 30 years of leading Insomniac, I felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team.</p>
<p>Filling the space that Price is vacating will be three co-heads for the studio: Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider and Jen Huang.</p>
<p>Schneider joined Insomniac during the PS2 era on the marketing and comms side, and has most recently been Head of Brand and Leadership Strategy. Huang joined eight years ago as CFO and Head of Finance, having previously been a finance exec elsewhere. Lastly, Dezern started at Insomniac back in 1998 as part of the creative team working in various roles as&nbsp;Environment Artist, Art Director, Studio Director for the Durham studio, and as the Head of Creative since 2017.</p>
<p>Of the trio, Price writes:</p>
<p>For many years, Chad, Jen and Ryan have been instrumental in making Insomniac what we are today. I’ve seen each lead major initiatives here which have positively changed Insomniacs’ lives. Plus, they’ve consistently demonstrated the kind of collaboration and transparency that’s part of our DNA. And just as important, their skillsets are truly complementary.</p>
<p>There is no way that I would ever consider handing the reins to a team I didn’t trust to take care of Insomniacs and lead us to even greater heights. Chad, Jen and Ryan are that team. For those who may not be familiar, please take a moment to get to know them here.</p>

            <p>Wolverine is going to be Insomniac's next big game, but despite the project being announced several years ago, the studio is still keeping a release date under wraps.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game">Wolverine was first teased back in 2021</a>, during a PlayStation Showcase. At this time, the studio stated the game was still "very early in development". It also still had its Marvel's Spider-Man sequel in the works at this point, with that project ultimately releasing in 2023.</p>
<p>But, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> now out in the wild, and Insomniac previously stating it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-developer-has-no-additional-story-content-planned-for-its-web-slinging-sequel">"no additional story content planned" for its web-slinging sequel</a>, many had hoped to hear more about Wolverine. However, the studio isn't quite ready to share too much about its upcoming project just yet, although it appreciates there is plenty of "pent up excitement" around it.</p>

<p>Our latest morsel on the game comes gollowing Insomniac co-founder <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-studio-boss-ted-price-announces-retirement-from-games-industry">Ted Price's retirement announcement yesterday</a>. The Wolverine studio now has three new co-heads - Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider, and Jen Huang - and the trio sat down to chat with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/insomniac-games-ceo-ted-price-exits-ryan-schneider-chad-dezern-jen-huang-playstation-1236281913/">Variety</a> about what this means for Insomniac, and naturally the topic of Wolverine came up.</p>
<p>The studio execs would not confirm or deny a 2025 release window when questioned, but did Dezern did say this:</p>
<p>"We've announced Wolverine, and we'd love to talk more about Wolverine, but we have to be like Logan today, and remain very stoic until it's time to pop the claws down the road. As much as we're as much as we have pent up excitement, we got to hold on to it. So that's, that's about as much as we could say about our upcoming projects today."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Insomniac is playing its claws close to its chest. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Other than that brief teaser from 2021, any official word on Wolverine has been slimmer than slim.</p>
<p>In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">files were stolen from Insomniac Games by ransomware hackers</a>. Following this attack, people began playing - and uploading footage - of an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-posting-footage-of-marvels-wolverine-from-stolen-early-version">incomplete early development build of Wolverine</a>, which was found within the stolen files.</p>
<p>Then, in October of last year, it was revealed the game's creative director had moved across to Xbox, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-wolverine-creative-director-now-leading-xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot">joined the team working on the Perfect Dark reboot</a>, meaning Wolverine would now be led by Marcus Smith. Meanwhile, Mike Daly became Wolverine's game director, while the game's previously announced game director Camerson Christain would remain with Insomniac, but in a different role.</p>
<p>At one point, there were rumours <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniacs-wolverine-could-reportedly-launch-as-early-as-autumn-2024">Wolverine could release in 2024</a>, which clearly did not happen. More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniacs-wolverine-reportedly-due-2025-darker-than-spider-man">there was word of a 2025 release</a>, which of course could still happen, so stay tuned.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Legendary video game composer Grant Kirkhope has said he has "zero hope" of seeing a new Banjo-Kazooie game.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media last night, Kirkhope went on to <a href="https://x.com/grantkirkhope/status/1882247865357209894">suggest</a> that any new attempt at reviving the dormant platforming franchise was doomed to failure, as "diehard fans would instantly hate it" regardless of "how good it was".
</p>
<p>
Kirkhope is famous for having scored a swathe of classic titles from the heyday of British development powerhouse Rare. He penned the scores of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-review">GoldenEye 007</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a> and Perfect Dark, as well as Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/banjo-kazooie-nuts-bolts">Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts</a>.

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
More recently, Kirkhope's fame has been revived with work on more modern platformers, including the distinctly Banjo-esque <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a>, as well as Ubisoft's Mario + Rabbids games.
</p>
<p>
"I hope that last tweet didn't come across as mean," Kirkhope <a href="https://x.com/grantkirkhope/status/1882298146971410457">added</a>, several hours later. "The Banjo fanverse is a wonderful thing, the reaction when Banjo got into Smash Bros. is something I'll remember for the rest of my life ❤️"
</p>
<p>
Fans of the classic Banjo-Kazooie games have long called for a new installment from developer Rare, but to date there's been no suggestion that one is in the works. 
</p>
<p>
Rare itself is busy maintaining hit pirate live-service <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, and has the long-in-development fantasy game Everwild next on its docket.
</p>
<p>
Still, Banjo-Kazooie's popularity endures. Classic games in the franchise have been re-released over the years, including via Xbox's Rare game compilation Rare Replay, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-tooie-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-later-this-month">as well as on Nintendo Switch Online</a>. And, as Kirkhope mentioned, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-kazooie-joins-super-smash-bros-ultimate-line-up">Microsoft gave the nod for the characters to turn up in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>. Could there still be hope for Banjo and Kazooie yet?

            <p>Surgent Studios, the developer behind Afrofuturist metroidvania <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera</a>: Zau, has teamed up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> publisher Pocketpair to release its next game.</p>
<p>Set for release in 2025, it will be a horror game but not part of the Tales of Kenzera universe.</p>
<p>Last year's Tales of Kenzera: Zau, published by EA, was the first in the series, with more games planned to continue that world. However, this next game will be a shorter and separate project.</p>

<p>"Both Surgent and Pocketpair are well-versed in taking risks. We noticed a pattern in the entertainment industry, and Pocketpair has given us the opportunity to make a horror game about it. It will be short and weird, and we think players will be interested in what we have to say," said Surgent Studios CEO Abubakar Salim.</p>
<p>"We're still in earnest conversation about further projects set in the Tales of Kenzera universe, but this will be a standalone piece: a mile marker between where we've come from and where we're going."</p>
<p>Pocketpair Publishing is the company's new publishing wing.</p>
<p>"As the games industry continues to grow, more and more games find themselves struggling to get funded or greenlit," said head of Pocketpair Publishing John Buckley. "We think this is a real shame, because there are so many incredible creators and ideas out there that just need a little help to become incredible games.</p><p>"We were instantly fascinated by Abubakar's creative vision for a horror game on a topic he's uniquely qualified to explore. The ultimate goal of Pocketpair Publishing is to find creators with a genuine passion for games and enable them to create fun, new experiences for gamers all over the world."</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-developers-next-game-will-be-an-afrofuturist-gothic-horror-rpg-as-the-studio-fights-to-survive">Eurogamer was shown a prototype for a new gothic horror game called Project Uso</a>, where players take the role of a vampiric android bearing the soul of Eshu, the god of chaos.</p>
<p>However, Surgent Studios has confirmed to Eurogamer today's announcement is a separate project, while Project Uso will be the continuation of the Tales of Kenzera world.</p>
<p>As a result, details on this new small project are largely unknown. It's set to release later this year.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>This is the energy I want to see driving games in 2025—developers lifting each other up, creating together, and pushing the industry forward.</p><p>Massive love to the Pocketpair team! It’s an incredible honor to be the first partnership announced with <a href="https://twitter.com/PocketpairPBLSH?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PocketpairPBLSH</a> We’ve been… <a href="https://t.co/DM8Z7Lp4oK">https://t.co/DM8Z7Lp4oK</a></p></div>— Abubakar Salim (@Abzybabzy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Abzybabzy/status/1882353922582450360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Following Tales of Kenzera: Zau, staff from Surgent Studios faced redundancy as the developer sought funding for its next project.</p>
<p>"There is this idea of constantly being pushed to grow, to be bigger, to do more, to spend more," Salim previously told Eurogamer. "And within an industry that is, rightfully, so artistic in its nature, that isn't necessarily always the answer."</p>
<p>That consideration may point to the decision to work with Pocketpair on this new, smaller game.</p>
<p>Salim has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/abubakar-salim-addresses-fever-pitch-of-racism-received-after-launch-of-tales-of-kenzera-zau">received a torrent of racist abuse online</a>, in the midst of openness about the development of Tales of Kenzera.</p>
<p>"I'm happy that we've been really open with as much as we can," he said. "Whatever feedback you have, send it through. Racism isn't feedback."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in December, a bunch of cool games had the extreme impoliteness to sneak onto digital shelves while we were losing our hair, souls and marbles covering various gaming award shows. One of those games was Escape From Castle Matsumoto - which can be excused, admittedly, because it's a game about ninjas, and we expect ninjas to be sneaky.</p> <!--more-->
<p>It's a free splitscreen pixelart heist oddity in which two ninjas race to be the first to loot a daimyo's castle. While scouring the mansion in your half of the screen, you can lay traps and obstacles for the rival shinobi. If push comes to shove comes to roundhouse kick, you can also fight them directly.</p>
<p>It's kind of nifty. It looks like it's from the 80s. Here's a video.</p>

<p>I had a play just now and can (re)confirm that I suck at being a ninja. In my defence, I Narutoed straight into <a href="https://mausimus.itch.io/efcm">the Itch.io browser edition</a> without even glancing at the control scheme. Impetuosity is not one of the ninja virtues, I gather. There's probably an ancient ninja proverb about always reading the manual. Still, it was calming to watch my bot opponent gracefully case the joint while I loitered menacingly in a hallway, trying to find the smoke bomb button.</p><p>You may fare better. Perhaps you'd like to up the stakes and challenge a friend, even - there's online, LAN and same-computer multiplayer, according to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490030/Escape_From_Castle_Matsumoto/">Steam page</a>. The developers are <a href="https://mausimus.net/">mausimus</a> and Chris "Joker" Femo. Good for them, I say. We can always do with more ninja games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game, titled <em>Lili</em>, is a “screen life thriller video game” where you’ll have access to a modern-day Lady Macbeth’s personal devices, according to a press release.</p><p>“Players will be immersed in a stylized, neo-noir vision of modern Iran, where surveillance and authoritarianism are part of daily life,” the release says. “The gameplay will feature a blend of live-action cinema within an interactive game format, giving players the chance to immerse themselves in the world of Lady Macbeth and make choices that influence her destiny.” It sounds kind of like a version of <em>Macbeth</em> inspired by Sam Barlow’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/23/20828666/telling-lies-review-steam-iphone-sam-barlow-interactive-thriller-her-story">interactive</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031558/immortality-is-coming-to-ps5">thrillers</a>.</p><p>The Royal Shakespeare Company is making the game in collaboration with iNK Stories, a New York-based indie studio and publisher that also made <em>1979 Revolution: Black Friday</em>. It stars Zar Amir as “Lady Macbeth (Lili),” per the press release.</p><p><em>Lili</em> is set to release “later in 2025.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/all-will-fall">All Will Fall</a> are pariahs, as far as I'm concerned. You should warn your children to avoid them. If you encounter them in the street, you should jerk away with a muttered oath, making a sign to avert evil spirits - for these are the scumbags who've decided to develop a city-building game in which all the buildings and building materials are subject to realworld physics. A city-building game that takes place on small, post-apocalyptic islands, where the only way to expand is upward.</p><p>"Playing Jenga with human lives" is how they summarise it, the wastrels. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The premise is that the world is being swallowed by the ocean. You lead a small boatload of wild-eyed survivors, searching for the last few scraps of land to found a civilisation on. Having located a few sparse tiles of solid footing, you must wrestle with a physics-based building system that "challenges you to consider real-world construction aspects when building your intricate multi-level city in all three dimensions".</p><p>Everything you build may collapse, pancaking the civvies inside, unless it's delicately stacked and balanced. Do not construct your city like you're absent-mindedly filling a shopping trolley at Tescos, with soft fruits carefully placed in the bottom and 20 family-sized tins of bratwurst heaped on top. Exercise discretion. "There is a high-risk, high-reward aspect to it," the Steam page adds. "For example, you can find various ways to reach much-needed resource nodes by building elaborate bridges or ladders. Or - save some space for more production by stacking the housing quarters on top of each other."</p>
<p>All this, and you still have to tackle the traditional post-apocalytic mayoral dilemma of whether to be a kindly custodian who causes everybody to perish of malnutrition, or a ruthless tyrant who secures overall survival at the cost of being universally despised. There are three survivor factions, each with different skills - Engineers can operate cranes, Sailors can sail boats, and Workers handle anything that isn't a boat or a crane, I guess. Factions have wants and needs: you likely won't be able to satisfy them all, so it's a good thing you can impose martial law to shut up the moaners.</p>
<p>I'm not clear on how complex All Will Fall <em>really</em> is when you discount the risk of towns accidentally flattening themselves, but the social and story elements sound quite labyrinthine. "Each colony you build will deal with unique challenges, foundation layouts, circumstances and random events - like storms, mysterious structures emerging from the ocean, political coups, unexpected newcomers, food shortages, and more," the developers hint. "Learn from your mistakes, unlock new locations on the global map, and embark on the next dangerous adventure once the inevitable calamity comes to destroy the city."</p>
<p>All mock-outrage aside, this sounds brilliant. I'm absurdly bad at Jenga and look forward to making a very short-lived Tower of Babel out of driftwood. All Will Fall is out this year, and you can sign up to a public playtest on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2706020/ALL_WILL_FALL_PhysicsBased_Survival_City_Builder/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>Celeste and Towerfall creators Extremely OK Games have announced the cancellation of their pixelart exploration platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/earthblade">Earthblade</a>, in what studio director Maddy Thorson calls a "huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure". The decision to call it quits follows a bust-up within the development team, though this isn't, apparently, why they pulled the plug. Thorson and programmer Noel Berry have found making something "bigger and better" than Celeste exhausting, and have decided to work on smaller projects in future.</p><!--more-->
<p>Extremely OK <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-developers-next-game-is-called-earthblade">announced Earthblade back in 2021</a> with Celeste composer Lena Raine handling the soundtrack. A proper reveal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-devs-announce-gorgeous-new-platformer-earthblade">followed in 2022</a> with a smidgeon of plot information: the game would have seen you playing a "child of Fate", exploring a ruined planet. In March last year, Thorson <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-creators-next-game-earthblade-wont-be-out-this-year-but-studio-assure-development-is-not-stagnant">blogged about development difficulties</a> but assured readers that the team were making progress. That brings us to today. It sounds like last year has been more complicated than she originally divulged.</p>
<p>Posting on Extremely OK's <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/">website</a>, Thorson writes that a "fracture" formed last year between herself and Berry and co-founder Pedro Medeiros, who was Earthblade's art director and pixel/UI artist for Celeste and Towerfall.</p>
<p>"The conflict centered around a disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste, which we won't be detailing publicly - this was obviously a very difficult and heartbreaking process," she explains. "We eventually reached a resolution, but both parties also agreed in the end that we should go our separate ways. Pedro is now working on his game <a href="https://saint11.art/games/neverway/">Neverway</a>, which you should check out - we've played it and it's very promising."</p><p>Pedro's departure prompted Berry and Thorson to think hard about the status of Earthblade as a whole. "The project had a lot going for it but, frustratingly, it was also not as far along as one would expect after such a protracted development process," Thorson continues. "I do believe that if we soldiered on despite it all, that Earthblade could still be a great game.</p>
<p>"But would it be worth the pain? Noel and I also began to reflect on how the game has felt for us to work on day-to-day, and realized that it has been a struggle for a long time. Sure, working on one project for so long is bound to become a slog, but this feels like a deeper problem. Celeste's success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with Earthblade, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting."</p>
<p>Thorson is careful to spell out that Medeiros is not to blame for all this - his leaving simply created "the clarity to see that we have lost our way". She adds that "if you were excited about Earthblade and angry about its cancelling, Pedro and the Neverway team aren't the enemy and anyone who treats them as such isn't welcome in any EXOK community."</p>
<p>As part of the cancellation, Thorson and Berry have parted ways with the other members of the Earthblade team - that's <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@amora">Amora</a>, <a href="http://kylepulver.com/">Kyle Pulver</a>, <a href="http://ikenfell.com/">Chevy Ray</a>, <a href="https://lena.fyi/">Raine</a> and sound design company <a href="https://powerupaudio.com/">Power-Up Audio</a> - though they hope to collaborate with them again.</p><p>"Noel &amp; I now want to take all of the (many!) lessons we've learned from Earthblade, wipe the slate clean, and refocus ourselves back to smaller-scale projects," Thorson goes on. "We're prototyping again and exploring at our own pace, and trying to rediscover game development in a manner closer to how we approached it at Celeste's or TowerFall's inception." </p>
<p>She concludes that "scaling the core team up post-Celeste has ultimately been a failure, and that's okay. We gave it all we've got, and life goes on. We are happy to return to our roots and reclaim some joy in our creative process, and see where that takes us."</p>
<p>I confess, I still haven't found time to play the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-review">magnificent-sounding</a> Celeste, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-towerfall-ascension">same-screen archery frenzy</a> of Towerfall was an office lunchbreak favourite when I worked at Future London. We'd gather round a monitor and mostly fall victim to our own arrows while hooting like baby elephants. Clearly the people who made that game are geniuses. I wish Extremely OK and the departing Earthblade team members better luck with their future creations.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-much-do-you-think-it-would-cost-to-hire-agent-47.1089522/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/agent-47-hitman-assassin-cost-hire<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hitman</em>'s Agent 47 is the world's premier assassin, a man able to blend in with his surroundings at will, to get within arm's reach of the most secure and often most <em>dangerous </em>people on the planet. For much of his career he's been a man on a mission, but I have recently been wondering how much it would cost to hire him for a single job.</p><p>Me being able to entertain this possibility is canon! At the end of <em>Hitman 3</em> he and Diana essentially go off grid, leaving Providence behind to continue their work together as <a href="https://aftermath.site/hitman-freelancer-the-best-kind-of-hitman-is-more-hitman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freelancers</a>.<a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Which I'm assuming doesn't pay as well as a staff job</a>, but if the gig economy has come for <em>us</em>, then it has come for Agent 47 as well.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like us</a>–and this is one of the only times I can make such a comparison, at least until I get balder–Agent 47 now has to worry about doing his own taxes, quoting for jobs and just generally living the small business hustle. His work pays (presumably) a lot more than ours does, so I’m sure he’ll be fine, but still, the leap from Providence employee to small business owner will be a challenge for him.</p><p>Which also means Agent 47's loss could be our gain. Prior to the events of <em>Hitman 3</em> he only worked in the shadows, the most lethal puppet on a string on the planet, a plaything of the powerful in their struggles against the...also powerful, but slightly more evil. If anyone else<em> </em>needed work done back then we'd have had to hire an assassin out of the phonebook, or Facebook Marketplace, or the dark web, or know a guy who knew a guy, all of which were just as likely to see us end up in prison as the target whacked.</p><p>These days though, Agent 47 is just out there for hire! He could, and presumably <em>would </em>(after repeated quicksaves and reloads, anyway) be able to do any job on the planet provided the pay was right.</p><p>Which leads me to wonder: <em>hypothetically speaking</em>, how much would a contract cost? Would Agent 47 charge per kill? Would he charge according to the complexity of the job? Would he scout out the target and present them with a series of quotes, escalating in cost owing to factors like difficulty and comedic value? Would the prospective clients get a certain number of "body in a storage closet" dumps for free, and exceeding that value would result in a surcharge per body?</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/19bp6yz/how_much_do_you_think_it_costs_to_hire_47/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve seen people ask this before</a>, pointing to contract values from previous games and coming up with ballpark figures. <em>Silent Assassin</em>, released in 2002, has Agent 47 saying his standard rate is $100,000, while 2006’s <em>Blood Money</em> paid between $100,000 and $600,000 per job. That’s a while ago though, and Providence probably took a substantial cut of that, so it doesn’t really help with what his rates would be in 2025, particularly given the inflationary and cost-of-living crisis we’re all currently living through.&nbsp;</p><p>And while<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/uruno4/how_expensive_is_a_hitman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> there are publicly available rates for actual hitmen</a>, I suspect that many of those are based on hitmen who were caught, and who also appear to be at the entry level of this particular market. The mafia hiring a guy to whack another guy outside a deli would not cost the same as a single career professional infiltrating an 18th century mansion, sneaking past 72 guards, hacking a security network and executing a renegade tech mogul.&nbsp;</p><p>So yeah, I have no idea how much it would cost to hire Agent 47! I just wonder sometimes, that's all.

<p>The Shopify Rebellion Game Changers roster, the reigning two-time champions, have made history. The women became the first GC team to qualify for a VALORANT Challengers event, after years of attempts.</p>



<p>The roster core that has dominated the women’s VALORANT scene has finally overcome their greatest obstacle on the path to their ultimate goal: the international VCT leagues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shopify-rebellion-makes-history">Shopify Rebellion Makes History</h2>



<p>While the Shopify Rebellion Game Changers team has dominated the GC circuit, they had always fallen short of advancing past qualifiers into Challengers. For VALORANT teams, the Challengers leagues are the path to the Ascension event, a regional tournament that determines who is promoted to the international VCT leagues.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-game-changers-vct-win/">winning their second Game Changers Championship in December</a>, Shopify were dealt a huge blow when their star Ava “florescent” Eugene signed with VCT EMEA team Apeks. In doing so, flor became the first Game Changers player to compete in VCT, but it left a big hole in the roster for Shopify to fill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just prior to the North American Challengers closed qualifier, Shopify found their replacement in Karnthida “dodonut” Chaisrakeo. In the closed qualifier, Shopify overcame dodonut’s former team, FlyQuest RED, before beating Funhaver to secure the third and final qualifier spot in NA Challengers.</p>







<p>For the Shopify Rebellion organization, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-merges-with-ludwig-and-cr1tikals-esports-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh off their merger with content creator stars Cr1TiKaL and Ludwig’s Moist Esports</a>, they will field two roster in NA Challengers, as their men’s roster returns after competing in the league last year. Organizations are permitted by Riot to field two teams in the same ecosystem, provided one of them is eligible to compete in Game Changers. The Shopify GC roster is the two-time champion of Game Changers, so they should be permitted to compete when the NA Challengers League stage one begins later this month.</p>

The medley of genres in this RPG is surprisingly accessible to players of all types, but there’s no shortage of challenging elements, too! A variety of activities and a vast world lie ahead. It’s up to you to repair what has been destroyed and restore peace.</p><p><strong>A Sprawling Overworld</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Our <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,007 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> takes place in the distant continent of Noahtun, a region rich in land and sea with various seasons.

Find out for yourself by traveling to every corner of the land.</p><p><strong>Puzzles</strong></p><p>Restoration Puzzles are a mission exclusive to the Restorer. By clearing the puzzle, the fragmentation of the land is then eliminated, restoring the land to its former state.</p><p><strong>Map-Crafting</strong></p><p>If the land has not been afflicted with fragmentation, it can be developed to have farmland, buildings, and other facilities so you can harvest crops and various resources. As you develop the land, more resources can be obtained and even stores can be accessed. Once a certain number of facilities have been established and the area is enclosed by fences, walls, or gates, it will become a village or town and you can give it a unique name.</p><p><strong>Battle</strong></p><p>A variety of monsters may appear in the land you explore. They can harm or damage the land they occupy, so be sure to take care of them with the help of your teammates. When battle commences, your teammates will attack automatically. Your role as the Restorer will be to grant <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a> to them throughout the battles duration. Through granting them Mana, the skill sets in their weapons will be charged, eventually allowing them to perform an extra powerful attack.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Long ago…</p><p>Seemingly out of nowhere, the world suddenly began to fall to pieces, fragmenting into cubes. Amidst the disaster many lives were lost, and spawned from this calamity came natural disasters, decimating all land and water.</p><p>The balance of the world was offset, and people’s lives were forever changed.</p><p>The disastrous phenomenon that reduces the land to cubes, what became known as the “fragmentation,” continued to spread throughout the world with no signs of stopping.</p><p>To restore the order of the world, the goddess Chroem selected an individual to fulfill the role of “Restorer,” the one who would restore the lands. They were tasked to journey across the world and rebuild all that had been destroyed.</p><p>The tale of our Restorer, begins now.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Extremely OK Games - the studio behind beloved 2018 platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a> - has announced the cancellation of its "2D explor-action" project Earthblade, calling the news a "huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure".
</p>
<p>
Extremely OK <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-dev-announces-new-game-earthblade-with-vibe-revealing-teaser-art-and-music">unveiled Earthblade back in 2021</a>, sharing some mood-setting teaser art and a musical snippet. A full reveal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-devs-show-first-look-at-earthblade">arrived a year and a half later</a>, offering an early glimpse of a side-scrolling platformer - blending elements of combat and exploration - that would see an "enigmatic child of Fate returning at long last to Earth".
</p>
<p>
At the time, the project was expected to arrive in 2024, but Extremely OK <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-developers-next-game-wont-be-out-this-year">confirmed a delay last March</a>. And while it didn't commit to a new release window, it moved to assure fans progress was not "stagnant" and that the team was "still excited to work on it".

<p>
Today, however, the studio has announced Earthblade is no more. In a <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/">lengthy post shared on the Extremely OK website</a>, studio director Maddy Thorson went into some of the factors leading to the project's cancellation. These include a "disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste" which, as painted in today's announcement, saw Thorson and Noel Berry on one side and studio "founding member" Pedro Medeiros on the other.
</p><p>
Thorson says the issue was eventually resolved following a "very difficult and heartbreaking process", but noted the outcome resulted in Medeiros' departure from the Earthblade project after "both parties... agreed in the end that we should go our separate way".
</p>
<p>
This, in turn, prompted the remaining members of Extremely OK to "take a serious look at whether fighting through to finish Earthblade was the right path forward". And while the project "had a lot going for it", according to Thorson, "it was also not as far along as one would expect after such a protracted development process."
</p>
<p>
"Noel and I also began to reflect on how the game has felt for us to work on day-to-day," Thorson continued, "and realised that it has been a struggle for a long time. Sure, working on one project for so long is bound to become a slog, but this feels like a deeper problem. Celeste's success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with Earthblade, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting."
</p>
<p>
"Pedro isn't to blame for this," Thorson stressed. "In fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief."
</p><p>
With Earthblade officially no more, other members of the team have also "moved on". However, Thorson and Berry now plan to "take all of the (many!) lessons we've learned... wipe the slate clean, and refocus ourselves back to smaller-scale projects." As a result, the duo are "prototyping again and exploring at our own pace, and trying to rediscover game development in a manner closer to how we approached it at Celeste's or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/towerfall">TowerFall</a>'s inception."
</p>

Thorson declined to detail the dispute other than to say that there was a resolution reached and Medeiros parted ways with the team and is now developing a separate game titled Neverway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, this dispute gave Thorson and Berry a chance to examine where they were at with Earthblade and discovered that the project was not coming along the way they had hoped. "Noel and I also began to reflect on how the game has felt for us to work on day-to-day and realized that it has been a struggle for a long time.

One of the main reasons for the cancelation revolved around disagreements over the Celeste IP rights, the details of which the studio has decided not to disclose. While a resolution was reached, founding member Pedro Medeiros parted ways with Earthblade in <a href="https://x.com/saint11/status/1857481536335131092" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">November</a> and is now working on his own game, Neverway.</p><p>Medeiros's departure led Thorson and programmer Noel Berry to reevaluate Earthblade, which was still promising but not as far along considering its long development period.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4432298-image_2025-01-22_165112344.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432298" data-ratio="0.96611445783133" data-width="1328" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4432298-image_2025-01-22_165112344.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432298"></a><figcaption>Thorson left a parting gift for Earthblade: its earliest piece of concept art.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4432298-image_2025-01-22_165112344.png"></figure><p>"Celeste's success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with Earthblade, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting," Thorson explained.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/01/earthblade-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hey everyone, I’ve got some sad news today to ring in 2025. Late last month, Noel and I made the difficult decision to cancel <em>Earthblade</em>. Yes, we are opening the year with a huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure. I want to outline in this post what lead to this decision, and what it means for the future of [Extremely OK Games].</p><p>Before I get into it however, I want to acknowledge that this news will likely come as a shock to fans who have been eagerly anticipating the game. We made this decision in December and felt it best to wait until now to announce it. For us on the inside we’ve had some time to process, grieve, and work toward accepting this, although that process is nonlinear and still ongoing. For those only reading this now who might be emotionally invested in this project, we’re sorry to disappoint you.</p><p><strong>What Happened</strong></p><p>Earlier this year, a fracture began forming in the team. Specifically, this was between us (Noel &amp; I) and Pedro, a founding member of [Extremely OK Games], longtime friend &amp; collaborator, and art director of <em>Earthblade</em> and pixel / user interface artist on <em>Celeste</em> and <em>TowerFall</em>. The conflict centered around a disagreement about the IP rights of <em>Celeste</em>, which we won’t be detailing publicly—this was obviously a very difficult and heartbreaking process. We eventually reached a resolution, but both parties also agreed in the end that we should go our separate ways. Pedro is now working on his game Neverway, which you should check out—we’ve played it and it’s very promising.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Losing Pedro wasn’t the only factor in cancelling the game, but it did prompt us to take a serious look at whether fighting through to finish <em>Earthblade</em> was the right path forward. The project had a lot going for it but, frustratingly, it was also not as far along as one would expect after such a protracted development process. I do believe that if we soldiered on despite it all, that Earthblade could still be a great game.</p><p>But would it be worth the pain? Noel and I also began to reflect on how the game has felt for us to work on day-to-day, and realized that it has been a struggle for a long time. Sure, working on one project for so long is bound to become a slog, but this feels like a deeper problem. <em>Celeste</em>‘s success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with <em>Earthblade</em>, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting. Pedro isn’t to blame for this—in fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief.</p><p>Because this is the internet, I want to be unequivocal here that the decision and responsibility for cancelling <em>Earthblade</em> rests entirely with me and Noel. If you were excited about <em>Earthblade</em> and angry about its cancelling, Pedro and the Neverway team aren’t the enemy and anyone who treats them as such isn’t welcome in any [Extremely OK Games] community.</p><p><strong>What Next</strong></p><p>While this has shaken out other members of the team have moved on as well. Noel &amp; I now want to take all of the (many!) lessons we’ve learned from <em>Earthblade</em>, wipe the slate clean, and refocus ourselves back to smaller-scale projects. We’re prototyping again and exploring at our own pace, and trying to rediscover game development in a manner closer to how we approached it at <em>Celeste</em>‘s or TowerFall’s inception. We still, of course, hope to collaborate with Amora, Kyle, Chevy, Lena, and Power-Up Audio again in the future. Scaling the core team up post-<em>Celeste</em> has ultimately been a failure, and that’s okay. We gave it all we’ve got, and life goes on. We are happy to return to our roots and reclaim some joy in our creative process, and see where that takes us.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>Razer steps into the handheld gaming space with a simple but well-designed dock that will be useful for a variety of devices.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">As the line between handheld and home consoles blurs there's been more of a need--and want--for docks that can bridge the gap between small and big screen gaming. For most people, it's an experience that is familiar thanks to the Switch, but these days it's not a feature exclusive to Nintendo's devices. Everything from beefy hardware like the Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-extreme-gets-200-discount-comes-with-free-travel-case/1100-6524126/" data-ref-id="1100-6524126">Asus ROG Ally</a> to comparatively modestly powered emulation handhelds like Anbernic's various devices are capable of being plugged into a large screen for a more traditional gaming experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Docks, then, are almost essential these days. Beyond functionality, I look for the aesthetic advantage a dock can provide. I like my devices nicely placed and positioned as something that looks good in a room, instead of just hanging out near a power outlet while on charge. With that in mind, my docks of choice have always come from JSAUX, which offers the ability to turn the Steam Deck, Ally, and any other PC-handheld into something that can actually function as a computer. Along with a HDMI out and few USB ports to connect peripherals to, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-Compatible-Ethernet-Charging-Deck-HB0603/dp/B0B7HVZNMB?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">JSAUX docks</a> include an ethernet port, making both working and gaming with good internet stability much more viable.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Handheld-Dock-Chroma-Connectivity-Passthrough/dp/B0DS4GDVW2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer's Handheld Dock Chroma</a> isn't very different from these, despite being more expensive at $80. However, it does address a couple of key issues I always have with docks. The first of these is docks aren't typically very nice to look at and the second being the stability can often be an issue. Razer sent over a dock for testing; I've been using it for about a week and, as a whole, I'm impressed with it as an overall package. It doesn't do anything unique, but it does offer everything you would want and need from a hardware and connectivity standpoint while also being designed in a thoughtful way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432290-razerhandhelddockchroma.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432290" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432290-razerhandhelddockchroma.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432290"></a><figcaption>Razer Handheld Dock Chroma with Steam Deck</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432290-razerhandhelddockchroma.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432291-razer_handheld_dock_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432292-razer_handheld_dock_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432293-razer_handheld_dock_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432294-razer_handheld_dock_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432295-razer_handheld_dock_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432296-razer_handheld_dock_6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4432291,1300-4432292,1300-4432293,1300-4432294,1300-4432295,1300-4432296" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432291-razer_handheld_dock_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432292-razer_handheld_dock_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432293-razer_handheld_dock_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432294-razer_handheld_dock_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432295-razer_handheld_dock_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432296-razer_handheld_dock_6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432291-razer_handheld_dock_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432292-razer_handheld_dock_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432293-razer_handheld_dock_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432294-razer_handheld_dock_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432295-razer_handheld_dock_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432296-razer_handheld_dock_6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">First and foremost, those looking to use the Handheld Dock Chroma as more than just a charging device with HDMI out capabilities will be able to make the most of the three USB 3.2 and/or the USB Type C ports to plug in keyboard, mice, controllers or anything else that's required to make a PC-handheld function as a desktop computer. There's a HDMI port that supports 4K at 60hz for external screens, and a gigabit ethernet port. There's also 100w passthrough for power. Again, it's mostly standard features and available in both JSAUX's docks and Valve's official dock for Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">However, where Razer's dock stands out is the mechanism used to hold devices in place. It's a back plate that covers the rear of most devices and provides good support and prevents any wobbling or tipping. This might sound like a simple thing that isn't really a big deal but, for me, I've always disliked the way the JSAUX and Valve docks I've used don't have a back and rely on how the base is shaped to keep devices in place. These all function perfectly fine for most people who don't really think about it, but I always felt my devices were somewhat precariously placed.</p><p dir="ltr">The back plate design Razer has used gives me much more confidence and, better still, it's adjustable so the angle at which your device is placed can be changed. The backplate can be raised and angled to fit into rubber grooves in the base to lend further stability, but also better accommodate a range of devices. Like other stands, the USB connector that plugs into your device has a goose neck design, so you're limited by how far it can extend, but most gaming devices, phones, and tablets should be able to settle in without issue. I have taken to positioning the back plate at its steepest angle and then placing my ROG Ally X on it for a viewing angle that is much more comfortable on a desk. Adjusting the placement also means that there's a variety of viewing angles available, which is handy if you want people to crowd around a single device for multiplayer (I ain't doing that).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432289-razerhandhelddock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4432289" data-ratio="0.41683501683502" data-width="1485" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432289-razerhandhelddock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4432289"></a><figcaption>Razer Handheld Dock Chroma with Asus ROG Ally</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432289-razerhandhelddock.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When not in use, the back plate can be flattened horizontally to serve as a top surface, giving the dock a box-like form factor that makes it much easier to transport. While most docks are lightweight enough to throw in a bag and take with you, the flat, rectangular design makes it much easier to place in sleeves and pockets in bags without worrying if it's scratching something else or being crushed by other things. It also makes it easier to take out and put in. The aluminium chassis makes it feel lightweight and sturdy, and matte black texturing means it can easily blend into most setups. Of course, there's also a button that you can hit to activate and cycle through RGB lighting options on the bottom of the base. It's worth noting that the package only includes the dock--so it's up to you to provide the power source.</p><p dir="ltr">All that means that the Razer Handheld Dock is a dock that I feel good about having, instead of something that just does the job. It's a versatile, stylish, and sturdy dock that can be used with a variety of devices. It covers its bases by ensuring the hardware has what it needs to leverage the power of your devices for more than just gaming, should you want to, and it's easy to pick-up-and-go with. As previously mentioned, at $80 it's on the higher-end in terms of pricing--the official Steam Deck Dock is $79--but it justifies this with quality that is evident from the moment you take it out of the box.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><em>Disclosure: Razer provided the Handheld Chroma Dock to GameSpot for testing.</em></p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/youtube-inspiration-tab-ai-slop</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/youtube%E2%80%99s-new-ai-is-inspiring-content-creators-to-make-their-videos-boring.1089381/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/youtube-inspiration-tab-ai-slop<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last month, YouTube introduced a new generative AI-powered “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDbJGw_Xzos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inspiration</a>” tab for creators. Like so many other gen AI products foisted on us by our increasingly shameless tech overlords, it has proven to be a solution looking for a problem. To creators producing <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samitsarkar.bsky.social/post/3lgcdhviffs2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">award-winning journalistic work</a>, for example, it has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/doomquasar.bsky.social/post/3lgdxgvtodc2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> absolute bangers like “Ranking the most iconic video game villains” and “Top 5 hidden video game secrets revealed.”</p><p>Before we get into more suggestions YouTubers have shared with Aftermath, I want to point out what I feel is the funniest part of this whole thing: Each YouTube-generated video idea is also rated in terms of potential audience interest. The above two suggestions, given to Polygon’s Simone de Rochefort, are considered “very low interest” and “low interest,” respectively. <em>Most </em>suggestions I’ve come across so far, in fact, have been dubbed total snoozers by the system itself. Why would anybody use this?</p><p>Perhaps YouTube is trying to motivate people to spend time with the Inspiration tab’s “Let’s brainstorm” module, which allows you to suggest a topic to get YouTube’s creativity-corroding juices flowing. You can then click on a video to see an outline, titles, and a spread of AI slop thumbnails. In its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDbJGw_Xzos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> introducing the feature, YouTube noted that you can further refine these suggestions with prompts of your own, like “incorporate humor.” Whose humor? At what pace? To what specific end? Who cares. The robot will add a packet of Humor Powder to your gruel, and you’ll like it.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s grim stuff, especially considering <a href="https://x.com/bcmerchant/status/1882151046606475356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companies like Netflix</a>’s documented interest in bulldozing through concerns like licensing and taste to churn out endless – and endlessly bland – buckets of AI mush. YouTube evidently wants actual creators to function as cogs in that machine, which will eventually replace them if the unimaginative soul voids currently running our world have their way.&nbsp;</p><p>But on the upside, this stuff sucks! A lot! That has been and will remain a massive impediment to generative AI’s widespread adoption, which fills me with hope that the AI bubble is on a one-way collision course with a very big needle. That in mind, let’s have a laugh at its expense.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s the Inspiration tab of YouTube video essayist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JacobGeller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Geller</a>:</p><figure><figcaption>Jacob Geller</figcaption></figure><p>Once again, we’re working with bottom-of-the-barrel ideas like “Games that don’t age well” and “Video games that deserve a sequel,” but I want to give special recognition to “How video games teach us about life,” which is accompanied by this incredible thumbnail:</p><figure><figcaption>Jacob Geller</figcaption></figure><p>Honestly, I’d be more likely to click on a video titled "How viideo qvormes teach us aboul tde" than the original suggestion, so maybe YouTube is onto something here.</p><p>“Fdrogttten NENS GEMS," which YouTube’s AI thought would be up Retronauts co-host <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrIttXi0WgLXHI1poCk0D6g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeremy Parish</a>’s alley, is similarly exceptional:</p><figure><figcaption>Jeremy Parish</figcaption></figure><p>I, too, love the Nintendo Entertainment Nintendo System.</p><p>You will not be surprised to learn that an overarching theme of YouTube’s video ideas is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hmsnofun.bsky.social/post/3lgdzdbvda22o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rehashing what creators have already posted before</a>, down to the title. Except, as per usual, generative AI can’t actually understand anything, so it seems to be playing mix and match with titles and ideas. Take, for example, these masterpieces offered to GameSpot associate editor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thecrawl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brendan Hesse</a>:</p><figure><figcaption>Brendan Hesse</figcaption></figure><p>"I already made basically all these videos, including 'Lunacid vs The Crawl,'” Hesse told Aftermath, "but it wasn't a versus; it was just an interview."</p><p>Indie-focused YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/wanderbots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wander</a> received a selection of ideas that seemed to be based on recent high-performing videos, but again, with little rhyme or reason. This resulted in entirely made-up games like <em>Digseum Artifactor Excavator</em> and <em>Eldritch Museum Entity</em>:</p><figure><figcaption>Wander</figcaption></figure><p>George "Chairman George" Weidman of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bunnyhopshow/featured" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Bunnyhop</a> believes the AI is skimming titles and basically nothing else of substance.</p><p>"I especially like how after making a video essay titled 'The Boisterous Bibliography of <em>Pentiment</em>,' it suggests I make a video titled 'The Boisterous Bibliography of Other Games,'" Weidman told Aftermath. "It doesn't seem to be scraping the YouTuber's script transcriptions or bio pages for topics we might be interested in, just flashy titles and thumbnails. These suggestions are just spitting back out what are the already-existing SEO optimization trends, and it's funny how one of those trends seems to be an aspirationally highbrow appeal that so many Gamer video essays strive for."</p><p>Suggested video outlines are also a trip. YouTube asked games writer and hobbyist YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/cbake76" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Baker</a> to take a walk down memory lane and hark back to all the “iconic” voice acting of <em>Spider-Man</em> games from the days before games really had voice acting:</p><figure><figcaption>Chris Baker</figcaption></figure><p>Baker’s AI-generated thumbnails – one of which seems to depict Spider-Man using his hand like a phone or perhaps Spider-Man yanking his own head off – are also really something:</p><figure><figcaption>Chris Baker</figcaption></figure><p>Are you feeling inspired? I sure am.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition"><h3>In Defense Of Techwear</h3></a><p>It's where form meets function</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to Nvidia, these changes are why the new 5090 fits in two slots on the motherboard compared to the previous three-slot 4090. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But on Wednesday, designer Maddy Thorson announced the project was quietly canceled last month after a fallout between some of the team’s members and the realization that the game’s protracted development had become a real slog. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,196663,196086" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“For us on the inside we’ve had some time to process, grieve, and work toward accepting this, although that process is nonlinear and still ongoing,” Thorson wrote. “For those only reading this now who might be emotionally invested in this project, we’re sorry to disappoint you.”</p><p><em>Earthblade</em> was announced by indie team <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/celeste-devs-announce-next-game-1846714154&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/celeste-devs-announce-next-game-1846714154">Extremely OK Games back in 2021</a></span> and revealed its first gameplay in a trailer at The Game Awards 2022. Originally set to come out as early as 2023, development didn’t progress as quickly as the team had expected. A planned 2024 launch was eventually delayed as well. </p><p>In the cancellation announcement today, Thorson writes of a falling-out with pixel artist Pedro Medeiros, whose visual style defined the aesthetic of the upcoming project, over a dispute related to IP rights for<em> Celeste</em>, the beloved 2018 GOTY contender. “We eventually reached a resolution, but both parties also agreed in the end that we should go our separate ways,” <em>Earthblade</em>’s director wrote. “Pedro is now working on his game <em>Neverway</em>, which you should check out - we’ve played it and it’s very promising.”</p><p>Thorson went on to pull the curtain back some on the latest project’s difficult development. “<em>Celeste</em>’s success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with <em>Earthblade</em>, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting,” Thorson wrote. “Pedro isn’t to blame for this-in fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief.”</p><p>For now, Thorson and <em>Celeste </em>co-creator Noel Berry have gone back to prototyping new potential projects while the rest of the team has moved on. The dream of <em>Earthblade</em> might be dead, but the minds behind it aren’t done making games. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
