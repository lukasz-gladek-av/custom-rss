It looked cool stylistically but may have not been the most ergonomic. But the only real external difference between the two new models appears to be the color and the Xbox icon insignia on the menu button. There don’t seem to be any other flourishes in the body of the device to give it an Xbox vibe.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/eve-vanguard-makes-a-lot-of-big-promises-but-delivers-good-gunplay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's almost surreal to ride a drop pod down to the surface of one of EVE Online's tens of thousands of planets in the upcoming shooter tie-in, EVE Vanguard. I've flown by them hundreds of times in the many years I've been playing the venerable spaceship MMO, but usually at astronomical distances. I always wondered about what was going on down there. I would make up stories about it in my head. Now I have a high-powered space rifle in my hands and I'm experiencing the universe up close and personal. And while it was a very, very build that couldn't show off a lot of the bigger promises, to my disappointment, there are some promising hints already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a quick caveat, the footage you're seeing is still from an early build and a lot of things, including the weapon and enemy models, are not final. CCP just announced that Vanguard will be going into Early Access in Summer 2026, so we've still got a while to wait. Also, the portion we actually got to play was only the session-based shooter maps themselves, and not the career and progression stuff that will be taking place back in space. But I got to talk to the devs about both, so we'll get into a bit of each here.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">EVE Vanguard – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What, exactly, is a Vanguard? Well, like most things in EVE Online, it's some esoteric high concept sci-fi that can seem a little bewildering at first. Your character is a semi-immortal "infomorph" – which is to say a digital human consciousness that lives in cyberspace. I guess you could say you're something like Johnny Silverhand from Cyberpunk 2077. To fight on the front lines of New Eden's many wars, you upload yourself into a powerful war clone, which is purpose-grown from a fresh soup of biological matter for each mission. They're not free, but you can call down a new one in the middle of a mission if the one you're in gets blown up, explaining how you can respawn over and over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a scale from random cannon fodder to Master Chief, the devs said you can think of war clones as not exactly superhuman, but more like the absolute peak of human ability an elite athlete could achieve. They are renowned across the galaxy, and running into another player-controlled Vanguard on a deployment is meant to feel like a mini boss fight.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Suit Up</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Vanguards gather in bastions, which CCP says you could think of almost like The Continental from John Wick. I swear I'm not trying to shoehorn in more Keanu references here. It just happens! It's neutral ground to shop, swap stories, and pick up new contracts, represented by a virtual space where you'll be able to physically walk around and interact with other mercs' avatars. As someone who was devastated when EVE Online removed the ability to walk around in stations, I was particularly pleased to hear this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The really cool thing, though, is that these bastions exist out in the same universe where EVE Online players are zipping around in their spaceships. The initial ones will be NPC-controlled, but it will eventually be possible for players to attack, build, and even own their own bastions. CCP hopes specific bastions might develop a reputation as the place you go if you really need a job done right. And similar to how EVE has "high sec" space where NPC law enforcement protects new players and "low" or "null sec" where players are free to PvP to their heart's content, new Vanguards will also be able to choose where they end up based on how interested they are in fighting other players.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hair Trigger</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest changes in philosophy EVE Vanguard has undergone since its reveal back in 2023 is how the guns themselves are being designed. We're moving away from sleek, understated military sci-fi into what the designers called an homage to the "golden age" of shooters, citing inspirations like Doom, Quake, and Unreal. There is still your standard space rifle, which comes in a few different faction variants. But I also got to play around with an energy shotgun with ricocheting projectiles that can fire in a spread pattern, or a single, massive orb of destruction if you hold down the fire button for a couple seconds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As more of a long-range enjoyer, my favorite was this high-powered sniper rifle that features the ability to hold your breath to line up a perfect shot. While the model is clearly unfinished, the reload animation of swapping out the little focusing crystal is slick and memorable as well. Like in EVE Online, almost everything is gathered and crafted by players, too. Even in a mission, I had to loot some corpses and spend a bit of time with my portable fabricator to top up my ammo. Mining and industry will also be a part of the Vanguard experience. It will even be possible to specialize in it – though the devs warned me that you'll probably want to bring some backup with combat skills if you do.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>For now, EVE Vanguard is still a lot of "wills," "shoulds," and " hope tos." It is playable, and the gunplay feels a bit unpolished still, but satisfying. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You might see me switching weapons with a debug menu in the video at the top of the page, which was just for the demo. Eventually, we'll be picking our loadout from the deck of our own battlebarge ahead of a deployment. This will also let us pick which kind of war clone to spawn, and we were told they will eventually come in all different shapes and sizes for different specializations. Vanguard will also have a bit of separation from the main EVE Online economy. Notably, you don't buy guns and ammo with ISK, which is the main currency for the starship jockeys, since it wouldn't make much sense for a rifle to cost the same as a frigate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There absolutely will be ways for players of both games to work together and benefit one another symbiotically, though. Some materials Vanguards can access planetside might not be abundant in space, for instance. Another example I was given likened it to Star Wars: Rogue One or Return of the Jedi, where an elite ground team might have to take down a shield generator so the fleet above can attack a fortified station.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nightmare Fuel</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The enemies here are also a work-in-progress. Using placeholder models, they spawn in small groups and mostly keep their distance, but I did get caught a couple times by a flanking attack from an unexpected direction. We got to see some concept art of one of the PvE enemy factions, Mordu's Legion, though, and they are extremely unsettling. These cyborg space mercs who have their heart ritually removed as part of their initiation will come in several different ranks, with some being able to direct the others on the battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On any given deployment, you might end up running into these NPCs and other players. These arenas are massive, open-ended, and varied, a combination of procedurally-generated terrain and handcrafted battlegrounds featuring the wreckage of some of EVE's recognizable starships. In this mission, there was debris actively streaking through the atmosphere as we fought, which was a really awesome touch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, EVE Vanguard is still a lot of "wills," "shoulds," and " hope tos." It is playable, and the gunplay feels a bit unpolished still, but satisfying. The environments are impressive, and the weapon designs are diverse and bombastic. It's just hard to get the full picture without actually experiencing how it will tie into the EVE Online shared universe or the social features, which are definitely the most exciting part of the whole idea. For that we'll have to wait until the middle of next year when Early Access warps in, at which point both games will be connected at last.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-updates-shop-to-show-how-much-you-need-to-spend-to-guarantee-pulling-a-character-and-now-players-want-hoyoverse-to-sell-the-characters-directly<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> is one of the most popular gacha games in the world. The free-to-play action RPG from HoYoverse lets players spend a virtual currency called Primogems to have a chance (a “wish”) to obtain rare characters of varying power. It’s a microtransactions system that has proved controversial, but a money-spinner for the developers, generating billions of dollars in revenue over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In most games of this type, the amount of money you have to spend to eventually pull a character is withheld from the player — and you can see why given the poor odds available. But now, HoYoverse has updated Genshin Impact to do just that, revealing front and centre just how much needs to be spent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Genshin Impact shop now tells U.S. players how many pulls you’re getting with each purchase (you can buy wishes directly with a direct conversion rate displayed) and how much you need to spend to guarantee pulling a character, which varies between $1.98 to $475.20. The figure is based on the base prices of the pulls (without bonuses) and if you hit the max pulls to guarantee the character (180 pulls).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, while the posted figure assumes the highest possible price if you intentionally don’t buy the higher value (and more expensive) bundles, you could face spending nearly $500 pulling just one character in Genshin Impact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have reacted with a mix of disbelief and positivity at the transparency.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Whole thing is weirdly.... Transparent,” said redditor Zion-plex. “You see it clear as day, 100 bucks 50 pulls every time staring at you (whales think or maybe don't even care they ‘know’ the math). Man, that'll sting, even for those who can and will spend, there's a lot of mental suppression that goes on.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">”Unmitigated positive,” said Whilyam. “The only people helped by obscuring costs are the ones who want to take advantage of people or make it easier for people with addictions to justify spending money.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it’s harder to justify the spending with abysmal conversion rate visible with your eyes,” added Mtboomerang. “I think the biggest problem with addicts is they follow the emotion then they will calculate. With the conversion rate visible now, their logic will shut their emotion down in time before they are deep in emotion abyss trying to come up with a reason.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Good changes that should be standardized for all Gachas and other similar games with gambling/loot box type mechanics,” said mikethebest1.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players are now calling on HoYoverse to just let Genshin Impact players buy characters directly, given they now know how much it could cost to obtain them through the gacha system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I wish they would just freaking sell the damn characters,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1kgml90/comment/mr0iwzu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said yuusharo</a>. “Horse armor works on me, I’d pay a freak ton on these games if I knew I’d get what I wanted every single time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Instead, the vast majority of their revenue comes from a tiny percentage of players exploiting gambling tendencies, preying on people like vultures. I hate it, I feel so gross whenever I succumb to that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why has HoYoverse added this layer of transparency to Genshin Impact now? It’s because it lost a court case against the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) back in January that resulted in a ban on selling loot boxes</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are wondering why, back in January <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2025/01/ftc-settlement-order-bans-sales-genshin-impact-loot-boxes-kids-under-16-without-their-parents" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HoYoverse reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a> that resulted in increased transparency around parental consent and virtual currency practices within its games. The results are now kicking in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of this, <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155805" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HoYoverse is now required by U.S. law to age verify U.S. player accounts</a>. That's because as part of the FTC's settlement order, sales of Genshin Impact loot boxes to kids under 16 without their parents' consent were banned. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The age verification process will be rolled out to all U.S. players by May 20. If you don’t provide your age information by July 18, 2025, you could see your account suspended, the developer warned. If the verification is not completed by July 20, 2026, the personal information of your HoYoverse account will be deleted permanently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The latest video features Square Enix's Naoki Hamaguchi, director of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy, who confirmed that all three FF7 Remake games will eventually come to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade was included among <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/#1">games coming to Switch 2</a> mentioned during the Direct, but the Creator's Voice video is the first confirmation that all three games--Remake, Rebirth, and the as-yet-unnamed third game--will launch on Nintendo's new console in the future.

"When I first saw the Switch 2, I was intrigued," Hamaguchi says in the video. "I felt it would have enough power to run the FF7 remake series I was creating. That's what convinced me to get involved."</p><p dir="ltr">FF7 Remake Intergrade isn't the only Square Enix game confirmed for Switch, with Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster launching on June 5--the same day as the console itself.

The one effect that was missing however, was the ability to recreate long exposure, a standard feature of high grade cameras that allows you to leave the shutter open and capture an entire range of motion in one image. I hadn't seen this being done in a game engine before, so I wanted to give it my best shot.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/how-avowed-s-qa-team-stomped-out-bugs-by-working-inside-the-design-tools" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Avowed's QA team stomped out bugs by working inside the design tools</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final in-game effect:</span></span></p><p>Image via Matt Newell/Annapurna Interactive.</p><p>Image via Matt Newell/Annapurna Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The approach I made to this was purely based on math. Real cameras don't work in "frames" or "ticks," so the in-engine solution for this would be to sequentially take images over time and compile them on top of one another. Combining all these images would end up being way too bright of course, so I created various methods of adjusting the exposure and appearance until I landed on the right outcome. I’ll try and describe the approach I took in each attempt, what went wrong, and how I found the correct solution.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="First attempt:">First attempt:</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If I were to take images over a long exposure period of one second, I would have 30 images.

The second frame would be divided by 2, the 12th frame would be divided by 12, giving each frame the proper weight.</span></p><p>Image via Matt Newell/Annapurna Interactive.</p><p>Image via Matt Newell/Annapurna Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I then increased the number of captures to 30 frames per second to get an accurate smear without being too taxing on performance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After getting these output shots in-engine, I was thrilled. There's something far more lifelike about an imperfect image, filled with blur and motion, that made these shots feel so real.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>At the end of this month, co-op spin-off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will make its debut. Back in February, developer FromSoftware hosted a network test for the upcoming release, before later revealing some stats which suggested many players actually struggled to finish it.</p>
<p>According to figures shared in March, the final boss Nightreign testers came up against in the cycle - Nightlord Gladius, Beast of Night - was only defeated 58,615 times. To compare, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-players-were-really-struggling-to-complete-the-network-test">the mini bosses strewn across the world were defeated from between 99,000 times to 195,000 times</a>, depending on how often they appeared over the day cycle.</p>
<p>So, what has FromSoft learned from the playtest? Well, speaking with <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/elden-ring-nightreign-interview-reimagined-game-design-anchored-by-in-depth-combat/?sf277193252=1">PlayStation</a>, Nightreign's game director Junya Ishizaki said the team had "received a lot of helpful feedback regarding the difficulty", and as a result has made some adjustments to the final build.</p>
<p>These adjustments will "strike a balance that makes the game challenging as you progress, but still manageable", Ishizaki said. The director added Gladius "will also receive some updates", although he did not elaborate on what exactly these updates will include. These, Ishizaki said, will be something for players to look forward to on Nightreign's release.</p>
<p>Ishizaki added that some of those who took part in the network test "found it difficult to understand what elements were visible on the map, and said it was hard to identify next steps or how to use some of the character movesets". Therefore FromSoft has made some tweaks to the final version of the game, which will ensure this information is presented more clearly.</p>
<p>Nightreign's director additionally said that on the game's release, players will be able to determine a boss's weakness before heading on into the fray.</p>
<p>"So, if poison is effective against an upcoming boss, you may proactively search for and loot items that inflict poison more often in that run.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-has-no-changes-currently-planned-for-raising-the-price-of-its-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While other major publishers across the video game industry are raising the prices of their games, EA currently says it has "<em>no changes</em>" to its pricing strategy.</p>
<p>During its investor call <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-bucks-industry-trend-and-says-it-has-no-plans-to-increase-video-game-prices">yesterday</a>, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">EA reported its fourth quarter earnings</a> and wrap-up report for its 2025 fiscal year, the question of game pricing was brought to EA's executive leadership. At least for now, there's no indication from chief executive officer Andrew Wilson and chief financial officer Stuart Canfield that EA plans to hike its game prices just yet.</p>
<p>"<em>In terms of pricing power, our business is very different than today than it was even just 10 years ago</em>," Wilson began. "<em>In a world where everything we did 10 years ago was about selling shiny discs in plastic boxes in retail shelves, while that's still a part of our business it's a significantly smaller part of our business, and we now have pricing representing everything from free-to-play all the way to Deluxe Editions and beyond.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>At the end of the day, whether we're doing something that costs a dollar, or we're doing something that costs $10, or we're doing something that costs $100, our objective is always delivering incredible quality and exponential value to our player base. And what we've discovered over the course of time is when we can marry quality and value together, our business is strong, resilient and continues to grow.</em>"</p>
<p>Canfield added, "<em>From a games perspective, we have reflected no changes in our current [pricing] strategy at this point</em>."</p>
<p>It's nice to hear from a big publisher like EA that it has no plans to raise prices at the moment, but that doesn't mean a price increase for its games won't happen. Right now, it's an easy win for EA to hold off on raising prices and raise them later when the rest of the industry has done so.</p>
<p>Everyone was worried that Rockstar would be the ones to smash the pricing ceiling with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but it was actually Nintendo to break through first with the price of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Mario Kart World</a>. Microsoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">now followed along</a> and will increase the cost of its games starting this holiday season, and even though PlayStation's next major release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-be-even-better-than-tsushima-says-shuhei-yoshida/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, isn't getting a price increase, it wouldn't be a surprise to see their next first-party title cost an extra $10.</p>
<p>EA might not have any plans right now, but remember this in a year's time. You can bet those plans will have changed by then.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Cough! Splutter! Sneeze! Excuse me, it's mighty dusty in here all of a sudden. Exceedingly dirty alleged leaked images of both the Asus ROG Ally 2 and what could be Microsoft's rumoured "Project Kennan" gaming handheld have burst forth from the tissues of the internet in a shower of dead skin particles and grime.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-2-and-rog-ally-2-xbox-edition-gaming-handhelds-leaked">Videocardz</a>, <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/asus-rog-ally-2-diduga-segera-rilis-di-indonesia-dapat-sertifikat-sdppi-postel/">91mobiles</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-handheld-photos-leak-showing-off-asus-made-project-kennan">Eurogamer</a>, the images originate from the US Federal Communications Commission's official certification testing procedures. Which is why they look like they've been used as attic insulation, yes.</p>
<p>Two handhelds are shown in the images, each sporting prodigiously-sized grips. One has the Xbox logo just visible on a button by the left analog stick. That'll be the Xbox-branded one, then, though both are referred to in documentation as versions of the Rog Ally 2. As <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027">rumoured by Windows Central</a> earlier this year, Microsoft appear to be collaborating with outside parties on their big break into on-the-go vidyagaming.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>FCC / Videocardz</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are no final tech specs, but a quick zoom at each handheld's posterior suggests that the Xbox-branded one will have an AMD eight-core 36W Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor, while the white model comes with an AMD four-core 20W AMD Aerith Plus processor. Each has a seven inch 120Hz screen. You might want to compare and contrast all that with James' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-review-a-nifty-handheld-pc-with-the-best-and-worst-of-windows">review of the original Asus ROG Ally</a>, which he deemed "a viable alternative" to the Steam Deck that trades "some of the ease of use and battery life you get with a Deck" for "a nicer screen, more powerful internals, wider game compatibility, and faster storage".</p>
<p>Care of my <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>-grade forensic scanning equipment, I notice that one of the leaked images also reveals something of the FCC working environment. You can see a small plastic Xmas tree on a filing cabinet in a corner. From this I deduce that either 1) these images were taken around Xmas time, 2) the FCC are pretty loose about tidying up their offices after the holiday season, or 3) the FCC are also road-testing small plastic Xmas trees.</p>
<figure>

<p>It's possible Microsoft will air their Xbox handheld properly at their June showcase during this year's Summer Games Fest. Perhaps they'll take the opportunity to comment on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">recent BDS boycott of their business links with the Israeli military</a>, as well.</p>
<p>Some might find the dustiness of these prototype handhelds a turn-off, but personally, this is how I want all new computers to look - like potent, forgotten relics of a civilization that perished of disease aeons ago, after all the people in charge of basic sanitation got hooked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>. I would watch a lot more Youtube unboxing videos if the unboxing process were akin to carrying out an archaeological dig. Imagine somebody like Marques Brownlee working the soil with a toothbrush for seven hours in order to get at the latest iPhone. You can have that idea for free, Marques.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-confirms-next-battlefield-reveal-will-come-this-summer-still-on-target-for-release-before-gta-6.1183233/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/07/ea-confirms-next-battlefield-reveal-will-come-this-summer-still-on-target-for-release-before-gta-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA’s latest financial report has confirmed their plans for the next <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield">Battlefield</a> game. Having already started <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/03/battlefield-labs-is-a-community-playtest-collab-for-the-next-battlefield/">closed public playtesting</a> earlier this year, the next Battlefield will be revealed this summer. Additionally, the game is still on target for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">a release in fiscal year 26</a>, which ends at the start of April 2026, meaning that it will beat GTA 6 to market – a title that EA was doing their best to avoid.</p>
<p>Andrew Wilson, CEO of Electronic Arts, said, “As we look to the future, we’re confident in our ability to execute across a deep pipeline — beginning this summer with the highly anticipated reveal of Battlefield, a pivotal step in delivering on our next generation of blockbuster entertainment.”</p>


<p>In following statements during a Q&amp;A with investors, Wilson added “Relative to Battlefield, what we have said all along is we’ve been building towards a window that we thought made the most sense for Battlefield, but we wouldn’t launch into a window that we thought truncated the value that we’ve invested into the franchise, or the value that we think our players will derive from it once they jump in and start playing.</p>
<p>“I think now, without going too far, we believe that window is clearer than it was before and we feel very good about launching Battlefield in [financial year] 2026.”</p>
<p>He is, of course, referring to GTA 6 having vacated this fiscal year. Take-Two had repeatedly stated that GTA 6 was on target for a release before the end of 2025, but has now <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">pushed GTA 6’s launch back by around half a year with a 26th May 2026 release date</a>. EA have always stated that the next Battlefield is aiming for a FY26 release, giving them flexibility to avoid GTA 6 if it had launched this year. It’s likely that EA were targeting the end of 2025 to try and snatch the Christmas spending rush, but with leeway to fall back to the following year if it was advantageous, or they could have always had early 2026 in the crosshairs.</p>

<p>The next Battlefield is in development under the collective brand Battlefield Studios, which encapsulates Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios. With the launch of Battlefield Labs playtesting earlier this year, we got a glimpse of actual gameplay from the next Battlefield, featuring a map in the Middle East with modern combined forces as tanks and soldiers battle through the streets. There’s an emphasis on flashy map destruction and degradation, building up to a whole building facade being blown up with an RPG.</p>

It goes on to call the world players will inhabit “lighthearted” and “comedic,” and the overall aesthetic “mythic” and “science-fantasy.” Sounds like it’s aiming to be the kind of vibrant mishmash you’d expect from, say, Blizzard. </p><p>The only thing that really sticks out is the “frog-type” descriptor. The term has been puzzling Bungie fans for years, ever since it was first mentioned in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Bungie/status/1692594057594429472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Bungie/status/1692594057594429472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a hiring post</a></span> back in 2023. TeamLFG was spun out of Bungie last summer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-layoffs-destiny-2-final-shape-marathon-sony-ps5-1851609905&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-layoffs-destiny-2-final-shape-marathon-sony-ps5-1851609905">amid mass layoffs at the studio</a></span> as Sony took more direct control of the company behind <em>Destiny 2</em> which it acquired for an eye-popping $3.6 billion in 2022. Its game was called Project Gummy Bears at the time, and was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-bungie-project-gummy-bears-transferred-to-new-playstation-team&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-bungie-project-gummy-bears-transferred-to-new-playstation-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumored to be a mix of elements</a></span> from MOBAs, platformers, and life sims, combining them into a new sort of online multiplayer experience. </p><p>I have no idea why it’s called “frog-type,” though tight moment-to-moment gamefeel has always been core to Bungie’s DNA and <em>Destiny 2</em> has proven the developers there are masters of first-person traversal, from double jumps and blinking to satisfying booster thrusts and gliding. Maybe teamLFG’s first game will wrap all of that into an MMO-like experience where just hanging out in the world (and spending money in it) is as much a part of the experience as completing objectives. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony has revealed a new developer that's joined PlayStation Studios, originating from Bungie and working on a new team-based action game.</p>
<p>The studio, teamLFG, comprises industry veterans from the Destiny and Halo studio, as well as developers from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, Roblox, and newcomers.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">Bungie laid off 220 staff</a>, representing roughly 17 percent of its workforce. At the time, Bungie CEO Pete Parsons stated one of its early-development projects would be moved to PlayStation Studios to form a new studio.</p>

<p>"The 'LFG' in 'teamLFG' stands for 'Looking For Group'," explains a message from the studio on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/welcome-teamlfg-to-the-playstation-studios-family/?sf277193480=1">PlayStation Blog</a> (as opposed to "let's f**king go"). </p>
<p>"We are driven by a mission to create games where players can find friendship, community, and belonging. We want our players to feel excited when they log on to discover their teammates already hanging out online. We want our players to recognise familiar names and to make myths and memes out of each other. We want our players to love remembering that one time where they pulled off That Play that changed the whole story of the match. As we say on the team - dat's da good stuff."</p>
<p>The studio will make "immersive multiplayer worlds propelled by action games that players can learn, play, and master for countless hours," the message continues, adding player communities will be invited to early access playtests as part of the studio's development process.</p>
<p>"It's critical that we stay nimble enough to react to player feedback, not just in our lead-up to launch, but throughout live service as we continue to grow the game and community for years to come," the studio said.</p>
<p>"Our first game is a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games. Players will inhabit a lighthearted, comedic world set in brand-new, mythic, science-fantasy universe."</p>
<p>Presumably, this game is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-cosy-moba-is-codenamed-gummy-bears-and-features-smash-bros-mechanics-to-target-younger-players">rumoured Gummy Bears that leaked earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>PlayStation has certainly struggled with live-service games in the past couple of years.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, the company aimed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">launch over 10 new live service games</a> by March 2026, as part of a strategy from former Sony exec Jim Ryan.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Concord was a high profile failure</a> for the company, and at the start of this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">two live service projects were cancelled</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-layoffs-at-playstation-following-live-service-cancellations">further layoffs</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">Sony announced it would acquire Bungie</a> in February 2022 for $3.6bn, partly with the intention of it supporting the company's live-service ambitions.</p>
<p>It would appear teamLFG's new project will showcase the results of that acquisition, alongside Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">forthcoming multiplayer shooter Marathon</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/conclave-fandom-is-the-religious-left.1183218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/pope-conclave-memes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The papal conclave starts today, when cardinals <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/how-does-the-conclave-pick-a-new-pope-8-things-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get together</a> in Vatican City to elect the next Pope following Francis’ death in April. On one hand, it’s a very niche event, involving one of the world’s many religious denominations electing its next leader. On the other hand, Catholicism is the <a href="https://www.gordonconwell.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2024/01/Status-of-Global-Christianity-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest</a> Christian denomination; there are <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/262883/worldwide-catholic-population-hits-14-billion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.4 billion Catholics </a>in the world, so there are a lot of people invested in the outcome. Despite this number, I’ve usually thought the conclave was mainly of interest to Catholics–until this year, when it feels like everyone I know is talking about it.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m not naive enough to believe all my friends and internet acquaintances have suddenly joined me in my interest in religion: The hype is surely due to the popularity of the movie <em>Conclave</em>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conclave_(film)#Accolades" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Picture contender</a> that won the Oscar for best adapted screenplay. I saw it <a href="https://aftermath.site/conclave-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early</a> in its New York release because I’m a religion nerd, but I was surprised by how much its wider release grabbed viewers. Then again, it’s essentially a movie about men gossiping, which has given it a fandom, as <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/conclave-hive-assemble-how-this-very-serious-movie-about-catholicism-has-inspired-a-rabid-online-fanbase-this-awards-season-213816622.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yahoo Entertainment</a> notes, akin to <em>Drag Race </em>and <em>Mean Girls</em>. One respondent told the outlet, “This very serious movie about Catholicism, that you would think is very straightforward, is full of messy bitches and vape hits.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="CONCLAVE - Official Trailer [HD] - Only In Theaters October 25" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JX9jasdi3ic?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Conclave</em> has spawned <a href="https://x.com/ClubConcrave" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parody news accounts</a>, <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Conclave%20(2024)/works" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fanfiction</a> I refuse to subject myself to, and a <a href="https://conclavezine.bigcartel.com/product/preorder-digital-conclave-fan-zine-pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan zine</a> benefitting progressive causes. Our colleague Isaiah shared with me a <a href="https://delectatiomorosa.carrd.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visual novel</a> that widens the movie’s world. There are <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/conclave-jokes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jokes</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/billydomineau.bsky.social/post/3lngfsc7vl22g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memes</a> about the conclave, and a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/75-000-people-are-playing-a-fantasy-football-game-where-you-guess-the-new-pope-you-have-to-choose-11-cardinals-the-ones-you-think-are-the-most-papal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fantasy football league</a> to guess who the next Pope might be. At a bar trivia I went to last night, teams had names like “No One Out-Pizzas The Balla,” and there was a whole round dedicated to papal names.</p><p>I’d argue that the office of the Pope already had a global fandom that rivals any pop star in the world, but here you’ve basically got tens of thousands of people stanning an ecclesiastical process, which is essentially an interest so niche even <em>I</em>, a scholar of <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-cults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">niche religions</a>, am surprised. But one of the other things I studied during my time in divinity school was how religion is portrayed in media and popular culture, and through the reaction <em>Conclave</em> has spawned, we see some of the effects that can have. By fictionalizing the process, by showing how a religion that can feel unchanging and inscrutable is also made up of humans and their human concerns, I think <em>Conclave</em> has taken Catholicism down a peg in a <em>good</em> way. It shows how people have the power to shape a faith, for good and bad. There’s been more talk this year of who the real-life papal contenders are than I’ve ever heard among non-Catholics, and I think some of that is down to the way that <em>Conclave</em> skillfully showed the stakes of the conclave in terms of how the next Pope will shape the priorities of the Church. In a time when the gulf between institutions and the rest of us feels wider and more consequential than ever, <em>Conclave</em> turned one of the most powerful institutions in the world into a high school lunch room, and in so doing made the Church, and all our institutions, more relatable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>That there is a somewhat radical bent to the movie’s gender politics has helped <em>Conclave</em> find a broader audience, but that thread has also drawn more attention to those things in the Church and religion at large. It dovetails well with the legacy of Francis, hugely <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/06/nx-s1-5385858/this-priest-has-focused-on-the-lgbtq-community-heres-what-he-thinks-of-the-conclave" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">progressive</a> by Catholic standards even when he <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/transgender-pope-francis-catholic-vatican-b2525400.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fell short</a> of what many of us might like to see. From my experience, religion has always been a <a href="https://www.jackjenkins.me/american-prophets.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">progressive</a> force, but I know that’s not the case for everyone. <em>Conclave</em>’s final twist shows a glimpse of a possible future for the Church—progress not as some incremental compromise but as a total alternative to all the familiar and terrible futures the movie’s other papal candidates can offer. It shows how even something like the Catholic Church can not just be changed by people, but changed radically and instantly. These days, as more of our institutions feel unstoppably <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/05/young-catholic-women-influencers-trump-maga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regressive</a>, as they steamroll actual humans in their pursuit of their own <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2025/april/documents/20250418-via-crucis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ends</a>, <em>Conclave</em> has let people imagine an alternative. We can make up stories about and root for our favorite real-life papal candidates, but through that, in ways big and small, we’re imagining and championing a new future, and we’re believing–even if in a small, jokey way–that this future can come to be.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Conclave</em>, the most conservative candidates have no more ownership over the Church than its most progressive. The movie explores the potential of this fact and puts the future of the Church in anyone’s hands. The memes and fan games can be a reminder that everyday religious people have ownership over their our faiths too, and that all of us have power within the institutions in our lives. We might not be able to influence who the next Pope is going to be (unless you are a member of the conclave illicitly reading this blog on your phone), but we can take this vision to both our religious and secular institutions closer to home.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-iv-max-traffic-speed-tom-walker-finished"><h3>He Did It</h3></a><p>Far and away the biggest Grand Theft Auto-related news of the day</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bob-barker-mic-gameshow-sony-ecm-51-match-game"><h3>Bring Back Those Long-Ass Game Show Mics</h3></a><p>The long microphone used Bob Barker on the Price is Right and Gene Rayburn on Match Game haven't been produced in years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-video/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new look at the Nintendo Switch 2's motherboard and SoC has arrived today, thanks to a new video shared online which also provides some very interesting data.</p>
<p>In a new video shared today, 极客湾Geekerwan provided a new look at a real Nintendo Switch 2 motherboard and SoC, which have been removed from a unit sold on the black market before release, essentially confirming earlier rumors that suggested it was possible to get a unit way ahead of launch for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-units-sold-40000/">exorbitant prices</a>.</p>
<p>Besides showing the Nintendo Switch 2 motherboard, 极客湾Geekerwan also conducted an interesting analysis of the SoC, summarized by ResetERA forums member <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-teardown-video.1183101/post-139626573">R3ndezvous</a>, confirming that it is not only twice as large as the original Tegra X1 20nm SoC - 207mm² vs. 118mm² - but also larger than the RTX 3050 Ti mobile GPU. Tapeout year of the SoC is 2021, as annotated on the die, which also confirms <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/">rumors</a> that suggested the system has been ready for release for a while. Additionally, the chip's process node is not exactly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-8nm-soc-ampere-efficiency-goals/">8nm</a>, and in some respects, it is closer to Samsung's 10nm process.</p>
<p>Regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 GPU, 极客湾Geekerwan highlighted how it's clearly an Ampere architecture design, though it seems closer to the Ada Lovelace architecture, with an unusual layout. The YouTuber also confirmed the GPU's 6 TPC, 2SM/TPC, and 1536 CUDA Cores, a typical design for mid-range and mobile Turing and Ampere architectures. What this means for performance remains to be seen, but it's an interesting fact nonetheless that makes it difficult to predict what the console will deliver based only on PC hardware with similar specs.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide. You can learn more about the system by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">Nathan's preview</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/teamlfg-playstation-studios-ex-bungie</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/teamlfg-is-a-new-playstation-studio-staffed-by-ex-bungie-devs.1183197/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/teamlfg-playstation-studios-ex-bungie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PlayStation Studios has announced the formation of teamLFG, a brand new studio comprising ex-Bungie staffers and "developers from across the industry", and the studio is already hard at work on its first game.</p>

<p>As revealed in a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/welcome-teamlfg-to-the-playstation-studios-family/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, teamLFG "originated at Bungie", but it's now a separate entity that's working on what Sony Interactive head Hermen Hulst describes as "an ambitious incubation project that [he's] very excited about".</p>

<p>Just in case you're wondering, yes, the "LFG" in teamLFG's name stands for "Looking for Group", MMORPG-style. The studio says it's "driven by a mission to create games where players can find friendship, community, and belonging", hence the name.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-teamlfg-playstation-studios.jpg?itok=TGyMDIDC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-teamlfg-playstation-studios.jpg?itok=MSEYX2WM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Staffers at teamLFG have worked on&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>,&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, and other games.</figcaption></figure><p>In the PlayStation Blog announcement, teamLFG says its debut project is "a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games". It'll all take place in a "lighthearted, comedic world".</p>

<p>If that wording sounds familiar to you, it's probably because the exact same project was "announced" by Bungie <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-teases-new-team-based-action-game-set-in-lighthearted-science-fantasy-universe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in August 2023</a>, and it was still classed as an "incubation" project then, too. Looks like the game may still be some way away from being officially revealed.</p>

<p>According to teamLFG, its goal is not only to react to player feedback "in our lead-up to launch" (although it feels a little premature for the studio to say that when the game hasn't even been revealed yet), but also "throughout live service", so it sounds like this'll be yet another live-service experiment for Sony.</p>

<p>It'd be remiss of me not to once again bring up&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>here; the first-person shooter was a hugely costly endeavor for Sony, but it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">closed its doors</a> within just weeks of its launch, resulting in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">closure of its developer</a>. I'm not sure yet another live-service game is the way to go, but hey, I'm not Sony.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marathon-bungie-playstation-studios.jpg?itok=YJSd8EUE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marathon-bungie-playstation-studios.jpg?itok=Br3HrOUx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bungie, from which teamLFG is a spinoff, is currently gearing up for the release of extraction shooter reboot&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The new studio's game will also find itself entering a landscape occupied by Bungie's next major live-service project, extraction shooter reboot&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">due to launch in September</a>.</p>

<p>Whether or not&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>succeeds could well inform whether teamLFG's game manages to see the light of day, or whether it gets canned in a similar manner to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-project-cancellations" rel="nofollow">two Respawn incubation projects</a> which were shut down recently.

A piece for which I received literal death threats, alongside hundreds of more banal insults and wishes for my imminent demise. As someone battle-hardened by Gamergate, it takes quite a bit for the scale of a backlash to take me by surprise, and while I knew it would piss some people off, I didn’t predict the volume. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-origins-tourism-difficulty&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-origins-tourism-difficulty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I wrote an article suggesting that boss fights should be skippable</a></span>.  Imagine my temerity.</p><p>There are so many games I’ve never seen the end of (but for YouTube, I suppose), because I just wasn’t physically capable of completing the later bosses. I’ve never finished a <em>Metroid Prime</em> game, for instance, despite it being one of my all-time favorite gaming series. There are other games I’ve been enjoying so, so much, but just had to abandon because every so often there would be a difficulty spike of such enormous disproportion that eventually I’d lose all will to try. And to be abundantly clear, this isn’t just about my incompetence. There are, obviously, a billion boss fights I’ve successfully completed, but almost none I’ve even vaguely enjoyed. For me (and millions of others), they are mostly tedious obstacles that get in the way of enjoying the rest of the game.</p><p>So, it struck me, why not just let me skip past them? Who loses out? Well, it turns out the answer to that question in 2017 was: <em>very angry people</em>. For reasons never quite comprehensively elucidated, my being able to carry on playing a game I like without finishing a specific fight causes them great personal injury. To skip over a boss is, I was told, both a moral and physical affront, and the addition of such an option would very likely destroy video games, if not all of society.</p><p>And yet, in the month since <em>South of Midnight</em> released, I have yet to witness the collapse of humanity. In fact, I’ve heard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/south-of-midnight-difficulty&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/south-of-midnight-difficulty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only very few people talking about it</a></span>.</p><figure id="" data-id="b850e513344892e86d89249ce619be82" data-recommend-id="image://b850e513344892e86d89249ce619be82" data-format="jpg" data-width="998" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fighting a queen in Metroid Prime, and no, I didn't find this bit too hard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fighting a queen in Metroid Prime, and no, I didn't find this bit too hard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b850e513344892e86d89249ce619be82" data-recommend-id="image://b850e513344892e86d89249ce619be82" data-format="jpg" data-width="998" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fighting a queen in Metroid Prime, and no, I didn't find this bit too hard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is not the very first time a game has offered a way past tough spots. A fair few big-name games have had options to let you skip entire missions should you fail them enough, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2 </em>and <em>Days Gone</em> for instance, while many others will offer to lower the difficulty if you’re flailing. But it’s still vanishingly rare, and <em>South of Midnight</em> is the only instance of specifically being able to skip the bosses that I’m aware of. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/botherer.bsky.social&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/botherer.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Let me know</a></span> of other examples!)</p><p>And it harms no one. Not even <em>that guy</em>, you know, Dave, the one who still unironically says “git gud.” It just lets more people play more games the way they want to.</p><p>But you know what, it used to be <em>commonplace</em>. It was incredibly rare that a game didn’t ship with a suite of hidden cheat codes! You’d find them in the next edition of your favorite gaming magazine, and then type them in to become invincible, or have infinite ammo, and then blitz through the boss that was troubling you. And yet the schools remained open, the supermarkets still had toilet paper on sale, everything was still OK. If anything, not being able to cheat past an impossible boss is the crime against nature.</p><figure id="" data-id="467ec1c843797fd7d49dbda85a1386b4" data-recommend-id="image://467ec1c843797fd7d49dbda85a1386b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel sits cross-legged, looking worried." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hazel sits cross-legged, looking worried." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Dave’s face reading this article.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Compulsion Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="467ec1c843797fd7d49dbda85a1386b4" data-recommend-id="image://467ec1c843797fd7d49dbda85a1386b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel sits cross-legged, looking worried." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m fairly certain this has appeared in <em>South of Midnight</em> as a consideration for accessibility, and that’s wonderful. (It’s worth noting the game even lets you skip combat, although given how dull it is, this seems to fix another issue entirely.) In the last few years, we’ve seen a dramatic change in how AAA games are being made, with the needs of  players put front and center. Few big-name games launch these days without offering a wealth of incredibly specific options, allowing people to tailor games to their specific requirements. Which is all well and good, until you reach a difficulty spike boss fight in which all such amenities seem to get thrown out of the window. Oi, you, be good enough at this bit, no matter your specific situation, or you’re done playing.</p><p>But could <em>South of Midnight</em> be the start of a trend? And no, Dave, I don’t mean I’m demanding that Soulslike games, in which the entire point is mastering the techniques required for all eight trillion bosses, all let me skip over every moment. (I mean, it’d be <em>brilliant</em> if they did! I’d <em>love</em> to explore the Lands Between because that place looks amazing, if not for all the immediate death.) As games superbly copy one another with their accessibility options, could we start to see the boss fight skip button become standard?</p><p>It’s an impossible thing to believe in, because we’re never allowed nice things. The gatekeeping around the topic is about as fierce as anything gets in this hobby, so many Daves horrified that others might enjoy a part of a game for which they have not demonstrated their worth. But I still allow myself a glimmer, to stare through the crack in the wall <em>South of Midnight</em> has offered at the beautiful, sunlit fields beyond.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In February, Nintendo surpassed a $100 billion market valuation for the first time ever, hitting an all-time high of roughly $107 billion on February 19, per <a href="https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/NTDOY/summary/market-cap" rel="nofollow ">FinanceCharts</a>. There have been some notable fluctuations since then. As an example, Nintendo's market cap was $83 billion mere weeks ago on April 23. That date stands out for being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 preorder eve</a> in the US. The system sold out immediately on April 24.</p><p dir="ltr">While $100 billion is nothing to sneeze at, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-becomes-first-company-to-be-worth-3-trillion-heres-how-that-compares-to-other-giants/1100-6499286/">Apple actually became the first company to be worth $3 trillion</a> in 2022. Keep in mind, though, that numbers don't just continue going up like a RPG character's level. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL" rel="nofollow ">CNBC</a> shows that Apple's market cap is currently below that threshold at roughly $2.96 trillion, while Xbox parent <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT" rel="nofollow ">Microsoft</a> has a $3.2 trillion market valuation.</p><p dir="ltr">Switch 2 is set to launch June 5 for $450. Mario Kart World will come out alongside the system <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-reach-staggering-80/1100-6530563/">for $80</a>, sparking spirited debates about the increase in game prices. Microsoft has since announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">select first-party games for Xbox will cost $80 beginning this holiday season</a>.</p>

		<p>Sony has announced the founding of teamLFG, a new studio within PlayStation Studios that’s formed around an incubation project and team that was formerly a part of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bungie">Bungie</a>.</p>
<p>While the team is formed around that core of ex-Bungie developers, PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst explains that it “has also rallied developers from across the industry”.</p>


<p>Furthermore, teamLFG explains a little of what their game will be. Their first title will take inspiration from “fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games. Players will inhabit a lighthearted, comedic world set in brand-new, mythic, science-fantasy universe.”</p>
<p>Here’s teamLFG’s announcement letter:</p>
<p>“Hello, world. It’s a delight to meet you, and we’re very grateful to be joining PlayStation Studios.</p>

<p>Our studio is headquartered in Bellevue, WA, with team members working both on-site and remotely throughout the U.S. and Canada. We are a team composed not just of industry veterans who have shipped titles like Destiny, Halo, League of Legends, Fortnite, Roblox, and Rec Room, but also industry newcomers with fresh creative perspectives and skills. We are passionate about exceptional action-based gameplay, moment-to-moment game feel, and richly social virtual worlds.</p>
<p>The “LFG” in “teamLFG” stands for “Looking For Group.” We are driven by a mission to create games where players can find friendship, community, and belonging. We want our players to feel excited when they log on to discover their teammates already hanging out online. We want our players to recognize familiar names and to make myths and memes out of each other. We want our players to love remembering that one time where they pulled off That Play that changed the whole story of the match. As we say on the team – dat’s da good stuff.</p>
<p>We will make immersive multiplayer worlds propelled by action games that players can learn, play, and master for countless hours. We want to build our games with our communities, inviting players to be a part of our development process through early access playtests. It’s critical that we stay nimble enough to react to player feedback, not just in our lead-up to launch, but throughout live service as we continue to grow the game and community for years to come.</p>
<p>Our first game is a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games. Players will inhabit a lighthearted, comedic world set in brand-new, mythic, science-fantasy universe. We can’t wait to reveal more.</p>
<p>‘Til then, we’ll do our best! Thanks for reading.”</p>
<p>– teamLFG</p>
<p>This new studio branched off from Bungie last August, amidst turmoil at the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer. With Destiny 2 underperforming and a good long time still to go before the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> – now set for release in a few months from now – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">Bungie CEO Pete Parsons enacted a round of layoffs</a> that cut hundreds of jobs and moved even more across to the rest of PlayStation Studios. One Destiny 2 spin-off, codenamed Payback, was cancelled at that time, while a team of around 40 were to form a new studio and continue working on an “incubation project”. That team has now become teamLFG.</p>

			<p>At EVE Fanfest 2025, CCP Games unveiled plenty of news for its popular sci-fi franchise. From the latest EVE Online expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-online-legion-expansion-revealed-out-on-may-27-eve-vanguard-to-get-public-test-on-september-16-ahead-of-summer-2026-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legion</a>, to the launch window of the MMOFPS <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-vanguard-will-bring-the-mmorpgs-legendary-betrayals-to-a-shooter-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard</a> and even the survival-like Frontier, fans were treated to lots of announcements and info dumps.</p>
<p>We were on the show floor, having been invited by CCP, and had the chance to interview CEO Hilmar Veigar Pétursson about all these games to understand what the developer has planned for them.</p>
<p><iframe title="Legion | Expansion Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k1AbLH_uGLw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>It's been more than five years since I spoke with CCP, and that was back at G-Star 2019 in Busan, shortly after Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-to-acquire-eve-onlines-ccp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired the company</a>. Can you talk about that partnership and how the acquisition has been going for you?</strong></p>
<p>It's been going great. We've largely just been doing our own thing. They're doing Black Desert and Crimson Desert and we're doing EVE. They are very nice people. There's a lot to learn from Koreans, who are extremely hardworking. You don't have an appreciation for what it is to be hardworking until you work with Koreans. I think we've learned a lot from each other. We've both been doing MMOs very differently, even if Black Desert and EVE Online are probably so far apart they're starting to be similar on some level. Both are very complicated.</p>
<p><strong>After March's GPU-driven Carbon update, capsuleers reported performance being cut by as much as 50% across Intel and Apple Silicon devices. What steps is CCP Games taking to help assure players that performance will improve alongside the graphic overhauls?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think we're largely dealing with a specific use case involving running multiple clients on the same machine, which is something we're researching. Generally, we're seeing a performance increase across more normal use cases. I think we're making good progress in tracking this down.</p>
<p>For sure, we will update our processes to better account for this multi-boxing use case, which is even sometimes called giga-boxing when you go with about 30 clients running on the same machine. It is something we don't really test properly for, and we should both trace down this and update our processes for that.</p>
<p><strong>Have there ever been any concerns about leaving behind players who haven't upgraded their systems in a number of years?</strong></p>
<p>EVE will turn 22 next week. I think there are computers from 2003 that don't run EVE anymore, which is good. At some point, you have to do that because otherwise it limits how much you can push into the future.</p>
<p><strong>Among corporations, there was The Initiative reset towards the beginning of the year. EVE Online hasn't seen any major conflicts in 2025 beyond a few minor skirmishes here and there. How long do you expect this tentative peace to last before another large scale battle breaks out?</strong></p>
<p>It's very hard for me to comment on EVE politics. You need an EVE political scientist to have any informed views on this, but I would say that at the start of the year, there was quite a lot going on, and generally, that does need some time to settle. Sometimes, wars in EVE Online are a little bit triggered around updates, and obviously, we are planning a major update now, which we're announcing here.</p>
<p>Often, when we do updates like that, it triggers something in the ecosystem. It doesn't always happen, but often it does. I wouldn't be surprised if there's going to be a perking up on the war front over the Summer, but I base that only on decades of observing the meta trends. If you were to base it on something that's actually going on in politics right now, I would talk to Peter Farrell in our community team. He has the finger on the politics.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'With Frontier, we have a unique opportunity to experiment with some violent ideas which are hard to experiment with in EVE, which is a deadly serious business. It's a little less serious right now in Frontier because it's a new game and it's not that serious. It's an Alpha, and we're doing a lot of modifications, so we have a unique opportunity to push pretty aggressively on some things we have been hesitant to do on Eve, and messing with the tick rate is one. Based on how that plays out, for the benefit of doing it and the increased overhead of doing it, then absolutely, once we've proven these things out, we will look into what of this makes sense to bring back to EVE.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-games-announce-new-title-eve-frontier-same-universe-as-eve-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE Frontier</a> has been one of your big showcases lately. Is CCP Games hoping that Frontier could replace online over time, or are there plans to have both titles coexist?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely to coexist. I think we have several examples where things can very happily coexist. I remember many people being concerned when the iPad came out that the MacBook would disappear. I think Apple sold the most MacBooks when the iPad came out.</p>
<p>Generally, it has been a good addition to the ecosystem. I think we've seen things like in World of Warcraft, with modern and Classic, RuneScape Old School, RuneScape, and now <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they have released a new survival game</a>. Lineage one and two are also great examples. We have several examples where many ways to experience an IP have absolutely coexisted and added to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Do you believe both titles are aimed at similar players, or do you think there are enough people in the world to populate both?</strong></p>
<p>We have a group of players who played EVE at some point but are no longer playing, and that group is about 20 million people. You basically have 20 million people who are not returning to EVE, and often, when we survey those 20 million people, they are looking for something new, fresh, and enigmatic to get that experience again.</p>
<p>We are largely calling back on the people who played EVE Online at some point and are currently not playing it. We're absolutely not looking for people to switch. People playing EVE Online today should absolutely continue playing;&nbsp;there's a lot of amazing stuff coming there.</p>
<p>But this group of 20 million people who were interested in the franchise at some point, we're calling those back. I think we can see some examples from when WoW Classic came out, where it was like a big reactivation campaign for the game. We were quite inspired by that.</p>
<p>And then we have this lingering impression around EVE Online that, because it's been going on for over 20 years, it's somehow too late to join. Even if it isn't the case, people have this kind of impression, so launching something where everyone is starting from an even base is a useful thing for us to do to see how that plays out with regards to that impression.</p>
<p><strong>For EVE Frontier, you promise a tick rate four times that of what EVE Online currently features. Could this be implemented back into EVE Online, or would that be unfeasible,&nbsp;given how time dilation plays a major part in battles?</strong></p>
<p>With Frontier, we have a unique opportunity to experiment with some violent ideas that are hard to experiment with in EVE, which is a deadly serious business. It's a little less serious right now in Frontier because it's a new game and it's not that serious. It's an Alpha, and we're doing a lot of modifications, so we have a unique opportunity to push pretty aggressively on some things we have been hesitant to do on Eve, and messing with the tick rate is one.</p>
<p>Based on how that plays out, for the benefit of doing it and the increased overhead of doing it, then absolutely, once we've proven these things out, we will look into what of this makes sense to bring back to EVE. One of the key elements, and we've actually been talking about it here at Fanfest, is that we upgraded Frontier to Python 3. EvVE currently runs on Python 2.7, a 15-year-old version of Python. It was about 1 million lines of C++ code and 4 million lines of Python code, and it took 2 years.</p>
<p>It took 4 weeks to get stable, but now we have achieved that in Frontier. We can now look at streaming that back into EVE, which is another big project. Still, we're doing that project now because we at least know that it can be done, even if there's a huge amount of additional work to bring it back.</p>
<p>I would never describe it as EVE 2. I would rather describe it as EVE 1 than EVE 2. It is weirdly more like EVE 1, and EVE today is more like 2. That's why it's not classic. It would not scratch the same itch as the original. When it came out, because it was so unprecedented, weird, and enigmatic, nobody knew, not even us, where it would go.</p>
<p>I can assure you, everyone who plays Frontier, and there are tens of thousands of people that have done that, they say 'what the actual fuck is going on here?'</p>
<p><strong>Looking at this from the view of an American, this is very much American frontierism, the manifest destiny. It's essentially a brand new frontier that you are going to stake your place in.</strong></p>
<p>It's very much like that. EVE had some of that feeling, but the premise wasn't quite there. It was a bit of a metropolis kind of feeling; now, it's very much a survival kind of feeling. Everything is ruined. It's post-apocalyptic. You need to rebuild a broken world, so we lean heavily on that.</p>

I can assure you, everyone who plays Frontier, and there are tens of thousands of people that have done that, they say 'what the actual fuck is going on here?''</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>It's going to be a learning experience for anyone, whether they're a veteran EVE player or coming in brand new and learning how to play by the new rules in Frontier.</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. And also for us. I think we're surprised at least once a year by stuff that the EVE online community does. The frequency and degree of surprise we witness from the Frontier community is just a lot. There's a certain amount of incredulity on our part when we see what the players get up to, but they also have much more agency to get up to stuff, being able to modify the server.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, you have the building blocks there with the smart assemblies. Being able to essentially modify the servers can be a very interesting concept for players to get into. I think there could be the possibility of manipulation if a corporation allies itself with using the smart assemblies to corner the market on a particular resource, perhaps, but we'll see.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we'll see indeed.</p>
<p><strong>Are there plans for freelance operations to be the main way new EVE Online players acclimate to that title?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Everyone who has watched EVE over these two decades knows we struggle with onboarding new people into the game. The most successful way has always been to use the current social infrastructure to onboard players, so now we're equipping those entities, the corporations, with better tools to recruit people.</p>
<p>This is a way for players to start working for a corporation without formally joining it, which often seems like a big step for people. Some people don't want to join a group without knowing something about them. This is a way to achieve that. We have high hopes that this will be the missing link to catch new players. Lots of people come to EVE Online for the first time every single year.</p>
<p><strong>With the freelance system, what mechanics are in place to prevent players from taking multiple jobs off the board and not completing them?</strong></p>
<p>Wow, you're going quite nitty-gritty.</p>
<p><strong>Griefing is always a concern with online games. It's human nature to kind of bend the rules.</strong></p>
<p>I will trust my design team, particularly the designer who made this, a legendary player in his own right, to have considered that while creating systems that are easy to understand but difficult to abuse. We have trained ourselves quite a bit in this. I don't know what the exact implementation is. He could give you the details about how he thought about that, but I can assure you he's very passionate about this particular system.</p>

He could give you the details about how he thought about that, but I can assure you he's very passionate about this particular system.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you know if multiple players can accept the same job?</strong></p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>I know this is kind of a buzzword that's always tough to bring up, but blockchain technology has unfortunately been tainted with low-effort cash grabs and Web3 games that promise residual wealth and never deliver. What kind of real world applications does Web3 offer CCP Games?</strong></p>
<p>Weirdly enough, when we chose to use a database to make EVE Online, I got similar questions. They were like, databases are slow, they're mostly about banks, and they're boring, and like, why are you using a database to make a game? And I said, well, I'm making a persistent online game and I'm gonna make sure everything is properly stored and it's not going to get lost. Seems like a database is a good implementation.</p>
<p>And then we used the database and nobody thinks much of it today. We don't really sell EVE Online as like, the first database game. It was literally the first database game. Now there's another database, so to speak. And what we like about this database is that you can decentralise the database. We talk a lot about this kind of forever thing, and the centralization of data is a risk factor in anything forever. Anything centralised is more prone to a single point of failure than something that is decentralised.</p>
<p>The Internet itself is very decentralised for fault tolerance, so we like that aspect. Then we like the aspect of the blockchains that have been running now... I mean, let's look at Ethereum. It's been running since 2014, so it's over a decade, and it has open development on top of it in an adversarial framework. So, if somebody develops an application on Ethereum, they are in a way in competition with all the other applications on Ethereum.</p>
<p>So we want it, and it's largely held up technically on that level. We wanted to use that aspect to make a mod platform out of an MMO so that you could mod the server side of an MMO with both reads and writes. Because what we have seen in EVE Online where we have an API where people have built amazing things on top, largely by just reading data (you can actually write a little bit, but we are very careful about allowing writes because it's hard to manage it properly). But we wanted to build a platform where people could mod the server side of an MMO so that everyone could use the mod.</p>
<p>And when you run through the stack of things, that has to be true about any technology that allows for these two things: fault tolerant through decentralization, adversarially sound for economic warfare. Then you eventually end up with something like a blockchain.</p>
<p>I actually made that decentralised computing architecture in the 90s. It was my first gig coming out of university, which was to make a VRML browser in the late 90s in Iceland, actually, and we made a peer-to-peer system. Didn't have the cryptography, and thus we couldn't really make the transaction sound. We wanted to experiment. Can we supercharge the third party development/modding? Can we achieve fault tolerance through decentralization? Those are the reasons we're using it, and so far, so good.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Eventually, blockchain will absolutely be able to replay big EVE battles. There will be a footprint record of the blow-by-blow. You would just actually read the blockchain on your own note. You would just run a note and you could play through the state and make your own visualisation of that.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Many players hear about these legendary EVE Online corporation battles after the fact in news stories and videos. Could blockchain technology record a battle and let players watch a battle play out in real time?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. Eventually, it will absolutely be able to do that. There will be a footprint record of the blow-by-blow. You would just actually read the blockchain on your own note. You would just run a note and you could play through the state and make your own visualisation of that.</p>
<p><strong>For EVE Vanguard, how have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-working-on-new-ue4-powered-fps-for-pc-as-dust-514-is-discontinued/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous failed attempts</a> at making an MMOFPS influenced this new take?</strong></p>
<p>There's a huge stack of stuff to that. I think probably the biggest lesson is that Dust 514 was a very big game. There were a lot of features, there was a lot of gameplay in the game. It was like a huge horizontal slice of a game, and because it was so big, we did not really have the time to make all aspects of it good. Now we're very much focused on that, on every single thing in Vanguard to be very good. All things are around gunplay and experience, moment to moment.</p>
<p>The shooter should just really be a great shooter. It should not lean on a crutch and because it has all these extra things, you can maybe excuse the shooting a little bit. I think that was the fundamental lesson. Another lesson is on the platform. It took a long time to get the performance where wanted on the PlayStation 3, which delayed it at the end of the cycle. The platform of choice now being PC, it's an easy thing to see after the fact. Doing it on a PC, which is our home ground, and making sure that every aspect of the game is rock solid before we start to scale up gameplay.</p>
<p>I think these are the primary points of what to learn from what didn't work out. Then, on the other side, what did work out is that people are still clamoring for Dust to come back, because this experience of playing a part in a grand adventure rather than just being a lobby shooter, nobody has delivered on that since Dust 514. You are taking part in a big, persistent, strategic war that's going to go on for decades.</p>
<p>By the way, I give Sony's massive props. We got waivers for everything under the sun to use our development methods on the PlayStation 3, and I think it actually taught Sony a lot about their own policies from working with us. Dust 514 was the first free-to-play game released on a Sony PlayStation console. There was a lot of trailblazing. Obviously, some of it was good and not all of it was good. We are ensuring we maintain what was good and address what was not.</p>
<p><strong>One of the aspects that I think drew a lot of players in was the promise that what you did in Dust 514 would be carried forward into EVE Online. So, can players expect further integration?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. What you do in Vanguard will echo in EVE forever.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share some examples of what might transfer between the two?</strong></p>
<p>If we think more of a future state, because this will take a while to work into, just like achieving the kind of Guinness World Record fleet fights we have now in EVE, it took a decade for players to organise themselves up until the point of getting thousands of people to fight together.</p>
<p>It's a major logistics, so in the future, we're planning for such logistics to span the solar system and the planets in the solar system to conquer territory in EVE Online. So, to conquer territory, you will have to go planet by planet to conquer the solar system. That means if you were a mercenary corporation in Vanguard, a single shot from one of your soldiers might topple an empire.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The shooter should just really be a great shooter. It should not lean on a crutch and because it has all these extra things, you can maybe excuse the shooting a little bit.

Doing it on a PC, which is our home ground, and making sure that every aspect of the game is rock solid before we start to scale up gameplay.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you feel that comparisons to Vanguard being an extraction shooter are apt, or would you consider it to be something else?</strong></p>
<p>Vanguard will feature a series of game modes. Some might be extraction-like, and some might be different. Right now, I don't know how many game modes we have. There are quite a few we're working on. The second tool that made it into the game wasn't even a gun; it was a mining laser. It speaks volumes that it's more than just about a combat experience.</p>
<p>The victory conditions of each mode will evolve drastically over time, because to play a part in the territorial conquest of EVE Online, you will need several types of commissions that you will need to implement in several game modes.</p>
<p>We don't even really think of them as game modes internally. They're more like a platform for gameplay experiences. It's a sandbox environment, and there are various reasons to enter it and various player motivations or purposes once you're inside it. Some are more combat-oriented, and some will have, as someone says, different victory conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Will corporations from EVE Online play a big part in Vanguard?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. You were talking about the freelance jobs earlier. Imagine some of the freelance jobs being for Vanguards. In the corporations, you'll have a whole suite of jobs you're delegating to all sorts of people all over space and on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>With the skinner system for ships, can you use those same colour palettes in Vanguard?</strong></p>
<p>I think eventually, what works in EVE will be brought to Vanguard and vice-versa, what makes sense, and I think the corporation palettes for sure. I think it will be a smashing success, but we will always base it on what really gets traction and usually what happens is that people start to request that to be brought to another game.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of bringing games elsewhere, has CCP Games considered bringing their PlayStation VR 1 catalog games, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sparc-virtual-sport-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sparc&nbsp;</a>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-valkyrie-project-arena-vr-hands-on-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE Valkyrie</a>, to either the PlayStation VR 2 or the Meta Quest?</strong></p>
<p>We consider this every year, but right now we have our hands full with the games we're making. We just don't have the bandwidth to do with one.</p>
<p>For example, there was a period of time when CCP didn't have an active FPS that the public was aware of. That didn't necessarily mean that our ambitions to have an FPS in EVE had ever gone away. It's the exact same thing with this.</p>
<p>There's always something brewing at CCP, I can assure you.</p>
<p><strong>Who would win 100 new pros or a Titan?</strong></p>
<p>It should be such that 100 new pros can take down a Titan. It should be like that. It is a bit of a design premise of EVE that a bunch of new players should be able to take down any veteran in any circumstance. Whether it is practically like that right now, I think it depends a lot on the new pros. There are probably tactics where it could work, so the new pros would have to know about those. I think that absolutely virgin players off the street might struggle, but if players who really knew the game were to make a new character, they should be able to do it. If it isn't the case, then that is something to look into.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-us-age-verification-to-kick-in-later-this-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced that all US&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>players will soon be required to verify their age if they wish to continue playing the gacha action RPG.</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155805" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on its official website, HoYoverse will require you to go through its age verification process to play <em>Genshin Impact</em>. The process&nbsp;will be rolled out to everyone across the US by May 20th.</p>

<p>You'll need to provide your age information by July 18th. Failure to do so will, according to HoYoverse, result in account suspension and "in-game friends and chat records" being deleted, as well as "no further notifications", since you won't be able to access your account anymore.</p>

<p>This requirement likely comes as a result of <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a decision</a> made by the FTC back in January, wherein the commission found that HoYoverse "violated a children's privacy law and deceived children and other users" about in-game transaction costs and rare prizes in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s gacha system.</p>

<p>The decision required HoYoverse to cease selling "loot boxes" to children under 16 without their parents' consent and also to pay a $20 million fine to "settle FTC charges". It's likely the new age verification process is a direct result of that ruling.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the gacha systems in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</i>are very similar to those found in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, it doesn't seem that the ruling applies to those games; it's likely they'd need to be assessed as their own cases.</p>

It takes you back to the land of Mondstadt, where your adventure began, in order to enjoy an "interlude chapter" before the next story chunk proper gets going.</p>
