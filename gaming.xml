			<p>Unity has shared a new tech demo called Time Ghost that showcases the Unity 6 Engine. It features some stunning visuals and graphics. The demo is just over four minutes long and was championed by the developer team that created their previous tech demos, such as The Blacksmith, Book of the Dead, and The Heretic. This demo highlights their advancements in visual quality and project complexity while utilizing machine learning.</p>
<p><iframe title="Time Ghost" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o1JIK5W3DRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The visual advancements made have allowed for the graphics in Time Ghost to look phenomenal, with the demo leveraging improvements that were made in HDRP (High Definition Render Pipeline), a variety of new lighting options with APVs, Scenario Blending, Smoke Lighting and a strong focus on performance with their GPU Resident Drawer. Those who utilize the engine will use tools like the VFX Graph and Shader Graph, to tailor their graphics to how they want them to look.</p>
<p>Even when there are close-up shots of the clothing, you can see the individual fibers of the cloth, allowing you to tell what kind of fabric it is made out of. The clothing deforms realistically, even in high-motion scenes, such as when the characters are sprinting.</p>
<p>Although the graphics are significantly more realistic, the characters look slightly robotic when running, which could be due to limb placement. While it looked like they were running with their arms out to maintain balance, it just made them look a little bit wonkier instead.</p>
<p>One of the things they focused on with Unity 6 was using Machine Learning to be able to create accurate and realistic cloth deformation. To be able to do that, they used Unity Sentis, where they trained the ML model with 2,000 frames of vertex animation. The accurate deformations happen in 0.8 ms per frame, allowing for the project to maintain that high visual fidelity.</p>
<p>Unity 6 has a lot of new features that are showcased in the Time Ghost tech demo, including the improved hair system. With close-ups on the character, you can see the high-density, real-time simulated hair. This feature was originally used in <a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-engine-stunning-enemies-tech-demo-download/">Enemies</a>, and the system used to create hair has been upgraded significantly, allowing for seamless rendering LOD, automatic LOD generation and volumetric wind to create a realistic and functioning hair system that has the correct physics depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Unity has<a href="https://unity.com/demos/time-ghost" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted a blog post</a> that details the new engine and what people can expect when using it. There are a ton of new features, including a new and improved VFX collision system that allows for more stable and robust enhanced collisions.</p>
<p>The Unity 6 Engine will be released on October 17.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pc-players-psn-ragnarok-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pc-players-are-complaining-again-about-ragnarok%E2%80%99s-psn-requirement.987294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pc-players-psn-ragnarok-steam/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>God of War Ragnarok was released on Steam just yesterday, and it has already pulled in more than 2,000 reviews on the platform, 45% of which are <strong>negative</strong>. Most of the complaints stem from the requirement for users to connect a PlayStation Network account to their profile to play the game, which isn’t a new concept for PS games making it over to PC.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Helldivers 2 became the target of a monumental hate campaign after it was revealed that users would need a PSN account to play it on PC — that was one of the most severe examples of this newfound concept.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-complaining-just-to-complain">Complaining Just To Complain</h2>



<p>It had been made clear that PC gamers would need to link a PSN account to play the single-player Santa Monica game for a while, but that hasn’t stopped players from complaining about it. It’s one of a few games to be released on PC with the requirement of late, but hundreds of people are still taking to Steam to throw out a negative review with that as the basis.</p>



<p>People have referenced Sony’s past data breaches, stressing that they don’t want to hand over their personal information to the company just to play God of War Ragnarok – but in most cases, they’re <strong>doing it anyway</strong>.</p>



<p>The main drawback is that PSN isn’t available in many countries worldwide. That means that these countries are also locked out of playing God of War Ragnarok on PC. </p>



<p>Even amid hundreds of thousands of negative reviews on games, Sony won’t relent on this requirement, which means PC gamers are going to have to just like it or lump it.</p>



<p>Is the PSN requirement blocking you from playing God of War Ragnarok on PC? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

If you're happy with that, go right ahead.”</p><p>“Yeah I'm not linking my account to PSN especially for a single-player game,” reads another negative Steam user review, which also includes a list of Sony data breaches.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Sony’s PSN account requirement for its PC games was thrust into the limelight with the release of Arrowhead’s explosive PC and PS5 co-op shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> earlier this year. Helldivers 2 suffered a review bomb campaign on Steam after Sony made PSN accounts mandatory for PC gamers on Valve’s platform (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-psn-review-bomb-cape-mia-as-arrowhead-awaits-clarity-on-game-being-sold-in-more-countries">Arrowhead subsequently decided to turn the user review history graph into a cape, which is ready for launch but has yet to release</a>).</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reverses-course-on-helldivers-2-psn-account-requirement"><u>Sony eventually backed down and reversed Helldivers 2’s PSN account requirement</u></a>, but the game remains unavailable in the many countries that lack PSN. And indeed all Sony’s games on PC now suffer from this problem, which means God of War Ragnarök is unavailable on PC in over 100 countries.</p><p>It seems unlikely that Sony will change its mind again for God of War Ragnarök, which means the game may have to live with its ‘mixed’ Steam user review rating for some time. As for how popular God of War Ragnarök is on PC, Steam's official concurrent figures show 25,471 playing at the time of this article's publication. That's down significantly on the PC launch of God of War, which saw a peak of 73,529 players on Valve's platform.</p><p>God of War Ragnarök continues the stories of Kratos and his now teenage soon, Atreus. The sequel was praised as an enthralling spectacle on its release, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">earning a 10 in IGN's review</a>.</p><p>"Impeccable writing, pitch-perfect performances, knockout action – it’s a complete work of art from top to bottom. Reflecting its core themes, it's everything a sequel should be: respectful of its legendary lineage, but not afraid to take it to exciting new places," we wrote at the time. "God of War Ragnarok is an almighty achievement and creates a new high that makes many of its peers look positively mortal by comparison."</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Ellis said that "while many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended."</p><p>Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history.

			<p>New details for Slitterhead were revealed today, alongside new screenshots that provide a new look at some of the game's characters, skills and the Kowlong Slums stage.</p>
<p>In the game developed by <a href="https://bokehgamestudio.co.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bokeh Game Studio</a>, a new development studio founded by the creator of the Silent Hill and Siren series Keiichiro Toyama, players will get to encounter special characters like Julee and Alex, known as Rarities, who have a strong synchronization with protagonist Hyoki and grant access to a variety of skills, including Rarity Skills, whose effects are become active by just having them, and Active Skills which are activated by using the skill button and can be carried over even when possessing ordinary humans.</p>
<p>Besides showing more of the Rarities and skills, Bokeh Game Studio also shared a new look at one of the Slitterhead's stages, the Kowlong Slums. This gigantic slum is slated for demolition, and its residents are forced to leave. Many, however, refuse to do so, making it the perfect location for the horrors upon which the experience is focused.</p>

The score, composed by Wilbert Roget, II, is absolutely filled with pomp. Everything is here, from the main theme that I’ve grown used to hearing while my screen idles to tracks that play while you’re fighting against either the Terminids or Automatons, <em>Helldivers</em>’ enemy forces.<br></p><p>Listening through the soundtrack has been a great reminder of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-community-humor-1851282592&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-community-humor-1851282592">how essential <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s score is to the fantasy it’s successfully portrayed</a></span> since it was released this February. For example, I’ve always taken for granted how lowkey and tech-y the music in your starship is, which feels like the right call for an area that gradually gets upgraded and fleshed out as you advance through the ranks and unlock new stratagems, buffs, and weapons. It stands in stark contrast to the triumphant music that plays as you jump into a pod and are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-malevelon-creek-liberated-1851379768&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-malevelon-creek-liberated-1851379768">dropped onto the surface of a planet as part of a “liberation” effort</a></span>. The score is great at instilling a false sense of pride—which is perfectly in-line with the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272"><em>Starship Troopers </em>influence</a></span>—as you take on hellish missions in the name of a clearly fascist regime and get ragdolled and eviscerated over and over again by enemies.</p><p>Though, I’d like to bring particular attention to the track titled “Super-Earth National Anthem” because why the hell is it so good? I’ve played <em>Helldivers 2 </em>quite a bit, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332">covered it even more than that</a></span>, but I had never heard this thing until today, despite evidence suggesting players found it in-game a long time ago. Here’s just a sample of the batshit propaganda Super-Earth passes for an anthem:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Freedom must reign over every last star, through citizen’s blood spilled in our righteous wars / Honor their deaths, do your part for the cause</p><p>Steadfast support of our regime is how humankind will reign supreme / No questions or doubts shall be allowed, tractors will all be disavowed”</p></blockquote><p>Now imagine that being sung by a beaming choir. Or worse, picture kids singing that every morning before class, or at their graduation ceremonies. I’m no fan of the American national anthem, but at least we aren’t made to explicitly sing about “citizen’s blood spilled in our righteous wars.” I need a documentary about life in the Super-Earth colonies immediately, this is truly horrifying stuff. On the bright side, you can now air music like this from your car every Fourth of July if you so choose. Ain’t democracy grand?<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-ceo-on-why-the-callisto-protocol-struggled/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Callisto Protocol struggled because it didn’t have a “gameplay edge”. That’s what Changhan “CH” Kim, CEO of the game’s publisher Krafton” said in a recent interview.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-ceo-says-the-callisto-protocol-suffered-because-it-lacked-a-gameplay-edge-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Kim talked about The Callisto Protocol being the first AAA single-player game from the studio and developer Striking Distance. He said that there was some “difficulty” within as to deciding whether the direction they were going in was the right way.</p>



<p>“This is a single-player narrative game [that’s] visually stunning and a high-quality game to look at,” he said. “Despite that, the game’s core is the gameplay. Gameplay comes first is what I learned with&nbsp;The Callisto Protocol. </p>



<p>“It could be the most high-quality game in the world, but if you don’t have a gameplay edge–if you can’t differentiate your gameplay from your competitors–it doesn’t work out. I was able to reaffirm that.”</p>



<p>He then told Game Developer that he understands that gameplay has to innovate with games in order for players to have interest. A new experience is what will help a game’s success.</p>



<p>“This allows for new experiences within the game, and even though [The Callisto Protocol] is a narrative game, a single-player game, you need to be able to offer a good gameplay experience,” Kim said. “You can’t do that without those elements.”</p>



<p>As far as moving forward, Kim says that the market is tough to guess what could work and what may not. Still, Krafton and the developers it works with will “continuously try these new creative ideas”.</p>



<p>“Not everything will succeed, but one of these days we might just hit another PUBG,” he said. “This is a very bottom-up approach, I would say, and it’s not what a lot of big companies are attempting right now.”</p>



<p>Do you agree with the reasoning behind the struggles of The Callisto Protocol when it launched in 2022? Let us know in the comments, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/group-photo-the-editors-of-game-developer-discuss-their-favorite-game-photos<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>For Photography Week, Game Developer has showcased new interviews, essays, and deep dives demonstrating the creative and technical process behind photography games and photo modes. In this group blog, join us as our editors ruminate on the photos and photo modes they love and explore their evolution and their value within the medium.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s so funny how it doesn’t matter if you’re a traditional photographer, or just like taking a lot of screenshots in video games—looking back at your early work is always so humbling. I recall taking these photos (including the header of this article) in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and being proud of them. So proud, in fact, that I hung on to them for years. It wasn’t actually that hard to find them, only one external storage device deep on my PC, 14 years and at least four hard drives later.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The Western Sky mod for Fallout: New Vegas deeply altered the day and night cycle, rendering certain hours of the day pitch black, both a strategic and photographic opportunity.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I remember that taking photos in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was as much about enjoying the scenery as it was spending more time in the game. I didn’t actually like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at first; it wasn’t as dark as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and I wasn’t fond of how its cool greens and grays were replaced by the bright orange palette of the Mojave. A Nexus mod, Western Sky, actually changed my mind, adding dynamic lighting and weather effects that turned the environment hostile but also strangely beautiful, with pitch-black nights and intense blue skies and rad storms that would pummel the Courier into the sand.&nbsp;The mod not only had the effect of making the game more strategically interesting, but visually as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was the early Bethesda Fallout games that gave me the training wheels to move onto “real” photography; back then you’d use the console commands to quickly detach the camera and remove clipping, and with that, capture moments from the game at more dynamic angles. While not exactly as sophisticated of the photo modes today, or heck, even the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bethesda</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> photo modes of today, it’s an experience I remember fondly for how much it did teach me about the basics. Take away the ability to consider fundamental things like depth of field and you’re left no option but to be in the moment and take in every detail within a tiny field of view that occupies that microscopic sliver of time. That it’s in a video game doesn’t make at any less an exercise in observation.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That observation process can offer a lot of solitude and contemplation. It demands rumination and self-reflection even as it commands you be present to the exclusion of everything else. Maybe that’s why taking photos in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> felt so good. Documenting the journey of the Courier as they crossed so much desert on foot and encountered so much uncertainty and decay and emptiness became a mirror not just of their loneliness and isolation but also my own.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These days I still take the occasional snap in Fallout. F</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>allout 76</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has a dedicated photo mode that combines traditional camera and photo editing features, letting you control depth of field, field of view, and lighting, and add player poses or picture frames. Unlike </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it’s also easy to get more variety in your shots, as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>76</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is comprised of regional environments with dramatically different enemies, plants, weather and lighting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But the improvements haven’t resulted in me taking more photos, despite how easy it would be to create my own scene with the game’s workshop tools. Maybe it’s just harder to find a moment of contemplation in a crowded live service game with so many random people looking over your shoulder.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, it’s nice to remember how mods and PC console commands paved the way. —Holly Green</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've recently fallen all the way down into a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-shaped Abyss. While I've been excited about the game ever since its launch last year, I never put much time into it until the last couple of weeks—and knowing photo week was coming up gave me the perfect excuse to dive in fully.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I love the game—its compelling core loop of fishing, exploring, building your boat up to get better at all of the above (spiced with dodging unfathomable horrors), its slow burn Eldritch horror story and impeccable, salty vibes. It's also often a weirdly beautiful game despite its subject matter and increasingly horrific sea life. There's an aching loneliness to the player's journey that is constantly pierced by the ambient (not-mutated) critters splashing about: sea turtles shimmering in pairs, dolphins bounding playfully, whales surfacing briefly, subjecting you to a tiny little touch of majesty every now and then.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It works in conjunction with the sky, the sea, the rough hewn little bits or architecture that people have eked out in this nightmare world. Your little boat, always a bit cartoonish and never a match for anything that lurks in the deep—but you keep going anyway. And every now and then, you get treated to a view like this one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It all seems to say sure, you're just a tiny speck in this terrifying, unknowable ocean. And on top of nature's indifference, there are creatures in the deep waiting to get at you, for harboring some of that forbidden knowledge humans should never have. But at least you aren't alone out there in infinity. Some beauty still remains. —Danielle Riendeau</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Photography is a beautiful lie. Every photo you've ever seen isn't a snapshot of reality, it's light channeled through a lens, slapped onto a sensor or strip of film, and processed before becoming the image you see in the real world. That image is shaped by the aperture of the lens, the speed that the shutter clicks, and the "stock" of the medium the light lands on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I love that lie. In-game photography tools make it so easy to easy play with, and it brings players close to the little lies that make games possible. When you freeze the world and muck around with artificial camera settings, you catch things developers don't want to be seen. But instead of killing the fantasy, it invites you to play with the lie yourself—especially when posing a character. I love juking the controls before smashing the "photo mode" button to move a character into the right pose, using an in-between frame to turn a simple transitional motion into a bit of storytelling that captures the "vibe" of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I call it a "lie," like it's a bad thing, but everyone knows a games are full of lies. Photo modes bring players in on the lie, and remind us these lies aren't meant to harm, but to help us speak in a language that goes beyond words. And I just think that's kind of neat. —Bryant Francis</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Authors</h2><div><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Community Editorial Coordinator, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Holly Green has been in games media for fifteen years, having previously worked as a reporter and critic at a variety of outlets.
