<p>SEGA capped off the test period by sharing that a free demo will be heading our way at some point in mid-September, with "more info coming soon".</p>
<p>Details are still pretty slim, but the company could reveal that the demo will be an "offline single-player experience only", so don't expect to be speeding around the track with your pals again before launch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zrvigm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>And that launch is really rather close. CrossWorlds is set to arrive on Switch 1 on <strong>25th September</strong>, with the Switch 2 version following at a later date in 2025. We have to assume that the demo will arrive at least a week before launch to give people adequate time to try before they buy, so keep an eye out for more details in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, CrossWorlds is already racking up an impressive roster of crossover racers, with even more to come. Across the game's DLC and future upgrades, the likes of SpongeBob SquarePants, Pac-Man, Persona 5's Joker and more will be joining Sonic and co. on the track — just don't expect them to be all that chatty...</p>

<p>Graham Greene lit up screens throughout a glittering 45-year career. The acclaimed actor did it all and has sadly passed away at the age of 73. Many gamers will fondly recognize and remember him for his incredible portrayal of Rains Fall in Rockstar Games’ Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>



<p>My first memory of Graham Greene was his role as Detective Joe Lambert in Die Hard with a Vengeance. He plays a valiant cop who ultimately tries his best to save kids he believes are in mortal danger. This is one of countless roles Graham accrued over his 40-plus-year career before his untimely passing on September 1.</p>



<p>Despite a resume anyone would snatch up in a heartbeat, Graham only had one video game role—Rains Fall in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-could-launch-on-switch-2-this-year-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2-voice-actor-graham-greene-passes-away-aged-73">Red Dead Redemption 2 Voice Actor Graham Greene Passes Away Aged 73</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It will make future RDR2 playthroughs harder. Credit to YouTube channel: <br>I’ll Give You Insight</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’ve played <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RDR2</a>, you know how important Rains Fall is to the story. He does his best to rein in his son—Eagle Flies—and advocates peace wherever possible.</p>



<p>Graham absolutely nails the role perfectly. It’s a wonder that this was his lone video game opportunity when you think about it. Technically, it wasn’t the only gaming project the actor was attached to.</p>



<p>In 2023, Graham played Marlon in HBO’s epic adaptation of Naughty Dog’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-receives-fewer-emmy-nominations-than-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a> for one episode. He was also in 2008’s Turok: Son of Stone—but that reference is a bit more out there.</p>



<p>The actor graced TV shows, movies, and one of the greatest video games of all time, and it’s his role as Rains Fall that further cemented his legacy in the memories of millions of gamers.</p>



<p>Do you have a favorite Graham Greene role over the decades? Let me know, and also let us know if this is giving you the edge to go back and play Red Dead Redemption 2 for the tenth time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The horror shooter vibes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-spectrum">Project Spectrum</a> are absolutely on point as you trudge through dank, foggy, muddy woods on the approach to a decrepit manor. Strange anomalies float in midair in the courtyard, distorting and colouring the air around them, when something fast flashes across the rooftop. Yeah, probably time to set a shovel on fire, just in case.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Spectrum | Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o4cso5zprZk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The world has been transformed by the appearance of Embers in a region that has subsequently been quarantined in what is known as the Ember Zone. Those who exist in this region can become transformed by Emberflux, altering their bodies and minds, but you have to gather a group of Agents and then send them in to try and neutralise the threat regardless. On the surface level, this game looks like a horror-infused extraction shooter, but Vice Game Director Rich Fu explains a different path that Project Spectrum is taking:</p>


<p>“We are different from the traditional extraction shooter, we are more like a CRPG [for progression]. One thing that we might think about is that, for instance, the characters or agents that you’re recruiting [and play as] in the game, if that character dies, they might just die! We wanted to be different from the traditional extraction shooter, like Tarkov, in terms of when you are searching for materials in the game and stuff like that.”</p>


<p>Project Spectrum is not a game that you’ll play alone, though, heading in as a squad, exploring this manor and trying to defeat the supernatural monsters you’ll find within. The atmosphere that Project Spectrum conjures up here is there with the very best, with creepy off-angle lighting such that you’ll need your flashlight or lighter, music randomly playing on a gramophone, and rooms where you can practically smell the musty rotting wood from the ruined decor. You might be playing together, but that doesn’t make it feel any less creepy, especially if you choose to split up.</p>
<p>The gameplay demo we saw took us to one of three points of interest in a wider world –&nbsp;alongside the manor, a fishery and a hospital were also options –&nbsp;but the full game will have a larger map to explore. Players will be turning up rather well equipped with modern guns, tactical gear and equipment to spot and track the anomalies –&nbsp;a camera that can highlight their location through walls and scenery –&nbsp;and there’s an emphasis to approaching quietly through the gameplay we’ve seen so far. This goes right down to trying to avoid crunching across broken glass, and hastily improvising a silencer with the crafting system, though I’m not sure what use a drinks can stuffed with cloth would actually be in reality. When it’s time to go loud, crafting molotov cocktails and the aforementioned fire shovel are also options.</p>

<p>And going loud can become a very quick necessity. I’ve buried the lede somewhat, as this isn’t even just a co-op horror game, but rather has PvPvE layered in as well. Other teams of players can be hunting the same anomaly, or looking to wait and attack you while you’re distracted or wounded, and this is another big reason for the cautious and quieter approach, as well as placing trip wires and other traps to prevent getting caught from behind while investigating.</p>
<p>Human combat will have a familiar tactical battle feel of many contemporary online shooters, but fighting the Emberborne monsters will rip you straight back to the horror shooter tone. As seen in the trailer, the towering, cloaked creature, seemingly made up of many masks can quickly shift around the environment, forcing you to spin and figure out where they are again, following the refracted light trails they leave while moving so quickly. Worse than that, as you deal damage, they can crumble down into basically a giant pile of masks with spider legs that splits and skitters around – a damage opportunity for your team, but also horrifying to the arachnophobic. Finally, we see the flaming spade set alight to swing at this enemy, which definitely does not like fire one bit.</p>

<p>All through this, your character’s sanity is being tested and drained, simply by existing in this tortured, twisted region. First by the depressing effect of trudging through the rainy woods to reach the manor, then by the dark and creepy environment, and then by facing the Emberborne themselves. Low sanity can lead to very obvious negatives, hallucinating shadowy enemies that can obscure and confound your view of the game.</p>
<p>But it’s not always bad, as Rich tells us, “Let’s talk about the disadvantages first. For the sanity level and its effect, there is a term in the game that we call Emberflux, and this means that human beings are being affected by the Ember. For the debuff, you can have a lot of illusions, but once you reach a certain level you might even see the perspective from other entities…. but I cannot tell you more than that for now!</p>
<p>“Then for the advantages, we have different characters with different abilities for how they are living with the sanity level, especially when it is low. For instance, some characters might get some new abilities, or their abilities might be stronger when the sanity level is low. And for another perspective, there’s the map exploration. You will only get to see some things when your sanity level is low, which could be a shortcut, certain rooms, certain areas, views or visuals which will help you to explore.</p>
<p>“But the key idea here for us is that we want to let the players choose whether they want to maintain a high level of sanity or low. They can take some risks to experience a different style of gameplay, or they can just make it safe.”</p>
<p>With the anomaly and an opposing team defeated, you’d think that’s job done, but there’s a further layer to this PvPvE game: the Executioner. This is another Ember-infused monster, a blob with smokey tendrils that it walks on in an alien fashion, but instead of being another Emberborne, this is another player that’s on the hunt. It’s an injection of the kinds of asynchronous multiplayer horror from the likes of Dead by Daylight, or perhaps more accurately Evolve.</p>

<p>Switching to the Executioner’s view, and their power is immediately clear to see with great traversal possibilities, climbing up to rooftops, blinking to new locations, and trying to use hit and run tactics. Of course, you can still be defeated, but it’s a fun twist to have yet another wildcard like this in the game. The curious element that’s yet to truly be revealed is how you become an Executioner. Is this a distinct character that you queue up to play as? Is it a sanity-driven transformation that you can aim to unlock mid-game? Surely you won’t have any allegiances to former teammates in that case…</p>
<p>This won’t be the only style of player monster that is in the game, though. Rich told us, “For the current Executioner, it’s only one of its forms. it also has other formats, and of course, we will have other Executioners added in the future, because we really consider this asymmetric gameplay a very important part of the game, so it has to be globally anticipated, so that is why we put a lot of effort on this.”</p>
<p>Project Spectrum is a fascinating blend of genres and ideas that has echoes of Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown and more, but by injecting sanity effects and abilities, giving players the chance to be the monster for asymmetrical battles, it’s creating something new and distinctive.</p>

            <p>It's been a little while since we got another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> tease that makes folks wonder whether CD Projekt are about to u-turn on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">adding more stuff to it</a> yet again. Here one is, though, and it invites us 2025 dwellers to help out a president who isn't elected in-universe until 2065.</p>
<p>Is it evidence that the NUSA have invented time travel tech that also allows Cyberpunk characters to migrate into our own reality? Is it just a way to spice up some promo for something like a livestream or minor reveal? I mean, almost definitely the latter, but the former's a lot more fun to consider.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, the tease. NUSA president Rosalind Myers, the one from Cyberpunk's Phantom Liberty expansion, needs "brave netrunners" to help her nation overcome a "mounting cybersecurity threat". The plea's dated September 4th, 2025, which is in the future, but not quite far enough into the future to match up with Myers' in-game presidential term. That kicks off in 2065, which is why she's still in power by the time V meets her in 2077.</p>
<p>What's president Roz doing teasing things dated about 40 years before she takes office, that're also happening in a different universe? Are Arasaka about to take over the official Witcher socials to post their own messages to us, inciting a seven hundredth corporate Twitter war? Are Kang Tao about to reveal they're behind the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">mysterious Project Hadar</a>? As I say, probably not. If this is anything, the netrunner "recruitment test" aspect seems to hint at an ARG of some sort being in the offing.</p><div>

<p>Naturally, some fans have immediately gone off the deep end with extra expansion theories. If that's you, it's maybe worth bearing in mind that CD Projekt senior community manager Amelia Korzycka has responded to one user on the tweeter asking what the tease is with <a href="https://x.com/Lilayaah/status/1962521644041121965">the following message</a>: "All I can say is it's not the DLC and it's not the patch."
 </p>
<p>"'The' DLC? Instead of 'a' DLC?Y ou're gonna dive people crazy, you know that right? Me included," another user replied to Korzycka. "Is there an expansion DLC in the works?" The community manager, I assume after a deep sigh, has simply <a href="https://x.com/Lilayaah/status/1962759935608938808">responded to this query</a> with a "No."</p>
<p>Given that, I'd very much temper your expectations. It'd be foolish to totally rule out CD Projekt adding yet more stuff to Cyberpunk given the past few years, though. Here's hoping they at least explain Myers' ability to move through time and space.</p>
<p>Has it required her to fork over a bit of her brain space to Neo from The Matrix doing his best dickhead rock singer impression? Will Cyberpunk 2 be about stopping Roz and/or Idris Elba's Solomon Reed from going back in time to kill one of V's ancestors while dressed in leather and speaking like the most Austrian cyborg you've ever met? We need answers.</p>

<p>The Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test was the game’s first proper hands-on opportunity. Don’t cry because it’s over, smile that it happened. Or if that doesn’t work, you can always enjoy the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds demo speeding your way.</p>



<p>This isn’t Sonic’s first foray into kart racers. Team Sonic Racing performed very well, and clearly well enough to warrant a full sequel. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworld-release-date-trailer-features-minecraft-persona-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> is that very sequel, and it’s just had its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Network Test</a>. These types of tests are common and an easy way to ascertain a multiplayer title’s online connectivity and stability.</p>



<p>The beta has finished, meaning if you didn’t get a chance to log in, you’ve missed this window. But as one door closes, another opens.</p>



<h2 id="h-sonic-racing-crossworlds-demo-launches-in-september">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Demo Launches In September</h2>

<p>We’ve learned that Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is debuting a new single-player demo in “mid-September,” thanks to the Sonic The Hedgehog <a href="https://x.com/sonic_hedgehog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X page</a>.</p>



<p>“The Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test has officially ended! Thank you everyone for participating! And in case you missed it… A single-player demo will be released in mid-September! We hope you keep coming back for more races!” said the page in a September 2 message.</p>



<p>September is a busy month in the gaming calendar. The likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-26-announces-12-new-icons-including-francesco-totti-andres-iniesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC 26</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a> are some of the monstrous names propping up the month. If you can find time, a Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds demo will be wedged into the middle of this.</p>

            <p>
Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto has claimed the "PS5 barrier" for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is "unexpectedly large", which has limited the game's success on Sony's console.
</p>
<p>
Tsujimoto was interviewed by <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en">Nikkei</a> back in May, though just recently published (and translated on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-president-regarding-building-upon-wilds-initial-sales-we-found-that-the-ps5-barrier-is-unexpectedly-large-ps5-the-main-platform-for-mhw.1285902/">ResetEra</a>), where he discussed the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-rises-beyond-another-impressive-milestone-in-first-month">initial 10m sales in its first month of release</a>. 
</p>
<p>
He stated PS5 was considered the main platform for the game, however the steep price of both the console and the game itself - especially in comparison to previous entries in the series now available on sale - had an impact on sales. In particular, younger generations are often unable to afford such high prices.

<p>
Capcom therefore aims to boost sales of the game with limited time sales - it had a 20 percent reduction at the end of June, for instance.
</p>
<p>
More interestingly, Tsujimoto commented on the popularity of Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, stating despite the price the "response was better than we had expected".
</p>
<p>
There's no indication here that Monster Hunter Wilds will appear on Switch 2 anytime soon. However, the series has a long history with handheld consoles from both Nintendo and Sony, with previous entry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> releasing on Switch before other platforms.
</p>
<p>
However, with the multitude of performance issues across both home consoles and PC with Monster Hunter Wilds, a Switch 2 version seems ambitious at this point.
</p>
<p>
It's particularly interesting PS5 was considered the primary platform, considering the vast majority of sales for Monster Hunter Wilds have actually been on PC. It perhaps explains why the PC version of the game, with its much-criticised performance issues, is yet to be properly optimised - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-players-wait-almost-a-year-for-better-performance-capcom-is-in-danger-of-losing-its-most-important-audience">PC players will be waiting almost a year for a comprehensive fix</a>.
</p><p>
Ahead of the game's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-producer-acknowledges-importance-of-pc-platform-and-crossplay">producer Ryozo Tsujimoto noted there are "more players than ever playing on PC, including in Japan"</a> so Capcom sees "room for the series to capture new players who haven't tried it before if that's their chosen platform". At the least, Capcom was aware of the game's potential PC popularity.

            <p>On the 30th anniversary of the Rayman series, brand producer Loic Gounon spoke about the history of the series, and provided a little teaser of what's to come.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694">video posted on the official Rayman X account</a>, which had been dormant for years prior to today, Gounon stated: "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working on the future of Rayman. Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>To mark the 30th anniversary of Rayman, Gounon also announced Ubisoft will be sharing behind-the-scenes anecdotes, interviews, concept art and more to make it a momentous occasion for the series, and give back to fans who've remained true to Rayman even now.</p>

<p>Composer for the Rayman series Christophe Heral then appeared in the video, thanking fans for lovely messages, saying he loves them very much, and playing a sweet performance to cap the whole thing off.</p>
<p>Rayman is one of Ubisoft's defining IPs, even if it's been left a bit by the wayside in recent years. It's nice to know some movement is happening on a new game, even if we won't be seeing it any time soon.</p>

<p>Naturally, the update mostly concerns backers who supported the project back in the 19th century, with Team Cherry providing advice on how to ensure the correct delivery of game keys and, more specifically, what Switch 2 owners will need to do to unlock the game's full potential on Nintendo's new console.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zrvigm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>In a nutshell, Switch backers will be receiving their codes via email. Those on Switch 2 will then need to download the game itself <em>and</em> an additional free upgrade pack to unlock the enhanced features (i.e. higher frame rates, etc).</p>
<p>Otherwise, backers who have yet to complete their surveys will need to do so soon in order to receive the relevant download key. If you're one of these and you happen to miss the cut-off point tomorrow, then you can still receive your game by reaching out to the team directly. All details can be found on the Kickstarter page linked.</p>
<p>For everyone else, Hollow Knight: Silksong <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/hollow-knight-silksongs-price-has-been-officially-announced">has been priced</a> at <strong>$19.99 / €19.99 / ¥2300</strong> and will launch on <strong>Thursday, 4th September 2025</strong>. Specific release times, as detailed by Team Cherry, will be <strong>7am PT / 10am ET / 3pm BST / 4pm CEST / 11PM JST</strong>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-2%E2%80%99s-peak-player-count-skyrockets-by-nearly-300-in-august.1286115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>POE2 player numbers have been dwindling in recent weeks. This happens to many games after their initial launch and hype. But players have flooded back to Path of Exile 2 to make player count numbers blow up—thanks to the ‘Third Edict’ update and free weekend incentive.</p>



<p>Arguably, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-all-boss-powers-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo 4</a>‘s biggest competitor is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-2-best-class-build-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a>. The ARPG launched to great success in December 2024. Over half a million of you flooded the Path of Exile 2 servers to see what the fuss was all about. Peak numbers were still close to the 200K mark by January 2025, and things have tailed off a bit—save for the April 2025 update.</p>



<p> However, a free weekend opportunity combined with a huge new content update has revitalized the ARPG sequel once more.</p>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-third-edict-update-amp-free-weekend-boosts-numbers">Path of Exile 2 Third Edict Update &amp; Free Weekend Boosts Numbers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roaring back into life. Image credit: Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Path of Exile 2 was free-to-play for everyone from August 29 to September 1. Whether you own the game or don’t, everyone was entitled to download the game and try it out.</p>



<p>This was to get as many eyes and hours on the game’s Third Edict content update as possible.</p>



<p>According to the POE 2 <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3826469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>: “You will get access to all the content currently available in Path of Exile 2, including the newly released Third Edict Content Update. There are no limits to character leveling, and all progress made during this period will be saved to your account. When the Free Weekend ends, you can continue playing by purchasing an Early Access key or by waiting until Path of Exile 2 becomes free to play at full release.”</p>



<p>For reference, Steam Charts says Path of Exile 2 achieved around 8,000 players on average in July 2025, with a peak of around 14,000. Whereas August 2025 saw an average of about 25,000 users, but a peak of over 352,000! The average would’ve been low throughout the whole month, up until the free weekend right at the end of the month.</p>



<p>Did you get a chance to play Path of Exile 2 during the free weekend? Are you going to continue to play it? It seems to be a bold strategy that paid off for Grinding Gear Games. If you agree or disagree, let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reputable social media has found traces of the first Marvel Rivals PS4 update. It’s long been suspected that a PS4 version of the superhero shooter would happen eventually, thank the Star Lord, it seems to be coming.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-does-c9-mean-in-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> has been a huge hit for NetEase Games. It’s surprising, really, as Marvel fans are insatiable for the hero shooter and anything Marvel-related in general. It takes the best of Overwatch and sprinkles in its own flair and features to make an excellent free-to-play shooter.</p>



<p>Many people still haven’t made the step up to current-gen hardware, and if you’re a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-marvel-rivals-on-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS4</a> user, it might be good news for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-on-ps4-update-discovered">Marvel Rivals On PS4 Update Discovered</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A confusing message. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>, this has been uncovered: “Marvel Rivals Update 01.01 Released. (PS4 Version).”</p>



<p>This would suggest the first update and patch notes for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-version-might-become-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals’ debut on PS4</a>. This is the most recent update on the port, and the X page posted on August 13 with another message indicating the port was happening: “Marvel Rivals – PS4.”</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals on PlayStation 4 feels like reality more than a dream, and if you are a last-gen owner, you finally get to see what the fuss is all about. Also, I’d hazard a guess that if Marvel Rivals is coming to older PlayStation hardware, then Xbox One owners might also be in luck! I’m worried about the game’s performance, but let’s hope it holds up!</p>



<p>Stay tuned for updates and details.</p>



<div><article><p><span>🚨 Marvel Rivals Update 01.01 Released. (PS4 Version)

Patch Notes : Marvel Rivals S4 is coming! </span></p></article></div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-rayman-game-ubisoft-milan-montpellier/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-rayman-game-in-development-at-ubisoft-milan-and-montpellier.1286091/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of the celebrations for the 30th anniversary of Rayman, Ubisoft has confirmed that Ubisoft Milan, which was previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/rayman-aaa-game-in-the-works-at-ubisoft-milan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> to be working on a new installment of the franchise, is partnering with Ubisoft Montpellier on this project.</p>



<p>Loic Gounon, Brand Producer for the IP, <a href="https://x.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595264390218129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a video message</a>:</p>



<p><em>A bit about myself: I joined Ubisoft twenty years ago, and I've been on the franchise since 2006 on projects such as Rayman Raving Rabbids, Rayman Origins, and Rayman Legends. Rayman was born at Ubisoft Montpellier back in 1995, and for the past thirty years, he has gone on many adventures thanks to studios across the world</em> <em>like Ubisoft Paris, Ubisoft Milan, or Ubisoft Annecy. Starting now and across our community channels, we are taking a moment to celebrate this incredible history by looking back. We will be sharing behind the scenes, anecdotes, developer interviews, concept art, and more throughout the months to come. Rayman couldn't have become such a legend without all of you, the fans. You have helped to keep his legacy going, and we're incredibly thankful for that. As we said in the past, a very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working together on the future of Rayman. Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured, Rayman is in good hands.</em></p>



<p>Fans of the peculiar limbless creature must arm themselves with a lot of patience, as triple-A game development can take a very long time these days. The only tidbit we have on the project is <a href="https://wccftech.com/rayman-remake-prince-of-persia-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from a rumor</a> that circulated last October, when Insider Gaming said this would be a remake of a prior title. Tom Henderson is usually extremely well informed when it comes to Ubisoft, so it's likely that the info is correct and a remake, rather than a new game, is on the way.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Which Call of Duty is Free?—Play COD For Free, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/which-call-of-duty-is-free/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/which-call-of-duty-is-free-%E2%80%94play-cod-for-free-explained.1286088/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty has existed for more than two decades, and in that time, dozens of games have been released to flesh out the franchise. It’s arguably the most popular first-person shooter series of all time, and today, we’re helping people get a taste of it by answering an all-important question: ‘Which Call of Duty is free?’</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll outline which Call of Duty games are free and which ones you need to pay for.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-free-call-of-duty-games">Are There Free Call of Duty Games?</h2>



<p>Few franchises sell quite so many copies as Call of Duty does. It’s a titan of the gaming industry, and every year, even amidst bad press, the annual Call of Duty release tops the charts. In 2022, Modern Warfare II was released, and within ten days, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-2-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had topped $1 billion in sales</a>.</p>



<p>However, as it’s a premium franchise, Call of Duty can be expensive, and typically, every new title will boast a top-tier pricing point as well as a paid battle pass and other in-game bundles and items that also cost real money. It can get very pricey, very quickly, and for some players, the need to find a free Call of Duty game arises. </p>



<p>With that in mind, which Call of Duty is free?</p>



<h2 id="h-good-news-you-can-play-call-of-duty-for-free">Good News: You <em>Can </em>Play Call of Duty For Free</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image Credit: Activision</figcaption></figure>







<p>There are two ways that you can play Call of Duty for free, and they’re both dramatically popular. </p>



<p>Firstly, there’s the Warzone ecosystem. This battle-royale-backed platform features one of the most popular titles to ever emerge into the genre, boasting hundreds of millions of players and an ever-changing landscape. It debuted in 2020, and in the years that it has been active, it has seen all-new maps, modes, events, and the growth of a massive community.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Warzone (in every capacity) is free to play across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms – it’s also a crossplay title, which has served to unite cross-platform players. There’s a possibility that Warzone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-mwii-ported-to-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will also be available on Nintendo devices</a>.</p>



<p>If Warzone isn’t your kind of thing, then you can get started with the <em>other </em>free Call of Duty game – COD Mobile. This is a handheld-exclusive game that has existed since 2019, and it’s a monumental title that, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1112479/call-of-duty-mobile-downloads-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to Statista</a>, secures around four million new downloads every single month.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Mobile incorporates content from several successful COD games, featuring a wide range of game modes, a battle royale mode, and plenty of customisation options. It’s free-to-play, but there are many microtransactions under the surface that fuel the development of the game itself.</p>



<p>That answers the titular question, ‘which Call of Duty is free’. There’s a battle royale platform that also includes an extraction shooter sub-mode and a mobile platform that is ever-expanding. That’s not a bad selection, considering it’ll cost you absolutely nothing to get involved with either of them!</p>

					</p></div><div>

						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Corsair’s Void line has been among my favorites for some time now —solid gaming audio, cool looks, and a price that doesn’t make my wallet cry. The Corsair Void Wireless v2, priced at $119.99, steps up from the old Void RGB Elite Wireless with a featherlight design, a mic that’s ready for prime time, and battery life that just keeps going. It’s got some quirks, especially for console players, but for PC gamers, this thing’s a steal. Let’s dive in and see what it’s packing.</p>



<p><strong>Design and features</strong></p>



<p>The Void Wireless v2 rocks that bold, angular Void style—like something out of a sci-fi flick. Available in Carbon or White, it’s got RGB strips on the earcups you can tweak via Corsair’s iCUE software. It’s not subtle, but I’m here for it. At just 303g, this headset is crazy light, making it a dream for long sessions. The microfiber mesh earpads and memory foam headband feel soft and breathable, and the adjustable headband keeps it snug without squeezing your head.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Controls live on the left earcup: a power button (which also swaps between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth), a programmable button, and a volume rocker you can tap for custom tricks in iCUE. The non-detachable mic is super flexible, with enough adjustment options. Flip-to-mute is a nice touch, and the build feels solid, though the plastic-heavy frame doesn’t scream “luxury” like Corsair’s high-end stuff.</p>



<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>



<p><span>Comfort</span><br>At 303g, the Void Wireless v2 is like wearing nothing at all. I’ve rocked it through marathons, and my ears stayed cool thanks to the breathable mesh and plush foam. Glasses-wearers like me will love the light clamping force, though the earcups can feel a bit small, sometimes brushing my ears. It’s not perfect, but it’s comfortable enough for the price.</p>



<p><span>Connectivity</span><br>This headset’s got flexibility for days: low-latency 2.4GHz wireless via a USB-A dongle (50ft range, no dropouts) and Bluetooth for phones, Switch, or other devices. Flipping between modes is as easy as tapping the power button. It works on PC, PS4, PS5, and Mac, but Xbox gamers are out of luck with this one. Additionally, there's no wired option, so be sure to stay on top of the juice left in the battery. Still, Bluetooth makes this a solid pick for bouncing between PC and mobile.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><span>Sound Quality</span><br>The 50mm neodymium drivers (20Hz–20kHz) deliver punchy, clear audio that’s great for gaming. Bass thumps in DOOM, and mids keep footsteps and callouts crisp in Rainbow Six Siege. Dolby Atmos on PC adds some immersive flair, but it’s not gonna blow your mind. For gaming and movies, it’s spot-on, but music fans might notice the highs lack a bit of sparkle compared to pricier headsets like the Virtuoso XT. It’s not the best audio out there, but for $120, it gets the job done. Console players, heads-up: you’re locked into the default sound without iCUE.</p>



<p><span>Microphone</span><br>The mic is a straight-up star. It’s omnidirectional, Discord-certified, and picks up your voice clean and clear (-40dB sensitivity). The flexible boom lets you tweak its position to perfection, and flip-to-mute is a lifesaver for quick silences. With the foam windscreen and NVIDIA Broadcast support on PC, it’s great for team comms or casual streaming. It won’t replace a dedicated USB mic, but it’s one of the best I’ve tested at this price.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><span>Battery Life</span><br>Corsair claims 70 hours on 2.4GHz and 130 hours on Bluetooth, and I’m not arguing. I got around 65 hours with RGB off, and a 15-minute charge gave me ~6 hours of juice. Compared to the old Void’s 16 hours, this is next-level. Even with RGB cranked, it lasts longer than most competitors. The USB-C cable makes charging quick and painless.</p>



<p><span>iCUE Software</span><br>iCUE is where PC gamers get the good stuff: RGB tweaking, a 10-band EQ, Dolby Atmos, and button remapping. It’s slick but can be a bit laggy, and console players get none of this magic, which is disappointing. Also, the EQ preset cycling just says “1,” “2,” and so on—no names like “FPS” or “Movie.” It’s a small gripe, but it bugs me when I’m swapping settings blind.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The Corsair Void Wireless v2 is a banger at $119.99. It’s quite comfortable, the mic’s a beast, and the battery life is basically immortal. Sound’s great for gaming, with Dolby Atmos adding some spice, though music snobs might want more. Bluetooth makes it super versatile, but the lack of wired connectivity and iCUE’s PC-only perks mean console gamers miss out on the full package. Compared to the Sony Wireless Gold 7.1 ($85) or Turtle Beach Stealth 600 ($100), it’s got a better mic and battery life, but PS5 players might want more on-headset control. If you’re a PC gamer living in iCUE, this headset’s a no-brainer. Console folks, you might wanna shop around unless you’re cool with basic audio. Either way, the Void Wireless v2 is a solid step up from its predecessor and an excellent pick for the price.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Map Leak Shows Large US Setting For ‘Season One’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-map-leak-large-us-setting/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-map-leak-shows-large-us-setting-for-%E2%80%98season-one%E2%80%99.1286064/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another major Battlefield 6 leak is circulating on social media, with the culprit uploading ten minutes of gameplay from a previously unseen map, titled either Blackwell Field or Blackwell Farm. The ten-minute video showcases a stunning, large map reportedly set in California, and it has been dubbed the first map to come to Season One of Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>It’s a positive look, regardless of how the content has surfaced. Fans were asking for larger maps following the end of the recent open beta, and that’s exactly what this leaked map represents.</p>



<h2 id="h-latest-battlefield-6-leak-reveals-larger-map">Latest Battlefield 6 Leak Reveals Larger Map</h2>



<p>In a ten-minute video leaked by the same source that uncovered the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 battle royale map</a>, we get a walkthrough of what is either named Blackwell Field or Blackwell Farm. This naming convention comes from the original poster who first shared the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6ap3s/bf6s_season_1_map_badlands_video_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video on Reddit</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s the linked video uploaded on Streamable:</p>



<p><strong><em>Video removed by copyright request</em></strong></p>



<p>Bizarre perspective aside, the video offers a neat look at one of the larger maps coming to Battlefield 6, assumedly with the game’s first season. There are oil derricks spread across a vast, rocky area, pitted with long sight lines and many avenues that would make vehicular combat on this map a dream.</p>



<p>Another area on the map appears to house an airstrip with some hangars, and there are factory-style buildings, rolling hills, and even what looks like a small village. It’s a super diverse map with plenty to uncover. It’s the kind of thing that large-scale Conquest fans have been begging for, and I can certainly see it becoming a fan favorite at first blush.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-answers-today/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-and-answers-today-september-2%E2%80%94clues-for-tuesday-813.1286061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nothing gets your day started in a better way than an invigorating run around today’s <em>New York Times Connections </em>puzzle. This daily word game has become a firm favorite worldwide since being released in June 2023. I’m a huge believer in keeping my brain sharp, and I can’t think of a more effective way to do that than with the NYT’s selection of mind-taxing games.</p>



<p>With that being said, today is a whole new day, and that means fresh NYT Connections hints and answers are here, waiting to be discovered and utilized. If you’re scratching your head about today’s NYT Connections, read on. I’ll help you figure out every group in today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections-and-how-do-you-play-it">What is NYT Connections and How Do You Play It?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <strong>everywhere</strong>, and it can be played either on a desktop device or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-today-s-nyt-connections-hints">What Are Today’s NYT Connections Hints?</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #814</p>



<ul>
<li>STIRRING</li>



<li>MYSTERY</li>



<li>CHRISTMAS</li>



<li>SWEARING</li>



<li>HOUSE</li>



<li>MOUSE</li>



<li>HERRING</li>



<li>EARRING</li>



<li>EXPLETIVES</li>



<li>PLEATHER VEST</li>



<li>OUROBOROS</li>



<li>NECKLACE</li>



<li>MESH SHIRT</li>



<li>FOUR-LETTER WORDS</li>



<li>HISTAMINE</li>



<li>PROFANITY</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Credit: New York Times</figcaption></figure>







<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>–<em>These words might get you ‘bleeped’ on television</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>T’was the night before… these words took center stage</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Fashion choices that scream 1993 pop culture icon</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word begins with a little ownership</em></li>
</ul>



<p>I didn’t have as much of a challenge with today’s NYT Connections words as I thought I might. That’s not always true, as some mornings I’ll be in a stupor trying to figure them out, especially the purple group, which is often <strong>obscure</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, September 2.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h3 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-september-2-814">NYT Connections Answers for Today, September 2 (#814)</h3>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>–<em> </em>EXPLETIVES, FOUR-LETTER WORDS, PROFANITY, SWEARING</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CHRISTMAS, HOUSE, MOUSE, STIRRING</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – EARRING, MESH SHIRT, NECKLACE, PLEATHER VEST</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – HERRING, HISTAMINE, MYSTERY, OUROBOROS</li>
</ul>



<p>And here’s the visual solution for today’s NYT Connections:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>



<p>How did you do? Did you get a perfect run? Let me know what your streak is looking like on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

        <p>IzanagiGames—known for creating cinematic game experiences such as <em><a title="Games > Death Come True [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/death-come-true">Death Come True</a></em>—now teams up with Nippon TV and AX-ON, leaders in Japanese drama production, to take on the challenge of a feature-length live-action game. Starring Hiromitsu Kitayama.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>13 years ago, six girls mysteriously vanished in Akihabara—an unsolved case known as “Akiba’s Spirited Away.”</p><p>At the annual Game Show, Daiki Shinjo (played by Hiromitsu Kitayama), once hailed as a “genius creator,” boldly announces the development of a new game inspired by this very incident: AKIBA LOST. But the moment he does, strange disappearances begin again.</p><p>The cast of the game includes his sister Aoi Shinjo, who works at a maid cafe, underground idol Kokone Nagato, food writer Moe Kurosu, shrine maiden Chihiro Jimbo, cosplayer Wakana Yusa, and game streamer Yukimi Kurahashi—each a colorful icon of Akihabara’s vibrant subculture.</p><p>Yet, the story they were supposed to perform soon begins to bleed into reality.</p><p>It all begins with a threatening phone call—and the sudden disappearance of Aoi.</p><p>“Cancel the game’s development—or the tragedy will repeat itself.”</p><p>Can Shinjo finish developing the game? Can he protect his friends? Who is behind it all? And what really happened thirteen years ago?</p><p>The choice that determines the ending of this story is now in your hands.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Daiki Shinjo</strong> (portrayed by Hiromitsu Kitayama) – Game creator.</li><li>More characters will be revealed in the coming months.</li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST-Ann_09-01-25_Chara_001.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST-Ann_09-01-25_Chara_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Producer Comments</strong></p><p><strong>Shinsuke Umeda, IzanagiGames</strong> (Games: <em>Death Come True</em>, <em><a title="Games > Yurukill: The Calumniation Games [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/yurukill-the-calumniation-games">Yurukill: The Calumniation Games</a></em>):</p><p>In June 2020, we released Death Come True under the concept of a “cinematic live-action game.” Our next ambition was to create a feature-length ensemble live-action game. Over the course of five years, we built the foundation for this project, holding countless long meetings from the very beginning together with Nippon TV and AX-ON. This collaboration has led to the creation of <em>AKIBA LOST</em>.</p><p>Veteran staff from the worlds of drama and film came together, filming day after day. Development continued after the shoot, and today, we are finally able to announce the project to the world.</p><p>In the story, the protagonist Shinjo strives to complete <em>AKIBA LOST</em> as a game creator. Similarly, Hiromitsu Kitayama, who plays Shinjo, led the team on set and helped bring this real-world version of <em>AKIBA LOST</em> to completion.</p><p>With the combined efforts of IzanagiGames, Nippon TV, AX-ON, the cast, and our dedicated staff, we proudly present the feature-length multi-angle suspense drama <em>AKIBA LOST</em>. Please look forward to it!</p><p><strong>Hiroki Shibata, AX-ON</strong> (Dramas: <em>Brush Up Life</em>, <em>What Day Were You Born On?</em>)</p><p>As someone whose career has been in drama production, I never imagined that I would have the opportunity to work on a live-action game.</p><p>Every day, we face countless “choices.” We select one option in front of us, then move to the next… and this infinite accumulation of decisions sometimes makes us realize, “There’s no going back now.”</p><p>At the same time, in modern society there is a prevailing sense that “speed is key—make choices quickly, act, and learn through trial and error.” There is certainly some truth to this. However, even a single wrong button press can lead to irreversible consequences. That is why I wanted to craft a story themed around the choices we make in life.</p><p>In this game, you, the player, experience the lives of seven characters, face the choices that appear one after another, make decisions, and advance the story.</p><p>The protagonist is portrayed by Hiromitsu Kitayama, who is active across acting, music, and other entertainment fields. Although this was his first experience in the game world, his flexibility and passionate dedication to the project inspired us greatly.</p><p>The setting is Akihabara, Tokyo, a city renowned worldwide for its subculture. What kind of endings await based on the choices made by the game creator protagonist (you)? We hope you will experience it firsthand.</p><p>We, the team behind <em>AKIBA LOST</em>, are fully committed to creating a game that can become one of your life’s choices.</p><p><strong>Hirokazu Umezawa, Nippon TV</strong> (Content <a title="Genres > Strategy [282 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">Strategy</a> Headquarters, Business Bureau, Music &amp; Artist Center)</p><p>When I first heard about a live-action game, my immediate reaction was: “This sounds amazing!”</p><p>Although I was completely new to the world of games, I realized that this was an opportunity to leverage television’s strengths in visual direction and story structuring.</p><p>In taking on this challenge, the expertise of IzanagiGames in game production was invaluable. The result of combining television and gaming is <em>AKIBA LOST</em>.</p><p>Filming posed unique challenges inherent to games, but Hiromitsu Kitayama performed with remarkable skill and fully immersed himself in the role, bringing authenticity to every scene. His presence has become the “core” of this work.</p><p><em>AKIBA LOST</em> is a project that could only be created because of television, and could only be completed thanks to IzanagiGames. We hope you will experience the story through your own choices!</p><p><strong>Yushi Ito, AX-ON</strong> (Films: <em>A Place in the Kinki Region</em>, <em>Your World Ends with You</em>)</p><p>For many years, I have been creating dramas and films, portraying countless tears, smiles, and human lives. Now, I am channeling that experience into the world of games. The characters on the screen are not just characters—they have thoughts, struggles, and their futures change based on your choices. Moments will arise that shake your heart or tighten your chest.</p><p>This live-action game, crafted by specialists in drama and film production, is not confined to a scripted story. Every choice creates new scenes, weaving a story that is uniquely yours.</p><p>Hiromitsu Kitayama, who played the central role in this project, not only possesses exceptional acting skills but is also widely supported as an artist across various entertainment fields. His presence and expressiveness enrich the world of the game, making him essential to the live-action experience.</p><p>The completed <em>AKIBA LOST</em> is a game, yet it is also a story that allows you to experience a chapter of life. The more your emotions are engaged, the more vividly the story comes alive. We hope you will play your own drama in this world.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/izanagigames-nippon-tv-and-ax-on-announce-full-scale-live-action-game-akiba-lost-for-ps5-switch-2-switch-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

<p>Every day, Wordle fans around the world log in to guess the five-letter word of the day. Whether you’re a seasoned player or just starting out, knowing today’s hints and strategies can help you solve Wordle faster and improve your daily streak. Of course, that’s if you don’t mind the extra assistance. In this article, we’ll share <strong>helpful hints, tips on how to play, today’s Wordle answer (Game #1536), and yesterday’s solution</strong> for comparison.</p>



<p>To play today’s Wordle, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">head to the game’s website.</a> If you just want to go right to today’s answer without any tips or tricks, you <strong><a href="#h-today-s-wordle-answer-for-september-2-2025-wordle-game-1536">can click right here</a>.</strong></p>



<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> The following information will include spoilers on today’s, and yesterday’s, edition of Wordle. If you don’t want the answer given to you, stop scrolling.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-wordle">What Is Wordle?</h2>



<p>Wordle is a daily online word puzzle created by Josh Wardle, who first created the game as a prototype in 2013 and released it in 2021. It challenges players to guess a <strong>five-letter word</strong> in six attempts or fewer, using clues from previous guesses. The game became a viral hit in late 2021 due to its simplicity, shareable results, and the excitement of solving a new puzzle every day. Wordle has even inspired countless spin-offs and daily challenges across social media.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-wordle">How To Play Wordle</h2>



<p>Wordle is a simple but addictive word puzzle. Each day, players get <strong>six attempts</strong> to guess the five-letter word answer. After each guess:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Green letters</strong> are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li><strong>Yellow letters</strong> are correct but in the wrong position.</li>



<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal is to guess the word in as few tries as possible. Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a trending topic online.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-do-wordle-games-reset">When Do Wordle Games Reset</h2>



<p>A new word is added to Wordle <strong>every day at 12am or Midnight EST.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-tips-on-how-to-play">Tips On How To Play</h2>



<p>While everyone has a different strategy for how they play the game to get today’s Wordle answer, there are tips and tricks you can use to help you get the daily words in as few attempts as possible.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tip 1:</strong> Use a word with common vowels and consonants (like SLATE or STRAW) to reveal useful letters early.</li>



<li><strong>Tip 2:</strong> Don’t just rearrange your first word to find the answer. If you don’t know it right away, pick a second word that uses different letters you haven’t tried yet. This will help you narrow down your options quicker.</li>



<li><strong>Tip 3: </strong>Don’t use duplicate letters too early. If you think a word has a duplicate letter, wait until you’re more confident the letter appears twice in the word.</li>



<li><strong>Tip 4:</strong> Wait on uncommon letters. To make it easier, try and find all the common letters first. Once you’ve ruled out any common vowels or consonants, then give letters like “J”, “X”, or “Z” a try.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-hint-for-today-s-wordle-answer-game-1536">Hint for Today’s Wordle Answer—Game #1536</h2>



<p>Without giving the Wordle answer completely away just yet, here are a couple helpful hints for today to get you started:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hint 1:</strong> Today’s Wordle answer starts with the letter <strong>“M”</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hint 2: </strong>Today’s Wordle answer has just <strong>one vowel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hint 3:</strong> It’s another word for <strong>“power”</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Use these clues to narrow down your guesses and increase your chances of solving <strong>Wordle #1536 for September 2, 2025.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 Message Teases Something Coming on September 4]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>CDPR has posted a message on social media teasing <strong>something </strong>related to Cyberpunk 2077 coming on September 4. The message is in the form of a notice issued by the N.U.S.A., the fictional government in Cyberpunk 2077’s universe. It speaks about a ‘mounting cybersecurity threat’ and invites ‘netrunners’ to battle against that rising danger.</p>



<p>Many theories have surfaced, and the leading belief is that CDPR is referring to cybersecurity-related job vacancies opening up in the near future. If that’s the case, why doesn’t the post link to any job listings, and why is it referencing a date three days in the future?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-something-new-coming-to-cyberpunk-2077">Is Something New Coming to Cyberpunk 2077?</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, CDPR adopted the persona of President Rosalind Myers of The New United States of America. The message the team published seemed to be asking for netrunners (a fancy Cyberpunk term for hackers) to join the N.U.S.A. and help defend against ‘viciously determined’ threat actors.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The most curious thing about this post was the header, which mentioned a date: September 4, 2025.</p>



<p>It’s not clear if this was a) posted early, b) written in error, or c) teasing something being imminently revealed on Thursday.</p>



<p>In the comments under the post, Cyberpunk 2077 fans started sharing theories. Some users believe it’s something to do with the second season of Edgerunners, while others feel it’s something tied to Phantom Liberty, the first and only Cyberpunk 2077 expansion.</p>



<p>It could be something linked to Project Orion, the next Cyberpunk game. Again, it could just be a fancy post lining up the delivery of some job vacancies.</p>



<p>Do you have any theories about this post? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

              <p><em>Final Fantasy VII</em> has one of the best openings of a video game ever. The remake cranks that up even further thanks to the the mash-up of modern graphics and <span tabindex="0" role="tooltip"><span tabindex="0" role="button" data-enable-toggle-animation="true" data-extra-container-classes="ZLo7Eb" data-hover-hide-delay="1000" data-hover-open-delay="500" data-send-open-event="true" data-theme="0" data-width="250" data-ved="2ahUKEwj_uaPDo7iPAxX0F1kFHQb7I5kQmpgGegQIJhAD"><span data-bubble-link="" data-segment-text="Nobuo Uematsu">Nobuo Uematsu’s classic score. I’m pleased to report the magic is still there on Switch 2. Digital Foundry said it <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/digitalfoundry.bsky.social/post/3lx6fxspghc2r">might be the best-looking port on the handheld hybrid yet</a>. Nothing in my time with it led me to think otherwise. And man, does that first mission still hit.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p> <p>For the uninitiated, the opening mission has a former corporate solider teaming up with an anarcho-terrorist cell to blow up a power plant that is helping to kill the planet. Combined with the slick hybrid turn-based combat, it’s a perfect tutorial that also sets the big-picture stakes for the rest of the adventure.</p> <p>I briefly tested <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> at PAX West this past weekend and was relieve to see it doesn’t seem to be suffering from <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-assassins-creed-shadows-framerate-2000621760">some of the issues</a> that appear to be hindering other Switch 2 ports. Square Enix <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1960711660592873862">recently promised</a> the newest version of the RPG would run at a stable 30fps with “smooth performance and crisp visuals” and my roughly 20 minutes with the opening mission backs that up. Even in handheld mode it performed well with no obvious visual shortcomings. The game still controls great, and after <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-switch-2-remake-square-enix-release-date-1851779556">dozens of hours with <em>Rebirth</em> last year</a>, I’d forgotten just satisfying those early moments of the first game look and feel.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000622098" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000622098"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000622098">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s worth noting that I didn’t have enough time to defeat the Scorpion Sentinel and make it out of the No. 1 reactor before it blows up, so I didn’t get to explore <em>Remake Intergrade</em>‘s more open and NPC-filled slums. It’s possible these portions of the game will strain it more on Switch 2. Based on that early section, though, it seems like there’s a decent chance the new hardware’s features will help it come out of the most demanding sections relatively unscathed. <em>Remake Intergrade</em> came out five years ago, but nothing about it looks “old” on Switch 2.</p> <p>Will I go back and replay it once it’s out? Not without some sort of cross-save feature, which the Switch 2 version doesn’t support. But it’s neat that another excellent game will get a second lease on life with Nintendo’s new hardware, and it doesn’t appear to be cutting any performance corners in the process. There’s no exact release date yet <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-s-yuffie-mission-is-1847082454">but <em>Remake Intergrade</em></a> is expected to arrive sometime over the winter.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-4-pack-of-airtags-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-just-wants-them-off-the-shelves-2000622093</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-4-pack-of-airtags-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-just-wants-them-off-the-shelves.1285905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple is know for keeping its prices steady, and discounts on its most popular products are basically a rarity. Still, a little digging can pay off because Amazon sometimes surprises with deals you’d never see on Apple’s official store. Take this AirTag 4-pack, for example: I<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">t normally runs $99 directly from Apple, but Amazon has dropped it down to $69</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why would you care about a little tracker?</h2>
<p>Because losing your keys, backpack or luggage is frustrating, and an AirTag eliminates that problem with no effort. Installation takes as little as tapping it once on your iPhone or iPad, and you’re finished: it pairs up right away. Then you can slip one into your wallet, attach one to your keys or slide one into your travel bag. The <em>Find My</em> app is pre-installed on every iPhone and then shows you where your things are.</p>
<p>If you misplace them at home, the AirTag will even play a sound to help you find them. And if they’re out of reach, <strong>Apple’s global network of billion devices is behind the scenes helping guide you to them</strong>. That means if your bag is left at a café or your suitcase ends up at the wrong airport, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to track it down.</p>
<p>The beauty of this pack is that four trackers cover most of your daily essentials (and one AirTag usually sells for $29): One can go on your keys, another in your wallet, a third for your backpack and the last one for your luggage. Once installed, you barely need to think about them again. The battery lasts for about a year before you’ll have to replace it and it uses a standard coin-cell battery that you can buy at any store. Replacing it is seconds.</p>



<p>What’s also great is how well AirTags blend into the Apple ecosystem: If you already possess an iPhone, iPad, or a MacBook, you don’t need any additional software or tedious pairing processes. It is all managed with Find My. For locating when near and ultra-wideband technology gives you precise directions on your iPhone screen, leading you to within inches of what you lost.</p>
<p>On top of all that, this 4-pack has a <strong>solid customer rating of 4.8 out of 5 stars based on nearly 30,000 reviews</strong>. That amount of feedback suggests these are not a gimmick, and they are correcting actual problems. And for $69, you’re basically getting a little over $17 per tracker, and that’s quite a bargain for the added peace of mind the next time you’re running through an airport terminal or simply can’t keep track of where you left your house keys.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This 1TB HP Laptop Is Now $499 Instead of $2499, Amazon Just Cut $2000 Off the Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-1tb-hp-laptop-is-now-499-instead-of-2499-amazon-just-cut-2000-off-the-price-2000622087</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-1tb-hp-laptop-is-now-499-instead-of-2499-amazon-just-cut-2000-off-the-price.1285893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon skipped laptop deals during Prime Day, but it clearly saved the best for the back-to-school rush. And honestly, you don’t have to be a student to appreciate the kind of discounts popping up right now. Maybe the best deal is on this HP 15.6-inch laptop with Intel i3 processor, massive 32GB RAM, and great 1TB solid-state drive. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3843/">normal price is $2499, yet Amazon has chopped it all the way down to $499</a>: <strong>that’s 80% off and basically one-fifth of what you’d usually pay</strong>. On top of that, it carries an impressive 4.7 out of 5 rating from buyers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3843/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why You Should Consider Buying It</h2>
<p>First off, the memory and storage bundle is significantly more than you’d get at this pricing: With 32GB of DDR4 RAM, you’re not bogged down with chores on a daily level. It means having dozens of tabs in your browser open, video streaming and you still have room to breathe. And then there’s the 1TB PCIe SSD. That amount of fast storage doesn’t just give loads of space for files, movies, and software — it also gets the laptop up and running in a snap.</p>
<p>The processor inside it is built to handle everyday needs with ease: It’s an Intel N100, capable of up to 3.4GHz when Turbo Boost kicks in. Yes, it’s not a workstation beast or a gaming processor, but for project-carrying students or remote workers with conferencing apps, it delivers. Coupled with Intel UHD Graphics, it can manage regular entertainment like Netflix or even light edit work without breaking a sweat.</p>



<p>The display is significant as well, and in this case, you’re getting a 15.6-inch Full HD (1920×1080) display. It’s anti-glare to make working in bright lights or in windows less stressful and its thin bezels give you more usable screen space in a footprint that’s not intimidating. At 250 nits of brightness and with 45% NTSC color, it’s aimed at comfortable streaming.</p>
<p>Despite the big screen and powerful internals, it weighs just 3.64 pounds and measures only 0.73 inches thick. That makes it easy to slip into a backpack or carry between classes or office meetings. The inclusion of WiFi 6E keeps you connected quickly and dependably and Bluetooth 5.3 has you pairing headphones and other peripherals effortlessly. The laptop adds a couple of ports as well: a USB-C, two USB-A, HDMI, and a headphone jack.</p>
<p>Plugged into Windows 11 Pro, this machine is ready for work right out of the box. You’re greeted with a bare-bones interface, Microsoft’s latest apps, and business-class features that help with security and workflow on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>All of that for $499, and you can see why this buy is so surprising.</p>
