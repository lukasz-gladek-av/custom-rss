              <div> <p>Chrome Boba Fett and the little baby Yoda are here to help you forget all about Disney’s complicity in <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249">a grim attack on free speech</a>. Out in less than nine months, <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu&nbsp;</em>now has its first trailer, and the next<em> Star Wars</em> movie looks both incredibly unnecessary and also lots of fun.</p> </div>  <p>The film stars Pedro Pascal as the Mandalorian bounty hunter, with his Force-sensitive sidekick Grogu looking as adorable as ever. Set after the TV series, the film finds the pair back in the galactic hotseat, navigating post-war tensions between the New Republic (Sigourney Weaver plays a colonel named Ward) and remnants of the Empire (Jonny Coyne plays an imperial warlord). Also Jabba the Hutt’s son Rotta is in the mix too.</p>  <p>Here’s a brief look:</p>   <p>The whole 90 seconds flashes by in an instant, but in addition to the aforementioned characters you can also catch a glimpse of some alien guy messing people up with an electrostaff and Grogu speeding around with some other cute god-knows-whats (paging <em>Star Wars</em> lore master Zack Zwiezen). But like I said at the top, it looks fun and not mired down in a bunch of <em>Star Wars</em> naval-gazing mythbuilding, which is a good a thing.</p> <p><em>The Mandalorian and Grogu </em>is directed by Jon Favreau and co-written by Favreau and Dave Filoni, and marks the first in a fresh slate of upcoming<em> Star Wars</em> movies for Disney. With everything else, including a new Jedi-centric tale with <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-new-jedi-order-writer-replaced-rey-delayed-1851747797">Daisy Ridley returning as Rey completely MIA</a>, it’ll either feel like the start of something new or the death knell for the current streaming-wars-burnout incarnation of the franchise. The movie hits theaters on May 22, 2026, and can’t come soon enough for a <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-boycott-marvel-marisa-tomei-2000627135">company currently facing a boycott</a> from fans and celebrities over the Jimmy Kimmel controversy.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-sales-revenue</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-sales-reach-2-5m-as-revenue-climbs.1304256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to new sales data,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>has racked up quite a few sales for itself since launching earlier in September, and it's making a pretty tidy packet for its developer and publisher as well.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/borderlands-4-amasses-over-25m-players-since-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, data firm Alinea Analytics says that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>has sold over 2.5 million copies since it was released on September 12th, resulting in revenues exceeding $150 million. That's a pretty impressive set of figures.</p>

<p>Alinea's data claims that around 1.3 million of the game's sales were on PC via Steam, and that over a million players have picked up&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>on both console platforms on which it's available. Honestly, that's a much more even split than I was expecting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=uV9qzfHf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=cH0_nZ62 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>has sold pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want some demographic breakdowns, Alinea has those as well. Over half of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s player base on PC is based in the US, and the next most popular regions are China, Germany, the UK, and Canada.</p>

<p>However, on PS5, the story is a little different. Again, more than half of the game's players on PS5 are in the US, followed by the UK, Germany, France, and Canada. Alinea doesn't provide data for Xbox Series X|S players.</p>

<p>According to Alinea's data, 59% of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>players on PC played&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/borderlands-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Borderlands 2</em></a>, while 55% played&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/borderlands-3" rel="nofollow">Borderlands 3</a>&nbsp;</em>and just 22% played the spinoff title&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands" rel="nofollow"><em>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</em></a>.</p>

<p>Those figures are higher on PlayStation; as Alinea points out, previous&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>games have been made available as part of PlayStation Plus, so 81% of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s player base on the console has checked out&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em>.</p>




<p><em>Borderlands 4</em>'s strong sales performance comes despite widespread criticism of the game's performance on PC, which prompted Gearbox head Randy Pitchford to launch into an impassioned (and lengthy) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-performance-comments" rel="nofollow">defense of his game on social media</a>.</p>

<p>Despite Pitchford's comments, 2K and Gearbox have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-pc-performance-top-priority" rel="nofollow">pledged to improve the game's PC version</a>, calling it their "top priority". Presumably, doing so will lead to even more sales for them.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Borderlands</em>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> is the newest entry in Konami's long-running survival horror franchise, tasking players with navigating the fictional town of Ebisugaoka in 1960s Japan as they attempt to uncover the mystery of a creeping fog that has produced bloodthirsty monsters around every corner. With this change in setting, Silent Hill f manages to be a great onboarding spot for series newcomers while maintaining plenty of familiar themes long-time players will recognize. But whether you're new to Silent Hill or a returning fan, you'll probably want to know how much playtime you can get out of this horrifying adventure. So, here's how long it takes to beat Silent Hill f.</p><h2>How long is Silent Hill f - Campaign length and replayability</h2><p>An average playthrough of Silent Hill f should take <strong>between 12-14 hours on Hard (normal) difficulty</strong>. This includes time spent solving puzzles and exploring at least some of the game's optional paths for additional healing items, upgrade materials, and weapons. However, those looking to advance through the campaign with less resistance can use the Story (easy) difficulty to reduce the combat and puzzle challenges, potentially allowing for a quicker completion.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill f - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Silent Hill f is a game designed to be played multiple times, though. While you can beat the game just once if you wish, additional playthroughs--which let you carry over your health, stamina, and sanity upgrades--unravel even more story content. Not only do subsequent runs provide fresh cutscenes and boss changes, but they also provide the opportunity to see up to 5 total endings, revealing more and more of the unsettling story surrounding main character Shimizu Hinako.</p><p>Additionally, completionists will find that there are quite a few reasons to keep playing the campaign through multiple times, as getting every trophy or achievement won't be possible in a single playthrough. You'll need to continue into NG+ to keep earning consumable currency known as Faith so that you're able to purchase all the upgrades and omamori (accessories). And any one-off trophies or achievements you missed your first time or two through can always be tried again on a new run.</p><p>With so much replayability, Silent Hill f can provide dozens of hours of entertainment to survival horror enthusiasts. If that sounds like something you're eager to dive into yourself, you can pick up Silent Hill f now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

<p>Instead, Ogg said he prefers books. He encouraged people to read Crime and Punishment from Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky.</p><p>"Someone said, 'At some point, you should play GTA 5.' I said, 'Why?' They said, 'Because it's so great.' And I said, 'Well, one day you should read Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment.' And then he went completely blank. Books are my thing," he said.</p><p>Ogg has previously discussed his inability to play video games, saying at one point he tried, but kept failing to progress and just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tYo-zfFngfI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept ramming into a wall with his character.</a></p><p>Ogg was said to have<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-have-had-a-james-bond-like-story-dlc-actor-says/1100-6522891/" data-ref-id="1100-6522891"> recorded lines for a James Bond-like story DLC for GTA 5</a> that would have seen Trevor going undercover. However, that add-on obviously never happened, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-is-why-gta-5-trevor-dlc-was-reportedly-scrapped/1100-6524713/" data-ref-id="1100-6524713">it was reportedly scrapped because of the success of GTA Online</a>. He's also said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-trevor-actor-wants-a-very-definitive-exit-in-gta-6/1100-6529064/" data-ref-id="1100-6529064">hopes Trevor shows up in GTA 6 so the character can be killed off.</a></p><p>Ogg is best known in gaming for GTA 5, but he's also known for playing Simon in more than 20 episodes of The Walking Dead. He also had a recurring role in the Snowpiercer TV series and was in a pair of Better Call Saul episodes as well. Ogg is also known for his <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/steven-ogg-old-spice-commercials-indie-films-1235116757/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">series of absurd Old Spice commercials.</a></p><p>The actor had roles in the video games Alone in the Dark (2008) and Cursed Mountain (2009) prior to his breakout success as Trevor in 2013's GTA 5. He hasn't done another video game since, however.</p><p>GTA 6 launches in May 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The game stars Jason and Lucia, but Rockstar has not yet announced the actors playing those lead roles. Check out the gallery below to learn more about Jason, Lucia, and all the other main characters in GTA 6's story.</p>

            <p>This year has marked Xbox's "largest investment in Game Pass to date", according to ID@Xbox boss Chris Charla.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation">Eurogamer</a>, Charla discussed the current state of the subscription service in the face of recent criticism, noting positive sentiment from developers and a desire to return for future projects.</p>
<p>"The majority of partners who've had a game in Game Pass want to bring their future titles to the service," said Charla. "As a result, we've signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalogue. We continue to engage with hundreds of partners each year to review upcoming titles.</p>
<p>"Last year, we worked with over 50 teams to sign their first Game Pass deal. This year marks our largest investment in Game Pass to date, and we remain focused on delivering the most exciting and diverse catalogue in gaming."</p>
<p>Xbox has received criticism for Game Pass in recent months. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-studios-founder-calls-game-pass-unsustainable-model-and-one-which-is-damaging-the-industry">Arkane Studios founder Raphael Colantonio</a> described the service as "an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade".</p>
<p>In a back and forth on social media on the "cannibalisation" of sales, Larian director of publishing Michael Douse added "smaller teams with new or riskier" games can benefit from Game Pass, but he prefers "Sony's 'lifecycle management'" method of adding games following initial sales.</p><p>Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden discussed the perceived profitability of Game Pass in a discussion with <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "There's a lot of debates going on," he said. "Is Game Pass profitable? Is Game Pass not profitable? What does that mean? That's really not the right question to ask anyway.</p>
<p>"You can do all kinds of financial jiggery-pokery for any sort of corporate service to make it look profitable if you wanted to. You take enough costs out and say that's off the balance sheet and, oh look, it's profitable now. The real issue for me on things like Game Pass is, is it healthy for the developer?"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-player-numbers-are-through-the-roof-thanks-to-subscription-platforms-like-game-pass-and-netflix-series-boss-miles-jacobson-explains-how">Football Manager boss Miles Jacobson recently told Eurogamer</a> player numbers for the series have skyrocketed since being added to subscription platforms. </p>
<p>"We built a whole business model around it," he said. "You can't just turn around and do this - this was before we launched on the subscription platforms, we'd been talking about it. And we'd been working out what we were going to do for five years - it was a five-year journey before we went with the first experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we learned from those experiments, and that's when the full strategy was put in place."</p><p>In a broader interview with Eurogamer on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation">state of indie games on Xbox</a>, Charla noted the breadth of games showcased by Xbox at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>. "It is just really a recognition by Xbox of the absolute crucial need for diversity in our portfolio," he said.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/canceled-perfect-dark-reboot-info</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-info-about-canceled-perfect-dark-reboot-surfaces-including-images-and-more.1304223/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New details have emerged regarding The Initiative's canceled&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot, including some of the locales the game would have taken you to and what kind of gameplay systems it would have offered.</p>

<p>Back in July, as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">wider Microsoft layoff wave</a>,&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">was canceled</a>, and developer The Initiative's doors were closed for good (and that game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">wasn't the only casualty</a> of those layoffs either).</p>

<p>Now, a new report from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MP1st</a>&nbsp;details what kind of game The Initiative was working on, and it turns out that the studio was looking to fill a niche left open by the absence of newer&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>007&nbsp;</em>games. As MP1st points out, it's a little ironic that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">both</a> of those franchises are now <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-release-date" rel="nofollow">active</a> and&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>isn't.</p>

Despite containing "fake stuff", the trailer did show a demo that was internally playable.</p>

<p>According to MP1st's report,&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>would have taken place in a variety of locales around the world, including the likes of Cairo. They'd have been depicted in an aesthetic internally referred to as "eco sci-fi", marrying futuristic visuals with green tech.</p>

<p>Additionally, one major gameplay system, the Adrenaline System, is detailed in the report. Apparently, Adrenaline would have been a resource that players built up over time, allowing access to skills like healing, reducing incoming damage, and more.</p>

<p>The report claims that the material featured within was intended to be part of&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark</em>'s "Season 1", which, as MP1st points out, could well lend credence to the idea that the game was intended to be episodic at one point.</p>




<p>Of course, all of this is moot given that&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>was canceled earlier this year, but who knows? Maybe some of the material in this report will make its way into another Xbox project somewhere down the line. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>For the better part of a decade, French gaming developers Laurent Lechat and Boris Marmontel had their game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/planet-centauri/" data-ref-id="5000-453058">Planet Centauri </a>in early access on Steam. However, the game's 1.0 launch arrived last year with a resounding thud, and Valve is accepting the blame for not notifying the 100,000-plus players who had wishlisted it on Steam.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBf5mZFUbpU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hBf5mZFUbpU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a recent post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nfd2ji/this_is_how_steam_can_ruin_more_than_10_years_of/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/valve-steam-alpha-centauri-launch-bug-daily-deal-terraria/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>), Lechat shared excerpts from an email sent out by Valve that explained why Planet Centauri's launch failed to get much traction.</p><p>"We found a bug that impacted a very small number of game releases (less than 100 since 2015) where wishlist email notifications for the launch of a game were not sent," wrote a Valve spokesperson. "Unfortunately, your game Planet Centauri was among those included. We intend for this feature to work for every game and we're inviting you to a Daily Deal as a way to help make up for lost visibility from your launch day."</p><p>Lechat explained at length how the dismal response to Planet Centauri disheartened himself and Marmontel. He also seemed wary about Valve's offer before other users on Reddit urged them to accept the added visibility of a Daily Deal on Steam's homepage.</p><p>Since Planet Centauri's story has been making the rounds, there has been a small uptick of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/385380/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">concurrent players to 105</a>. That's not a huge number, but some players have given the game a shot and shared largely positive reviews. Although some of the other reviews on Steam have noted that <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/twilightdusk/recommended/385380/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planet Centauri has noticeable flaws</a> and still feels like an early-access release.</p><p>Lechat and Marmontel are currently working on a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roguelike-games/2900-6522/" data-ref-id="2900-6522">roguelike game</a> that uses the engine they built for Planet Centauri. The duo said that they have a financial obligation to finish that game before they'll be free to work on future patches for Planet Centauri.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Team Ninja <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nioh-3-revealed-at-state-of-play-free-demo-out-today/1100-6532108/" data-ref-id="1100-6532108">debuted the first look</a> at a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nioh-3/" data-ref-id="5000-680916">Nioh 3</a>, the latest game in the action-RPG series. Players will assume control of a fictionalized version of Japan's first shogun, Tokugawa Takechiyo, as he rises to power by taking on supernatural threats. In a departure for the series, Tokugawa can switch back and forth between samurai and ninja fighting styles. Now, Team Ninja has explained how its Ninja Gaiden games inspired this shift in Nioh 3's gameplay.</p><p>"We wanted to create a new kind of action that would act as a major centerpiece, making players feel that the game has taken a step forward," said Nioh 3 general producer Fumihiko Yasuda during an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nioh-3-is-changing-the-game-with-ninja-style-and-the-distinctive-mist-system-ign-first" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "Team Ninja also has the experience of creating the Ninja Gaiden series. In other words, we have just about as much experience and knowhow when it comes to creating ninja action as we do with Nioh's samurai action. Ninja are very popular overseas, and we thought that this would excite those players as well. Nioh's Japanese world and setting is also something we value, which made ninja seem like the best possible answer."</p><p>Yasuda noted that previous Nioh games have already referenced the Ninja Gaiden games in the DLC, but added that Team Ninja is looking "into creating the sort of action that fans of both series will enjoy."</p><p>Players will can favor one fighting style over another, although there will be key differences between them. Samurai style will allow players to use Ki Pulse after attacking to recover their stamina. However, that ability won't be available to players using ninja style. Instead, ninja style players can use the mist ability to temporarily create a duplicate of themselves to better strike at their enemies. </p><p>Nioh 3 is currently expected to hit PlayStation 5 and PC in early 2026. In the meantime, Team Ninja's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/" data-ref-id="5000-659496">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, is coming on October 21 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. That sequel was also co-developed by Platinum Games.</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza / Mario Odyssey Pauline" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d91b0cb478cbd/donkey-kong-bananza-mario-odyssey-pauline.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>From the second Nintendo revealed Pauline was in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, a timeline theory began to take shape in our heads. But then we wrapped the game up, and our prequel presumptions weren't as nailed on as we'd expected.</p>
<p>We still don't have an official answer for how Bananza Pauline is related to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> Pauline, and according to producer Kenta Motokura, we ain't going to get one any time soon.</p>
<p>This stems from a recent <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/50508">Famitsu</a> interview (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stealth40k.bsky.social/post/3lzbwv3as5c2w">@Stealth40K</a>), in which some of Bananza's key creatives sat down to chat all things DK. The answers cover many of the same topics we saw in the game's Ask the Developer series, but the question of Pauline's timeline is a newbie — albeit one that was somewhat brushed aside.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4hjixsy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>When asked about Bananza Pauline's connection to Odyssey's New Donk City mayor, Motokura deftly dodged the topic, saying (via Google Translate), "That's... Of course, the developers have a plan for it, but I'm sorry, but I'd like you to use your imagination". <em>Gah</em>! And there we were, thinking an answer was on the horizon.</p>
<p>And what about that Grandma that 13-year-old Pauline brings up so often in Bananza's Getaway naps? There must be a connection there, right? "Sorry, this too", said Motokura. <em>Double gah</em>!</p>
<p>Now, that little tease of the developers having "a plan" for Pauline's heritage has us wondering if we're going to return to this timeline topic again in the future — we'd be amazed if we don't get another 3D DK game somewhere down the line. Alternatively, of course, Motokura could just be implying that the dev team has their theories, just like we all do, but we're never going to hear 'em. The latter seems all the more realistic, knowing Nintendo.</p>
<p>Okay, so Nintendo isn't going to spill the beans on this one just yet, but that doesn't mean we can't keep on theorising. Don't worry, we won't spoil the end of Bananza here, but if you want to read all about the game's finale and how we reckon it may/may not tie into Odyssey, you can find a full rundown in the guide below.</p>

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s hitherto <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-second-patch-is-live-in-steam-beta-includes-fix-for-bug-caused-by-dying-to-bosses-while-killing-them">beta-only update 1.0.28650</a> is now a fully public release that any dang fool can download without switching to a Steam playtest branch. I'm still noodling my way through the lower levels of Team Cherry's new metroidvania, blissfully unbothered by any pressure to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review">review it</a> or write <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong walkthroughs</a>. As such, I asked our reviewer James to have a look at the patch notes and pluck out any important changes, based on his many, many hours in Pharloom. 
</p>
<p>
A shadow glided over James's face, then returned and took up residence in one earhole. Wordlessly he outstretched a gnarled finger towards item 3 on the list: "Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava."
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Thus my introduction to the Savage Beastfly, an optional <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-bosses">Silksong boss</a> that has two iterations. I've now done some background reading on Savage Beastfly and - inasmuch as it's safe to extrapolate from all-caps forum posts - it appears to be Silksong's most-hated NPC. Not simply a challenging fight but a crushingly unfair and unpredictable one, in the eyes of many players, with complaints lodged against the inconsistency of the creature's hitbox, its two-mask damage output, its habit of summoning minions, and the whiteknuckle RNG effect of mixing all these things together.</p>
<p>It doesn't even look that good, the detractors howl. It's not like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. It's just a mallet with wings. Nobody wants to Rule 34 that thing. Well, some people probably do, because that's the point of Rule 34, but this particular intersection of masochism and formicophilia seems like a rare gift, indeed.
</p><p>
And all of this merely describes the first iteration of the boss. The second introduces lava and destructible platforms, just for funsies. As such, the now-fixed technical issue above with the Savage Beastfly diving into lava and never returning could be styled a positive. Let the bastard stay in the magma, if it loves magma so much. Let it burn forever in a hell of its own creation.
</p>
<p>
The loathing is so extreme that there is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fucksavagebeastfly/">a whole subreddit dedicated to Savage Beastfly</a> and all its works, with 34,000 weekly visitors. Be warned that the subreddit contains a lot of fake reporting about undiscovered, even tougher Savage Beastfly variants, because if there's one thing Silksong players like doing, it's rustling each other's jimmies.
</p>
<p>
While the Savage Beastfly does appear to savagely beastfly in the face of sporting boss design, I do inevitably wonder whether a piss-boiling abomination like this is a marketing asset for a game such as Silksong. Bosses that are merely 'good' and 'well-designed' don't tend to attract dedicated subreddits. Malenia doesn't have one, as far as I can tell. Nor do Giygas, Psycho Mantis or Sephiroth. I'm surprised I haven't seen Savage Beastfly cited more in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yes-hollow-knight-silksong-has-some-moments-of-steep-difficulty-team-cherry-admit-but-have-you-considered-going-for-a-pre-boss-walk">the on-going discussion</a> of whether Silksong's overall difficulty is key to the mood, or just contrived.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the full patch notes are below. They are essentially unchanged from the beta test last week.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Dithering effect option in Advanced video settings. Reduces colour banding but can slightly soften the appearance of foreground assets. Defaults to 'Off'.</li>
<li>Updated Herald's Wish achievement description to clarify that players must both complete the wish and finish the game.</li>
<li>Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava.</li>
<li>Fixed rare cases of Shrine Guardian Seth getting out of bounds during battle.</li>
<li>Fixed rare case of Second Sentinel knocking the player out of bounds during battle.</li>
<li>Added catch to prevent Lugoli sometimes flying off screen and not returning during battle.</li>
<li>Further reduced chance of Silk Snippers getting stuck out of bounds in Chapel of the Reaper battle.</li>
<li>Fixed various instances of dying to bosses while killing them causing death sequences to play messily or out of sync.</li>
<li>Fixed Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock.</li>
<li>Cocoon positions in some locations updated to prevent it spawning in inaccessible areas.</li>
<li>Fixed Liquid Lacquer courier delivery not being accessible in Steel Soul mode.</li>
<li>Fixed some NPCs not correctly playing cursed hint dialogues in certain instances.</li>
<li>Fixed Pondcatcher Reed not being able to fly away after singing.</li>
<li>Fixed Verdania memory orbs sometimes replaying layered screen-edge burst effects.</li>
<li>Fixed the break counter not working for certain multihitter tools eg Conchcutter.</li>
<li>Fixed Volt Filament damage multiplier not applying for certain Silk Skills.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies and Wisps inappropriately targeting Skullwings.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change.</li>
<li>Fixed Curveclaw always breaking on the first hit after being deflected.</li>
<li>Fixed Plasmium Phial and Flea Brew sometimes not restoring as intended at benches.</li>
<li>Various other smaller tweaks and fixes. </li>
</ul>

            <p>The now-cancelled Perfect Dark reboot had an "eco sci-fi" aesthetic, an Adrenaline System, and may have been released episodically.</p>
<p>That's according to internal documentation from a former developer on the project at The Initiative shared with <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot">mp1st</a>, revealing new artwork and gameplay details.</p>
<p>The document highlighted an opportunity to capitalise on the secret agent genre, due to the absence of Metal Gear Solid and James Bond 007 during development. Ironically enough, both franchises have since returned.</p>

<p>This may somewhat point to why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark was ultimately cancelled</a> - perhaps this reboot of the N64 classic from Rare wasn't able to differentiate itself enough.</p>
<p>Still, this newly unearthed documentation - which dates back to a period close to the game's cancellation this year - hints as to what players could have expected. The creative vision for the reboot aimed to reimagine the franchise while retaining the core DNA of the N64 original, with the HBO series Westworld providing inspiration for giving a classic property fresh themes and concepts.</p><p>While several systems are briefly mentioned, only the Adrenaline System is detailed. This would've been a resource regenerated over time to provide various abilities like healing and increasing damage dealt, as well as slowing time to aim with precision. Killing multiple enemies in quick succession would have extended this effect.</p>
<p>Until April of this year, the studio was working on a vertical slice (a playable proof-of-concept) that belonged to "Season 1", suggesting the game would have been released episodically.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark was properly revealed at last year's Xbox Games Showcase, with in-game footage of protagonist Joanna Dark exploring a futuristic Cairo (above). Later,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lsypye2edk2v"> reports suggested this gameplay was fake</a>, though a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adammcdlt.bsky.social/post/3lt23bz2dwk2z">designer on the game responded</a> it was in-engine despite "some fake stuff in it".</p>
<p>The new documentation includes further artwork for the game, including an alternate design for Joanna, as well as various futuristic environments to show off its "eco sci-fi" aesthetic.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark was cancelled back in July, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">layoffs across Microsoft</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild was also cancelled</a>.</p>

<p>Dropping two days earlier on other platforms</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Windwalk Games and Team17 have announced that the release date for their upcoming co-op roguelike, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sworn">Sworn</a>, has been shifted from 25th September, a.k.a. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a> Day™, to 23rd September on PC and (other) consoles, with a Switch version due to arrive at "a later date."</p>
<p>This colourful roguelike from "a team of veteran developers from Riot Games, Niantic, and Blizzard" takes inspiration from the art of the legendary Mike Mignola, has been available on PC in early access since February, where it's gone down very well, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1763250/SWORN/">sat as it is on a very positive rating</a>.</p>
<p>At first glance, it's a <em>very</em> similar-looking affair to Hades 2 , so we can't really blame Team17 for shifting the launch date to give version 1.0 a little breathing room. But Sworn also offers something of its own, with up to four-player co-op available for you and your pals to dig into while exploring a cursed Camelot.</p>

<p>Here's some official info about the game, and we'll be sure to let you know when the Switch date is set in stone. Like a big sword.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose to play solo or with friends, summoning the blessings of the Fae Lords in this action rogue-like set in a cursed Avalon. Only through your mastery of unique weapons, many ability options and the help of powerful allies such as Merlin can there be hope for realm. Coinigh dó neart leat! Sworn encourages players to be versatile in the ever-changing battlegrounds of Camelot and to do whatever it takes to halt the grim plans of Arthur and his dishonourable Knights. <strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong><strong>Solo and Co-op<br></strong>Play solo or unite with up to 4 friends to stand off against the Knights of the Round Table. Choose from 4 characters: Vigilante, Rook, Spectre, and Monk and combine the strengths of each character in surprising ways and master abilities to become knights worthy of standing off against Arthur himself.</p>
<p><strong>Explore a foredoomed Avalon</strong><br>
Meet familiar friends and foes inspired by myths and Legends, in this beautifully crafted comic world, inspired by the work of American artist Mike Mignola.</p>
<p><strong>Power divine from the Fae</strong><br>
Swear fealty to the Fae Lords and choose from over 200 unique blessings to unleash your full potential. Will you avail of King Oberon you fury bonuses and damaging whirlwinds or perhaps Banshee Cliona’s aid of soul missiles.</p>
<p><strong>Creatively conquer Camelot</strong><br>
Combine your blessings with unique character, weapon, and ability selections. Test thousands of unique builds as you become a seasoned knight.</p>
<p><strong>Become worthy</strong><br>
Upgrades from the Beacon of Avalore will forge your squire into a worthy champion over time. However, if you believe you are already worthy of facing Arthur, get ready for a challenge that will put your skills to the test.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/09/two-games-are-available-early-this-week-with-xbox-game-pass-september-22-23#sworn-series-xs-pc-cloud-september-23">our sister site Pure Xbox</a>, Sworn is dropping on Game Pass Ultimate tomorrow, too — another place to check it out if you can't wait for that 'TBA' Switch date. Team17 is putting the game out physically on Switch, so watch this space.</p>

In the Natural History Museum, no less!</p>
<p>From <strong>26th January to 22nd March 2026</strong>, the museum's Cranbourne Boutique shop will be getting a Pokémon twist, stocking exclusive collaboration products including clothing, plushies, accessories and more. Many of these products have been made specifically for the collaboration, so expect to see more than a little historical flair in their designs.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fozvirw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Of course, this is a Pokémon pop-up that we're talking about here, so the event will be ticketed. You'll be able to pick up a <em>free</em> ticket to the shop from the <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/events/pokemon-pop-up-shop.html?utm_source=pokemon-press-announcement-20250922-hp&amp;utm_medium=nhm-press&amp;utm_campaign=retail">Natural History Museum website</a> from <strong>1st October</strong>, and you can register for the priority list right now.</p>
<p>Products from the Pokémon x NHM collection will also be available via the museum's online store, and a selection will be added to the official Pokémon Center UK website in January.</p>
<p>It may not be a Pokémon <em>Center</em>, as such, but we're always excited to see more Pokémon shopping opportunities come to Europe. Let's just hope that things go a little smoother than they did in the Louvre back in 2023.</p>

            <p>Hello reader who is also a player! Once again I have failed in my fervent efforts to meddle with the Earth's rotation so as to suspend time exactly at 11.30am, Saturday morning. I fear that another week is upon us. Fortunately, it contains some new PC games, spanning full releases and early access launches. Some of those new PC games may even be worth a modest portion of your lifespan and personal capital. Here's a list of the ones I find most appealing or notable.

<p>Aside from the above new PC games, this week will contain a non-zero quantity of games so new they aren't even released yet. We'll hear about a few of them at the latest Tokyo Game Show, which runs 25th-28th September. As I write this I am looking at a spreadsheet of embargoed announcements. The temptation to just paste the whole thing below and take the week off is fierce, but I am absurdly professional and will resist. Pretty sure none of you care about <span tabindex="0">made you look!</span> anyway.</p>
