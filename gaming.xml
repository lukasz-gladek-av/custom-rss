			<p>As promised yesterday, following our Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-exclusive-qa-no-side-quest-exists-without-contributing-to-the-narrative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive Q&amp;A</a>, here's the full transcript of the longer roundtable Q&amp;A that featured BioWare's Game Directors Corinne Busche and John Epler answering all sorts of questions from the assembled press on the highly anticipated single player action RPG.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will continue the story of Inquisition a decade later (albeit with a different protagonist, although the Inquisitor will still be featured in the new game). Dragon Age Inquisition launched on November 20, 2014, whereas Veilguard will be released on October 31 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Fundamentally, it comes down to player agency. We, of course, are a single-player offline RPG. We value your choice and autonomy, and we want to respect that. I have a hell of a great time playing around with the skill trees and trying different builds. We want you to do the same. If you want to respec, more power to you.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>This game allows you to respec on a very organic level. You can do that anytime. That's something, I'd say, new to Dragon Age. How did that come to be that you could respec and not commit to a class?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>Yeah, that's a really lovely question. Thank you. Fundamentally, it comes down to player agency. We, of course, are a single-player offline RPG. We value your choice and autonomy, and we want to respect that. I have a hell of a great time playing around with the skill trees and trying different builds. We want you to do the same. If you want to respec, more power to you.</p>
<p><strong>I'm just curious: when did you guys decide that Rook would be essentially the only playable character and that you should focus more on that instead of what previously was mostly party-based combat?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>I think I can start this one and then maybe John if you want to jump in. Dragon Age has such an amazing, rich lore and history behind it. The worldbuilding, I really think it's what's kept this franchise alive and people discussing it 10 years after Inquisition. So our North Star was that we wanted you to embody Rook, to step into Rook's shoes, to experience this world on the ground as this character. And what that meant is giving you more autonomy, more control of the character, putting you in control of every single swing, and really making it feel like you're a part of this world.</p>
<p>What's more, we've talked a lot about the companions. I know a lot of the questions that came up today about Dragon Age: The Veilguard were about the depth and authenticity of the companions. We really felt like there was a big opportunity here to make the companions feel more realized, more like their characters who fight alongside you and have their own styles, motivations, and interactions if you're not actually embodying them.</p>
<p>But of course, throughout all of that, we do know in the combat system, that sense of teamwork, of pause and play, tactical depth. That has been the throughline through every single edition of Dragon Age. So we wanted to walk the fine line of making that teamwork and that sense of strategy show up but also make you feel like you're in this world.</p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>Yeah, and Corinne touched on autonomy as far as Rook goes, but also part of making the companions feel like their own people, like their own characters, is giving them that autonomy as well on the battlefield. Again, you are the leader of this group, they have their own personalities, their own stories, and we wanted to make sure that you felt that through the gameplay as well.</p>
<p><strong>Most RPGs right now are open world. Dragon Age Inquisition was open world, and I'm glad Dragon Age: The Veilguard is not. Was it hard to adapt, and does it change a lot the way that Rook is going to progress through the story?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>I'll tell you what: it's hard to buck trends sometimes, but we really felt we could tell the best stories and create the most curated moment-to-moment experience by going back to a mission-based structure. But maybe I'll turn it over to Francois, our Mission Director, and John to talk about our philosophy on that.</p>
<p><strong>Francois Chaput:</strong> It's a great question, and thank you for asking. One of the key things for us was understanding the opportunities. They were different opportunities than in the past. What can we do with this new focus that we found? We had to make sure that we stood on some solid pillars.</p>
<p>One of those was, "Alright, we have an opportunity to stay focused and make sure everything's contributing to a greater conflict, a greater narrative, and a greater sense of space." That was the first one. And then, to keep us in check and avoid going totally linear, we wanted to make sure the second pillar supported that in being one of player freedom and agency.</p>
<p>So, understanding how we can focus things and bring things in while allowing players to still have a choice, to still make their impact and still decide where to go, and still have things to uncover and discover. Those were our two key pillars. We had to establish that early on. Once we understood that, this was our new structure for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>I'm just going to add one more thing. One of the things about the spaces in Veilguard that I think is fantastic is that each space has a story of its own. These are not just spaces that exist for their own sake; they tell a story that, in a lot of ways, ties back to the overarching conflict, the overarching story.</p>
<p>Something we heard loud and clear in Inquisition was some of the spaces didn't necessarily feel like they had a purpose. We wanted to make sure every space felt purposeful and meaningful in the experience of Rook and companions against these elven gods, against the end of the world.</p>

<p><strong>I think we all had a bit of an idea that the character customization would be really in-depth when we came into it, but even still coming into it, it was even more detailed to the point where I don't think I've ever seen a cataract slider in a game ever. When you're going that granular with that kind of decision, how do you decide how far to go and where to stop?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, it's a great question. Thank you. We wanted to hit a balance where players could make the characters that they wanted to make but also not be broken. So I think the tactic we took with that was really opening up the possibilities of how far you could take the sliders and the different options that you could take.</p>
<p>And then, through testing, playing, and evaluating it, we figured out how far we could tune it back so that the characters still looked like we wanted them to in the cinematics while still respecting the choices the player wants to make.</p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>Also, the character creator is an amazing player-facing thing, and it's so much fun. My kids, to them, that's what the game is. It's the character creator. At the same time, it's also what we use to build most of the NPCs that you interact with in the world. It is super cool to offer this much variety, but it's also from us where we just want to be able to tell the stories we want to tell. We needed to be able to push it that much further.</p>
<p>We were talking to somebody before about EA and how it's been really handy, actually, for hair in particular. I noticed some people really pushing the hair, which is great. But it's been cool with EA because we're sharing the engine with a number of other different groups that are pushing here. We've been able to borrow from them and learn and get amazing stuff and then share back in return. So it's been really beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>One of the things I might also add is of our three core design pillars, be who you want to be was the first, that was the starting point. We wanted everyone to feel like they belonged in this game to the best of our ability, we wanted that you could relate to the characters, so that meant sclera color. It meant cataracts. It meant vitiligo. Freckles. Respectful skin tones that react to light properly. I'm tremendously proud of the team and everything they put together to make sure that all of the players can feel seen, too.</p>
<p><strong>Was there ever any hesitation when it came to character creation? I read the news from Larian talking about how 80 percent of Baldur's Gate 3 players are selecting the half-elf, and only a tiny minuscule amount are picking whatever. Is there any sort of talk about that in the development studio, like, 'Do we really need to make this race of character playable when only a certain amount is going to be playing it?'</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>Challenge accepted is what we say. Here's a little fun fact for you. In Dragon Age Inquisition, only 5 percent of players ever played a dwarf. What we see in our player testing these days, we're up to 12 percent, so we'll take it. What that tells me is the more options you give players to embody the character they want to be, the more engaged they will be. We know our players love that. They're hungry for it.</p>
<p><strong>This is actually a question for Matt (<em>Rhodes, Art Director</em>). I loved the tarot card art in Dragon Age Inquisition and wondered why you decided against using it for this game.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt Rhodes:</strong> It was such a core piece of of Inquisition. It was something that was actually born out of a Dragon Age week, where we give people a chance to work on something cool that they want for a week. And two artists just went absolutely nuts. I think they maybe only made three images each, but the art director at the time loved them and was just like, that's what we're doing now; let's do more of that.</p>
<p>One of the best jobs as a concept artist that I did on Inquisition was taking on their tasks so that they could work on those because, yeah, it became a thing. One of the things we've tried to do is keep the visual language of these cards and expand on it, so what was once the 2D frescoes from Origins and 2 has always been there, but like inject that style into the 2D cinematics. Even going so far as our UI artists, who extrapolated and took those shapes and started feeding them through the UI, so you'll see it all across the UI, the exploration icons and in-world diegetic things of the patterns and motifs that you notice on the glint system if you have that activated. We literally tried to take that and basically just blast it everywhere we possibly could get away with it.</p>
<p>This is part of Dragon Age now, and it's never not going to be part of Dragon Age. There's no way we could just stop doing this. One of the things that characterizes is that it was a cool passion project at one point, and then it expanded and we just went bonkers with it. But as with every game, people also want to try new stuff. These were actually all done by the same artist who was one of the original card creators. These were some of the beautiful last things he did for our project and they're gorgeous.</p>
<p>But it's cool because it's also this natural growth where, as an illustrator and a painter, you want to push it into new territory and continue that process. If you notice in the skill tree, there's just little illustrations that were also painted by the same artist (Ramil Sanga). Probably in the next game it's going to be in even more places.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Under the UI customization menus, you can disable damage floaties, whether you show incoming attack indicators or health bars. Hell, if you want to do a UI-less run, more power to you, but you can do that too. Customizing this experience for what suits you, whether we're talking about difficulty, builds, pause and play versus staying in the moment, and UI, it's been a central premise to us.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>One of the things I've noticed playing through Dragon Age: The Veilguard generally, but especially as you gain more skills, is there's a lot on screen. There's a lot of flashy things, and I was wondering, I know Final Fantasy XIV has the idea that you can have many crazy things on screen or just remove them entirely. Is that something you would consider just because there is so much happening on screen all at once, or is that the whole point?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>Absolutely. Great question. You can. Under the UI customization menus, you can disable damage floaties, whether you show incoming attack indicators or health bars. Hell, if you want to do a UI-less run, more power to you, but you can do that too. Customizing this experience for what suits you, whether we're talking about difficulty, builds, pause and play versus staying in the moment, and UI, it's been a central premise to us.</p>
<p><strong>In Dragon Age Origins, I was an elf and couldn't marry Alistair, so I had to start over as a human. I know part of the story is to try to get all these challenges to the players, to develop more of the story and to get this final controversy and all these things. What are we gonna get through all these storylines in Dragon Age: The Veilguard?</strong></p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>So, there are kind of two parts to answering this question. One of which is, again, we've spoken before about reactivity, how who your character is, what your lineage is, what your faction is, and even what your class is impacts the world.</p>
<p>Again, using class as an example, mages obviously have a different understanding of the world than a rogue or a warrior. But we wanted to make sure that, again, the world reacts to you, and this cast of characters particularly—they're all people who have chosen to join your cause, join your party.</p>
<p>Talking specifically about romance, one of the things we wanted to allow is player choice as much as possible, so being able to develop a romance with any character no matter who your Rook is, but those romances may play out a little bit differently based on every activity, based on how you've built your Rook, how you've customized them.</p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>Handling romances and romantic options is quite the challenge, and to be honest with y'all, I'm not sure there's a right answer on how to approach it. What we felt was best for this game was to make sure you could romance the companions, but I want to be clear that it's not player sexual. These are fully fleshed-out characters that have their own romantic histories, preferences, and backgrounds.</p>
<p>That doesn't change based on who you, the player character, are. They don't adapt their personalities to conform to the player. That's fundamentally the difference. There's merits to it and challenges. We're also mindful of having characters in the world of all orientations so we get that thoughtful representation again where people can see themselves.</p>
<p><strong>We talked about how deep and time-consuming the character creator is. Have you considered putting that up pre launch as a standalone, just so people can really hone their Rook in the time before the game releases?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>It's a much-requested feature. We're TBD on that, but it would be pretty cool.</p>
<p><strong>WCCFTECH: I had a two-part question about leveling. Dragon Age has traditionally had a level cap somewhere around 27 to 35. With the level cap being 50 in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, what kind of challenges did you have with balancing so many more skills under the player's belt?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>Oh my goodness, our poor systems design director, Luke Barrett. My goodness, send him all your love because it was quite the tuning and balancing challenge. Coming up as a systems designer myself, the sophistication in the model, the challenge around game balance... I'm in awe. It took a concerted effort and some really insightful forethought in how we were going to handle the underlying damage calculations and contributions from gear versus skill trees.</p>
<p>And also, those tuning plateaus of how enemies scale alongside you. Those moments where you feel like you're you're maybe overpowering them, and then they leap ahead of you to keep you constantly engaged and pushing forward. It was hard.</p>
<p>Especially with all the combinatorial effects, I would say one of the biggest challenges we have is we want players to find emergent builds. We want them to feel like they can outsmart us. Maybe not obliterate the game. So when we find those, we try and reign them in. But my goodness, nothing would make me happier than somebody outsmarting our best tuners.</p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>There's a phrase we like to use called error in the player's favor, which is again, as Corinne said, people finding these opportunities for gear and skills to synergize in ways that we didn't expect but are always awesome as players to find.</p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>I'll tell you, one of the builds we found early on, did anybody play with the warrior shield toss builds or anything adjacent to that? We had a build that was probably the most broken thing I've seen. It would just obliterate entire boss encounters with a single throw and we had to tune that one down.</p>
<p><strong>WCCFTECH: As my quick follow-up, do you have any gear that scales up with your level in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, like the Fadeshear in prior games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>We have something adjacent to that. You may or may not have come across gear in your time today that will scale properties based on the strength of the respective faction that the gear comes from. Also, I'm sure some of you experienced upgrading the rarity of your items. That's the primary method by which we scale the gear.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the forecasting of the abilities. It really gets you curious about how the gear might synergize with your build later on. But that is the primary scaling mechanism. Faction strength, when you come across it, can be quite potent.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'In Dragon Age Inquisition, Corypheus was somebody who wanted to become a god. Now, for the first time, you're facing actual gods. As Corinne said, that raises the stakes tremendously. And we also want to make sure you're aware of what those stakes are.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>When I reached the final portion that we could play today, I was told it was like the finale of the first act of the game. It was already a pretty great scale. It felt like the complete finale of some other games. How many more acts are there in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and were there ever talks about maybe going too big?</strong></p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>One of the fun things about working on Dragon Age is that the stakes continue to escalate from game to game. We wanted to make sure that each act felt like it had its own arc that fed into the larger arc of the critical path of the game. For me, every mission should feel meaningful and important in the story's context, no matter where it takes place.</p>
<p>And then, as you finish the arc, as you finish the act, that's obviously the thing that drives you to the next one. It's what we describe as context shifts. With the end of each act, the context shifts, the world changes, and things, how you approach it, but also how Rook approaches their fight against the gods, is going to change accordingly.</p>
<p>We've broken it down into essentially a three-act structure. Each act is different, though; not every act is the exact same as the other one, and a lot of the content that's not on the critical path you can do at any time. Even with the companion quests and arcs, we wanted to make sure that they felt meaningful. You are standing against the end of the world. Everything you do should feel meaningful in that context.</p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>One of the things I'd add is that the conclusion of this game needs to matter. It needs to be the natural conclusion of your efforts in building up the Veilguard and taking on these gods. Weisshaupt really serves as your first true demonstration of what you're up against. While it is a large first act, and it is a very climactic mission to cap it off, from my perspective, that is where you get that sense of the overwhelming power, the stakes of what's at play here.</p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>In Dragon Age Inquisition, Corypheus was somebody who wanted to become a god. Now, for the first time, you're facing actual gods. As Corinne said, that raises the stakes tremendously. And we also want to make sure you're aware of what those stakes are.</p>
<p><strong>I was wondering if, given its appearance in Origin and Dragon Age 2, the Blood Mage (<em><a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-lead-writer-explains-why-blood-magic-isnt-available-to-players-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which is not in Veilguard</a></em>) as a specialization ever has a chance of coming back, despite its lore implications?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>To be honest, we looked long and hard at that. Origins versus Dragon Age 2 and the representation of Blood Mage were very different takes. What I hope you've taken away from playing today is that we want everything, including your classes, how you show up in the world, to feel narratively salient to this adventure. Blood Magic is a difficult one in the world of Dragon Age. It comes at a tremendous cost to how you're regarded. To be honest, when we were having our truest conversations about Blood Magic, to do it proper justice, I almost feel as though it would have to be a class unto itself to fit within the scope and direction of this game. It didn't feel like the right time, especially given some of the other Blood Magic threats you're going to come across.</p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>Building off what Corinne said, Blood Magic is a weighty thing to decide to do, and if we do it, we want to make sure we do it with the narrative weight and also the respect that it deserves. Because, again, Blood Magic is something that even some of the villainous characters in the games have balked at. We want to make sure that if you go down that path, it feels meaningful. It doesn't just feel like a reskin of other mage abilities. It needs to feel like an actual massive character choice you are making.</p>
<p><strong>One of the things that I noticed is that when you do the character creation, you choose the history of the Inquisitor. One of the things that I loved about Dragon Age Inquisition was Dragon Age Keep, which was a huge tool. Was there ever a possibility that we could customize the history of what happened for us for more than just the Inquisitor?</strong></p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>This project has been in development for a while, so one of the things we did investigate is how deep we wanted that to go. For us, though, the core philosophy was that we want you to make choices that matter, choices that we can actually reflect. Part of going to Northern Thedas is a lot of stuff that matters tremendously if you're in Ferelden or Orlais doesn't matter as much in Tevinter.</p>
<p>A great example is the Divine, who is hugely important if you're Andrastian in the South of Thedas, but they have their own Divine up in Minrathous. We really wanted to focus again on those decisions that we knew would matter and that we knew we could do something interesting with.</p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>It's been a long time since Inquisition. Even if you're a diehard fan, unless you're gonna watch a YouTube replay of the whole game, you might have a little cobwebs on the choices you made or their implications. Not only did we want this to be an in-game feature that would allow you to replicate those choices that John mentioned are contextually appropriate to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but we also view it as a dual-purpose onboarding tool.</p>
<p>If you are a player that just doesn't remember or hasn't played the past games, you're gonna go in and see those choices, those beautiful tarot cards that Matt and his team put together, with all the context around what these choices meant and why they mattered. I view it as a beautiful onboarding tool as well.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>On the OculusQuest subreddit, a clip was uploaded <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1fl01lp/299_quest_3s_128gb_confirmed_by_amazon_ad_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">showcasing an ad</a> that many users believe was posted ‘early’ by Peacock.</p>



<p>In the ad, we see both the Quest 3 and the Quest 3S side-by-side, along with a caption stating that the Meta Quest range ‘starts at $299.99’. There’s a snippet of text at the bottom that clarifies the Meta Quest 3S 128GB headset will retail for $299.99.</p>



<p>This leaked ad also corroborates recent images that surfaced online, giving users their first 360-degree look at the Quest 3S, which features full-colour passthrough technology at a lower resolution than the Quest 3. It also features older lenses, but it makes use of the same controllers that come with the Quest 3, which was released just late last year.</p>



<p>The Quest 3S <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meta-quest-3s-leak-battery-missing-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will have a slightly lower battery capacity</a> than the Quest 3, and it’s also missing a headset jack, much to the chagrin of VR users worldwide. It’s not designed as an upgrade from the Quest 3, though – it’s an accessible and admittedly very competitive device designed by Meta for users just getting into VR gaming.</p>



<p>This price leak, if accurate, makes the Quest 3S one of the cheapest VR headsets on the market, and given that it will be able to access the full library available to Quest 3 users, that makes it an absolute bargain.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlestate-tarkov-plans-for-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has unveiled a ‘preliminary update plan’ for the remainder of 2024 involving Escape from Tarkov and EFT: Arena. It covers everything up to 0.16.0.0, which will welcome in the winter season – and that probably means <strong>crunchy snow</strong> is coming back.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the next few minor and major patches for both the traditional extraction shooter and more recent multiplayer arena shooter are detailed, even if no dates are mentioned.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-patches-everywhere">Patches Everywhere</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1837122066606067934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the graphic published</a> on social media by Battlestate Games, we see the next few months of updates for Escape from Tarkov and EFT Arena.</p>



<p>It starts with 0.2.2.0 for Tarkov Arena, which will bring about a new mode, location, and various technical adjustments. Shortly after, the synchronisation of EFT’s 0.15 patch and EFT: Arena will be deployed. That patch will roll out hand-in-hand with the Unity 2022 update for Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>In 0.15.5.0, Escape From Tarkov will get a stack of changes and upgrades:</p>



<ul>
<li>Stash and Hideout ‘interaction’ while matching</li>



<li>Lock items in stash</li>



<li>Expansions to ‘new mechanics’</li>



<li>Fall weather</li>



<li>New weapons</li>



<li>In-game events</li>
</ul>



<p>EFT: Arena will then get Molotov Cocktail throwables, a battle pass system, a ranked season system, and a new location between 0.2.4.0 and 0.2.5.0.</p>



<p>Finally, at the end of the year, Escape from Tarkov’s 0.16.0.0 patch will be deployed, bringing about ‘new high-end content’, fresh weapons, and winter weather.</p>



<p>It’s expected that the next Tarkov wipe will be released with 0.16.0.0 in December 2024. It has been a rough few months for the team at Battlestate Games thanks to a few controversial changes and massive issues with cheaters – something has to give soon, so perhaps these major updates will change the game for the better.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Titans in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> will soon see a bunch of buffs to their abilities, bringing the experience of playing the beefy subclass a little more in line with the fantasy and making it more viable in endgame activities.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie announced the balancing changes it's making to Titans in its weekly <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid_09_19_2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Week in Destiny blog</a>, outlining a series of tweaks coming in October with the release of the game's next content episode, Revenant. The big takeaway is that Bungie is hoping to make playing as a Titan--the tank-ish, slightly meatheaded of Destiny 2's three character subclasses--feel a little more like the fantasy of playing a frontline fighter that tends to punch their way through the opposition.</p><p dir="ltr">That doesn't necessarily mean making Titans stronger in a martial sense, however; instead, Bungie is making tweaks to different elements of the Titan build in other ways. The one that'll affect players more clearly is making the Titan barricade ability now taunt enemies, drawing their fire away from teammates and toward the barrier itself.</p><p dir="ltr">The Titan barricade is an energy wall that Titans can lay down on the battlefield, either in full-sized versions that function as a big shield or as a smaller piece of cover players can shoot over. Right now, it basically just functions as a wall you can hide behind for a few seconds before getting back to the fight, but enemies still target players behind the wall or when they're away from it. The idea here is that, in most cases, enemies will prioritize shooting at the barricade until it's destroyed, increasing its defensive functionality by allowing Titans to use it to take some of the heat off teammates, even if those teammates aren't actually standing behind it.</p><p dir="ltr">Barricades will also be stronger going forward, taking 50% less damage from rank-and-file enemies, so they'll last longer generally in PvE activities. They'll also provide better protection from explosive splash damage: Bungie is increasing that protection from 20% to 60% for anyone standing behind a barricade. The buffs are also being applied to the Sentinel Shield Super ability in which players generate a shield in front of themselves that they wield while walking around, and when using the Unbreakable aspect, in which players generate a personal shield that absorbs damage--both will now have additional defensive uses than just making yourself harder to kill.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie is running out a few other tweaks as well, making it easier for different Titan abilities to destroy Stasis crystals they create to deal freezing damage to nearby enemies--another means by which Titans should get a boost to their viability without Bungie specifically amping up their damage output. One place Titans are getting a boost in damage, though, is in their punches. Titans are supposed to be the class that opt for brawn more often than other characters, so their unpowered melees are getting boosted 5% against players and 20% against PvE enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">The blog also detailed a number of other tweaks Bungie is rolling out with the Revenant update, including adjustments to various "roaming" Super abilities--the ones players use that allow them to move around, like the Hunter's Golden Gun and Spectral Blades, or the Warlock's Chaos Reach and Stormtrance. Those Supers are getting increases to damage reduction when they're used in PvE, and several are also getting slight buffs to make them a little more useful against enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid_09_19_2024">Bungie's This Week in Destiny post</a> for a full rundown of the changes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-the-%E2%80%98i-will-never-take-nintendo%E2%80%99s-side%E2%80%99-vow.987336/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nintendo-palworld-lawsuit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is a company that’s usually pretty easy to root for. It takes its time to make great games. It <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-direct-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-metroid-prime-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continues supporting a beloved console</a> even with a shiny new one waiting in the wings. It’s synonymous with the likes of Mario, Link, Samus, and Kirby. Unfortunately, at least from a legal standpoint, Nintendo is also evil. This week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/palworld-nintendo-lawyer-sue-pocketpair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Palworld </em>lawsuit</a> has been <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-citra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet another</a> rude wake-up call in that regard. On the latest episode of Aftermath Hours, we discuss the wolf in Pikachu’s clothing.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by comedian and streamer Tom Walker to discuss the latter’s self-made nightmare: an ongoing<em> </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-iv-fast-traffic-stream-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Grand Theft Auto IV </em>playthrough in which traffic speed is cranked up to max</a>. We talk about how livestreaming comedy differs from traditional forms of comedy like standup and how Twitch chat facilitates a unique sort of chaos that might involve, among other things, a naked person announcing that they’ve spilled wedding cake on their dick. Also, we get two separate Peter Griffin impressions, so you know this is a good one.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to the big news story of the week: Nintendo suing <a href="https://aftermath.site/four-hours-in-pokemon-with-guns-hasnt-given-me-any-guns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Palworld</em></a>, the <em>Pokemon</em>-alike with guns that <a href="https://aftermath.site/palworld-release-record-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got big earlier this year</a>. Nintendo might be the purveyor of more beloved family-friendly faces than any other video game company, but its legal team is about as black-hearted as they come. Why, then, do people give Nintendo more grace in these sorts of situations than they do other companies? Finally, we talk about an obscure Australian holiday that has resulted in, as one chatter put it, “mass horse death.”</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can patent troll Nintendo, to see how they like it.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I have taken the “I will never take Nintendo’s side” vow. It’s a very, very simple vow: You will never take Nintendo’s side in any legal argument. And they make it pretty easy. Because if they had mined the game and were like “You put a Pikachu in here. There is a Pikachu in the game file. Fuck you. You hid it well and creatively,” that would have been more actionable than “We own the concept of dog fights for little monsters.”&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the thing that gets me: They found the evilest angle for this. They found the thing that makes me side with <em>Palworld</em>, which I don’t want to do. And again, we don’t know how this is gonna play out. But just based on the fact that they’re going after patent shit, it doesn’t seem fun. It doesn’t seem like that TikTok sketch where two guys are like “That’s a different monster.” Maybe they think they can win this. I don’t know. This is not legal analysis. This is just me being like “Man, Nintendo’s an evil fucking company a lot of the time.”</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> It makes you wonder where the line is with this game as well. There were a lot of Japanese Twitter users and social media users reposting <em>Sujimon</em>, which is the <em>Pokemon</em>-type game that was in the latest <em>Yakuza</em>/<em>Like A Dragon</em> game. You basically had a quite extensive minigame where the guys you fight in the street as you progress through the game, you could unlock them and collect them and basically play <em>Pokemon </em>with them. Systems-wise, it was almost identical to <em>Pokemon</em>. That’s a recent prominent example, but how many other games have done this over the last 30 years? Why is Nintendo going so hard over these guys? It’s because they gave Pokemon guns, and they made tens of millions of dollars.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, I think that’s the big one. This is the first <em>Pokemon </em>clone that has had bordering on mainstream success – at least initially. I think it cooled off after that initial surge of sales. But it made headlines. It was the first big game of this year. It’s super visible. And any time that a company does this, of course, what they’re hoping is that it will have a chilling effect on other companies that might want to do something similar in the future.</p><p>Which is also terrible, because one of the big problems we’ve seen with <em>Pokemon </em>in general is that it has stagnated a lot over the years. People liked <em>Palworld </em>so much because it felt like something a little bit different within the bounds of that formula. It took it and put it in a big 3D open world. It added crafting and farming and all these other elements and systems. It didn’t do those things perfectly, but at least it was kind of interesting compared to where <em>Pokemon </em>has been going for the past decade or more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think [Nintendo] is just mad they got one over on them, and they were looking for a way to sue them, and they’re going with patent. And yeah, sure, I stand with <em>Palworld </em>until we find out there’s something evil going on there.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> #IStandWithPalworld&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Well, it’s annoying to have to take that position where it’s like “Yeah, I think I like those guys who are clearly doing something like ‘I’m not touching you, I’m not touching you’ more on principle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Tom, as the outsider here – at least insofar as you don’t cover video game news for a living – have you kept up with <em>Pokemon </em>games over the years, or is this just a thing to you of, as you said earlier, it’s funny that they gave the kid a gun?</p><p><strong>Tom: </strong>I think “adult Pokemon fan” is definitely a bullet I dodged. No disrespect to adult <em>Pokemon </em>fans. I have been riddled with many other bullets. That’s something I got close to but have thankfully fallen off the wagon of, because boy oh boy, that seems to be a thankless life. <em>Pokemon </em>fans have got it rough enough that they were excited when they released a <em>Pokemon </em>MOBA. That is not a fate I wish for anybody in this world, to be excited for a MOBA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To me, an outsider – tell me if this is right – it seems like their ambition is to cut off the impetus for a big company to be able to do a <em>Pokemon</em>-like. Even if you are doing a thing where you’re collecting little guys and having them fight each other, they want it to clearly be a substandard version of it rather than something approaching more of a 1:1.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> Nintendo’s legal stuff is always performative. There isn’t a commercial justification for 99 percent of the prominent things they pursue, because a lot of those are fan projects or tiny little projects scrounging together a few bucks on Kickstarter or Patreon. This is a rare sort of exception where there’s genuinely money involved. Normally it’s supposed to have a chilling effect. It’s supposed to make other people not want to touch Nintendo’s shit. </p><p>That’s the point of them being so militant about protecting their copyrights and their imagery and that stuff: If they’ve got a reputation as being the company that goes hard and fast on everybody who tries to replicate or even pay homage to anything they make, then it scares a lot of companies off from doing that stuff. Because they know Nintendo’s gonna come after them, whether it’s when they announce it or release it, or nine months later in <em>Palworld</em>’s case. Nintendo could come for you at any moment and come super hard.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unity-showcases-the-unity-6-engine-in-time-ghost-demo/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Unity has shared a new tech demo called Time Ghost that showcases the Unity 6 Engine. It features some stunning visuals and graphics. The demo is just over four minutes long and was championed by the developer team that created their previous tech demos, such as The Blacksmith, Book of the Dead, and The Heretic. This demo highlights their advancements in visual quality and project complexity while utilizing machine learning.</p>
<p><iframe title="Time Ghost" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o1JIK5W3DRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The visual advancements made have allowed for the graphics in Time Ghost to look phenomenal, with the demo leveraging improvements that were made in HDRP (High Definition Render Pipeline), a variety of new lighting options with APVs, Scenario Blending, Smoke Lighting and a strong focus on performance with their GPU Resident Drawer. Those who utilize the engine will use tools like the VFX Graph and Shader Graph, to tailor their graphics to how they want them to look.</p>
<p>Even when there are close-up shots of the clothing, you can see the individual fibers of the cloth, allowing you to tell what kind of fabric it is made out of. The clothing deforms realistically, even in high-motion scenes, such as when the characters are sprinting.</p>
<p>Although the graphics are significantly more realistic, the characters look slightly robotic when running, which could be due to limb placement. While it looked like they were running with their arms out to maintain balance, it just made them look a little bit wonkier instead.</p>
<p>One of the things they focused on with Unity 6 was using Machine Learning to be able to create accurate and realistic cloth deformation. To be able to do that, they used Unity Sentis, where they trained the ML model with 2,000 frames of vertex animation. The accurate deformations happen in 0.8 ms per frame, allowing for the project to maintain that high visual fidelity.</p>
<p>Unity 6 has a lot of new features that are showcased in the Time Ghost tech demo, including the improved hair system. With close-ups on the character, you can see the high-density, real-time simulated hair. This feature was originally used in <a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-engine-stunning-enemies-tech-demo-download/">Enemies</a>, and the system used to create hair has been upgraded significantly, allowing for seamless rendering LOD, automatic LOD generation and volumetric wind to create a realistic and functioning hair system that has the correct physics depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Unity has<a href="https://unity.com/demos/time-ghost" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted a blog post</a> that details the new engine and what people can expect when using it. There are a ton of new features, including a new and improved VFX collision system that allows for more stable and robust enhanced collisions.</p>
<p>The Unity 6 Engine will be released on October 17.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pc-players-psn-ragnarok-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pc-players-are-complaining-again-about-ragnarok%E2%80%99s-psn-requirement.987294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pc-players-psn-ragnarok-steam/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>God of War Ragnarok was released on Steam just yesterday, and it has already pulled in more than 2,000 reviews on the platform, 45% of which are <strong>negative</strong>. Most of the complaints stem from the requirement for users to connect a PlayStation Network account to their profile to play the game, which isn’t a new concept for PS games making it over to PC.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Helldivers 2 became the target of a monumental hate campaign after it was revealed that users would need a PSN account to play it on PC — that was one of the most severe examples of this newfound concept.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-complaining-just-to-complain">Complaining Just To Complain</h2>



<p>It had been made clear that PC gamers would need to link a PSN account to play the single-player Santa Monica game for a while, but that hasn’t stopped players from complaining about it. It’s one of a few games to be released on PC with the requirement of late, but hundreds of people are still taking to Steam to throw out a negative review with that as the basis.</p>



<p>People have referenced Sony’s past data breaches, stressing that they don’t want to hand over their personal information to the company just to play God of War Ragnarok – but in most cases, they’re <strong>doing it anyway</strong>.</p>



<p>The main drawback is that PSN isn’t available in many countries worldwide. That means that these countries are also locked out of playing God of War Ragnarok on PC. </p>



<p>Even amid hundreds of thousands of negative reviews on games, Sony won’t relent on this requirement, which means PC gamers are going to have to just like it or lump it.</p>



<p>Is the PSN requirement blocking you from playing God of War Ragnarok on PC? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnark-launches-to-mixed-steam-user-reviews-with-most-complaining-about-the-playstation-network-account-requirement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> has a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam following its PC launch, with most of the complaints revolving around Sony’s controversial PlayStation Network Account requirement.</p><p>Sony had made it clear on the God of War Ragnarök Steam page that a PlayStation Network account would be required to play Sony Santa Monica’s purely single-player adventure, but that doesn’t seem to have prevented a number of negative reviews singling out the policy.</p><p>One negative Steam review, from a user who refunded the game after just 20 minutes of play, called out the PSN requirement. “Creating a PSN account was something I knew was necessary in advance and I was prepared to do so, until I was met with the reality of it,” they said. “For UK residents at least, it requires submitting a mobile phone number to verify your age just to start with, and if that fails (which it did, no texts were ever received) your only recourse is to submit a photograph of your face or a government-issued ID to a third party website. If you're happy with that, go right ahead.”</p><p>“Yeah I'm not linking my account to PSN especially for a single-player game,” reads another negative Steam user review, which also includes a list of Sony data breaches.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Sony’s PSN account requirement for its PC games was thrust into the limelight with the release of Arrowhead’s explosive PC and PS5 co-op shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> earlier this year. Helldivers 2 suffered a review bomb campaign on Steam after Sony made PSN accounts mandatory for PC gamers on Valve’s platform (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-psn-review-bomb-cape-mia-as-arrowhead-awaits-clarity-on-game-being-sold-in-more-countries">Arrowhead subsequently decided to turn the user review history graph into a cape, which is ready for launch but has yet to release</a>).</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reverses-course-on-helldivers-2-psn-account-requirement"><u>Sony eventually backed down and reversed Helldivers 2’s PSN account requirement</u></a>, but the game remains unavailable in the many countries that lack PSN. And indeed all Sony’s games on PC now suffer from this problem, which means God of War Ragnarök is unavailable on PC in over 100 countries.</p><p>It seems unlikely that Sony will change its mind again for God of War Ragnarök, which means the game may have to live with its ‘mixed’ Steam user review rating for some time. As for how popular God of War Ragnarök is on PC, Steam's official concurrent figures show 25,471 playing at the time of this article's publication. That's down significantly on the PC launch of God of War, which saw a peak of 73,529 players on Valve's platform.</p><p>God of War Ragnarök continues the stories of Kratos and his now teenage soon, Atreus. The sequel was praised as an enthralling spectacle on its release, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">earning a 10 in IGN's review</a>.</p><p>"Impeccable writing, pitch-perfect performances, knockout action – it’s a complete work of art from top to bottom. Reflecting its core themes, it's everything a sequel should be: respectful of its legendary lineage, but not afraid to take it to exciting new places," we wrote at the time. "God of War Ragnarok is an almighty achievement and creates a new high that makes many of its peers look positively mortal by comparison."</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Ellis said that "while many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended."</p><p>Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history. After years of costly development, the PvP first-person shooter launched August 23 priced $40 on PC and PlayStation 5, but its sales were estimated to be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">around only 25,000</a> and its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-shooter-concord-debuts-to-a-tragic-697-concurrent-players-on-steam">peak Steam concurrent player count was shockingly low</a> (Sony does not make PlayStation player numbers public). <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">Sony then removed Concord from sale</a> just 11 days after launch, issuing refunds in the process.</p><p>According to Kotaku, staff at the 150-person Firewalk, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-aaa-multiplayer-developer-firewalk-studios">Sony acquired in 2023</a> for an undisclosed fee, are anxiously awaiting their fate. While Ellis has indicated that Firewalk would “explore options” that suggest Concord may return in some form, some staff are said to be skeptical. Kotaku reports that some  have been asked to pitch ideas for new games, some are speculating they may be drafted in to help develop another Sony game, while others fear mass layoffs or even a studio shutdown.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Sony’s gaming business has already suffered significant cuts in 2024. In February, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close"><u>it announced a</u> <u>round of layoffs</u></a> affecting 900 staff, or about 8% of its global PlayStation workforce.

<p>Besides showing more of the Rarities and skills, Bokeh Game Studio also shared a new look at one of the Slitterhead's stages, the Kowlong Slums. This gigantic slum is slated for demolition, and its residents are forced to leave. Many, however, refuse to do so, making it the perfect location for the horrors upon which the experience is focused.</p>

The score, composed by Wilbert Roget, II, is absolutely filled with pomp. Everything is here, from the main theme that I’ve grown used to hearing while my screen idles to tracks that play while you’re fighting against either the Terminids or Automatons, <em>Helldivers</em>’ enemy forces.<br></p><p>Listening through the soundtrack has been a great reminder of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-community-humor-1851282592&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-community-humor-1851282592">how essential <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s score is to the fantasy it’s successfully portrayed</a></span> since it was released this February. For example, I’ve always taken for granted how lowkey and tech-y the music in your starship is, which feels like the right call for an area that gradually gets upgraded and fleshed out as you advance through the ranks and unlock new stratagems, buffs, and weapons. It stands in stark contrast to the triumphant music that plays as you jump into a pod and are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-malevelon-creek-liberated-1851379768&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-malevelon-creek-liberated-1851379768">dropped onto the surface of a planet as part of a “liberation” effort</a></span>. The score is great at instilling a false sense of pride—which is perfectly in-line with the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272"><em>Starship Troopers </em>influence</a></span>—as you take on hellish missions in the name of a clearly fascist regime and get ragdolled and eviscerated over and over again by enemies.</p><p>Though, I’d like to bring particular attention to the track titled “Super-Earth National Anthem” because why the hell is it so good? I’ve played <em>Helldivers 2 </em>quite a bit, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332">covered it even more than that</a></span>, but I had never heard this thing until today, despite evidence suggesting players found it in-game a long time ago. Here’s just a sample of the batshit propaganda Super-Earth passes for an anthem:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Freedom must reign over every last star, through citizen’s blood spilled in our righteous wars / Honor their deaths, do your part for the cause</p><p>Steadfast support of our regime is how humankind will reign supreme / No questions or doubts shall be allowed, tractors will all be disavowed”</p></blockquote><p>Now imagine that being sung by a beaming choir. Or worse, picture kids singing that every morning before class, or at their graduation ceremonies. I’m no fan of the American national anthem, but at least we aren’t made to explicitly sing about “citizen’s blood spilled in our righteous wars.” I need a documentary about life in the Super-Earth colonies immediately, this is truly horrifying stuff. On the bright side, you can now air music like this from your car every Fourth of July if you so choose. Ain’t democracy grand?<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
